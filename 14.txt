Informed consent in international health research	JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS			English	Review						informed consent; international research ethics	CLINICAL-RESEARCH; ETHICAL DILEMMAS; COMMUNITY; TRIAL; EXPERIENCES; COMMUNICATION; COMPREHENSION; PERSPECTIVES; POPULATION; BIOETHICS	INFORMED CONSENT IS UNIVERSALLY recognized as a central component of ethical conduct in scientific research. Investigators working with diverse populations throughout the world face myriad challenges. The application of standards for informed consent can be daunting for researchers when they face the pragmatic constraints of the field and the reality of cultural beliefs about consent that may be in direct conflict with regulatory requirements. This paper explores cultural and social factors underlying informed consent for health research with diverse populations in international settings. Sociocultural influences on comprehension of information, perceptions of risk, and beliefs regarding decisional authority are reviewed. The implications of power inequities between study sponsors, researchers and participants are also considered. Issues associated with the development and preparation of consent forms, including translation and documentation are highlighted. Recommendations for good practices are outlined and future directions for research are explored.

J	Owen, R				Owen, Roger			The rapid growth of Egypt's agricultural output, 1890-1914, as an early example of the green revolutions of modern South Asia: some implications for the writing of global history	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY			English	Article								The article uses comparative Indian material from British India and, later, the Pakistani Punjab to ask new questions of the standard accounts of Egypt's post-1890 cotton boom. It also argues for the particular relevance of the rich Punjabi green revolution data to the Egyptian case, and more generally, for the rewards to be obtained from an academic dialog between selected aspects of late nineteenth and of late twentieth century globalization. Topics analyzed include the impact of the various agricultural revolutions on social and regional inequalities, the issue of sustainability, the role of experts and the impact on health of long-term environmental degradation.

JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						air pollution; public health; tobacco	ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; FREE WORKPLACES; EXPOSURE; RISK	Background From 26 March 2006, smoking will be prohibited in wholly and substantially enclosed public places in Scotland, and it will be an offence to permit smoking or to smoke in no-smoking premises. We anticipate that implementation of the smoke-free legislation will result in significant health gains associated with reductions in exposure to both environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and personal tobacco consumption as well as other social and economic impacts. Methods Health Scotland in conjunction with the Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland and the Scottish Executive have developed a comprehensive evaluation strategy to assess the expected short-term, intermediate and long-term outcomes. Using routine health, behavioural and economic data and commissioned research, we will assess the impact of the smoke-free legislation in eight key outcome areas - knowledge and attitudes, ETS exposure, compliance, culture, smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption, tobacco-related morbidity and mortality, economic impacts on the hospitality sector and health inequalities. Conclusion The findings from this evaluation will make a significant contribution to the international understanding of the health effects of exposure to ETS and the broader social, cultural and economic impacts of smoke-free legislation.

A review of major influences on current public health policy in developed countries in the second half of the 20th century	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH			English	Review						health determinants; health targets; inequalities in health; policy development; public health		Public health policy underwent substantial transformation during the latter half of the 20th century The landmark statement was the 1948 World Health Organization (WHO) constitution, which identified good health as a fundamental right and gave the responsibility to governments to achieve it for all their people. However, following World War 11, developed countries made substantial investment in health care with less attention paid to public health. The importance of public health was slowly recognised over the period from 1970 to 2000 with the publication of several reports from different organisations. The first authoritative policy statement that the important determinants of health lay outside health care was in the Lalonde Report from Canada. These ideas were subsequently expressed in the WHO Alma-Ata declaration and were emphasised a year later by the US Surgeon General. The idea of setting goals for health improvement also began in the 1970s. The Lalonde Report and the United Kingdom Black Report recommended that targets be used, but the first explicitly stated health targets were set by the US in 1979. WHO also identified the need for such targets at this time, but did not introduce them until 1984. Since then health targets have become a central feature of public health policy in developed countries. The Ottawa Conference on Health Promotion in 1986 championed the view that health promotion was central to achieving health goals internationally It helped clarify the types of actions needed: that individuals need to be provided with the supportive environment and economic resources to be able to lead healthy lives. In a further development, the Healthy Cities Project was launched with the specific aim of involving political decision-makers in building a strong lobby for public health at the local level. The Healthy Cities Project illustrates how to provide means and opportunity for interventions to be implemented in communities. Concerns with inequalities in health were emphasised in the WHO declaration of Alma-Ata, and were the focus of the United Kingdom Black Report. The Jakarta Conference on Health Promotion in 1997 urged international action on poverty, as it is the major threat to health. International acceptance of the need to tackle inequalities took longer than the acceptance of health targets, but it is now an important feature of public health policy. The advent of the 21(st) century marked the coming of age of public health. The renewed version of 'Health for All', 'Health for All in the 21(st) Century', emphasised the one constant goal of WHO that all individuals should achieve their full health potential. Public health is now regarded internationally as being a priority with this WHO goal being adopted as the overarching goal of policy. The challenges it faces in tackling problems such as obesity, inequalities in health, smoking, alcohol and substance abuse are great and will require policies which tackle the economic, social and environmental determinants of health.

Methods In this poptilation-basedc ross-sectorial study, we analyzed all deaths in the 25-64 age group (N = 14 816) in Slovenia in 1992, 1995, and 1998. Causes of death, classified into groups according to the 10th revision of International Classification of Diseases, were linked to rile data oil the deceased from the 1991 Census. Stratified contingency-table analyses were performed. Years-of-potential-life-lost (YPLL) were calculated on the basis of population life-tables stratified by region and linearly modeled by the characteristics of the deceased. Poisson regression,vas applied to rest the differences in mortality rate. Results Across all socioeconomic strata, men died at younger age than women (index of excess mortality in men exceeded 200 for all studied years) and from different prevailing causes (injuries in men aged < 45 years; neoplasms in women aged > 35 years). For men, higher education was associated with fewer deaths from digestive and respiratory system diseases. The least educated women died relatively often from circulatory diseases, but rarely from neoplasms. Single people died from neoplasms less often. Marriage in comparison with divorce reduced the mortality rate by 1.9-fold in both men and women (P < 0.001). Mortality, race in both men and women decreased with increasing education level (P < 0.001). Mortality rate of ethnic Slovenians was half the mortality rate of ethnic minority members and immigrants (P < 0.001). Analysis of WILL revealed limited and nonlinear impact of education level on premature mortality. The share of neoplasms was the highest in the cluster of socioeconomically. prosperous regions, whereas the share of circulatory diseases was increased in poorer regions. Significant differences were found between individual regions in age at death and mortality rate, and the differences decreased over the studied period. Conclusion These data may aid in understanding the nature, prevalence and consequences of mortality as related to socioeconomic inequalities, and thus serve as a basis for setting health and social policy goals and planning health measures.

There is presently no curative treatment or definitive predictive test for tardive dyskinesia. The authors note that the three antipsychotic drugs enlisted in the most recent (14th) World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines - chlorpromazine, fluphenazine and haloperidol - belong to the FGA therapeutic class. In this regard, the need to choose between the competing objectives of ensuring global access to affordable and efficacious medicines, such as FGAs, and the formidable long-term risk for tardive dyskinesia, may create an ethical conundrum. Pharmacogenetics has thus far been conceptually framed as a tool to individualise therapy with new drugs under patent protection. However, the authors suggest that pharmacogenetics may also improve access to pharmacotherapy through the reintroduction of affordable second-line generic drugs or FGAs with suboptimal safety, as first-line therapy, in targeted subpopulations in whom they present a lower risk for tardive dyskinesia. To impact positively on global public health and distributive justice, a directory complementary to the essential medicines library - one that enlists the 'essential biomarkers' required for optimal pharmacotherapy - may benefit patients who do not have adequate access to new antipsychotic medications. This review discusses pharmacogenetic associations of tardive dyskinesia that are in part supported by meta-analyses and the oxidative stress-neuronal degeneration hypothesis.

There are, however, few graduate medical education programs that focus on health equity. A graduate medical education program in health equity was developed at Brigham and Women's Hospital based on a review of existing literature and on a survey of junior faculty who have had informal health disparities experience. The Howard Hiatt Residency in Global Health Equity and Internal Medicine was developed as a four-year program to provide intensive training in internal medicine and health disparities. Participating residents are matched with a mentor who has clinical and research experience in the field of global health. In addition to a series of didactic teaching sessions and longitudinal seminars that focus on issues of global health equity, residents take graduate level courses in epidemiology, health policy, ethics, and medical anthropology. Residents also carry out an independent research project in a geographic area that suffers from health disparities. Two residents are selected for training per year. Participating faculty are multidisciplinary and come from diverse Harvard-affiliated institutions. Graduate medical education in the United States with a focus on health equity is lacking. It is hoped that the novel training program in health equity for internal medical residents developed at Brigham and Women's Hospital can serve as a model for other teaching hospitals based in the United States.

J	Pittman, PM				Pittman, PM			Beyond the sound of one hand clapping: Experiences in six countries using health equity research in policy	JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLITICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article							RECOMMENDATIONS	In an attempt to better understand the complex and sometimes tenuous relationship between health equity research and health policy, we undertook a collaborative comparison of six case studies with researchers from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, China, South Africa, and Chile. Patterns in factors contributing to governments' interest in research included the role of domestic advocacy, interest in their international standing, and the existence of internal government champions. Strategies used by researchers to promote their findings included carefully crafting messages and selecting messengers in accordance with their audience's concerns, delaying publication until interactions with policy makers had occurred, monitoring public opinion, and a host of ideas relating to the style and content of government-sponsored commission reports. Most of the similarities crossed the developing/developed country divide, although it did appear that in the three case Studies from the north, greater attention was paid to the professional legitimacy of institutions, individuals, and journals, while in the three developing countries the existence of trusted personal messengers appeared essential. While there are no prescriptions for ensuring the use of health equity research in policy, the comparison across Such different international settings stimulated participants to question their assumptions about what works, when, and why.											22	13	14	1	6	DUKE UNIV PRESS	DURHAM	905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA	0361-6878			J HEALTH POLIT POLIC	J.

J	Ram, R				Ram, R			Further examination of the cross-country association between income inequality and population health	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						income inequality; population health; cross-country data; poverty	MORTALITY; DETERMINANTS; SET	Several scholars have put forward the view that the estimates by Rodgers [(1979). Income and inequality as determinants of mortality: An international cross-section analysis. Population Studies, 33 (2), 343-351], Flegg [(1982). Inequality of income, illiteracy and medical care as determinants of infant mortality in underdeveloped countries. Population Studies, 36 (3), 441-458] and Waldmann [(1992). Income distribution and infant mortality. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107 (4), 1283-1302] showing a negative cross-country association between income inequality and population health, cannot be replicated from recent data. In view of the importance of this matter, the present study further examines the issue from the most recent, and probably more accurate, data for the largest cross-country sample used in this line of research. The main conclusion is that the negative cross-country association between income inequality and good health, reported by Rodgers, Flegg, and Waldmann, is replicated very well. The different findings indicated by some scholars may have been due to their samples or the models being unusual. Therefore, the recent skepticism about the existence of such a negative association needs to be reconsidered. Several additional points are also noted. First, income inequality shows significance even after an index of ethnic heterogeneity is included. Second, ethnic heterogeneity itself has a negative association with population health. Third, income inequality retains significance in the presence of a measure of social capital. Fourth, however, the association between the measure of social capital and population health appears weak. Fifth, a simple analysis does not support the view that the positive association between income inequality and infant mortality in less developed countries (LDCs) may just be a reflection of the role of poverty. Finally, there is some support for the proposition that while income may be relatively more important for health in LDCs, the role of income inequality may be stronger in developed economies.

J	McIntyre, D; Thiede, M; Dahlgren, G; Whitehead, M				McIntyre, D; Thiede, M; Dahlgren, G; Whitehead, M			What are the economic consequences for households of illness and of paying for health care in low- and middle-income country contexts?	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						health care costs; illness costs; coping strategies; poverty; household impacts	MALARIA; COSTS; EXPENDITURES; POVERTY; EQUITY; SECTOR; IMPACT	This paper presents the findings of a critical review of studies carried out in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) focusing on the economic consequences for households of illness and health care use. These include household level impacts of direct costs (medical treatment and related financial costs), indirect costs (productive time losses resulting from illness) and subsequent household responses. It highlights that health care financing strategies that place considerable emphasis on out-of-pocket payments can impoverish households. There is growing evidence of households being pushed into poverty or forced into deeper poverty when faced with substantial medical expenses, particularly when combined with a loss of household income due to ill-health. Health sector reforms in LMICs since the late 1980s have particularly focused on promoting user fees for public sector health services and increasing the role of the private for-profit sector in health care provision. This has increasingly placed the burden of paying for health care on individuals experiencing poor health. This trend seems to continue even though some countries and international organisations are considering a shift away from their previous pro-user fee agenda. Research into alternative health care financing strategies and related mechanisms for coping with the direct and indirect costs of illness is urgently required to inform the development of appropriate social policies to improve access to essential health services and break the vicious cycle between illness and poverty.

Nursing's fundamental responsibilities to promote health, prevent disease, and alleviate Suffering call for the expression of caring for humanity and environment through political activism at local, national, and international levels to bring about reforms of the current global economic order.

Nursing, likewise, is in the process of expanding its worldview to one that accommodates global care. The authors further articulate a global ethic for nursing by distinguishing 2 concepts: world citizenship, as described by Martha Nussbaum, which calls nurses to critically evaluate personal and culture-based beliefs, and compassionate professional, which calls nurses to nurture partnerships of mutual respect. It is also important that nursing participate and support professional and international organizations that address social injustices related to healthcare, poverty, and public health.

J	Hartford, K; Carey, R; Mendonca, J				Hartford, Kathleen; Carey, Robert; Mendonca, James			Pre-arrest diversion of people with mental illness: Literature review and international survey	BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES & THE LAW			English	Article							POLICE OFFICERS; CRISIS; ILL; RESPONSES; PROGRAMS; OUTCOMES	Mental health diversion is a process where alternatives to criminal sanctions are made available to persons with mental illness (PMI) who have come into contact with the law. One form of mental health diversion is pre-arrest, in which the police use their discretion in laying charges. Concomitant with the growth of pre-arrest diversion programs is a growing body of research devoted to the phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature of pre-arrest diversion, and to report the results of an international survey of pre-arrest diversion programs we conducted to identify evidence-based practices. On the basis of our review and survey, we note that successful pre-trial programs appear to integrate relevant mental health, substance abuse and criminal justice agencies by having regular meetings between key personnel from the various agencies. Often, a liaison person with a mandate to effect strong leadership plays a key role in the coordination of various agencies. Streamlining services through the creation of an emergency drop-off center with a no-refusal policy for police cases is seen as crucial. While there is some indication that mentally ill offenders benefit from their participation in this form of diversion, the evaluative literature has not yet achieved the "critical mass" necessary to create generalizable, evidence-based knowledge. The absence of generally agreed-upon outcomes could lead to the inequitable application of basic principles of diversion. We suggest that indicators, benchmarks, and outcomes must be agreed upon if a comprehensive understanding of pre-arrest programs is to emerge. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Rennie, S; Behets, F				Rennie, S; Behets, F			Desperately seeking targets: the ethics of routine HIV testing in low-income countries	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article						HIV infections/diagnosis; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/diagnosis; ethics; medical; human rights; informed consent; developing countries; Botswana (source : MeSH, NLM)	INFECTION; HIV/AIDS; MEDICINE; RATES	The human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) pandemic, and responses to it, have exposed clear political, social and economic inequities between and within nations. The most striking manifestations of this inequity is access to AlDS treatment. In affluent nations, antiretroviral treatment is becoming the standard of care for those with AIDS, while the same treatment is currently only available for a privileged few in most resource-poor countries. Patients without sufficient financial and social capital - i.e., most people with AIDS - die each day by the thousands. Recent AIDS treatment initiatives such as the UNAIDS and WHO "3 by 5" programme aim to rectify this symptom of global injustice. However, the success of these initiatives depends on the identification of people in need of treatment through a rapid and massive scale-up of HIV testing. In this paper, we briefly explore key ethical challenges raised by the acceleration of HIV testing in resource-poor countries, focusing on the 2004 policy of routine ("opt-out") HIV testing recommended by UNAIDS and WHO. We suggest that in settings marked by poverty, weak health-care and civil society infrastructures, gender inequalities, and persistent stigmatization of people with HIV/AIDS, opt out HIV-testing policies may become disconnected from the human rights ideals that first motivated calls for universal access to AIDS treatment. We leave open the ethical question of whether opt-out policies should be implemented, but we recommend that whenever routine HIV-testing policies are introduced in resource-poor countries, that their effect on individuals and communities should be the subject of empirical research, human-rights monitoring and ethical scrutiny.

In light of numerous calls to action both nationally and internationally, an orientation to applied health policy and systems research, and to public health research and its application is required to redress global inequalities in wealth and health and to tackle well-documented constraints to achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Over the last four years, the GHRI has funded close to 70 research program development and pilot projects. However, longer-term investment is needed. The proposed $100 million Teasdale-Corti Global Health Research Partnership Program is such a response, and is intended to support teams of researchers and research users to develop, test and implement innovative approaches to strengthening institutional capacity, especially in low- and middle-income countries; to generating knowledge and its effective application to improve the health of populations, especially those most vulnerable; and to strengthen health systems in those countries. While Canada stands poised to act, concerted leadership and resources are still required to support "research that matters" for health and development in low- and middle-income countries.

Participants: Researchers from the Tanzanian National Institute for Medical Research, university and community-based researchers from Tanzania, the Gambia and South Africa. Setting: National Institute for Medical Research, Dar es Salaam - Tanzania. Intervention: An intensive two-day workshop to examine the applicability of the BIAS FREE Framework within an African setting. This involved clarification of the following concepts: construction of knowledge, objectivity, logic of domination, hierarchy, power, sex and gender, disability, and race/ethnicity. The Framework identifies three types of bias problems that derive from social hierarchies based on gender, race and disability: maintaining hierarchy, failing to examine differences, and using double standards. Participants used the 20 diagnostic questions at the heart of the Framework to analyze various research publications, including some authored by participants. Outcomes: Participants uniformly stated that the Framework is useful for uncovering bias in public health research, policy and programs; that it is immediately applicable in their work settings; and that doing so would improve equity in research and, ultimately, in health. One participant re-analyzed published data using the Framework and submitted a supplementary report with some new recommendations. Implications: The applicability of the BIAS FREE Framework has been demonstrated in diverse settings. It is now being offered for broader application as a tool for uncovering and eliminating biases in health research that derive from social hierarchies and for addressing the persistence of global health inequities.

J	Lown, B; Banerjee, A				Lown, Bernard; Banerjee, Amitava			The developing world in The New England Journal of Medicine	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article							HEALTH	Background: Rampant disease in poor countries impedes development and contributes to growing North-South disparities; however, leading international medical journals underreport on health research priorities for developing countries. Methods: We examined 416 weekly issues of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) over an eight-year period, January 1997 to December 2004. A total of 8857 articles were reviewed by both authors. The content of each issue was evaluated in six categories: research, review articles, editorial, correspondence, book reviews and miscellaneous. If the title or abstract concerned a topic pertinent to any health issue in the developing world, the article was reviewed. Results: Over the eight years covered in this study, 1997-2004, in the three essential categories of original research articles, review articles and editorials, less than 3.0 percent of these addressed health issues in the developing world. Publications relevant to DC were largely concerned with HIV and communicable diseases and constituted 135 of the 202 articles of which 63 were devoted to HIV. Only 23 articles addressed non-communicable disease in the DC and only a single article - a book review - discussed heart disease. Conclusion: The medical information gap between rich and poor countries as judged by publications in the NEJM appears to be larger than the gap in the funding for research. Under-representation of developing world health issues in the medical literature is a global phenomenon. International medical journals cannot rectify global inequities, but they have an important role in educating their constituencies about the global divide.

J	Jacobs, B; Price, N				Jacobs, B; Price, N			Improving access for the poorest to public sector health services: insights from Kirivong Operational Health District in Cambodia	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						health care financing; access; equity; user fees; community; local ownership	COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; USER FEES; EQUITY; CARE; COUNTRIES; FRAMEWORK	This article presents research findings into the effectiveness of an innovative equity fund approach to improving access to public sector health services for the poor in Kirivong Operational Health District in Cambodia. The operational health district is the lowest organizational level in the Cambodian health system, providing services through health centres and a single referral hospital. An equity fund involves a third party identifying the poor and paying user fees on their behalf by reimbursing the service provider, thus relieving health staff of such responsibility. We explore the appropriateness of utilizing community members to identify the poorest. The impact of newly introduced pagoda-managed equity funds on access to public health services for the poorest, and on their out-of-pocket expenditure during illness episodes, is then examined. We conclude with an evaluation of the contribution of the equity funds to community participation. The research indicates that identification by community members of those eligible for equity funds is feasible, accrues minimal direct costs, and is effective. Households identified as eligible for equity fund benefits were poorer than those identified as non-beneficiaries. Direct costs associated with seeking care were considerably lower for equity fund beneficiaries than for non-beneficiaries, and fewer beneficiaries than non-beneficiaries initially consulted the private sector, providing evidence of the equity fund's ability to attract the poorest to the public sector. The level and nature of community participation was enhanced considerably following the introduction of the pagoda-managed equity funds. In order to maximize and sustain the equity benefits of such funds, we recommend that external agencies (such as international non-governmental organizations) limit their role to the provision of technical support and advice, rather than taking the lead on implementation and administration. Facilitating the design, implementation, administration and management of equity funds by indigenous community-based organizations has the advantage of not only greatly reducing administrative costs, allowing a large proportion of the fund to be spent on services for the poor, but also of enhancing local ownership, thus increasing the likelihood of equity funds being sustained in the future.

J	Orach, CG; De Brouwere, V				Orach, CG; De Brouwere, V			Integrating refugee and host health services in West Nile districts, Uganda	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						integration; health service; refugees; host population; Uganda	ASSISTANCE; GUINEA	Refugees are a common feature in Africa and Uganda is no exception. However, Uganda does not have the resources to provide health care to all its own citizens, let alone to refugees. Refugee health services are therefore usually set up and provided separately by international organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). However, such services often end up being the only available or reliable services in a particular location for both host and refugee populations. Yet the host populations are often denied access to these services because, in theory, other services are being provided by their government. The case study in the West Nile region of Uganda describes how host and refugee services were integrated in an attempt to address the concerns of inequity of access to care for host populations, when reasonably good health services were available to nearby refugee populations. The paper identifies and discusses the challenges encountered and those remaining.

J	Banerji, D				Banerji, Debabar			Serious crisis in the practice of international health by the World Health Organization: The Commission on Social Determinants of Health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							ALMA-ATA; MACROECONOMICS	The Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) is the latest effort by the World Health Organization to improve health and narrow health inequalities through action on social determinants. The CSDH does not note that much work has already been done in this direction, does not make a sufficient attempt to analyze why earlier efforts failed to yield the desired results, and does not seem to have devised approaches to ensure that it will be more successful this time. The CSDH intends to complement the work of the earlier WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which has not had the desired impact, and it is unclear how the CSDH can complement work that suffers from such serious infirmities. Inadequacies of both commissions reflect a crisis in the practice of international health at the WHO, stemming from a combination of unsatisfactory administrative practices and lack of technical competence to provide insights into the problems afflicting the most needy countries. Often the WHO has ended up distorting the rudimentary health systems of the poor countries, by pressuring them into accepting health policies, plans, and programs that lack sound scientific bases.

J	Bernier, NF				Bernier, NF			Quebec's approach to population health: An overview of policy content and organization	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Canada; Quebec; policy; public health; health promotion; social determinants of health	PUBLIC-HEALTH; DETERMINANTS	While Canada's international leadership in the area of health promotion has been widely acknowledged in the past, Quebec's approach could be better known. Canada's second largest province has indeed developed a comprehensive public health infrastructure and adopted a population health approach which features an integrated set of legislative, organizational and programmatic policy instruments. These instruments not only ensure the core functions of public health, but also foster public intervention on the social determinants of health. In addition, Quebec's policy is supported by a solid research infrastructure, networked expertise and a mobilized workforce among health professionals. In spite of the interest it represents for the larger public health community in Canada and elsewhere, this largely French-speaking province's approach remains little known because of language and cultural barriers between Quebec and Anglo-Saxon countries, and it has yet to be systematically discussed in the English-language literature. This article provides an overview of policies and administrative structures in Quebec to support public health and address socially determined inequalities in health. It analyzes the development of these policies over the past decade and offers insight to their core content.

Its very remoteness, stark landscape and inhospitable climate, coupled with its many unique cultural attractions, have led to Upper Mustang being described as "to the international tourism circuit what Antarctica is for naturalists." Agriculture, livestock and tourism are considered major sources of livelihood but the low agricultural productivity, diminishing rangelands, inequitable sharing of revenue from tourism threaten the sustainability of livelihood in Upper Mustang. Reducing the crop loss to pest and diseases, improving animal health and rangelands, equitable sharing of revenue generated from tourism and its re-investment in the area are seen as key strategies for sustainable livelihood.

It deals with this largely through prosthetic replacement. The discipline occupies a major portion of a dental school curriculum, and dental practitioners usually devote much of their practice to prosthodontic services. With the rapid improvement in oral health and the reduction of edentulism in many countries, increasing numbers of people are retaining more teeth later in life. Gradually, the main focus in prosthodontics has shifted from removable dentures to fixed prostheses, while implant-supported restorations have attracted intense interest in the dental community. Another factor increasingly influencing prosthodontic practice is patients' awareness of newer technologies in aesthetic dentistry. Because prosthodontic interventions as well as maintenance and repair are by nature costly, the global development in the field manifests fundamental inequalities in the levels of service that patients can access. Diminishing resources for health care in general challenges educators and practitioners of prosthodontics alike. This review is an attempt to describe the recent developments in prosthodontics and its therapeutic areas, and the impact such developments may have on the theory and practice of the discipline.

This article reviews the limitations of systematic reviews as stand-alone tools for this purpose and suggests a complementary approach to make better use of the evidence. That is, systematic reviews and other sources of evidence should be incorporated into a wider analytical framework, the public health regime (defined here as the specific legislative, social, political, and economic structures that have an impact on both public health and the appropriateness and effectiveness of public health interventions adopted). At the national level this approach would facilitate analysis at all levels of the policy framework, countering the current focus on individual interventions. It could also differentiate at the international level between those policies and interventions that are effective in different contexts and are therefore potentially generalizable and those that depend on particular conditions for success.

Who receives specialist palliative care in Western Australia - and who misses out	PALLIATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						cancer; palliative care; population-based study; specialist palliative care	CANCER-PATIENTS; ADVANCED LUNG; FAILURE; SERVICES; DISEASE; ISSUES; HEALTH; HEART	Objectives: To describe the characteristics of Western Australian (WA) people who received, and did not receive, specialist palliative care (SPC) during their last 12 months of life. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting and participants: People who died between 1 July 2000 and 31 December 2002 in WA, and whose cause of death was from cancer or selected non-cancer conditions. Main outcome measures: Use of SPC in the last 12 months of life. Results: There were 27 971 deaths from all causes in WA over the study period. Two-thirds (68%) of people who died of cancer received SPC, but less than one in ten (8%) who died of selected non-cancer conditions received SPC. Those who died of cancer were significantly less likely to receive SPC if they were single or widowed, aged > 85 years or lived in a region other than a major city. Of those who died of selected non-cancer conditions, people other than those who were married were significantly less likely to have accessed SPC. Indigenous people were less likely to have accessed SPC, although this was not statistically significant (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.36-1.34). Conclusions: Within a WA context, this study confirms established international evidence for problems of access to SPC by non-cancer patients and other disadvantaged groups. Importantly, this evidence is provided at a population level, thus documenting the extent of inequities in palliative care service provision. By pointing to the areas of most critical need, this study assists in health service policy and planning.

To control for simultaneity, an estimated value of fertility was used in the mortality equation and a final specification included only exogenous socio-economic, health and environmental variables. We confirm the importance of female literacy in explaining both fertility and mortality, and also find a measure of consumption for the poorest share of the population to be significant, while controlling for nutrition, health expenditure, and income distribution. Incidence of tuberculosis and female agricultural population proxy for environmental impacts, but in spite of these controls, approximately 41% additional mortality was estimated due to living in the CARs. The results fill gaps in the literature: we use a wider range of socio-economic and environmental health variables than previously in an encompassing analysis of mortality and fertility, and find evidence of excessive mortality in the CARs most likely linked to environmental degradation in the region.

The Bradford Hill criteria are often used to evaluate public health interventions. The principal finding of this review was that there is compelling evidence of effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness, consistent with seven previous reviews conducted by or on behalf of U.S. government agencies. Authorities in countries affected or threatened by HIV infection among injecting drug users should carefully consider this convincing evidence now available for needle syringe programs with a view to establishing or expanding needle syringe programs to scale.

I first discuss the ways in which economic globalisation can and has been defined and then why it is important to analyse its impact both in terms of health and health policies. I then explore the ways in which economic globalisation influences health and health policies and how this relates to equity, social justice, and the role of values and social rights in societies. Finally, I argue that the process of economic globalisation provides a common challenge for all health systems across the globe and requires a broader debate on values, accountability, and policy approaches.

The concept of universal human rights is that every person, simply by being human, has the right to be treated with dignity and equality. After a brief overview of international human rights declarations and treaties since that time, this article looks at the mistreatment of women prisoners in the U.S. today in the areas of health care, mental health, and sexual abuse, and determines that it is a violation of their human rights on a number of levels. Despite lip service by the government and the belief of many citizens that file U.S. is it Country that honors human rights, when we took at what really goes on, we find that file U.S. falls behind other democratic countries in its treatments of domestic prisoners, particularly women prisoners.

The key objectives of this article are to: (i) explore the key determinants of personal computers (PCs), telephone mainline and cellular and Internet penetration/connectivity in the African Region; and (ii) to propose actions needed to create an enabling environment for e-health services growth and utilization in the Region. Methods: The effects of school enrolment, per capita income and governance variables on the number of PCs, telephone mainlines, cellular phone subscribers and Internet users were estimated using a double-log regression model and cross-sectional data on various Member States in the African Region. The analysis was based on 45 of the 46 countries that comprise the Region. The data were obtained from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) sources. Results: There were a number of main findings: (i) the adult literacy and total number of Internet users had a statistically significant ( at 5% level in a t-distribution test) positive effect on the number of PCs in a country; ( ii) the combined school enrolment rate and per capita income had a statistically significant direct effect on the number of telephone mainlines and cellular telephone subscribers; (iii) the regulatory quality had statistically significant negative effect on the number of telephone mainlines; (iv) similarly, the combined school enrolment ratio and the number of telephone mainlines had a statistically significant positive relationship with Internet usage; and (v) there were major inequalities in ICT connectivity between upper-middle, lower-middle and low income countries in the Region. By focusing on the adoption of specific technologies we attempted to interpret correlates in terms of relationships instead of absolute "causals". Conclusion: In order to improve access to health care, especially for the majority of Africans living in remote rural areas, there is need to boost the availability and utilization of e-health services. Thus, universal access to e-health ought to be a vision for all countries in the African Region. Each country ought to develop a road map in a strategic e-health plan that will, over time, enable its citizens to realize that vision.

We recommend that highest priority be given to research in five general areas: (1) global factors and processes that affect health equity and/or constrain what countries can do to address health inequities within their own borders; (2) societal and political structures and relationships that differentially affect people's chances of being healthy within a given society; (3) interrelationships between factors at the individual level and within the social context that increase or decrease the likelihood of achieving and maintaining good health; (4) characteristics of the health care system that influence health equity and (5) effective policy interventions to reduce health inequity in the first four areas.

Methods The data on patients older than 45 years and their chronic diseases classified according to the 10th revision of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems were collected from the medical files in a family practice in Komarevo. The patients were grouped according to their status (natives, immigrants, and returned refugees) and age (45-64 and >= 65 years). The differences in diagnoses between the groups of the same age were analyzed by descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis test, and chi(2) test. Results In the 45-64 age group, hypertension was diagnosed in 67 out of 183 (36.6%) natives, 22 out of 108 (20.4%) immigrants, and 12 out of 50 (24%) returned refugees (chi(2)(2) = 9.48; P=0.008). In the same age group, ischemic heart disease was found in 21 out of 183 (11.4%) natives, 3 out of 108 (2.8%) immigrants, and 3 out of 50 (6.4%) returned refugees (chi(2)(2) = 7.34, P=0.025). In those aged >= 65, intervertebral disc disorders, dorsalgia, and dorsopathy were found in 61 out of 169 (36.1%) natives, 26 out of 123 (21.1%) immigrants, and 15 out of 90 (15.8%) returned refugees (chi(2)(2)=15.44, P < 0.001). Ischemic heart disease was found in 20 out of 169 (11.8%) natives, 4 out of 123 (3.3%) immigrants, and 16 out of 90 (16.8%) returned refugees (chi(2)(2) = 11.40, P= 0.003). Five (56%) and six (67%) out of nine groups of diagnoses had the lowest prevalence in immigrants aged 45-64 and >= 65, respectively. Conclusion Native inhabitants had the highest prevalence of observed chronic diseases, whereas the immigrant adult population had the lowest. Such differences should be kept in mind in the approach to war-affected populations.

By using the concept of transitions, we examine current and future tensions between welfare, well-being and the environment, and focus on four major issues that are of global importance: two of our key natural resources, water and biodiversity; the health of human populations; and the developments related to global tourism. In our global assessment, we base ourselves on the most recent scenario efforts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Future developments are explored along the lines of four development paths (scenario groups), defined along two dimensions (global versus regional dynamics and emphasising economic objectives versus environmental and equity objectives.

It is an old phenomenon that produces many disadvantages for the donor region or nation. The difficulties include inequities with the provision of health services, financial loss, loss of educated families, potential employers, and role models and diminished resources with which to conduct medical education. Staff for undergraduate and postgraduate education is depleted. The critical mass for research and development becomes difficult to achieve or maintain, and these disadvantages are not compensated for adequately by increased contacts, the introduction of new ideas, or financial inflow to the donor region or country. The political will of governments and international organizations regarding treaties about the ethics of physician recruitment is called into question by discrepancies between the text of agreements and the ground realities. Amelioration of this situation requires economic development and imaginative schemes by the donors and, ideally, ethical considerations from recipient governments. At the very least, adequate compensation should be made to the donor country for the gain obtained by the host country.

Current scientific evidence indicates that climate change will contribute to the global burden of disease through increases in diarrhoeal disease; vector-borne disease, and malnutrition, and the health impacts of extreme weather and climate events. A few studies have estimated future potential health impacts of climate change but often generate little policy-relevant information. Robust estimates of future health impacts rely on robust projections of future disease patterns. The application of a standardized and established methodology has been developed to quantify the impact of climate change in relation to different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. All health risk assessments are necessarily biased toward conservative best-estimates of health effects that are easily measured. Global, regional, and national risk assessments can take no account of irreversibility, or plausible low-probability events with potentially very high burdens on human health. There is no "safe limit" of climate change with respect to health impacts as health systems in some regions do not adequately cope with the current climate variability. Current scientific methods cannot identify global threshold health effects in order for policymakers to regulate a "tolerable" amount of climate change. We argue for the need for more research to reduce the potential impacts of climate change on human health, including the development of improved methods for quantitative risk assessment. The large uncertainty about the future effects of climate change on human population health should be a reason to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and not a reason for inaction.

The article corrects for two main shortcomings in conventional economic analyses of environmental change. First is the overemphasis placed on income growth, and general disregard for other socioeconomic factors. Second is economists' often oversimplified view of the environment, where distinctions between environmental necessities such as potable water and so-called environmental luxuries are ignored. I test for the effectiveness of power inequality in explaining access to sanitation and safe water as well as their health consequences. Methods. I develop a two-stage model seeking first to explain changes in the environmental variables and then population health. I employ ordinary least squares regressions on international cross-sectional data. Results. Some dimensions of power inequality outperform per-capita income as possible determinants of population health. Neither power inequality nor income is clearly superior at explaining environmental quality. Conclusion. The study casts further doubt on the importance of per-capita income in explaining environmental and health outcomes.

Human rights and social justice are key considerations for both population health and biomedical research. In this paper, I will briefly explore approaches to human rights in bioethics and review guidelines for ethical conduct in international health research, focusing specifically on health research conducted in resource-poor settings. I will demonstrate the potential for addressing human rights considerations in international health research with special attention to the importance of collaborative partnerships, capacity building, and respect for cultural traditions. Strengthening professional knowledge about international research ethics increases awareness of ethical concerns associated with study design and informed consent among researchers working in resource-poor settings. But this is not enough. Technological and financial resources are also necessary to build capacity for local communities to ensure that research results are integrated into existing health systems. Problematic issues surrounding the application of ethical guidelines in resource-poor settings are embedded in social history, cultural context, and the global political economy. Resolving the moral complexities requires a commitment to engaged dialogue and action among investigators, funding agencies, policy makers, governmental institutions, and private industry.

To explore some determinants of occupational disease incidence in Mexico, the authors carried out an ecological study with data from 32 Mexican states. Using ordinary least squares regression, they explored associations between occupational disease incidence and the Gini coefficient, the percentage of small and median enterprises, and migration. Income inequality and the combined percentage of small and median enterprises were negatively associated with the incidence of occupational disease. In Mexico, the "population strategy" of the prevention of occupational disease suggests that big enterprises' contexts are related to a higher occurrence of occupational diseases. Further studies using multilevel approaches are needed to establish whether these occupational diseases are related to exposures present in big or in small and median enterprises.

Investment and investigation in health also involve inequalities at the global level, and this includes insufficient North-South transfer of funds, technology and expertise in the health field, including the specific area of communicable diseases. Globally, epidemics and outbreaks in any geographic region can represent international public health emergencies, and this type of threat requires a global response. Therefore, given the need to strengthen the global capacity for dealing with threats of infectious diseases, a framework is needed for collaboration on alerting the world to epidemics and responding to public health emergencies. This is necessary to guarantee a high level of security against the dissemination of communicable diseases in an ever more globalized world. In response to these needs, international health agencies have put a number of strategies into practice in order to contribute to the control of communicable diseases in poor countries. The principle strategies include: 1) implementation of mechanisms for international epidemiologic surveillance; 2) use of international law to support the control of communicable diseases; 3) international cooperation on health matters; 4) strategies to strengthen primary care services and health systems in general; 5) promotion of the transfer of resources for research and development from the North to the South.

Jenner's discovery of the smallpox vaccine made possible the prevention and control of smallpox epidemics. In response to a large outbreak of smallpox in the Spanish colonies, King Charles IV appointed Francisco Xavier de Balmis to lead an expedition that would introduce Jenner's vaccine to these colonies. During the journey, the vaccine was kept viable by passing it from arm to arm in orphaned children, who were brought along expressly for that purpose and remained under the care of the orphanage's director. This expedition was the first large scale mass vaccination of its kind. The historic legacy of this pioneering event in international health should be revisited in the current era of persistent inequalities in global health.

We determined whether or not juvenile detainees with major mental disorders received treatment, and the variables that predicted who received services. Methods. Our sample was 1829 randomly selected juvenile detainees taking part in the Northwestern Juvenile Project. To determine need for mental health services, independent interviewers administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and rated functional impairment using the Child Global Assessment Scale. Records on service provision were obtained from the juvenile justice and public health systems. Results. Among detainees who had major mental disorders and associated functional impairments, 15.4% received treatment in the detention center and 8.1% received treatment in the community by the time of case disposition or 6 months, whichever came first. Significantly more girls than boys were detected and treated. Receiving treatment was predicted by clinical variables (having a major mental disorder or reported treatment history or suicidal behavior) and demographic variables. Conclusions. The challenge to public health is to provide accessible, innovative, and effective treatments to juvenile detainees, a population that is often beyond the reach of traditional services.

Therefore, this study aims to compare the shape and magnitude of occupational class inequalities across key domains of health, i. e. the subjective, functional and medical domains. Additionally, we examine whether physical or mental workload will affect these inequalities, and whether these effects are specific to particular health indicators. Methods: Cross- sectional survey data from the Helsinki Health Study in 2000 and 2001 were used. Each year employees of the City of Helsinki, reaching 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 years received a mailed questionnaire. 6243 employees responded ( 80% women, response rate 68%). The socioeconomic indicator was occupational social class. Nine health indicators were included: self- rated health, pain or ache, GHQ- 12 mental well- being, limiting long- standing illness, SF- 36 physical and mental health functioning, Rose angina symptoms, circulatory diseases and mental problems. Prevalence percentages, odds ratios and inequality indices from logistic regression analysis were calculated. Results: Occupational class inequalities were found for self- rated health, pain or ache, limiting long- standing illness, physical health functioning, angina symptoms, and circulatory diseases. Physical or mental workload did not account for these inequalities. Inequalities were non- existent or slightly reversed for GHQ- 12 mental well- being, SF- 36 mental health functioning and mental problems. Conclusion: Expected occupational class inequalities in health among both women and men were found for global and physical health but not for mental health. The observed inequalities could not be attributed to physical or mental workload.

Computer database searches of peer-reviewed literature published between 1993 and 2005 and manual reviews of 20 journals were used to identify research on the link between employee health and performance. Data was extracted to summarize the overall findings on the magnitude of health problems addressed by health promotion and disease prevention programmes, and the impact of interventions on improving health risk, reducing health care cost, and improving worker performance. From this summary, major conclusions on early detection of disease, the impact of behaviour change programmes were drawn. This systematic review is supplemented with a case study description of a preliminary evaluation of a corporate wellness programme in a major international organization. The influence of developments in work/family issues, complementary and alternative medicine, and quality of care and health outcomes research are briefly discussed. Finally, a conceptual framework for studying the impact of health and productivity is described.

J	Taffa, N; Chepngeno, G; Amuyunzu-Nyamongo, M				Taffa, N; Chepngeno, G; Amuyunzu-Nyamongo, M			Child morbidity and healthcare utilization in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS			English	Article							DIARRHEAL DISEASE; GLOBAL PROBLEM; COMMUNITY; MAGNITUDE; EQUITY	Rapid urbanization and inequitable distribution of social services in African cities significantly contribute to the current deterioration of child health indicators in the region. Determinants of child morbidity and healthcare utilization among slum residents in Nairobi City, Kenya were assessed. Using a morbidity surveillance system, we visited 1691 households every 90 days for 9 months and registered 696 children below 5 years. 264 (37.9 per cent) children were reported to have been sick or injured at least once during the study period. A total of 447 illness episodes were reported among the 264 children (an average of 1.7 episodes per child). Cough, fever, diarrhea, skin problems and eye diseases made up the top five causes of morbidity. Child age below 1 year (OR = 2.7; 95 per cent CI = 1.33, 5.49) and having a working-mother (OR = 2.0; 95 per cent CI = 1.19, 3.31) were significantly associated with child morbidity report. About half of the mothers sought proper medical care for their sick children mostly from health institutions located outside the slum. Healthcare seeking within the slum heavily relied on informal private clinics. Working mothers sought medical care more often than non-working mothers (OR = 0.29; 95 per cent CI = 0.12, 0.7) and infants got priorities compared to older sick children (OR = 0.2; 95 per cent CI = 0.05, 0.83). We conclude that maternal engagement in non-formal low-paying jobs might in the long-run have a questionable gain in child survival among slum residents.

J	Choi, BCK				Choi, BCK			An international comparison of women's occupational health issues in the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore: the CIDA-SEAGEP study	OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD			English	Article						developed countries; developing countries; occupational health; women's health issues; workplace	RISK-FACTORS; SHIFT WORK; GENDER; HOUSEWORK; BURDEN	Background An international comparison study of women's occupational health issues was carried out in 2000 for the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. The study was funded by the Canadian International Development Agency's Southeast Asia Gender Equity Program. Aim The objective was to compare the issues, risk factors, social determinants, and challenges in women's occupational health, according to the status of economic development as defined by the World Bank. Method Data were collected through 27 key informant interviews of high-ranking government officials and senior researchers, self-administered questionnaires on country or regional statistics and 16 courtesy calls. Results Results indicated that women's occupational health problems common in these countries or regions included women's long hours of work (double workday), shift work and a caring role for family and friends. Problems reported in developing countries but not developed countries included poor access to training and protective equipment, and insufficient legislation to protect women's rights. Problems reported in developed countries but not in developing countries included obesity, smoking and not including women in health research Conclusion This paper provides insights into the changing environment in the workplace, such as increasing participation of women in the paid workforce and changes in gender differences due to the changing country economy, for improving women's occupational health.

Although largely preventable, many people across the world still suffer unnecessarily from the pain and discomfort associated with oral diseases. In addition, the costs of dental treatment are high, both to the individual and to society. Effective evidence-based preventive approaches are needed to address this major public health problem. The aim of this paper is to outline public health strategies to promote oral health and reduce inequalities. An extensive collection of public health policy documents produced by WHO are reviewed to guide the development of oral health strategies . In addition a range of Cochrane and other systematic reviews assessing the evidence base for oral health interventions are summarized, Public health strategies should tackle the underlying social determinants of oral health through the adoption of a common risk approach. Isolated interventions which merely focus on changing oral health behaviours will not achieve sustainable improvements in oral health, Radical public health action on the conditions which determine unhealthy behaviours across the population is needed rather than relying solely on the high-risk approach. Based upon the Ottawa Charter, a range of complementary strategies can be implemented in partnership with relevant local, national and international agencies. At the core of this public health approach is the need to empower local communities to become actively involved in efforts to promote their oral health.

J	Pfeiffer, J				Pfeiffer, J			Commodity <i>Fetichismo</i> the holy spirit, and the turn to pentecostal and African independent churches in central Mozambique	CULTURE MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Mozambique; Pentecostalism; African Independent Churches; traditional healing; structural adjustment	WITCHCRAFT; MOVEMENT; POVERTY	Pentecostal and African Independent Churches have rapidly spread throughout central Mozambique in the aftermath of war and in the midst of a recent structural adjustment program that has hastened commoditization of community life and intensified local inequalities. This extraordinary expansion signals a shift away from reliance on "traditional" healers to treat persistent afflictions believed to have spiritual causes. Survey data and illness narratives collected from recent church recruits and local residents during research in 2002 and 2003 in the city of Chimoio reveal that healers have increased fees and tailored treatments to clients searching for good fortune in ways that have alienated many other help seekers in this changing social environment. While traditional healing has been celebrated in the international health world, community attitudes are less generous; many healers are increasingly viewed with suspicion because of their engagement with malevolent occult forces to foment social conflict, competition, and confrontation for high fees. Church healing approaches offer free and less divisive spiritual protection reinforced by social support in a new collectivity. One vital source of church popularity derives from pastors' efforts to tap the already considerable community anxiety over rising healer fees and their socially divisive treatments in an insecure environment.

This country has a strong tradition of top-down public administration, and health professionals, trade unions and the general public are all uneasy about the idea of introducing market forces and privatising public health provision. The main reforms discussed in this article were based on planning, rationalisation, cost-containment, efficiency and equity. However, some embryonic changes and emerging practices can be detected which might seem to relate to the 'new public management' approach, and which could also serve as a basis for future market initiatives.

J	Maynard, A				Maynard, A			European health policy challenges	HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						health care reform; policy evaluation; incentives; outcome measurement; health inequalities	CARE; MANAGEMENT; MEDICINE	Few countries are immune to the international health care 'virus' of reform, with many countries regularly re-cycling changes that shift costs and benefits in ways that are arbitrary, inefficient and offer short term political palliation. Much of this activity has little evidence base and reveals lack of clarity in defining public policy goals, establishing trade-offs and aligning incentive structures with these objectives. Well established failures in health care delivery systems such as variations in medical practice and continuing absence of systematic outcome measurement, have persisted for decades as nations grapple inefficiently with recurring problems of expenditure inflation and waiting times. The lack of emphasis on evidence to inform the efficient management of chronic disease and the reduction of health inequalities is a product of perverse incentives and managerial inertia that maintains the incomes of powerful interest groups.

J	Schokkaert, E; Van de Voorde, C				Schokkaert, E; Van de Voorde, C			Health care reform in Belgium	HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						health care reform; Belgium	RISK ADJUSTMENT; SERVICES; EQUITY; DEMAND; MARKET; EUROPE	Curbing the growth of public sector health expenditures has been the proclaimed government objective in Belgium since the 1980s. However, the respect for freedom of choice for patients and for therapeutic freedom for providers has blocked the introduction of microeconomic incentives and quality control. Therefore - with some exceptions, particularly in the hospital sector - policy has consisted mainly of tariff and supply restrictions and increases in co-payments. These measures have not been successful in curbing the growth of expenditures. Moreover, there remains a large variation in medical practices. While the structure of health financing is relatively progressive from an international perspective, socioeconomic and regional inequalities in health persist. The most important challenge is the restructuring of the basic decision-making processes; i.e. a simplification of the bureaucratic procedures and a re-examination of the role of regional authorities and sickness funds.

We propose that the positive point towards which international researchers should strive is engagement. We define engagement as the polar opposite of exploitation. Engagement occurs when researchers and people in resource-poor communities work together in a just way to improve the health of the host community and to decrease unfair health inequalities.

Many other countries also have an increasing number of ESRD cases. Racial/ethnic disparities have been documented globally in the prevalence, incidence, and treatment of CKD, most extensively in the United States, but also in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, among others. In many circumstances, these disparities are of a negative nature, that is, certain racial/ethnic groups fare worse than their white counterparts with respect to the treatment or outcome of CKD. However, in a few circumstances, they are of a positive nature, such as the survival advantage seen in minorities with ESRD compared with whites. The reasons for racial disparities in the prevalence, incidence, and treatment of CKD are not fully understood, although they are explained partly by coexisting medical conditions and modifiable risk factors, such as socioeconomic, lifestyle, and cultural. It is likely, however, that the complete picture incorporates a complex interaction between these sociocultural, genetic, and environmental factors. In a global society that prides itself on a high level of sensitivity and equality, there is an ethical and moral imperative to address the continuing racial/ethnic disparities in CKD and many of the factors underlying this epidemic. We review data highlighting the racial/ethnic disparities that exist in the incidence and treatment of CKD, with particular emphasis on ESRD. A better understanding of both the negative and positive racial/ethnic disparities may yield important insights, which can inform future research strategies and improve health outcomes for all patients afflicted with CKD.

Both series drew attention to the nearly 11 million annual deaths of children under the age of five years, and to the fact that almost 4 million of these deaths occur in the first month of life. We show that two thirds of these deaths could be prevented through universal coverage with existing, low-cost interventions that are failing to reach most children in the world. The series also highlighted the importance of reducing inequities both between and within countries. The relevance of these series to Latin America and the Caribbean is examined. Although substantial progress has been made in reducing mortality and improving coverage, two major challenges remain: how to improve the quality of health interventions, and how to reach the most disadvantaged children in the Latin American and Caribbean Region.

Significant health inequalities linked to social (dis)advantage rather than to inherent biological differences are generally considered unfair or inequitable. Such health inequities are the main object of health development efforts, including global targets such as the Millennium Development Goals, which require monitoring to evaluate progress. However, most national health information systems (HIS) lack key information needed to assess and address health inequities, namely, reliable, longitudinal and representative data linking measures of health with measures of social status or advantage at the individual or small-area level. Without empirical documentation and monitoring of such inequities, as well as country-level capacity to use this information for effective planning and monitoring of progress in response to interventions, movement towards equity is unlikely to occur. This paper reviews core information requirements and potential databases and proposes short-term and longer term strategies for strengthening the capabilities of HIS for the analysis of health equity and discusses HIS-related entry points for supporting a culture of equity-oriented decision-making and policy development.

Most studies of sociobehavioural risk factors in dental caries have been carried out in industrialized countries, but such reports from low- and middle-income countries have been published in recent years. World Health Organization international collaborative studies and other international studies of social factors in dental caries using the same methodology provide empirical evidence of social inequality in oral health across countries and across oral health care systems. The paper highlights the challenges to dental public health practice, particularly the importance of risk assessment in estimating the potential for prevention. In future public health programmes, systematic risk factor assessment may therefore be instrumental in the planning and surveillance of oral health promotion and oral disease intervention programmes.

J	Pandey, J; Singh, P				Pandey, J; Singh, P			Social psychology in India: Social roots and development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review							ALLOCATION; PERFORMANCE; STEREOTYPES; ATTRACTION; RECIPIENTS; ATTITUDES; RESOURCE; BEHAVIOR; REWARD; CASTE	Although applied practical knowledge of social behaviours can be traced to the rich Indian intellectual traditions in philosophy, religious texts, social-political treatises and reform movements from the ancient period, the scientific social psychology in India began in the 1920s mostly as a borrowed discipline from the West. This article reviews briefly the historical background of psychology as a scientific discipline from the founding of the first university departments at Calcutta in 1916, Mysore in 1924, and Patna in 1946. Soon after independence in 1947, the discipline slowly but widely expanded in universities and in research, technology, and management institutes throughout the country. Some early classical studies on rumour, group influences, and prejudice not only appeared in the international literature, but also influenced theoretical developments in the West. One widely cited example is Leon Festinger's use of Indian rumour transmission research in the development of cognitive dissonance theory. Later research has been influenced by the social and cultural milieu as well as national priorities. Dominant thematic areas of research have been identified. These include: attitude, prejudice, and intergroup relations; social motives and development; social influence processes; poverty, deprivation, and social justice; environment and behaviour; health beliefs and behaviour; and social values and development. Over the years social psychology in India has witnessed serious debates regarding the nature of the discipline and research methodology. These debates have centred on issues related to relevance, indigenization, and cultural appropriateness of the discipline. Such discussions are aimed at giving social psychology a distinctive look and making it more "social". Some of these concerns are shared by social psychologists in other countries. Social psychology is and will be a prolific discipline in India as it fits with the democratic sociopolitical context that promotes and facilitates the agenda for social research. Some challenges and concerns that would make social psychology more socially and culturally relevant are discussed.

J	Bellorin-Font, E; Pernalete, N; Meza, J; Milanes, CL; Carlini, RG				Bellorin-Font, E; Pernalete, N; Meza, J; Milanes, CL; Carlini, RG			Access to and coverage of renal replacement therapy in minorities and ethnic groups in Venezuela	KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						access to RRT; inequity in RRT; RRT in minority group	DISEASE; INDIANS	Numerous studies have documented the presence of racial and minority disparities regarding the impact of renal disease and access to renal replacement therapy (RRT). This problem is less well documented in Latin America. Venezuela, like most countries in the region, is subject to severe constraints in the allocation of resources for high-cost chronic diseases, which limits the access of patients with chronic kidney disease to RRT. Although access to health care is universal, there is both a deficit in coverage and disparity in the access to RRT, largely as a result of socioeconomic limitations and budget constrains. With current rising trends of the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and costs of medical technology, the long-term goal of complete RRT coverage will become increasingly out of reach. Current evidence suggests that prevention of progression of renal disease is possible at relatively low cost and broad coverage. Based on this evidence, the Ministry of Health has redesigned its policy with respect to renal disease based on 4 elements: 1. Prevention by means of early detection and referral to multidisciplinary health teams, as well as promotion of health habits in the community. 2. Prevention of progression of renal disease by pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic means. 3. An increase in the rate of coverage and reduction of disparities in the access to dialysis. 4. An increase in the rates of renal transplantation through better organ procurement programs and reinforcement of transplant centers. However, the projected increase in the number of patients with ESKD receiving RRT will represent a serious burden to the health care system. Therefore, implementation of these policies will require the involvement of international agencies as well as an adequate partnership between nephrologists and health care planners, so that meeting the increasing demands of ESKD programs may be balanced with other priorities of our national health system.

Gender differences were also analysed. Data from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions for the years 1998 and 1999 were analysed. Employed 20-64-year olds with a registered wage were included (nearly 6000 respondents). Sex-specific logistic regressions in relation to global self-rated health were applied. Those in the lowest income quintile had 2.4 times (men) and 4.3 times (women) higher probability of less than good health than did those in the highest quintile (adjusted for age, family status, country of birth, education level, smoking and full-time work). The mediating contribution of work environment factors to the health gradient by income was 25 per cent (men) and 29 per cent (women), respectively. This contribution was observed mainly from ergonomic and physical exposure, decision authority and skill discretion. Psychological demands did not contribute to such inequalities because mentally demanding work tasks are more common in high income as compared with low income jobs. Using sex-specific income quintiles, instead of income quintiles for the entire sample, gave very similar results. In conclusion, work environment factors can be seen as important mediators for the association between wage income and ill health in Sweden. A larger residual effect of income on health for women as compared with men suggests that one's own income from work is a more important determinant of women's than men's ill health in Sweden.

J	Yamin, AE				Yamin, AE			The right to health under international law and its relevance to the United States	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							LESSONS; CARE	In recent years, there have been considerable developments in international law with respect to the normative definition of the right to health, which includes both health care and healthy conditions. These norms offer a framework that shifts the analysis of issues such as disparities in treatment from questions of quality of care to matters of social justice. Building on work in social epidemiology, a rights paradigm explicitly links health with laws, policies, and practices that sustain a functional democracy and focuses on accountability. In the United States, framing a well-documented problem such as health disparities as a "rights violation" attaches shame and blame to governmental neglect. Further, international law offers standards for evaluating governmental conduct as well as mechanisms for establishing some degree of accountability.

DATA SOURCES: Information was gathered from presentations and discussions at the Ministerial Summit on Health Research conducted in Mexico City November 16-20, 2004. DATA SYNTHESIS: Strategies to strengthen health systems through closer collaboration between researchers and policy makers were debated. Consideration was given to persisting inequalities in health research, including the 10/90 gap (10% of health research expenditure is devoted to diseases responsible for 90% of the world's disease burden), the "know-do" gap (the gap between research knowledge and professional practice), and the divide in access to health information. Adopting measures to address human resource shortages was seen as critical. Participants at the Summit issued "The Mexico Statement on Health Research." CONCLUSIONS: All stakeholders must develop the political will to share information, resources, and experiences to ensure that practice research and public policy develop in accordance with patients' needs.

J	Bennett, S; Chanfreau, C				Bennett, S; Chanfreau, C			Approaches to rationing antiretroviral treatment: ethical and equity implications	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article						antiretroviral therapy, highly active/ethics/utilization; health care rationing/ethics/methods/organization and administration; health services accessibility/ethics; eligibility determination/utilization; patient selection/ethics; health policy; policy making; health expenditures; socioeconomic factors; Mexico; Senegal; Thailand; Uganda		Despite a growing global commitment to the provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART), its availability is still likely to be less than the need. This imbalance raises ethical dilemmas about who should be granted access to publicly-subsidized ART programmes. This paper reviews the eligibility and targeting criteria used in four case-study countries at different points in the scale-up of ART, with the aim of drawing lessons regarding ethical approaches to rationing. Mexico, Senegal, Thailand and Uganda have each made an explicit policy commitment to provide antiretrovirals to all those in need, but are achieving this goal in steps - beginning with explicit rationing of access to care. Drawing upon the case-studies and experiences elsewhere, categories of explicit rationing criteria have been identified. These include biomedical factors, adherence to treatment, prevention-cl riven factors, social and economic benefits, financial factors and factors driven by ethical arguments. The initial criteria for determining eligibility are typically clinical criteria and assessment of adherence prospects, followed by a number of other factors. Rationing mechanisms reflect several underlying ethical theories and the ethical underpinnings of explicit rationing criteria should reflect societal values. In order to ensure this alignment, widespread consultation with a variety of stakeholders, and not only policy-makers or physicians, is critical. Without such explicit debate, more rationing will occur implicitly and this may be more inequitable. The effects of rationing mechanisms upon equity are critically dependent upon the implementation processes. As antiretroviral programmes are implemented it is crucial to monitor who gains access to these programmes.			4800 Montgomery Lane, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.	sara_bennett@abtassoc.com		bennett, sara/0000-0001-8094-8798					24	37	43	0	2	WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION	GENEVA 27	MARKETING AND DISSEMINATION, CH-1211 GENEVA 27, SWITZERLAND	0042-9686	1564-0604		B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN	Bull.

J	Sagar, AD				Sagar, AD			Alleviating energy poverty for the world's poor	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						biomass; climate change; sustainable development; equity		Improving energy services for poor households in developing countries remains one of the most pressing challenges facing the development community. The dependence of these households on traditional forms of energy leads to significant health impacts as well as other major disbenefits, yet there has been little progress in meeting this challenge. This viewpoint argues for an 'energy-poverty alleviation' fund to help provide modern energy services to these households. It also proposes an approach through which to create such a fund, namely by introducing an incremental levy on petroleum. Notably, this scheme does not need a global agreement since a levy could be introduced by major oil-exporting countries. The implementation of this mechanism would result in a climate-friendly outcome (even before taking into account the elimination of products of incomplete combustion resulting from the traditional household use of biomass-based fuels) while providing immense socio-economic benefits to the world's poor. Such an approach would allow significant progress on the sustainable development front while reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore is very much consistent with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Why Turkish work migrants return from Germany	JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES			English	Article						Germany; Turkey; socio-economic status; ethnicity; return migration	MORTALITY; INEQUALITIES; IMMIGRANTS	In the 1960s and 1970s, hundreds of thousands of Turkish workers migrated to Germany. Some settled there, others returned to Turkey after a few years. To explore how the experience of life between two cultures and in transnational families affected the decision to return, we conducted focus-group sessions with male returnees in Turkey who had spent varying lengths of time in Germany. Return was rarely based on purely economic or health-related motives; value-oriented and emotional themes almost always played a role. There were complex interactions between particular themes, e.g. perceived health status and economic success. We organised our findings into three 'ideal types': first, the I nostalgic' returned migrant who is facing socio-economic problems in Turkey and has a transfigured notion of life in Germany which he would like to but cannot resume; second, the 'cultural traditionalist' who considers Turkish culture superior and left Germany without remorse after having made some money; and third, the 'player of two systems' who thrives in both Turkey and Germany. This typology helps to structure and understand the complex themes underlying the decision to return-migrate.

Neurosurgery began at the hospital with the arrival of an American neurosurgyeon to train Nepalese surgeons locally and, later, the return of these Nepalese surgeons to Kathmandu after subsequent fellowship training in the United States. This article traces the origins of neurosurgery in Nepal, outlines the specialty's development in Kathmandu at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital during the past decade from international education strategies, and describes the status of and challenges facing the provision of neurosurgical care in Nepal.

We propose a concept of effective coverage as the probability that individuals will receive health gain from an intervention if they need it. Understanding the extent to which health systems are delivering key interventions to those who will benefit from them and the factors that explain gaps in delivery are a critical input to decision-making at the local, national and global levels. We develop an integrated conceptual framework for monitoring and analyzing the delivery of high-quality interventions to those who need them. This framework can help clarify the inter-relationships between notions of access, demand for care, utilization, and coverage on the one hand and highlight the requirements for health information systems that can sustain this type of analysis. We discuss measurement strategies and demonstrate the concept by means of a simple simulation model. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We undertook a systematic review to investigate the geographical dispersion of and time trends in publication for policy-relevant information about children's health and to assess associations between the availability of reliable data and poverty. Methods We identified data available on Jan 1, 2001, and published since 1980, for the major causes. of morbidity and mortality in young children. Studies with relevant,data were assessed against a set of inclusion criteria to identify those likely to provide unbiased estimates of the burden of childhood disease in the community. Findings Only 308 information units from more than 17 000 papers identified were regarded as possible. unbiased sources for estimates of childhood disease burden. The geographical distribution of these information units revealed a pattern of small well-researched populations surrounded by large areas with little available information. No reliable population-based data were identified from many of the world's poorest countries, which account for about a third of all deaths of children worldwide. The number of new studies diminished over the last 10 years investigated. Interpretation The number of population-based studies yielding estimates of burden of childhood disease from less developed countries was low. The decreasing trend over time suggests reductions in research investment in this sphere. Data are especially sparse from the world's least developed countries with the highest child mortality. Guidelines are needed for the conduct of burden-of-disease studies together with an international research policy that gives increased emphasis to global equity and coverage so that knowledge can be generated from all regions of the world.

Method Data were abstracted from multiple sources and collated and tabulated. Results The dental health of the majority of British children has improved dramatically since the early 1970s. Twelve-year-old children now have on average less than one decayed, missing (extracted) or filled tooth. Levels of dental decay in UK children at 5 and 12 years are among the lowest in the world. There are still marked inequalities in the dental decay experience of children between the territorial regions of the UK, high and low socio-economic groups, and regular and symptomatic dental attenders. Many children in areas of deprivation are either not motivated to seek dental treatment or experience barriers in obtaining it. In parallel with improvements in the dental health of the majority of children, the proportion of UK adults who have no natural teeth has fallen from 37% to 12% over the past four decades. Total tooth loss is now confined almost entirely to individuals over 45 years of age. Most of the improvements in children's dental health are attributable to environmental factors, in particular the widespread availability of fluoride containing toothpastes since the 1970s. There are clear benefits from fluoridation of public water supplies over and above those attributable to other factors. Conclusions The findings suggest initiatives should be directed to bringing children from deprived backgrounds under the umbrella of dental care. To help alleviate the inequalities in dental health, water fluoridation should be implemented, in urban industrial areas in particular, where levels of dental decay are still unacceptably high.

The objective of this work was to analyse inequalities on global mortality and on mortality due to specific causes according to occupation in a historical cohort of males from the province of Navarra, Spain. Methods: The base population for this historical cohort comprised all employed men over age 34 from Navarra in the 1986 population register. Age-standardised point estimates and confidence intervals for occupational-specific mortality risks were computed. Results: There exist differences in mortality risks with respect to the overall risk of Navarra in certain occupational activities for several major causes of mortality. Some of the results corroborate previous findings in other works, such as the significant high risk that presents in leather, clothing workers and shoemakers when analysing kidney, bladder and other urinary malignant tumours, while others present a certain degree of novelty. Conclusion: This work contributes to filling the gap in the lack of works on occupational mortality in Spain. It also complements the information that other monitoring systems may provide on occupational health.

Methods: Deaths of men and women older than 30 years from transportation injuries were studied. Rate differences and rate ratios (RR) between high and low educational level rates were obtained. Results: Among men, those of low educational level had higher death rates in all settings, a pattern that was maintained in the different settings; no inequalities were found among women. Among men, in all the settings, the RR was higher in the 30 - 49 age group ( RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.61) than in the age groups 50 - 69 and >= 70 years, a pattern that was maintained in the different settings. For women for all the settings together, no differences were found among educational levels in the three age groups. In the different settings, only three had a high RR in the youngest age group, Finland ( RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.74), Belgium ( RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.67), and Austria ( RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.96). Conclusion: This study provides new evidence on the importance of socioeconomic inequalities in transportation injury mortality across Europe. This applies to men, but not to women. Greater attention should be placed on opportunities to select intervention strategies tailored to tackle socioeconomic inequalities in transportation injuries.

J	McMichael, C; Waters, E; Volmink, J				McMichael, C; Waters, E; Volmink, J			Evidence-based public health: what does it offer developing countries?	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						deprivation; inequalities in health; mortality	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; MALARIA CONTROL; DISEASE; BURDEN	The global burden of disease and illness is primarily situated in developing countries. As developing countries have limited resources, it is particularly important to invest in public health and health promotion strategies that are effective. Systematic reviews are central to evidence-based public health and health promotion practice and policy. This paper discusses issues surrounding the relevance of evidence-based public health and systematic reviews to the health of developing countries. It argues that there is a lack of systematic reviews relevant to the health priorities of developing countries; many interventions reviewed can not be implemented in resource-poor situations; and, a limited amount of primary research is conducted in developing countries. The paper further argues that improvements in public health are determined not only by effective health services and interventions, but through an approach that includes other sectors and influences broader structural and systematic barriers to health. Given the social complexity of human development, and the inter-sections amongst different development goals, there is no question that gains in developing country public health are unlikely to emerge from systematic reviews alone, but will require decisions about inter-sectoral collaboration and social policy initiatives. Nonetheless, evidence around intervention effectiveness has an important role to play in addressing health priorities in developing countries and resource-poor areas. The public health evidence base urgently needs strengthening, with dedicated effort towards increasing the relevance of primary evidence and systematic reviews.

Subjects and methods: Data are derived from a population-based study in Malmo, Sweden. This included baseline laboratory testing and a self-administered questionnaire. The question on global SRH was answered by 15,590 men ( mean age 46.4 years) and 10,089 women (49.4 years). Social background characteristics ( occupation, marital status) were based on data from national censuses. Mortality was retrieved from national registers. Results: At screening 4,261 (27.3%) men and 3,085 (30.6%) women reported poor SRH. Among subjects rating their SRH as low, 1,022 ( 24.0%) men and 228 (7.4%) women died during follow-up. Corresponding figures for subjects rating their SRH as high were 1801 (15.9%) men and 376 (5.4%) women. An analysis of survival in subjects reporting poor SRH revealed an age-adjusted hazard risk ratio (HR, 95% CI) for men HR 1.5 (1.4 - 1.7), and for women HR 1.4 ( 1.2 - 1.6). The corresponding HR after adjusting for possible social confounders was for men HR 1.3 (1.1 - 1.4), and women HR 1.1 (0.9 - 1.4). When additional adjustment was made for biological risk factors the association for men was still significant, HR 1.2 ( 1.1 - 1.3). Conclusion: Poor SRH predicts increased long-term mortality in healthy, middle-aged subjects. For men the association is independent of both social background and selected biological variables. The adjustment for biological variables can be questioned as they might represent mediating mechanisms in a possible causal chain of events.

J	Ferng, JJ				Ferng, JJ			Local sustainable yield and embodied resources in ecological footprint analysis - a case study on the required paddy field in Taiwan	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						ecological footprint; embodied resources; hybrid-units input-output model; local sustainable yields; Paddy field	INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; SOIL QUALITY; ENERGY-COST; WHEAT; APPROPRIATION; INDICATORS; COMPONENT; SCIENCE; SYSTEM; HEALTH	Since the 1990s, ecological footprint (EF) analysis has been employed to discuss two important dimensions of sustainable development, intra- and inter-generational equity, from the perspective of ecosystem appropriation. When examining the equality of resource use among generations in the EF analysis, sustainable yield plays a crucial role; however, its value is assumed to be the same as that of average industrial yield, which does not reflect differential productivity and its value can be much higher than the sustainable one through over-exploitation practices. The estimated EF, as well as ecological deficits, would be underestimated, from which false policy implications could be drawn. Through a review of the literature on the relationships between yield, soil quality, and fanning practices, this paper suggests adopting a yield potential ranking system that was established by the government in Taiwan in 1991 through an 8-year field study. This ranking system served as a proxy for local sustainable yield in estimating the required paddy fields in Taiwan in 1996 under two scenarios. Scenario (1) concerned the required paddy fields for supporting the direct and indirect consumption of rice by Taiwan residents; Scenario (11) explored the additional area of paddy fields that would be needed when the food energy from cereals is provided exclusively by rice and the importing of rice is not possible. The results were then compared with the estimates when the average industrial yield of 1996 was used. A hybrid-units input-output modeling method was used to estimate the rice contained in manufactured products. The results of the scenario analysis shed light on the importance of preserving Taiwan's existing paddy fields for the sake of maintaining stable long-term food supply. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The developed world is experiencing an 'epidemic' of childhood obesity but little is known about the prevalence of obesity, or underweight, amongst adolescents from minority ethnic groups in the UK. An understanding of the prevalence of obesity and overweight in these populations is important since some ethnic groups may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse health effects associated with obesity. Study Objectives. To examine levels of extreme obesity, obesity, overweight and underweight amongst a representative sample of adolescents from different ethnic groups in East London and to explore the association between socio-economic status and body mass index (BMI). Design. A school-based survey of adolescents aged 11-14. Obesity and overweight were estimated using the 1990 UK growth reference (UK 90) and the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) cut-off points. Extreme obesity was defined as a BMI more than three SD above the UK 90 mean. Underweight was examined by looking at those with a BMI below the 15th or the 5th UK 90 percentiles. Main Results. A total of 2,482 adolescents were surveyed (response rate 84%), 73% from non-white ethnic groups. Although there were significant differences in BMI between ethnic groups, high levels of overweight were seen in all ethnic groups. More than one-third were overweight and one-fifth were obese using the UK 90; and over a quarter were overweight and almost one-tenth were obese using the IOTF cut-offs. Two per cent were extremely obese. Indian males were at higher risk of being overweight than white British males. The Prevalence of obesity and overweight was similar in white British and Bangladeshi males. Overall the prevalence of underweight was slightly lower than that predicted by the UK 90, but South Asian ethnic groups, especially males, had a higher prevalence of underweight than other groups. No associations between BMI and measures of socio-economic status were found in this relatively deprived population. Conclusions. The 'epidemic' of childhood obesity observed in the UK involves adolescents from all ethnic groups, although there are some differences between ethnic groups in the prevalence of overweight. Indian males appear to be at increased risk of being overweight. There is no evidence of a simultaneous increase in underweight amongst this population overall, but Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani boys appear to be at increased risk of being underweight.

J	Raftery, J; Roderick, P; Stevens, A				Raftery, J; Roderick, P; Stevens, A			Potential use of routine databases in health technology assessment	HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT			English	Review							CORONARY-ARTERY SURGERY; SOUTH-EAST ENGLAND; GENERAL-PRACTICE; CANCER REGISTRY; DATA ADEQUATE; PRESCRIBING COSTS; ORGAN-RETRIEVAL; BREAST-CANCER; MANAGEMENT; CARE	Objectives: To develop criteria for classifying databases in relation to their potential use in health technology ( HT) assessment and to apply them to a list of databases of relevance in the UK. To explore the extent to which prioritised databases could pick up those HTs being assessed by the National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment (NCCHTA) and the extent to which these databases have been used in HT assessment. To explore the validation of the databases and their cost. Data sources: Electronic databases. Key literature sources. Experienced users of routine databases. Review methods: A 'first principles' examination of the data necessary for each type of HT assessment was carried out, supplemented by literature searches and a historical review. The principal investigators applied the criteria to the databases. Comments of the ` keepers' of the prioritised databases were incorporated. Details of 161 topics funded by the NHS R&D Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme were reviewed iteratively by the principal investigators. Uses of databases in HTAs were identified by literature searches, which included the title of each prioritised database as a keyword. Annual reports of databases were examined and ` keepers' queried. The validity of each database was assessed using criteria based on a literature search and involvement by the authors in a national academic network. The costs of databases were established from annual reports, enquiries to ` keepers' of databases and ` guesstimates' based on cost per record. For assessing effectiveness, equity and diffusion, routine databases were classified into three broad groups: ( 1) group I databases, identifying both HTs and health states, ( 2) group II databases, identifying the HTs, but not a health state, and ( 3) group III databases, identifying health states, but not an HT. Group I datasets were disaggregated into clinical registries, clinical administrative databases and population-oriented databases. Group III were disaggregated into adverse event reporting, confidential enquiries, disease-only registers and health surveys. Results: Databases in group I can be used not only to assess effectiveness but also to assess diffusion and equity. Databases in group II can only assess diffusion. Group III has restricted scope for assessing HTs, except for analysis of adverse events. For use in costing, databases need to include unit costs or prices. Some databases included unit cost as well as a specific HT. A list of around 270 databases was identified at the level of UK, England and Wales or England ( over 1000 including Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Allocation of these to the above groups identified around 60 databases with some potential for HT assessment, roughly half to group I. Eighteen clinical registers were identified as having the greatest potential although the clinical administrative datasets had potential mainly owing to their inclusion of a wide range of technologies. Only two databases were identified that could directly be used in costing. The review of the potential capture of HTs prioritised by the UK's NHS R&D HTA programme showed that only 10% would be captured in these databases, mainly drugs prescribed in primary care. The review of the use of routine databases in any form of HT assessment indicated that clinical registers were mainly used for national comparative audit. Some databases have only been used in annual reports, usually time trend analysis. A few peer-reviewed papers used a clinical register to assess the effectiveness of a technology. Accessibility is suggested as a barrier to using most databases. Clinical administrative databases ( group Ib) have mainly been used to build population needs indices and performance indicators. A review of the validity of used databases showed that although internal consistency checks were common, relatively few had any form of external audit. Some comparative audit databases have data scrutinised by participating units. Issues around coverage and coding have, in general, received little attention. NHS funding of databases has been mainly for 'Central Returns' for management purposes, which excludes those databases with the greatest potential for HT assessment. Funding for databases was various, but some are unfunded, relying on goodwill. The estimated total cost of databases in group I plus selected databases from groups II and III has been estimated at pound 50 million or around 0.1% of annual NHS spend. A few databases with limited potential for HT assessment account for the bulk of spending. Conclusions: Suggestions for policy include clarification of responsibility for the strategic development of databases, improved resourcing, and issues around coding, confidentiality, ownership and access, maintenance of clinical support, optimal use of information technology, filling gaps and remedying deficiencies. Recommendations for researchers include closer policy links between routine data and R&D, and selective investment in the more promising databases. Recommended research topics include optimal capture and coding of the range of HTs, international comparisons of the role, funding and use of routine data in healthcare systems and use of routine database in trials and in modelling. Independent evaluations are recommended for information strategies ( such as those around the National Service Frameworks and various collaborations) and for electronic patient and health records.

Methods and Findings We examined age-standardized mean population levels of body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol in relation to national income, food share of household expenditure, and urbanization in a cross-country analysis. Data were from a total of over 100 countries and were obtained from systematic reviews of published literature, and from national and international health agencies. BMI and cholesterol increased rapidly in relation to national income, then flattened, and eventually declined. BMI increased most rapidly until an income of about I$5,000 (international dollars) and peaked at about I$12,500 for females and I$17,000 for males. Cholesterol's point of inflection and peak were at higher income levels than those of BMI (about I$8,000 and I$18,000, respectively). There was an inverse relationship between BMI/cholesterol and the food share of household expenditure, and a positive relationship with proportion of population in urban areas. Mean population blood pressure was not correlated or only weakly correlated with the economic factors considered, or with cholesterol and BMI. Conclusions When considered together with evidence on shifts in income-risk relationships within developed countries, the results indicate that cardiovascular disease risks are expected to systematically shift to low-income and middle-income countries and, together with the persistent burden of infectious diseases, further increase global health inequalities. Preventing obesity should be a priority from early stages of economic development, accompanied by population-level and personal interventions for blood pressure and cholesterol.

J	Davey, C				Davey, C			Sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United Kingdom at ICPD+10	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						gender equality; family planning services; adolescents; sex education; sexually transmitted infections; HIV; United Kingdom		At the mid-point of the Programme of Action of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, we reviewed the situation in the UK in key areas. In recent years, greater attention has been paid to sexual health at a national policy level, including strategies on teenage pregnancy and sexual health, but there is Still G long way to go. The low against female genital mutilation has been strengthened, twice as many men attend family planning clinics as ten years ago, access to abortion services funded by the National Health Service has improved substantially, up to 80% of contraceptive advice and care is accessed through general practice, a notional screening programme for chlamydia is being rolled out, the age of consent has been equalised for men and women and for heterosexuals and homosexuals, and new recommended Standards for sexual health and HIV services have been developed. However, many family planning services do not involve young men, waiting times for on abortion are too long, the abortion low has never been extended to Northern Ireland, and there are rising rates of STIs and HIV Rapid improvements in sexuality education, training and improved resources for family planning and abortion providers and the re-introduction of national public information campaigns about all aspects of sexual health are all required.

J	Hessini, L				Hessini, L			Global progress in abortion advocacy and policy: An assessment of the decade since ICPD	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						abortion law and policy; abortion providers and services; reproductive rights; advocacy and political process; International Conference on Population and Development	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; TAMIL-NADU; LAW REFORM; POLITICS; REALITY; BRAZIL	The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action represented a positive step toward legitimising abortion as a component of basic reproductive health services. This paper reviews how the ICPD principles and recommendations have been applied in the post decade toward increasing women's access to affordable, safe and legal abortion services. It examines advocacy efforts to increase understanding of abortion among policymakers and the public, policy and action at the global level, progress made in national-level policies and services, and obstacles encountered. Research and advocacy are helping to break the silence globally about unsafe abortion, and there is on emerging global movement supporting women's right to safe abortion. A great deal has been accomplished in the ten short years since ICPD, in spite of serious setbacks in some countries and continuing obstacles. A synthesis of public health and rights-based approaches, and strategic partnerships with other social justice movements are called for, as a foundation for effective legal reform efforts and to ensure that women hove access to Safe abortion services.

This ethnic division is considered a salient dimension of social stratification, shaping the two groups of elders' pathways through life. The results showed that Taiwanese elders experience a disproportionate burden on the two measures of health in part because of their lower socioeconomic status (SES). Also, Taiwanese elders are more likely to develop adverse health transitions than their Mainlander counterparts, and variations in perceptions of chronic illnesses may exist across ethnicity. The results suggest that both ethnicity and SES play important roles in linking social status to health status among this cohort of elders. Ethnicity and SES affect health collectively, and different components of SES may not confer the same health benefits across ethnic groups.

J	Sanford, S; Ali, SH				Sanford, Sarah; Ali, S. Harris			The New Public Health Hegemony: Response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto	SOCIAL THEORY & HEALTH			English	Article						hegemony; surveillance; risk; morality; security; SARS	DISEASE; REFLECTIONS; POLITICS; RISK	The 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak presented a challenging period for public health in Toronto. Many old and new public health measures were implemented at local, national and global levels, in an attempt to control the outbreak of the disease. Among these, surveillance mechanisms dominated, which involved new epidemiological techniques and statistical profiling strategies. In this paper, Gramsci's concept of hegemony is used to further understandings of public health governance during the outbreak of emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, the function of the discourse of 'risk' in public health governance is examined, along with public health as a 'moral agent' in the naturalization of specific public health measures. In addition, the pervasive discourse of 'security' is discussed in relation to current public health practices. These characteristics of public health are examined with consideration of their potential for propagating social exclusion and stigmatization of individuals and communities. The specific case of SARS in Toronto is used to examine the implications of public health as a mechanism for social control and reproduction rather than the promotion of equality in health throughout the population.

We therefore examined the shape of the relationship between household equivalent income and self-assessed health in seven European countries. Methods Data were obtained from nationally representative health, level of living, or similar surveys in Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, The Netherlands, and Norway and applied to men and women aged 25 years and older in the 1990s. Smooth nonparametric curves were fitted to the data, as well as a spline regression function with three linear pieces connected by two knots. Results A higher household equivalent income is associated with better self-assessed health among men and women in all countries, particularly in the middle-income range. In the higher income ranges, the relationship is generally curvilinear and characterized by less improvement in self-assessed health per unit of rising income. In the lowest income ranges, the relationship is found to be curvilinear in four countries (Belgium, Finland, The Netherlands, and Norway), where the usual deterioration of health associated with lower incomes levels off or even reverses into an improvement. Conclusions Further research is necessary to investigate the background of differences between countries in the shape of the relationship between income and self-assessed health, and should focus an both methodological and substantive explanations. Assuming causality, the results of our study lend some support to the notion of decreasing marginal health returns of a unit increase in income at the higher income ranges.

The general aim of this article is to determine whether inequalities in self-assessed health in 10 European countries showed a general tendency either to increase or to decrease between the 1980s and the 1990s and whether trends varied among countries. Methods Data were obtained front nationally representative interview surveys held in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England, The Netherlands, West Germany, Austria, Italy, and Spain. The proportion of respondents with self-assessed health less than 'good' was measured in relation to educational level and income level. Inequalities were measured by means of age-standardized prevalence rates and odds ratios (ORs). Results Socioeconomic inequalities in self-assessed health showed a high degree of stability in European countries. For all countries together, the ORs comparing low with high educational levels remained stable for men (2.61 in the 1980s and 2.54 in the 1990s) but increased slightly for women (from 2.48 to 2.70). The ORs comparing extreme income quintiles increased from 3.13 to 3.37 for men and from 2.43 to 2.86 for women. Increases could be demonstrated most clearly for Italian and Spanish men and women, and for Dutch women, whereas inequalities in health in tie Nordic countries showed no tendency to increase. Conclusions The results underscore the persistent nature of socioeconomic inequalities in health in modern societies. The relatively favourable trends in the Nordic countries suggest that those countries' welfare states were able to buffer many of the adverse effects of economic crises on the health of disadvantaged groups.

This paper aims to give the first international overview for several common chronic diseases. Methods Micro-level data were pooled from non-standardized national health surveys conducted in eight European countries in the 1990s. Surveys ranged in size from 3700 to 41 200 participants. The prevalence of 17 chronic disease groups were analysed in relation to education. Standardized prevalence rates and age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. Results Most diseases showed higher prevalence among the lower education group. Stroke, diseases of the nervous system, diabetes, and arthritis displayed relatively large inequalities (OR > 1.50). No socioeconomic differences were evident for cancer, kidney diseases, and skin diseases. Allergy was snore common in the higher education group. Relative socioeconomic differences were often smaller among the 60-79 age group as compared with the 25-59 age group. Cancer was more prevalent among the lower educated in the 25-59 age group, but among the higher educated in the 60-79 age group. For diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, socioeconomic differences were larger among women as compared with men. Inequalities in heart disease were larger in northern European countries as compared with southern European countries. Conclusion There are large variations between chronic diseases in the size and pattern of socioeconomic differences in their prevalence. The large inequalities that are found for same specific fatal diseases (e.g. stroke) and noel-fatal diseases (e.g. arthritis) require special attention in equity-oriented research and policies.

J	Pollard, I				Pollard, I			Bioscience-bioethics and life factors affecting reproduction with special reference to the Indigenous Australian population	REPRODUCTION			English	Review							DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; INFANT-DEATH-SYNDROME; RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; DRUG-ABUSE; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE; PRETERM BIRTH; WHITEHALL-II; STRESS; HEALTH	The demand for equality of recognition or respect is the dominant passion of modernity. The 20th century experienced a giant leap in technological inventiveness and ruthless use of technological power. In the 21st century, human welfare and environmental wellbeing demand fundamental political appraisal. We have the means, if we choose, to eradicate poverty and to responsibly protect the global environment. However, economic, political and cultural systems act to differentially allocate the benefits and risks for growth between socioeconomic groups. For example, it is a matter of pride that the neonatal mortality rate in affluent societies has dropped substantially since the late 1970s. However, the level of infant mortality (three times the national average) and low birthweight (13%) among the Indigenous Australian population is the highest in the country. With hindsight we now know that is the inevitable legacy of Australia's colonial history. Chronic physical and psychological stress is recognized as an important etiological factor in many lifestyle diseases of the cardiovascular, immune and reproductive systems. Diseases of adaptation are further advanced by non-adaptive lifestyle choices, depression, alcoholism and other drug dependencies. This review describes the principles of bioscience ethics and targets equity issues as they affect human reproduction across generations with particular reference to the Indigenous population of Australia. The review also considers ways we may advance global and cultural maturity from the Indigenous Australian perspective and proposes an ecologically based model of preventative care. If we are to embrace fundamental social change and protect future children without threatening parents' basic freedoms, then new beliefs and priorities - based on a compassionate understanding of biological systems - must evolve from the general public. Belief in human rights arising from a sense of human dignity is a collective outcome originating from individual commitment. The golden rule; that is, Nature's principle of reciprocity, is fundamental in bridging the gap between knowledge and effective action.

Methods: The study was carried out in 96 administrative districts of the municipality of Sao Paulo in the period 1994-2002. Mortality data were collected from the Program for Improving Local Mortality Data and from population estimates based on the 1991 and 2000 census of the State System DataAnalysis (SEADE) Institute and the Municipal Department of Planning. The indicators were obtained from the city map of exclusion (1996 and 2000). Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's correlation test (at 5% level). Results: A signficant positive correlation was seen among men between AIDS mortality and the district life quality; index from 1994 to 1998 (p < 0.05). Among women, a significant negative correlation (p<0.05) was seen for the whole study period between AIDS mortaliy; and the equity index, which measures the proportion of illiterate women who are family heads. From 2000, it was also observed a significant negative correlation (p < 0.05) among women between AIDS mortality and the global social exclusion index. Conclusions: The study results suggest a shaft of AIDS mortality to exclusion areas and might indicate a relationship between AIDS mortality and socioeconomic factors. Further epidemiological and social sciences studies arc needed to investigate these associations.

J	Marmot, M				Marmot, M			Social determinants of health inequalities	LANCET			English	Article							MORTALITY	The gross inequalities in health that we see within and between countries present a challenge to the world. That there should be a spread of life expectancy of 48 years among countries and 20 years or more within countries is not inevitable. A burgeoning volume of research identifies social factors at the root of much of these inequalities in health. Social determinants are relevant to communicable and non-communicable disease alike. Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy. As a response to this global challenge, WHO is launching a Commission on Social Determinants of Health, which will review the evidence, raise societal debate, and recommend policies with the goal of improving health of the world's most vulnerable people. A major thrust of the Commission is turning public-health knowledge into political action.

J	Mold, F; Fitzpatrick, JM; Roberts, JD				Mold, F; Fitzpatrick, JM; Roberts, JD			Minority ethnic elders in care homes: a review of the literature	AGE AND AGEING			English	Review						minority ethnic elders; care homes; health and social care	PEOPLE	Background: health and social care services are required to provide quality service provision to meet all older people's needs, including any needs specific to minority ethnic groups. The heterogeneity of the population, however, highlights the need to offer a range of services that reflect people's language, cultural and religious differences. Objectives: this paper reviews the literature concerned with minority ethnic elders in care homes. Methods: systematic searches were conducted using the following online databases: Web of Science, Pub Med, Sociological Abstracts, Social Sciences Index, AMED, British Nursing Index, Medline, PsycInfo and CINAHL. Independent reviewers undertook a structured assessment of each piece of literature. Data extraction and analysis were in accordance with established methods. Findings: the literature has been classified into two key areas. First, issues arising from international literature, including factors relating to access, equality and workforce issues, care satisfaction and placement decision-making. The second area focuses on the issues emerging from the UK literature. Issues of particular concern include barriers to care provision for minority ethnic older people, loss of independence and the recognition of cultural needs. Conclusion: the review indicates how problems remain in ensuring the delivery of best-quality long-term care to ethnic elders in care homes. The review also highlights the absence of studies focusing on the perception of care from residents' perspectives and their involvement in making placement and care decisions.

Its purposes are to provide an overview of homelessness research and to stimulate discussion on strategic directions for research. We identified studies on homelessness, with an emphasis on Canadian research. Studies were grouped by focus and design under the following topics: the scope of homelessness, the health status of homeless persons, interventions to reduce homelessness and improve health, and strategic directions for future research. Key issues include the definition of homelessness, the scope of homelessness, its heterogeneity, and competing explanations of homelessness. Homeless people suffer from higher levels of disease and the causal pathways linking homelessness and poor health are complex. Efforts to reduce homelessness and improve health have included biomedical, educational, environmental, and policy strategies. Significant research gaps and opportunities exist in these areas. Strategic research will require stakeholder and community engagement, and more rigorous methods. Priorities include achievement of consensus on measuring homelessness, health status of the homeless, development of research infrastructure, and ensuring that future initiatives can be evaluated for effectiveness.

J	Sepehri, A; Chernomas, R; Akram-Lodhi, H				Sepehri, A; Chernomas, R; Akram-Lodhi, H			Penalizing patients and rewarding providers: user charges and health care utilization in Vietnam	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Vietnam; user charges; health care utilization; supplier-induced demand	SECTOR REFORM; CHINA; EQUITY; COUNTRIES; ECONOMICS; INSURANCE; SERVICES; POOR; COST	The introduction of a comprehensive system of user charges in 1995 provided public health facilities in Vietnam, especially hospitals, with a growing source of revenue. By 1998 revenues from user charges accounted for 30% of public hospital revenues. Increasingly, provider incomes have relied on fee revenues and provision-based bonuses, the effect of which is that a poorly regulated fee-for-service system has replaced a salary system based upon a centrally determined global budget. This paper examines the potential influence of providers' on the use of publicly provided health services. Using facility-based data over the period 1996-98, the relative contribution of treatment intensity is compared and contrasted under the two sources of hospital revenues from patients, namely a user charge system and a third party payment system based on fee-for-services. The primary focus of the comparison is on the treatment intensity for all hospital contacts, hospital admissions and the length of hospital stays, decisions normally taken by the providers and over which patients have little or no influence. The results indicate that growth in patient revenues was associated with large increases in intensity. The growth in intensity was more pronounced in the case of inpatient contacts. Moreover, both the admission rate and the length of hospital stay were far higher for better off individuals than for the poor, and greater for the insured than the uninsured. The increase in the intensity of hospital care for both health insurance enrollees and the uninsured can be seen as, among other things, an attempt on the part of providers to increase revenue from health insurance premiums and user charges in the face of a shrinking share of public resources allocated to hospitals, and low wages and salaries.

J	Jones, M				Jones, M			Can international law improve mental health? Some thoughts on the proposed convention on the rights of people with disabilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article								This paper examines the promise of the proposed Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities to improve the position of people with mental illness. Proponents of the new Disability Convention argue that the state of human rights abuses experienced by people with disabilities is intolerable, that the existing international law is inadequate, that additional international law will increase the visibility of people with disabilities and will clarify the fundamental entitlement to equality, and that, as a result, the position of people with disabilities will be greatly enhanced. This paper questions the value of international law to achieve real change and warns against placing too much faith in the law. The potential of a new international law to rectify the wrongs experienced by people with psychiatric disabilities will depend on whether the new law specifically displaces the existing international law which undermines the rights of people with mental illness and on the final terms of the Convention with respect to recognition and enforcement. Ironically, it is the process of developing the Convention which has been empowering, and the utility of the new law will ultimately turn on the continuation of the momentum built through this process.

Disparities in health and health care in the U.S. pale when global facts are considered. Although U.S. citizens ought to be concerned about the worse off in the U.S., such concern ultimately must be balanced against the urgent imperative to address the plight of those in poor countries.

We analysed 2,802 original articles published in 1952, 1962, 1972, 1982, 1992 and 2002 in five of the high impact factor journals, namely (i) Acta Tropica, (ii) American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, (iii) Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, (iv) Leprosy Review, and (v) Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Authors' country affiliations were categorized according to the human development index 2003 (HDI), with stratification into low, medium and high HDI. We observed the following trends: First, there was a strong increase in the number of articles published from 250 in 1952 to 726 in 2002. Second, over the same time span, the median number of authors per article increased from I (four journals) or 2 (American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene) to 2.5 (Leprosy Review) up to 6 (Acta Tropica and American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene). Third, research collaborations between countries of different HDI ranks increased concomitantly - in 2002, 19.4-43.7% of all manuscripts comprised authors from different HDI countries - indicating that tropical medicine has become a global endeavour. However, in four of the five journals investigated, the overall percentage of researchers affiliated with low HDI countries decreased over the past 50 years and only a slight positive trend can be observed over the last decade. Concluding, current roadblocks should be identified and programmes designed and implemented to enhance equity of publishing in tropical medicine. This in cum might be an important step forward to substantially reduce the current burden of tropical diseases, so that social and economic development in the tropics and subtropics can be advanced and poverty alleviated.

The obligations of sponsors to ensure that participants have access to antiretrovirals have been a particular focus of this debate. This paper presents three arguments that have been made in this regard, and some of their limitations, in anticipation of HIV vaccine trials in South Africa. The first argument is that HIV risk behaviour increases in such trials, and HIV infection can be viewed as a research-related injury, justifying sponsor provision of treatment on grounds of compensation for harm. We conclude that risk-behaviour studies to date do not show general increases in risk behaviour that could constitute the basis for a general obligation. Participation may well adversely impact on risk behaviour for some individuals, and conceivably this could be demonstrated. This argument may, therefore, have merit at the individual level; however, it seems a weak platform from which to argue that sponsors should treat all HIV infections acquired during trials. The second argument is that treatment should be provided based on distributive justice. We conclude that traditional concepts of "distributive justice" in research appear limited in justifying obligations of sponsors to ensure access to antiretrovirals. Further, using research initiatives to reduce global health care inequities is controversial, and even proponents may disagree about the fairest use of finite resources. The third argument is that sponsors should ensure antiretroviral access on grounds of beneficence; namely, the maxim that if one can do something beneficial without sacrificing anything of comparable significance, it ought to be done. Thus, sponsors should provide more interventions than those minimally required to conduct the research. However, beneficence may demand levels of altruism that exceeds what is reasonable. While the latter arguments may provide stronger justifications than the first, it is difficult to use these arguments to establish that sponsor provision of antiretrovirals to infected individuals is obligatory.

We investigate the empirical foundations for these expectations in recent social science research. Consistent evidence indicates that health and demographic benefits result from educational expansion, and suggests that education enhances, but does not ensure, individuals' economic security. However, the impact of educational expansion on growth remains debated, and decades of sociological studies offer evidence that educational expansion does not necessarily narrow social inequalities. Finally, considerable controversy surrounds the implications of educational expansion for democratization. Reasonable forecasts of the consequences of further educational expansions need to consider the diverse social contexts in which these expansions will occur. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Using survey data for as many countries as possible, we estimated the relative risk association between income or assets and risk factors at the individual level within 11 medium- and low income subregions of WHO. WHO and The World Bank data on the prevalence of risk factors and income poverty (defined as living on < US$100 per day, US$ 1-2.00 per day and > US$ 2.00 per day) were analysed to:impute the association between poverty and risk factors for each subregion. The possible effect of poverty reduction on the prevalence of risk-factors was, estimated using population-attributable risk percentages. Findings There were strong, associations between poverty and malnutrition among children, having access only to unsafe water and sanitation, and being exposed to indoor air pollution within each subregion (relative risks were twofold to threefold greater for those living on < US$ 1.00 per day compared with those living on > US$ 2.00 per day). Associations between poverty and obesity, tobacco use and alcohol use varied across subregions. If everyone living on < US$ 2.00 per day had the risk factor profile of those living on > US$ 2.00 per day, 51% of exposures to unimproved water and sanitation could be avoided as could 37% of malnutrition among children and 38% of exposure to, indoor air pollution, The more realistic, but still challenging, Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people living on < US$ 1:00 per day would achieve much smaller reductions. Conclusion To achieve large gains in global health requires both poverty eradication and public health action. The methods used in this study maybe useful for monitoring pro-equity progress towards Millennium Development Goals.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups design, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 6-week treatments: phenytoin (n = 7), carbarnazepine (n = 7), valproate (n = 7), or placebo (n = 8). The efficacy measure was the average aggression score, a global severity index from the Overt Aggression Scale (J. M. Silver & S. C. Yudofsky, 1991). Analysis showed a significant reduction in impulsive aggression during all 3 anticonvulsant conditions compared with placebo. However, the treatment effect during carbamazepine administration was slightly delayed compared with phenytoin and valproate. These findings suggest that increased use of anticonvulsants could make a significant impact in the control of impulsive aggression in both mental health and criminal Justice settings.

J	Fredriksen-Goldsen, KI				Fredriksen-Goldsen, KI			Multigenerational health, development, and equality	GERONTOLOGIST			English	Article						social work education; multigenerational framework; life span perspective	INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION	Purpose: Because of the significant aging of the global population, world regions are experiencing an increase in the number of generations within families. However, to date most practice methods in the health and human services are explicitly organized by age. This article discusses a multigenerational practice approach and the impact of an infusion strategy to integrate multigenerational practice into social work education. Design and Methods: A required first-year MSW course was targeted for concentrated infusion of multigenerational content cutting across substantive areas. To compare students' perceptions and needs prior to and following the infusion of multigenerational content, students were surveyed, and mean scores were compared between the two time periods. Results: Although the majority of social work practitioners work in multigenerational settings, most have received training that has been fragmented by age and relevant to only one stage of the life course. The vast majority of students endorsed multigenerational issues as important to social work in general and to their own professional careers. Following the infusion of multigenerational content, students' knowledge and skills in multigenerational practice increased significantly. Implications: A multigenerational practice framework honors the contributions, needs, and requirements of each generation as well as interdependence among generations. This approach prepares social work practitioners for practice, policy, and research that are more clearly relevant to the changing nature of the 21st century.

J	Wilson, DP; Blower, SM				Wilson, DP; Blower, SM			Designing equitable antiretroviral allocation strategies in resource-constrained countries	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; MODELS; HIV; TRANSMISSION; HIERARCHIES; DYNAMICS; SPREAD; ACCESS	Background Recently, a global commitment has been made to expand access to antiretrovirals (ARVs) in the developing world. However, in many resource-constrained countries the number of individuals infected with HIV in need of treatment will far exceed the supply of ARVs, and only a limited number of health-care facilities (HCFs) will be available for ARV distribution. Deciding how to allocate the limited supply of ARV's among HCFs will be extremely difficult. Resource allocation decisions can be made on the basis of many epidemiological, ethical, or preferential treatment priority criteria. Methods and Findings Here we use operations research techniques, and we show how to determine the optimal strategy for allocating ARVs among HCFs in order to satisfy the equitable criterion that each individual infected with HIV has an equal chance of receiving ARVs. We present a novel spatial mathematical model that includes heterogeneity in treatment accessibility. We show how to use our theoretical framework, in conjunction with an equity objective function, to determine an optimal equitable allocation strategy (OEAS) for ARVs in resource-constrained regions. Our equity objective function enables us to apply the egalitarian principle of equity with respect to access to health care. We use data from the detailed ARV rollout plan designed by the government of South Africa to determine an OEAS for the province of KwaZulu-Natal. We determine the OEAS for KwaZulu-Natal, and we then compare this OEAS with two other ARV allocation strategies: (i) allocating ARVs only to Durban (the largest urban city in KwaZulu-Natal province) and (ii) allocating ARVs equally to all available HCFs. In addition, we compare the IDEAS to the current allocation plan of the South African government (which is based upon allocating ARVs to 17 HCFs). We show that our OEAS significantly improves equity in treatment accessibility in comparison with these three ARV allocation strategies. We also quantify how the size of the catchment region surrounding each HCF, and the number of HCFs utilized for ARV distribution, alters the OEAS and the probability of achieving equity in treatment accessibility. We calculate that in order to achieve the greatest degree of treatment equity for individuals with HIV in KwaZulu-Natal, the ARVs should be allocated to 54 HCFs and each HCF should serve a catchment region of 40 to 60 km. Conclusion Our OEAS would substantially improve equality in treatment accessibility in comparison with other allocation strategies. Furthermore, our OEAS is extremely different from the currently planned strategy. We suggest that our novel methodology be used to design optimal ARV allocation strategies for resource-constrained countries.

However, there is an inequitable distribution of services, with many rural areas being poorly resourced. This is partly as a result of the historical inequalities prevalent in the South African society of the past; efforts are being made to address this. EMS training is provided at basic, intermediate and advanced levels. The advanced level of training is comparable with the best in the world. Emergency care practitioners are registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa and are thereby subject to the regulations, scope of practice and disciplinary structures of the Council. Response times vary from 15 min in sophisticated urban systems to 40 min or longer in some rural services. Emergency departments (ED) are very busy, usually overloaded with patients, often poorly resourced and are similar to "Casualty Departments" that existed in the UK in the past. Facilities, staff and equipment are variable, and until recently there has been no formal career structure for emergency doctors. The introduction of emergency medicine as a new full speciality in 2004 will transform emergency care in Southern Africa, and appropriate training programmes are already being developed, together with progressive upgrading of emergency departments. EMS personnel face a vast spectrum of clinical cases, particularly all forms of trauma. Recent improvements in organisation, education and resources, coupled with better distribution of services, upgraded emergency departments and the development of emergency medicine as a speciality, should provide a significant boost for emergency care for the community.

Injuries are overlooked as contributors to global inequities in health, yet the long-term disabilities they frequently produce represent a significant burden. The Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health convened a panel of experts in trauma and injury from the United States and low- and middle income nations to identify research gaps in this area and opportunities to create new knowledge. Panel members identified sustainable programs of research established through stable linkages between institutions in high-income nations and those in low- and middle income nations as a priority. The resulting benefits of addressing the growing burden of trauma and injury to communities in resource-constrained settings around the world would be substantial.

While there were offenders for whom neither treatment was effective, a majority in both groups decreased jail days and improved psychosocial functioning, with MHTC participants demonstrating greater gains in most areas. The impact of implementing the MHTC on community practices, and the value of integrating criminal justice and mental health systems, is discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These factors include the huge, still growing, and aging population, rapid economic growth, ongoing industrialization and urbanization, environmental and health concerns at local, regional and global level. Against such background analysis, the article explores the potential and constraints of non-fossil fuel, fuel-switching to natural gas, economy restructuring and clean coal technology in mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and ensuring energy supply in China. The authors reiterate the importance of improving energy efficiency in China and discuss how to integrate renewable energy into rural development. The article concludes with an in-depth discussion about redefining development goals, the equity issue in climate change process, and the linkage with sustainable development.

J	Vijayakumar, L; Nagaraj, K; Pirkis, J; Whiteford, H				Vijayakumar, Lakshmi; Nagaraj, K.; Pirkis, Jane; Whiteford, Harvey			Suicide in developing countries (1) - Frequency, distribution, and association with socioeconomic indicators	CRISIS-THE JOURNAL OF CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION			English	Article						suicide; epidemiology; rates; developing countries	INDIA	Objective. Suicide is a global public health problem, but relatively little epidemiological investigation of the phenomenon has occurred in developing countries. This paper aims to (1) examine the availability of rate data in developing countries, (2) provide a description of the frequency and distribution of suicide in those countries for which data are available, and (3) explore the relationship between country-level socioeconomic factors and suicide rates. It is accompanied by two companion papers that consider risk factors and preventive efforts associated with suicide in developing countries, respectively. Method. Using World Health Organization data, we calculated the average annual male, female, and total suicide rates during the 1990s for individual countries and regions (classified according to the Human Development Index [HDI]), and examined the association between a range of socioeconomic indicators and suicide rates. Results. For reasons of data availability, we concentrated on medium HDI countries. Suicide rates in these countries were variable. They were generally comparable with those in high HDI countries from the same region, with some exceptions. High education levels, high telephone density, and high per capita levels of cigarette consumption were associated with high suicide rates; high levels of inequality were associated with low suicide rates. Conclusion. Epidemiological investigations of this kind have the potential to inform suicide prevention efforts in developing countries, and should be encouraged.

Here, we focus on a large infrastructure development in sub-Saharan Africa, namely the Chad-Cameroon petroleum development and pipeline project. We adapted a five-step process for HIA, consisting of (1) screening of project documents, (2) profiling of affected communities, (3) identifying priority health areas, predicting potential impacts, and proposing mitigation measures, (4) implementing interventions, and (5) monitoring and evaluation of health impacts. We found that project scoping was broad, including extensive environmental and social assessments. Innovative features of the project include the high degree of public-private partnerships, and the management of oil revenues for purposes of poverty reduction. The project also addressed occupational and public health issues, and developed and implemented measures to prevent or mitigate potential health impacts. However, there was a disproportionate emphasis on workers' health, particularly on the prevention/mitigation of construction-related injuries, sexually transmitted infections (STIs; mainly HIV/AIDS), and malaria. Health impacts among surrounding communities, and cumulative health impacts in the larger region were not considered in a comprehensive way. Concluding, there is a need for a more systemic approach to HIA and its incorporation within 'Equator Principles', which are increasingly adopted by the international financial community. This' process would include clarification of corporate social responsibility beyond the project fence line in the mitigation of health problems at regional levels. Finally, we propose the establishment and running of a longitudinal demographic surveillance system, which-coupled with regular household surveys-would facilitate monitoring and evaluation of impacts on health, social wellbeing and equity in the broadest possible manner.

The second part of the paper examines in some detail the Chilean and Colombian reforms, the two countries that have implemented closely the principles of the neoliberal reform. The two case studies confirm that neoliberal reforms do not improve quality of care, equity, and efficiency. In the discussion the authors identify the beneficiaries of the reforms: transnational corporations, consultant firms, and the World Bank's staff. The recognition of the beneficiaries helps to explain some of the reasons behind the Word Bank continuing pressures to implement neoliberal health reforms in spite the growing evidence of their failures.

J	Katz, A				Katz, A			The Sachs report: Investing in health for economic development - Or increasing the size of the crumbs from the rich man's table? Part II	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health report (Sachs report of 2001) has been heralded as inspiring and groundbreaking and is being adopted as the blueprint for global health policymaking. This article argues that the report is deeply conservative and unoriginal. It encourages medico-technical solutions to public health problems; it ignores macroeconomic determinants and other root causes of both poor health and poverty; it reverses public health logic and history; it is based on a set of flawed assumptions; it reflects one particular economic perspective to the exclusion of all others; and it recommends greater amounts of charity while preserving the status quo of a deeply unjust and irrational international economic order. Wishful thinking and ideology are presented as established facts to legitimize globalization, and health is conceived primarily as an input to productivity rather than as a human right. The benefits that would result from simple, macroeconomic measures directed toward social justice and the meeting of basic needs are incomparably greater than those that would result from following CMH recommendations in terms of sustainable improvements in both health and economic well-being. The ultimate source of poor health status and miserable living conditions is the extreme concentration of power, nationally and internationally, in the hands of the few.			15 Chemin Passeur, CH-1219 Aire, Switzerland.	alison.katz@bluewin.ch							58	13	14	0	4	SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD	LONDON	1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND	0020-7314	1541-4469		INT J HEALTH SERV	Int.

J	Duffy, L				Duffy, L			Suffering, shame, and silence: The stigma of HIV/AIDS	JANAC-JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF NURSES IN AIDS CARE			English	Article						gender; health promotion; HIV/AIDS; poverty; social justice; stigma; suffering		HIV/AIDS, especially in the context of poverty, results in considerable suffering. The issues surrounding prevention, transmission, and mitigation are complex, but one very important concept sustaining the epidemic is stigma. This article examines the meaning of stigma in the literature and through the experience of people living in a high-prevalence area. An ethnographic study in rural Zimbabwe, where approximately one third of adults are infected, revealed how stigma, suffering, shame, and silence are mutually supporting concepts that challenge health promotion efforts. For a reduction in HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality rates, there is a need to understand and act on contextual issues such as stigma with increased political and social commitment at local, national, and international levels. Nurses and other health care professionals need to be involved to ensure public policy and local interventions are aimed at enhancing supportive environments and reducing suffering.

J	Craig, P; Forbes, J				Craig, P; Forbes, J			Social position and health: are old and new occupational classifications interchangeable?	JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SELF-RATED HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION; MORTALITY DIFFERENCES; HEART-DISEASE; INEQUALITIES; WOMEN; INDICATORS; CHILDHOOD; INCOME; MEN	There is growing international interest in the choice of socioeconomic indicators for health research. This study used a combination of standard and novel methods to compare three occupation-based measures of social position in terms of their ability to explain variation and measure inequality in self-assessed health. The recently developed National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification (NS-SEC) is compared with its predecessor, the Registrar General's Social Class schema (RGSC), and with another occupation-based measure, the Cambridge Social Interaction and Stratification Scale (CAMSIS). With data from two large, independent, nationally representative samples of adults aged 16-64 living in private households in Scotland, logistic regression models are used to compare the classifications' ability to predict self-assessed health. Concentration indices are estimated to compare how well they capture inequality in self-assessed health. The study shows that all three classifications are strongly associated with self-assessed health, though the associations are heavily attenuated by adjustment for one another and for other measures of social position. Despite their differing theoretical bases, the three are closely related. No evidence is found that any of them systematically under- or overstate the extent of inequality in self-assessed health in either men or women, and the extent to which they measure independent dimensions of social inequality is questioned. It is concluded that the availability of the new classifications is unlikely to transform our understanding of the extent or the causes of socioeconomic inequality in health, but provides useful opportunities for sensitivity analysis.

This paper addresses the overall standard of health care ( SOC) that should be provided to research participants in developing countries, rather than the narrow definition of SOC that has characterised the international debate on standards of health care. It argues that contributing to sustainable improvements in health by progressively ratcheting the standard of care upwards for research participants and their communities is an ethical obligation of those in resource-rich countries who sponsor and implement research in poorer ones.

J	Bobrik, A; Danishevski, K; Eroshina, K; McKee, M				Bobrik, A; Danishevski, K; Eroshina, K; McKee, M			Prison health in Russia: The larger picture	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Russia; prisons; mortality; tuberculosis; HIV	MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; INJECTING DRUG-USERS; MORTALITY; DEATH; DETENTION; DOMINANCE; COMMUNITY; DISEASE; SYSTEM; JAILS	Russia, despite recent legal reforms, still has one of the highest rates of imprisonment in the world. There are many reports of the adverse conditions in Russian prisons, often highlighting the consequences for health, in particular, risks of HIV, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases. However, there are no reviews of the broader health issues in the Russian penal system. This paper reviews the available information on the health of the imprisoned population in Russia and the factors underlying it. It was undertaken by means of a search of Russian and international literature, including unpublished sources, supplemented by in-depth interviews with 27 key informants from the Ministry of justice, prison administration, and non-governmental organizations. Published and unpublished data from the ministries of health and justice were used to describe the demographic characteristics of the imprisoned population and compare it with the general population. Although convicts are drawn disproportionately from disadvantaged groups in society and are detained in adverse physical conditions, the standardized mortality ratio from all causes is slightly over one-third of that in the overall Russian male population. This is mainly explained by an eight-fold lower mortality from external causes and a more than two-fold lower mortality from cardiovascular disease. These far outweigh the increased mortality from infectious diseases. The chances of survival of young men in Russia may actually be improved by being in prison, highlighting the need for policies that reduce the overall level of violence and other external risks, such as dangerous driving habits, in Russian society. Yet while conditions are improving in Russian prisons, with death rates falling, there are still many avoidable deaths and high levels of mental illness and infectious disease. There is also much that is not known about the health of Russian convicts, with what is available reflecting what is measured rather than what is important.

J	Baghdadi, G				Baghdadi, G			Gender and medicines: An international public health perspective	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH			English	Article								Despite outstanding progress in the area of medicines, their access and use have not been equitable throughout the world. Fifteen percent of the world's population consumes 91% of the world's production of pharmaceuticals. Only one third of the world population has access to essential medicines. Additionally, studies carried out in developing countries reveal that gender-related barriers in access to health services and medicines are greater for women than men because of social and cultural factors. In high-income settings, women are reported to use more medicines than men. Moreover, the current devastating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic impacts women disproportionately. Women are more vulnerable to HIV infection than men biologically but also because of gender inequalities. More social and statistical data, in both developing and developed countries, are needed to fully understand the impact of gender on access to and use of medicines. Improving access to essential medicines will be possible only if countries introduce a gender perspective in their medicine policies.

J	Hardon, A; Blume, S				Hardon, A; Blume, S			Shifts in global immunisation goals (1984-2004): unfinished agendas and mixed results	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						immunisation; health policy; health inequity; globalisation; public-private partnership	PRIMARY-HEALTH-CARE; QUALITY	The turn of the millennium has been marked by a large-scale mobilisation of resources for immunisation programmes in developing countries. The resources have been generated by public and private sector parties collaborating in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). GAVI was formed in response to deteriorating immunisation coverage rates occurring in the late 1990s. GAVI is the latest in a line of vaccine initiatives, which have operated over the past 20 years. This article reviews the five most important global immunisation initiatives that have taken place over those past 20 years. It analyses their origins, shifts in global immunisation goals, identifies key actors, assesses the initiatives capacity to mobilise resources and increase immunisation coverage, and points to possible unintended effects of the initiatives. The study argues that shifts in global immunisation goals lead to fragmentation in the implementation of vaccine programmes at the local level in developing countries. It also suggests that global actors involved in the formulation of these initiatives appear to miss opportunities to build on past experiences and fail to learn from previous mistakes. This raises questions about the initiatives' sustainability and relevance to the overall objective of preventing vaccinepreventable deaths. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The findings of this review on previous reviews and on the availability, process, and outcomes of QCT are summarized. The review found that previous, anglophone reviews have tended to present positive outcomes front QCT, but that there are some problems with this research. QCT is increasingly available internationally, but may be applied at different stages of the criminal justice process, and to different types of offender. Research on the process of QCT is comparatively rare. The available research does suggest problems of system integration between criminal justice and treatment agencies in implementing QCT. The research in languages other than English shows a wider range of outcomes (including negative affects) for QCT than was found in the English literature. We conclude that the international literature shows that QCT does not inevitably produce worse outcome that? voluntary treatment, but that we need more multimethod, multisite studies of QCT in order to inform policy and practice, which is currently being made in the absence of reliable evidence in many countries.

In this work, we propose a new approach to allocate resources with equity as a tool for decision-making in planning. The grade of equity in resource allocation in decentralized management medical areas (DMMAs (AMGD, for its initials in Spanish)) was determined; these are limited geographical areas of a social security institution in three states of the northeastern region of Mexico. The areas with more health needs in the global index were DMMA no. 12 in Tamaulipas with a Z-score (ZS) of -5; area no. 3 in Coahuila with -4; and area no. 9 in Nuevo Leon, no. 16 and no. 17 in Tamaulipas with -2. Equity was measured according to the degree of concordance between the health needs index and the per capita health expenditure of each area: (r = 0.19, P > 0.05). Low concordance was found between these variables in the studied medical areas. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bonu, S; Rani, M; Razum, O				Bonu, S; Rani, M; Razum, O			Global public health mandates in a diverse world: the polio eradication initiative and the expanded programme on immunization in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						national immunization days; polio eradication program; EPI; social inequities; sub-Saharan Africa; South Asia	VACCINATION; CAMPAIGNS; COVERAGE; IMPACT	Background: The circulation of wild poliovirus is expected to cease soon due to the success of the global polio eradication initiative. Thereafter, intensified polio eradication efforts such as National Immunisation Days (NIDs) will most likely be discontinued. As a consequence, the expanded programme on immunization (EPI) will no longer enjoy extra inputs from the polio eradication initiative. We investigated whether today's EPIs are ensuring universal and equitable vaccine coverage; and whether the removal of extra inputs associated with the implementation of NIDs is likely to affect EPI coverage and equity. Methods: Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 15 countries of South Asia and Africa during 1990-2001, we examined absolute levels of EPI coverage; changes in EPI coverage after the introduction of NIDs; and relative coverage according to urban versus rural residence, higher versus lower education of mothers, and wealthiest vs. poorest population segment. Results: Polio and non-polio antigen coverage increased in seven countries during the study period. Substantial inequalities in coverage of non-polio antigens persist, however, translating into inequities in the risk of contracting vaccine preventable diseases. In some African countries, routine EPI coverage and/or equity declined during the study period. In these countries, any positive effect of NIDs on the EPI coverage must have been small, relative to the negative effects of declining economies or deteriorating health systems. In Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Malawi, even polio coverage declined, in spite of the introduction of NIDs. Conclusion: As additional inputs associated with polio eradication will cease, routine EPI services need to be strengthened substantially in order to maintain levels of population immunity against polio and to improve social equity in the coverage of non-polio EPI antigens. Our findings imply that this aim will require additional inputs, particularly in African countries. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

(2) The 1996-2001 population information for the cities, counties and townships in Taiwan, abstracted from the Taiwan-Fukien Demographic Fact Book. Study Design. Longitudinal, using the autocorrelation model. Principal Findings. Results indicated decline in dental care utilization, particularly after the implementation of dental global budgeting. With few exceptions, dental global budgeting did not improve the distribution of dental care and dentist supply. Conclusions. The experience of the dental global budget program in Taiwan suggested that dental global budgeting might contain dental care utilization and that several conditions might have to be met in order for the reimbursement system to have effective redistributive impact on dental care and dentist supply.

This study investigates the correlates and psychological outcomes of domestic abuse among women in a semi-industrial country. The participants included 215 mothers residing in working-class communities located on the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. We utilized structural equation modeling to test the hypothesis that poverty and other structural inequalities would be related to incidents of domestic abuse in Chile, as they are in the United States. Our results suggest that lower socioeconomic status, even within poor communities, and stressful life events have a direct relationship to domestic conflict. Domestic abuse was, in turn, associated with women's mental health such that greater domestic conflict was related to higher reports of depressive affect and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. The importance of identifying similarities and differences in the occurrence of domestic violence in developing countries as compared to industrialized countries is discussed.

Design: A cohort of 576 children from the prospective study of a BRAC- International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh joint research project was analysed. Data were collected three times during 1995-1996 with approximately 4-month intervals. Stunting, defined as height-for-age below minus two standard deviations from the reference median, was the outcome health measure. The study children were stratified into three groups according to their mother's social and BRAC membership status: poor and BRAC member (BM), poor non-member (TG) and non-poor non-member (NTG). Setting: Matlab, rural area of Bangladesh. Subjects: Children aged 6-72 months. Results: The overall prevalence of stunting was 76%; the highest prevalence was found among TG (84.6%) children and no significant difference was observed between BM and NTG children (67.3% and 69.4%, respectively). In all groups, a significantly larger proportion of girls was stunted compared with boys in the first round. Group-level analysis showed that stunting decreased among all children except BM boys at the end of third round, with the largest decline among BM girls. In contrast, stunting prevalence increased among BM boys. A similar trend was found in the individual-level analysis, where a larger proportion of BM girls recovered from stunting compared with other groups and no recovery was observed among BM boys. At the end of the third round, the nutritional status of BM girls was almost equal to that of the BM boys, while gender inequity remained large among TG and NTG children. Conclusion: The BRAC initiative appeared to contribute to a significant equity gain in health for girls, as well as to decreased differences in ill health between the poor and the non-poor.

Using data from a telephone survey of adults in the United States, this study analyzed the effect of metropolitan level income inequality on self-rated health. It combined individual data from the 2000 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System with metropolitan level income data from the 2000 Census. After controlling for smoking, age, education, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, sex, household income, and metropolitan area per capita income, this study found that for each I point rise in the GINI index (on a hundred point scale) the risk of reporting Fair or Poor self-rated health increased by 4.0% (95% confidence interval 1.6-6.5%). Given that self-rated health is a good predictor of morbidity and mortality, this suggests that metropolitan area income inequality is affecting the health of US adults. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Study design A systematic literature review. Search strategy Medline database (1968-August 2003) was searched for empirical studies of the relationship between macro-level economic and social policies in rich nations and rates of infant mortality (IMR) and LBW. Cross-national comparison of infant mortality and LBW that did not compare the effects of macro-level economic and social policies was excluded from the review as were studies including less developed countries. Keywords representing IMR and LBW were entered into Medline along with exposures related to international comparison and macro-level policy. Abstracts obtained from the initial search were reviewed for relevant studies. Full papers of potentially relevant studies were obtained and reviewed for inclusion. Secondary search of papers cited in included papers was undertaken. For this review, papers were not excluded on the basis of quality although methodological limitations were commented on and taken into account in interpreting the results. Summary statistics were not estimated. Results Twelve studies, fulfilling the inclusion criteria, were identified. Ten studies examined the association of IMR with income inequality, eight of which reported a statistically significant positive association with higher levels of inequality after adjustment for a range of variables. Six studies reported significant positive associations of IMR with other indicators of less re-distributive social and economic policy. Associations with LBW were reported in four studies; three showed significant positive associations with higher levels of income inequality and one showed no association with low levels of parental leave entitlement. Methodological differences, particularly the wide range of variables used to adjust for confounding, make interpretation of the findings difficult. Conclusions The results of this review represent a preliminary attempt to summarize the literature linking macro-level economic and social policies in rich nations with IMR and LBW. The findings, taking account of the methodological limitations of the review and of the included studies, suggest a statistically significant association between IMR and higher income inequality and other indicators of less re-distributive social policy. Only three studies examined the association of income inequality with LBW and, although they suggest a significant association, further studies will be needed to confirm this finding.

The survey finds shortfalls in delivery of safe, effective, timely, or patient-centered care, with variations among countries. Delays in lab test results and test errors raise safety concerns. Failures to communicate, to engage patients, or to promote health are widespread. Aside from clinical preventive care, the United States performs poorly on most care dimensions in the study, with notable cost-related access concerns and short-term physician relationships. Contrasts across countries point to the potential to improve performance and to learn from international initiatives.

J	Coe, AB				Coe, AB			From anti-natalist to ultra-conservative: Restricting reproductive choice in Peru	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						1994 International Conference on Population and Development; anti-natalist population policy; reproductive health policy and programmes; reproductive rights; anti-choice policies; Peru; United States		This article examines Peru's population policy since the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and assesses to what extent its policies and programmes hove affected reproductive health and rights. It is drown from data collected during ongoing monitoring of sexual and reproductive health policies and programmes in Peru since 1998 for the Center for Health and Gender Equity (CHANGE). Accomplishments since 1994 in Peru demonstrate good faith on the part of the government and foreign donors to make progress towards fulfilling the ICPD agenda by addressing key reproductive health concerns and promoting women's rights. Unfortunately, this progress has not been consistent. It has been overshadowed by two periods of anati-choice policies and interventions. The first, in 1996-97 under the Fujimori government, was G demographic approach that used numerical targets and undue pressure on women to accept sterilisation as the government's main poverty reduction strategy, which led to documented abuses. The second, in 2001-03 under the Toledo government, was a far-right approach that worked to limit access to essential services, including emergency contraception, condoms and post-abortion Care. In spite of their contradictory nature, these two policy approaches have been the greatest obstacles to making long-lasting improvements to reproductive health and rights in Peru.

J	Birenbaum-Carmeli, D				Birenbaum-Carmeli, D			'Cheaper than a newcomer': on the social production of IVF policy in Israel	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS			English	Article						in vitro fertilisation; reproductive policy; health policy; women; assisted reproduction; Israel; politics	IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION; COST; INFERTILITY	This paper explores the shaping of health policy in terms of power relations and group interests, as enacted in Israel's IVF policy. A comparison with the principles of IVF provision in other countries (UK, Canada, USA) shows Israel's policy to be substantially more 'liberal'. In order to explain this exception, the policy is initially located within the context of the state's pro-natalist reproductive policy, women's impaired equality and a complex system of healthcare provision. A Parliament Committee discussion on the subject is then analysed in greater detail, revealing three narratives that are used to account for the state's IVF policy: a nationalised narrative of reproductive medicine as a source of international acclaim, a personalised narrative of compassion for anguished women, and a medicalised narrative of experts as being best capable of regulating IVF. All three narratives have merged within the local IVF discourse, enabling the creation and maintenance of consensus among the participating politicians, physicians, consumers and women activists. Of significance is the muted argument regarding the state's interest in enlarging its Jewish population, which dominated other discussions on this topic. I argue that it is the demographic interest which crucially underlies the state's willingness to sustain its costly IVF policy, and that it is this interest which has enabled the various participants - who all shared an interest in unlimited IVF provision - to present a unanimous agreement. State representatives then used this consensus as a firm civil ground for the development and maintenance of Israel's exceptional IVF policy. The paper concludes with several implications regarding women's health and wellbeing.

Systematic reviews can inform public policymaking by providing research-based answers to these questions. Public policymakers can encourage more informed policymaking by asking to see systematic reviews on priority issues, commissioning reviews when none exists, and placing more value on such work in their deliberations and in their interactions with stakeholders. Donors and international agencies can encourage more informed public policymaking by supporting national and regional efforts to undertake reviews and assess their local applicability, and by supporting regional or worldwide efforts to coordinate review and assessment processes.

The inclusion of the SF-36 in the first Australian national household panel survey, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia ( HILDA) Survey, provides an opportunity to investigate health inequalities. In this analysis we establish the psychometric properties and criterion validity of the SF-36 HILDA Survey data and examine scale profiles across a range of measures of socioeconomic circumstance. Methods: Data from 13,055 respondents who completed the first wave of the HILDA Survey were analysed to determine the psychometric properties of the SF-36 and the relationship of the SF-36 scales to other measures of health, disability, social functioning and demographic characteristics. Results: Results of principle components analysis were similar to previous Australian and international reports. Survey scales demonstrated convergent and divergent validity, and different markers of social status demonstrated unique patterns of outcomes across the scales. Conclusion: Results demonstrated the validity of the SF-36 data collected during the first wave of the HILDA Survey and support its use in research examining health inequalities and population health characteristics in Australia.

Research can assist in mounting an effective response, but will require increased emphasis on health determinants at both the national and global levels, as well as health systems research and broad-based and effective public health initiatives. Civil society organizations (CSOs) are already at the forefront of such research. We suggest that there are at least three ways in which the participation of CSOs in research can be increased: namely, influencing commissioning and priority-setting; becoming involved in the review process and in conducting research; and through formal partnerships between communities and universities that link CSOs with academic researchers.

For developing countries to indigenize health research systems, it is essential to build research capacity. We review the positive features and weaknesses of various approaches to capacity building, emphasizing that complementary approaches to human resource development work best in the context of a systems and long-term perspective. As a key element of capacity building, countries must also address issues related to the enabling environment, in particular: leadership, career structure, critical mass, infrastructure, information access and interfaces between research producers and users. The success of efforts to build capacity in developing countries will ultimately depend on political will and credibility, adequate financing, and a responsive capacity-building plan that is based on a thorough situational analysis of the resources needed for health research and the inequities and gaps in health care. Greater national and international investment in capacity building in developing countries has the greatest potential for securing dynamic and agile knowledge systems that can deliver better health and equity, now and in the future.

Headache and musculo-skeletal pain are major public health problems. Substantial proportions of the general population report that they experience pain problems that affect their work, daily living and social life. Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that the prevalence of most pain conditions is higher in women than in men. Design. Cross-sectional survey in the county of Uppland, Sweden, 1995. Five thousand four hundred and four completed the questionnaire (response rate = 68%). In these analyses for persons aged 20-64 years 4506 were included. Results. Back pain (22.7%) and shoulder pain (21.0%) were the most commonly reported medical problems in the population with pain in arms/legs (15.7%) in fifth and headache (12.5%) in eight place. Major gender differences were found. The prevalence of pain conditions, especially headache, was higher among women. Women reported more severe pain. Co-morbidity between pain conditions and psychiatric and somatic problems was higher among women. Health-related quality of life (SF-36) differed by gender and type of pain condition. The physical dimensions of HRQoL were more affected by headache among men; psychological dimensions were more affected among women. Among both men and women, pain conditions were associated with poorer socioeconomic conditions and life-style factors but there were gender differences. Education and unemployment were important only among men while economical difficulties, half-time work and being married were associated with pain among women. Obesity, early disability retirement. long time sick-leave and lack of exercise were associated with pain conditions generally. Factors associated with pain conditions were unevenly distributed between genders. Conclusion. There are major differences between men and women in the prevalence and severity of self-reported pain in the population. Biological factors may explain some of the differences but the main explanation is presumably gender disparities in work, economy, daily living, social life and expectations between women and men. Although improved working conditions are of importance, deeper societal changes are needed to reduce the inequities in pain experiences between women and men.

The main purpose of the study is to: (a) analyze the process of collection and distribution of out-of-pocket or direct payments and particularly of the informal component; (b) explain why they seem to be so prevalent; (c) investigate their consequences, especially on access and quality of health care services. The findings of this study are derived from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with users as well as providers. The study found that in general paying for health services in Georgia has become a really common and mostly accepted practice, and that a significant share of these payments are completely unrecorded. The extent of direct payments for health services are producing severe consequences on both equity and efficiency, making services unaffordable for most people, and leading to under funding of essential inputs. The policy implications of the study findings are challenging. First, the study clearly points out the deep-rooted and multidimensional reasons why out-of-pocket payments are pervasive, and why an important share of them is collected informally. Second, the study highlights that there is no simple solution. In particular, some of the solutions frequently proposed in the international debate, such as simply formalizing user charges, in the Georgian context appear impractical.

Since the acceleration of globalization in the 1970s, service-sector workers in developed nations have faced high unemployment, increased skill requirements for mostjobs, and a rise in non-traditional work arrangements. These secular shifts in service-sector labor markets have occurred against the background of an erosion of the welfare state and growing income inequality. As well, many healthcare systems, including Canada's, were severely downsized and restructured in the 1990s, exacerbating the underlying negative secular trends in the service sector, and worsening the working conditions for many healthcare workers. Globalization has altered the labor market and shifted working conditions in ways that have been unfavorable to many healthcare workers.

Design, setting, and participants: Qualitative residential workshop involving senior policy advisors with a substantive role in policy development across a range of sectors (mainly public health, but also including education, social welfare, and health services). In four in depth sessions, facilitated by the authors, focused questions were presented to participants. Their responses were then analysed thematically to identify key themes, relating to the availability and utility of existing evidence on health inequalities. Main results: The lack of an equity dimension in much aetiological and evaluative research was highlighted by participants. Much public health research was also felt to have weak underlying theoretical underpinnings. As well as evaluations of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policy and other interventions, they identified a need for predictive research, and for methodological research to further develop methods for assessing the impact on health of clusters of interventions. Conclusions: This study reinforces the view that there is a lack of information on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies, and it uncovered additional gaps in the health inequalities evidence base. A companion paper discusses researchers' views of how the production of more relevant public health evidence can be stimulated.

It is based on secondary multivariate analysis of the Fourth National Survey of Ethnic Minorities of England and Wales. Respondents aged 45-74 years belonging to four ethnic groups (1,068 white, 514 Caribbean, 581 Indian and East African Asian, and 199 Pakistani) were included in the analysis, which focuses on differences between ethnic groups by age and gender, using the white population as the reference group. Four dimensions (incorporating seven factors) that influence the quality of life were determined among this age group: quality of neighbourhood (availability of local amenities, and problems with crime and the physical environment); social networks and community participation (strength of family networks, and community participation); material conditions (income, wealth and housing conditions) and health. The relative position of the four ethnic groups on the seven factors illustrated two contrasting patterns. For the factors based on conventional indicators of social inequalities - such as material circumstances, health, participation in formal social networks, and quality of the physical environment - the white group ranked highest, the Pakistanis lowest, and the Indian and Caribbean groups ranked second and third. But factors that capture more immediate and subjective elements, such as frequency of family contact and the desirability of the residential neighbourhood, displayed a diametrically opposite rank-order, with the Pakistani group ranked first and the white group fourth. The study highlights the value of examining separately the various influences on quality of life. Contradictory patterns are revealed in key influences that are hidden by global measures. The study also reveals the difficulty of identifying culturally-neutral measures of quality of locality, with ethnic minority groups having a more positive perception of their area than rated by conventional measures of area deprivation such as the Index of Deprivation.

This population-based study was carried out in a poor community in Brazil (15,000 inhabitants), aiming at determining the prevalence of social phobia and its associated factors. Method: The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was applied in a random sample of 1037 residents aged greater than or equal to 18 years. Results: The 1-month, 1-year and lifetime prevalence of social phobia were 7.9, 9.1 and 11.8%, respectively. One-month social phobia was independently associated with age (45-64 years), marital status (divorced/separated), worse socioeconomic indicators (family income and education), number of months worked, worse health status and use of health services and medications. Conclusion: There was an important burden of social phobia in the study community, due to its high prevalence (similar or superior to those observed in most developed countries), and due to its association with worse health status and use of health services and medications. The strong association between social phobia and socioeconomic circumstance, even in a small and poor community, is certainly a reflex of the major social inequalities in Brazil.

This article investigates the relationship between openness, government social expenditures (i.e., education, health, and social security and welfare), and income distribution through a time-series cross-sectional panel data set for 35 less developed countries (LDCs) from 1972 to 1996. I compare these findings to the redistributive effects of social spending in 11 advanced industrialized economies. The results show that while all categories of social spending help improve income distribution in richer countries, the effects of social spending are much less favorable in LDCs. Only spending on education in LDCs encourages a more favorable distribution of income in the face of globalization. I argue that the pressures of a more competitive global economy increase incentives for more redistributive education spending, whereas publicly sponsored health programs and, particularly, social security and welfare programs confront greater political lobbying and clientelism.

The data include four types of spending: criminal justice system, interdiction and international intelligence, education in the community and workplace, and drug treatment These data were combined with mortality rates for drug abuse, a public health outcome. The empirical findings support the hypothesis that resources allocated to drug prevention and treatment have benefited the public health. Conversely, a 10% reduction in enforcement expenditures is associated with a long-run reduction of approximately 3,000 deaths per year.											26	5	8	0	7	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	0022-0426	1945-1369		J DRUG ISSUES	J.

Developing a framework for equitable and effective resource allocation for health depends upon knowledge of service providers and their location in relation to the population they should serve. The last available map of health service providers in Kenya was developed in 1959. We have built a health service provider database from a variety of traditional government and opportunistic non-government sources and positioned spatially these facilities using global positioning systems, hand-drawn maps, topographical maps and other sources. Of 6674 identified service providers, 3355 (50%) were private sector, employer-provided or specialist facilities and only 39% were registered in the Kenyan Ministry of Health database during 2001. Of 3319 public service facilities supported by the Ministry of Health, missions, not-for-profit organizations and local authorities, 84% were registered on a Ministry of Health database and we were able to acquire co-ordinates for 92% of these. The ratio of public health services to population changed from 1:26,000 in 1959 to 1:9300 in 1999-2002. There were 82% of the population within 5 km of a public health facility and resident in 20% of the country. Our efforts to recreate a comprehensive, spatially defined list of health service providers has identified a number of weaknesses in existing national health management information systems, which with an increased commitment and minimal costs can be redressed. This will enable geographic information systems to exploit more fully facility-based morbidity data, population distribution and health access models to target resources and monitor the ability of health sector reforms to achieve equity in service provision.

To succeed in the global economy, now and in the future, the United States must educate and nurture the nation's children to their fullest potential, regardless of which states they live in. Under what economic conditions are children living in different states? What is the level of child well-being that different states are achieving? What is the relationship between the two phenomena? This article demonstrates, through a state-by-state data analysis, that there is a significant relationship between the economic deprivation of children in a state and the low level of child well-being in that state.

Materials and methods: Three cross-sectional surveys from the WHO Global Oral Data Bank that were conducted at national level in France in 1987, 1993, 1998. The surveys involved a representative sample of 1,000 12-year old children in 1987, 1,331 in 1993, and 6,000 in 1998. Results: An important decline of the caries focused in the first period - 22.8% vs. 4.5% in the period 1993-1998. All components in the DMFT Index decreased although they followed different patterns. The mean number of filled teeth consistently dropped over the entire 11 years in a context where the mean number of untreated carious teeth reached its lowest point in 1993 and increased thereafter. The four first molars accounted for the vast majority of the caries, 73.7% in 1998. In 1998 year, 44.9% of children had caries-free first molars as opposed to 38.8% in 1993 and 14.0% in 1987. Conclusion: The influence of this caries evolution on the oral health system is discussed. Suggestions are advanced to integrate dentistry in a public health concept especially focused on the reduction of inequality.

The ministers intend to form a network to share thinking and evidence on healthcare improvements, with the specific aim of sustaining and promoting equitable access to health care. Despite a vast literature on the notion of equity of access, little agreement has been reached in the literature on exactly what this notion ought to mean. This article provides a brief description of the relevance of the access principle of equity, and summarises the research programme that is necessary for turning the principle into a useful, operational policy objective.

J	Bandy, J				Bandy, J			Paradoxes of transnational civil societies under neoliberalism: The Coalition for Justice in the Maquiladoras	SOCIAL PROBLEMS			English	Article							SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; POLITICS	A variety of social movements are coalescing into transnational networks that oppose the polarizing inequalities, unaccountable corporate power, and declining social and environmental health of free trade. in the process of sharing grievances and resources, many movements are forging cross-border networks and shaping the beginnings of transnational civil societies. This research discusses one network and its efforts to build a transnational civil society, the Coalition for Justice in the Maquiladoras (CJM), a coalition endeavoring to reform exploitative labor relations in Mexico's export processing sector. Using thirty extended interviews, movement documents, and notes from participant observation from 1996 to 2002, the research analyzes the problems and possibilities of transnational movement coalitions as they struggle for reform. Borrowing from scholarship on transnational social movements and coalition building, this research makes two contributions. First, liberal capitalism paradoxically both enables the growth and limits the power of democratic development in transnational civil societies, like national civil societies before it. Second, despite the fact that the CJM has yet to overcome internal disunity and external forces of social control, it shows how coalition building creates transnational cultures of solidarity that inspire movement networks to survive and explore new opportunities for social change.

Social participation and trust are two aspects of social capital that mutually affect each other, according to the literature. In recent years there has been an increased attention to the fact that generalised trust decreases for every new birth cohort that reaches adulthood in the USA, while social participation may take new forms such as ideologically much narrower single-issue movements that do not enhance trust. The phenomenon has been called "the miniaturisation of community". The effects of similar patterns in Sweden on self-reported health and self-reported psychological health are analysed. The odds ratios of bad self-reported global health are highest in the low-social capital category (low-social participation/low trust), but the miniaturisation of community and low-social participation/high-trust categories also have significantly higher odds ratios than the high-social capital category (high-social participation/high trust). The odds ratios of bad self-reported psychological health are significantly higher in both the low-social capital category and the miniaturisation of community category compared to the high-social capital category, while the low-social participation/high-trust category does not differ from the high-social capital reference group.

J	Paluzzi, JE				Paluzzi, JE			A social disease/a social response: lessons in tuberculosis from early 20th century Chile	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						tuberculosis; Chile; social medicine	PUBLIC-HEALTH	During the 1930s, Chile reported the world's highest mortality rate due to tuberculosis. In this pre-antibiotic era, the attention of the biomedical community frequently turned to the underlying social inequalities and deficiencies that created conditions of heightened risk for Chile's rapidly expanding working class. With the recognition that crowded housing, chronic malnutrition and substandard working conditions fostered an environment in which the disease developed and spread with virulent rapidity, physicians frequently became vocal advocates for widespread and significant social reform. However, by the time of the introduction of efficacious pharmaceutical agents in the 1940s and with the overall rapid development of biomedicine in the mid-20th century, the larger medical discourse became more rigidly defined and characterized by the promotion of the new antibiotics and treatments. These factors increased the depth of the self-defined medical territory but substantially reduced its breadth. Accompanying this shift was an increasing focus on individual behaviors that were seen as deficient and were both socially censored and used as explanations for increased susceptibility. In the midst of the current worldwide epidemic of tuberculosis, this disease and its epidemiological pattern heightens our awareness of the significance and consequences of global inequalities. It also draws our attention to the importance of intervention within the social conditions from which these patterns emerge. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CLINICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						developing countries; global inequalities; medicine; paradigm shift; physicians; resource-poor settings	HYPERTENSION; PREVALENCE; DISEASE; US	The current global health system, which concentrates on a few and neglects billions of people who live in resource-poor settings and carry the largest burden of global diseases, is unacceptable. The weight of medical practice patterns ought to shift from the therapeutic phase of medical care to prevention. Achieving better health for the majority of humanity requires innovation, improved resources, new cooperation between the rich and the poor, and a clear ethical vision, consolidated by goal-oriented and system-focused strategic health planning. Development assistance from wealthier nations to developing countries must shift from the current donor-driven agendas to country-driven sector-wide approaches for health development with adequate accountability and sustainability. There must be a fundamental departure from classical universalism to new universalism, reoriented by a new public health, and reinforced by a new solidarity, using holistic approaches to ensure better health for the whole of humanity.

The data are taken from the 1996 wave of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). We examine two types of utilisation (the probability of a visit and the conditional number of positive visits) for two types of medical care: general practitioner and medical specialist visits using probit, truncated Negbin and generalised Negbin models. We find little or no evidence of income-related inequity in the probability of a GP visit in these countries. Conditional upon at least one visit, there is even evidence of a somewhat pro-poor distribution. By contrast, substantial pro-rich inequity emerges in virtually every country with respect to the probability of contacting a medical specialist. Despite their lower needs for such care, wealthier and higher educated individuals appear to be much more likely to see a specialist than the less well-off. This phenomenon is universal in Europe, but stronger in countries where either private insurance cover or private practice options are offered to purchase quicker and/or preferential access. Pro-rich inequity in subsequent visits adds to this access inequity but appears more related to regional disparities in utilisation than to other factors. Despite decades of universal and fairly comprehensive coverage in European countries, utilisation patterns suggest that rich and poor are not treated equally. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

A new redistribution interpretation and an existing redistribution interpretation of the Gini are presented and applied to the concentration index. Both indicate the share of the total amount of any variable that needs redistributing in a particular way from rich to poor (or vice versa) to achieve a concentration index equal to zero. The characteristics of these redistribution schemes are compared. The paper also draws attention to the relationship between a concentration index, a correlation coefficient with relative income rank and a coefficient of variation of the variable of interest. These relationships are illustrated using data on inequality in dental care utilisation in European countries taken from the European Community Household Panel survey.

It is a global injustice that 95% of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries. The focus of guidance is on abortion procedures that are lawful within the countries in which they occur, noting that in almost all countries, the law permits abortion to save a woman's life. The guidance treats unsafe abortion as a public health challenge, and responds to the problem through strategies concerning improved clinical care for women undergoing procedures, and the appropriate placement of necessary services. Legal and policy considerations are explored, and annexes present guidance to further reading, international consensus documents on safe abortion, and on manual vacuum aspiration and post-abortion contraception.

J	Tolhurst, R; Zhang, TH; Yang, H; Gao, J; Tang, SL				Tolhurst, R; Zhang, TH; Yang, H; Gao, J; Tang, SL			Factors affecting the implementation of health legislation and its impact on the rural poor in China: A case study of implementation of the maternal and infant health care law in two poor counties	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						maternal and child health; health legislation; equity; China; health services	SERVICES; POLICY	This paper presents and discusses a case study of health legislation in China. In the transition to a market economy, legislation has been developed to offset the weakening in the central planning mechanism and political control that have historically influenced the behaviour of institutions and individuals in the Ministry of Health. There has been relatively little empirical examination of the implementation and impact of legislation as a tool for influencing health service provision in low-income countries. The study aimed to contribute towards filling this gap by exploring the factors affecting the implementation and impact of the Maternal and Infant Health Care Law, through a case study of two poor, rural counties in Chongqing municipality, China. The study found that key local actors perceive health legislation to be an important tool for safeguarding access to essential health care. However, the implementation of health legislation is inevitably a political process. The study illustrates the difficulties involved in efforts to influence provider behaviour through a national level legislative framework in a situation of decentralization of control over those providers, due to extreme regional variation in economic situations and limited resource inputs from the centre. Lessons are drawn for Chinese and international policy makers. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Beato, LB				Beato, LB			Inequality and human rights of African descendants in Brazil	JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES			English	Article						gender and race inequality; African descendants in Brazil; human rights; international law; economic rights; social rights; cultural rights		Race and gender inequalities in Brazil are analyzed in light of international human rights law and standards. The demographic category "blacks" or "African descendants" is new and still controversial in Brazil; it conflicts with the traditional "racial democracy" ideology by grouping together dark-skinned and light-skinned blacks, but official research institutions increasingly employ this methodology. Statistical economic and demographic analysis demonstrates that African descendants' human rights, particularly those of black women, are violated daily in Brazil. Analysis is made of compliance with international standards for the rights to life (life expectancy, mortality rates, quality of life), physical and mental health, work with dignity and equal opportunity, ongoing improvement of living conditions, and protection in childhood. Brazilian society is traditionally authoritarian and inequality is taken for granted. Meaningful economic and social change must address the specific issues of race discrimination and its legacy, which implies deep structural changes in Brazilian society.											17	13	20	0	6	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	0021-9347			J BLACK STUD	J.

A series of effective, low-cost interventions, based on appropriate technologies can be used to address the main causes of neonatal deaths. Among these interventions, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding and thermal control of the newborn infant are very effective ones. Although the effectiveness of interventions such as kangaroo mother care, newborn resuscitation, and infant massage is not widely recognized, they may have important complementary roles in providing heath care to newborn infants in adverse conditions.

J	Batista-Foguet, JM; Fortiana, J; Currie, C; Villalbíi, JR				Batista-Foguet, JM; Fortiana, J; Currie, C; Villalbíi, JR			Socio-economic indexes in surveys for comparisons between countries	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						canonical variate analysis; health-behaviour; optimal scaling; socio-economic indexes; social inequalities; summated rating scale	DETERMINANTS; NETHERLANDS; BEHAVIOR; HEALTH	The study of socio-economic inequalities from a cross-national perspective has been hampered by the lack of adequate common indices of socioeconomic status that can be used in a self-report survey instrument. This paper examines the construction and the properties of global social indexes in general, and of the Family Affluence Scale ( henceforth FAS) in particular. The paper proposes a new strategy for making comparisons of the global index with stratified data, building a revised FAS based on Adapted Canonical Variate Analysis ( henceforth ACVA). This alternative strategy for constructing a global index is available in standard software, and the new proposal for stratified data only requires a simple program, which is justified, explained and provided in the text. Data come from the 1998 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC), a WHO Cross-National Study using cluster sampling of schoolchildren from five countries: Denmark, Latvia, Portugal, Scotland and the USA. The results reveal that in every country we would have had a completely different evaluation of the three indicators of Family Affluence if we had used either linear or non linear approaches to compute the global indexes. Moreover, Family Affluence comparisons among countries shows that the relative contribution of the three indicators to the overall FAS, changes from country to country. We conclude that separate indicators of Family Affluence are not equally relevant in each country and, as a consequence, do not contribute equally to the global index. For cross-cultural studies, the strategy for constructing an index should be country specific. The methodological developments presented in the paper open up opportunities to study socio-economic patterning of health among young people in the developed world, since self completed surveys can now employ a commonmeasure of family material wealth. The findings show that the RFAS ( Revised FAS) is a useful index of socio-economic status for use in national and cross-national surveys of adolescent health and health behaviour. The new strategy for weighting observed indicators in the index gives it enhanced power to detect inequalities.

J	West, P; Sweeting, H				West, P; Sweeting, H			Evidence on equalisation in health in youth from the West of Scotland	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						health inequalities; youth; child-youth transition; Scotland	SOCIAL-CLASS; PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; INEQUALITIES; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDREN; GRADIENTS; PARENTS; MATTER; AGE	Many studies report few socioeconomic (SES) differences in health in youth, a pattern contrasting with that of health inequalities in childhood and adulthood. This paper focuses on the child-youth transition to examine the hypothesis of equalisation in health over this period. Specifically, we test two hypotheses: (a) that equalisation is more likely for health state measures (physical and malaise symptoms and accidents) than health status ([limiting] longstanding illness and self-rated health) or health potential (height), and (b) that the patterning of health over this period is similar between occupational (social class) and non-occupational (deprivation, housing tenure and family affluence) SES measures. Data are derived from the West of Scotland 11 to 16 cohort, followed from late childhood (aged 11) through early (13) to mid (15) adolescence. The results showed very little evidence of SES differences in (limiting) longstanding illness at any age for both sexes, while self-rated health exhibited some differentiation, and height (as expected) consistent gradients throughout. By contrast, among males evidence of equalisation was found for both physical and malaise symptoms and pedestrian road traffic accidents (RTAs). Among females, equalisation was confined to specific physical symptoms, pedestrian RTAs, sports injuries and burns/scalds, while for malaise symptoms a reverse gradient at age 11 strengthened with age. These patterns were generally unaffected by the SES measure used. We conclude that while some of the evidence is consistent with the equalisation hypothesis, it needs extending to accommodate patterns of no SES differences, and particularly reverse gradients, in childhood. These patterns may reflect the increasingly pervasive influence of youth culture, suggesting that in the UK the boundary between childhood and youth should be set at an earlier age. This in turn suggests that international comparisons have considerable analytic potential for identifying the conditions under which equalisation does and does not occur. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt, sparked a global movement that called for men's full participation in reproductive health as a means to achieve gender equality, empower women, and improve family health in society This impetus required a transformation of reproductive health services from a woman-only framework to one that includes men and is based on gender equity and gender sensitivity. This article evaluates several post-Cairo frameworks for delivery of male reproductive services and reviews men's options and roles in family planning. Gender relations and the social context of partner decision-making will be challenged, as men assume more responsibility for their reproductive health and family planning.

In the decades after the conference, tuberculosis rates decreased more slowly than forecast, perhaps because chemotherapy had less impact than anticipated, or because the conference's recommendations were not implemented fully until 30 years later, when an epidemic resurgence jolted the country out of complacency. Since 1959, several broad issues have gained prominence after being overlooked or unexpected at the time of the Arden House Conference. These include tuberculosis outbreaks, contact investigations, treatment of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, briefer treatment regimens, human immunodeficiency virus infection, bacteriology laboratory capabilities, and transnational migration. Trends and experience have shown that tuberculosis elimination in the United States will be unfeasible until both technological advances and social justice allow control systems to be applied throughout the world.

Not only are global investments and support programmes for child health by the development agencies declining, but commensurate support for maternal and child health by poor countries themselves is poor. In order to make a meaningful contribution to maternal and child health and survival, a multi-pronged approach is needed which not only focuses on the proximal determinants of child health but also some of the underlying factors governing the status of women in society and expenditures on health and development.

Despite the tremendous potential it holds for improving global health, genomics challenges policy-makers to ensure that its benefits are harnessed equitably across populations and nations. The classification of genomics as a global public good and the inequity encountered in the development and application of genomics knowledge are outlined in this paper. We examine the effect of the current patent system on the distribution of costs and benefits relating to genomics knowledge between countries of different economic strength. The global public goods concept provides a normative economic rationale for the modification of certain aspects of the current patent system and for the creation of complementary mechanisms to respond to the health needs of low-income and middle-income countries.

To review the extent to which the literature supports the position that a medical home is important and to review the extent to which insurance is related to having a medical home. Methods. A review of literature concerning the benefits of a medical home on effectiveness, costs, and equity (reducing disparities) was conducted. Results. International and within-nation studies indicate that a relationship with a medical home is associated with better health, on both the individual and population levels, with lower overall costs of care and with reductions in disparities in health between socially disadvantaged subpopulations and more socially advantaged populations. Although important in facilitating use overall, insurance does not guarantee a medical home. Conclusions. A medical home, with its 4 key features, provides better effectiveness as well as more efficient and more equitable care to individuals and populations. A concerted attempt to provide a means of universal financial access as well as a medical home should be of high priority for the United States.

LANCET			English	Article							SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; LIFE EXPECTANCY; POVERTY; PATTERN; EQUITY; HEALTH	Health trends over much of the past century have been generally, and notably, positive throughout the world. In several regions, however, life expectancy has declined over the past 1-2 decades. This trend suggests that the expectation that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s of worldwide gains and convergence in population health status is not guaranteed by a general deterministic process. National populations can now be clearly grouped into those that have achieved rapid gains in life expectancy; those whose gains are slower or are perhaps plateauing; and those in which the trends have reversed. Over the past two centuries, outside times of war and famine, such reversals have been rare. Exploration of these varied population health trends elucidates better the close relation between population health and the processes of economic, social, and technological change. Such analysis has shown that the health status of human populations should be a guiding criterion in the debate on sustainable development.

J	Sanders, AE; Spencer, AJ				Sanders, AE; Spencer, AJ			Social inequality in perceived oral health among adults in Australia	AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							FUNDED DENTAL PATIENTS; SELF-RATED HEALTH; VALIDATION; VALIDITY	Objective: To establish population estimates of self-assessed tooth loss and subjective oral health and describe the social distribution of these measures among dentate adults in Australia. Methods: Self-report data were obtained from a nationally representative sample of 3,678 adults aged 18-91 years who participated in the 1999 National Dental Telephone Interview Survey and completed a subsequent mail survey. Oral health was evaluated using (1) self-assessed tooth loss, (2) the 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile, and (3) a global six-point rating of oral health. Results: While the absolute difference in tooth loss across household income levels increased at each successive age group (18-44 years, 45-64 years, 65+ years) from 0.7 teeth to 6.1 teeth, the magnitude of the difference was approximately twofold at each age group. For subjective oral health measures, the magnitude of difference across income groups was most pronounced in the 18-44 years age group. In multivariate analysis, low household income, blue-collar occupation, and high residential area disadvantage were positively associated with social impact from oral conditions and pathological tooth loss. Speaking other than English at home (relative to English), low household income (relative to high income), and vocational relative to tertiary education were each associated with more than twice the odds of poor self-rated oral health. Conclusions: Significant social differentials in perceived oral health exist among dentate adults. Inequalities span the socioeconomic hierarchy. Implications: In addition to improving overall levels of oral health in the adult community, goals and targets should aim to reduce social inequalities in the distribution of outcomes.

Design: A multisite, cross-sectional study that used stratified sampling to identify and maximize participation among groups of people traditionally underrepresented in SCI research. Setting: Four Model Spinal Cord Injury Systems participated in the data collection. The primary site was a large southeastern specialty hospital; the other 3 were in the western and mountain regions of the United States. Participants: A total of 512 participants, 475 of whom were included in the analysis. This group included relatively equal portions of whites, African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics. Approximately 40% of the sample was women. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures included 2 measures of SWB (Life Situation Questionnaire-Revised, Older Adult Health and Mood Questionnaire), I measure of participation (Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique), and several items from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Results: The majority of racial and ethnic differences in SWB related to specific life areas (eg, economics, employment), rather than more global outcomes (eg, engagement, health), with whites generally reporting the best outcomes, followed by African Americans. American Indians, and whites generally reported the highest participation scores, whereas limited differences were noted between the racial and ethnic groups on health indicators. Women reported lower satisfaction with health, more poor mental health days, and lower SWB related to home life, but higher SWB related to interpersonal relations. Conclusions: There are racial and ethnic differences in outcomes after SCI focused primarily on subjective outcomes in areas in which racial and ethnic minorities have traditionally been disadvantaged. The results of this study direct rehabilitation professionals to the outcomes that need to be targeted for intervention to eliminate inequities in outcomes for all persons with SCI.

The objective was to analyse the association between the family's social class and adolescents' use of medicine for headache, stomachache, difficulties in getting to sleep, and nervousness. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds, a Danish contribution to the WHO international collaborative study Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) 1998. The study population comprised students from a national random sample of schools who answered a standardized questionnaire in the classroom, participation rate 88%, n=5,205. Results: Logistic regression analyses showed that medicine use for all four symptoms increased by decreasing social class, controlled for age and prevalence of the specific symptom for which the medicine was taken. Adjusted OR (95% CI) for medicine use among students from lower social classes were: medicine for headache 1.35 (1.11-1.65), medicine for stomachache 1.41 (1.08-1.84), medicine for difficulties in getting to sleep 2.00 (1.30-3.08), and medicine for nervousness 3.22 (1.87-5.56). Conclusion: Symptom-adjusted medicine use in a representative sample of Danish adolescents showed a clear and graded increase with decreasing social class. Policies to reduce social inequality in health should address medicine use as well.

J	Schoen, C; Doty, MM				Schoen, C; Doty, MM			Inequities in access to medical care in five countries: findings from the 2001 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						health; policy; international; inequality; access; insurance		Objective: To examine across five countries inequities in access to health care and quality of care experiences associated with income, and to determine whether these inequities persist after controlling for the effect Of insurance coverage, minority and immigration status, health and other important co-factors. Design: Multivariate analysis of a cross-sectional 2001 random survey of 1400 adults ill five Countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and United States. Main outcome measures: Access difficulties and waiting times, cost-related access problems, and ratings of physicians and quality of care. Results: The study finds wide and significant disparities in access and care experience between US adults with above and below-average incomes that persist after controlling for insurance coverage, race/ethnicity, immigration status, and other important factors. In contrast, differences in UK by income were rare. There were also few significant access differences by income in Australia; yet, compared to UK, Australians were more likely to report out of pocket costs. New Zealand and Canada results fell in the mid-range of the five nations, with income gaps most pronounced on services less well covered by national systems. In the four countries with universal coverage, adults with above-average income were more likely to have private supplemental insurance. Having private insurance in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand protects adults from cost-related access problems. In contrast, in UK having supplemental coverage makes little significant difference for access measures. Being uninsured in US has significant negative consequences for access and quality ratings. Conclusions: For policy leaders, the five-nation survey demonstrates that some health systems are better able to minimize among low income adults financial barriers to access and quality care. However, the reliance on private coverage to Supplement public coverage in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand can result in access inequities even within health systems that provide basic health coverage for all. If private insurance call circumvent queues or waiting times, low income adults may also be at higher risks for non-financial barriers since they are less likely to have Supplemental coverage. Furthermore, greater inequality in care experiences by income is associated with more divided public views of the need for system reform. This finding was particularly striking in Canada where an increased incidence of disparities by income in 2001 compared to a 1998 survey was associated with diverging views in 2001.

J	Ghobarah, HA; Huth, P; Russett, B				Ghobarah, HA; Huth, P; Russett, B			Comparative public health: The political economy of human misery and well-being	INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY			English	Article							DICTATORSHIP; CONSEQUENCES; EXPENDITURES; EDUCATION; DEMOCRACY; CONFLICT; PEACE	Nearly 10 percent of the world's economic resources are devoted to health care. But why do certain countries devote more resources to public health? Why are some countries better than others at achieving tangible health outcomes using the same level of economic resources? Surprisingly, political scientists and public health scholars have done only limited systematic research on these important questions. We address them by developing and testing an analytical framework of domestic and international political influences on public health. We use new data from the World Health Organization to examine cross-national variation first in the level of public expenditures on health, and then in the level of achievement of health outcomes. We measure these influences and their relative impact in terms of dollars and years of health, respectively. Dictatorship, severe income inequality, ethnic heterogeneity, and persistent international hostilities substantially depress the amount of public resources allocated to health care. Moreover, we analyze the extent to which, given the same level of resources allocated to public health, overall national health performance suffers further from unequal provision of services, rapid urbanization, and civil conflict.

The growth in overseas nurse recruitment to address staff shortages in the United Kingdom (UK) has led to the proliferation of adaptation programmes for overseas nurses to gain appropriate experience and enable them register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. This paper reports on selected findings from an independent evaluation of an adaptation programme for overseas Registered Nurses offered by a large acute National Health Service trust. Aim. This paper reports on a study to evaluate the programme with reference to its objectives, outcomes and overall success from the perspective of various stakeholders. Methods. A pluralistic evaluation research model was adopted to identify the criteria that stakeholders used to judge the success of an adaptation programme, and then to use these criteria to judge the programme in question. Data were collected by means of focus group and individual in-depth interviews with overseas nurses, ward managers, mentors, senior nurse managers and educators over a 12 month period and analysed by drawing on the principles of dimensional analysis. The criteria for success identified by the various stakeholders provided a framework through which the overall success of the initiative could be judged. Findings. Five meanings of success were identified: gaining professional registration; fitness for practice; reducing the nurse vacancy factor; equality of opportunity and promoting an organizational culture that values diversity. Key findings relating to each of these are presented. The ease with which nurses gained UK registration and integrated into the nursing workforce was influenced by the characteristics of the work environment, level of support, and organizational context. Conclusion. Industrialized nations recruiting from the global nursing market need to invest in providing appropriate support to enable overseas nurses to adapt to working in a different health care system and social and cultural context.

However, differential rates of HIV infection between countries may reflect a different set of circumstances. We obtained data from the World Bank and several other sources to test eight alternative explanations for the global differences in prevalence of HIV infection: (1) economic underdevelopment, (2) inadequate public health care, (3) insufficient media, (4) political instability, (5) overurbanization, (6) social inequity, (7) religion, and (8) region. Our regression findings showed that income inequality and political instability had statistically significant positive effects on HIV/AIDS prevalence and that gender equality had a negative effect on HIV/AIDS prevalence. Religion and region were also important predictors, as countries that were predominately Muslim and Christian Orthodox generally had lower prevalence of HIV/AIDS, whereas West Africa, Central Africa, and Southern Africa had a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS. None of the public health and media indicators were statistically relevant.

Risk analysis, utilising attributable and impact fraction, raises several methodological considerations. The present study illustrates this by measuring the impact of changed distribution levels of smoking on lung cancer, ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive lung disorder (COLD) and stroke for the highest and lowest socio-economic groups measured in disability adjusted life years (DALY). The material is based on relative risks obtained from various international studies, smoking prevalence (SP) data and the number of DALY based on data available for Sweden. The results show that if smoking would have been eliminated (attributable fraction, AF), the inequality between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups may decrease by 75% or increase by 21% depending on the size of the relative risk. Assuming the same smoking prevalence for the lowest socio-economic group as for the highest (impact fraction), then the inequality may decrease by 7-26%. Consequently, the size of the relative risk used may have a significant impact, leading to substantial biases and therefore should be taken into serious consideration in HIA.

J	Pandey, N				Pandey, N			Equity in climate change treaty	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article							ASIAN SOUTHWEST MONSOON; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; BROWN CLOUD; KYOTO; FOREST; DEFORESTATION; CONSERVATION; EMISSIONS; DISTRICT; HOLOCENE	The Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to achieve climate stability and sustainable development through global cooperation. Even with spectacular advances in climate science, projected economic and health benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation, and presence of all the key elements for an effective treaty in the Kyoto Protocol, climate change negotiations remain inconclusive. Arguably, this is so because a widespread concern on equity is yet to be resolved. Here I reexamine the equity in climate change treaty. Political leadership, scientific community and civil society in several nations have maintained that the democratic norms for climate governance are a prerequisite for crafting a successful climate change treaty. Principle of equal p er capita emission entitlements is now emerging as the key option beyond current impasse. Although not required under the Kyoto Protocol, several developing nations are taking responsible action to mitigate climate change. Principle of equal per capita emission entitlements is a just solution to successfully implement climate treaty aimed at climate change mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development. Without a full and unequivocal commitment to equity and democratic governance by a cohesive humanity, any international climate change treaty will have only limited utility.

Sport is now a huge nationally and internationally based industry. The desire to win has led some athletes to resort to the use of performance enhancing drugs. With huge financial rewards now available in some sports the pressure to excel has grown. Some have argued that drug use should be given free rein, however most people are of the view that it is athletic prowess that should be applauded not the efficacy of various performance enhancing drugs. Apart from the obvious aspects of equality and fair play, the use of drugs is associated with significant health risks. In the 1960's the use of stimulants in sports such as cycling led to the death of at least one cyclist. Since 1968 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has required all Olympic Games' host cities to provide laboratory facilities for the analysis and detection of performance enhancing drugs. There are now 29 IOC accredited laboratories throughout the world that routinely test samples from athletes for the presence of such drugs. The purpose of this tutorial review is to give an overview of drug testing procedures, including those that were used at the last summer Olympic Games in Sydney 2000, and the incorporation of the latest developments in analytical chemistry technology in the drug testing process. More recently, developments in biotechnology mean that the use of whole new classes of drugs are banned in sport, often requiring new methodologies and techniques for their analysis. The contest between those who wish to cheat and those who wish to maintain fair play in sport is an ongoing one.

J	Woolf, SH				Woolf, SH			Patient safety is not enough: Targeting quality improvements to optimize the health of the population	ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article							MEDICAL ERRORS; CHRONIC DISEASES; UNITED-STATES; DEATHS; CARE; RISK; NEED; PREVENTABILITY; MANAGEMENT	Ensuring patient safety is essential for better health care, but preoccupation with niches of medicine, such as patient safety, can inadvertently compromise outcomes if it distracts from other problems that pose a greater threat to health. The greatest benefit for the population comes from a comprehensive view of population needs and making improvements in proportion with their potential effect on public health; anything less subjects an excess of people to morbidity and death. Patient safety, in context, is a subset of health problems affecting Americans. Safety is a subcategory of medical errors, which also includes mistakes in health promotion and chronic disease management that cost lives but do not affect "safety." These errors are a subset of lapses in quality, which result not only from errors but also from systemic problems, such as lack of access, inequity, and flawed system designs. Lapses in quality are a subset of deficient caring, which encompasses gaps in therapeutics, respect, and compassion that are undetected by normative quality indicators. These larger problems arguably cost hundreds of thousands more lives than do lapses in safety, and the system redesigns to correct them should receive proportionately greater emphasis. Ensuring such rational prioritization requires policy and medical leaders to eschew parochialism and take a global perspective in gauging health problems. The public's well-being requires policymakers to view the system as a whole and consider the potential effect on overall population health when prioritizing care improvements and system redesigns.

This paper examines educational and health policies under SAP and addresses the following issues: How did educational and health policies impact children? What are the implications of these impacts for the future of children and human capital formation? To answer these questions, we investigate the (1) availability and accessibility of schools and health facilities; (2) quality of schools and health care; (3) costs associated with schooling and using health facilities; and (4) factors that moderate the impact of education and health policies on the lives of children. The findings are that of (1) low educational attainment; (2) poor health, high morbidity and mortality levels; and (3) inequities based on geography, income, and gender. The implication for policy is that there is a need to promote human capital development by investing in it.

However, cross-cultural research shows that it is not always easy to determine what members of a culture consider to be private or how they wish private information to be handled. This article begins by presenting an ethnographic study of patient-healer relationships in Sri Lanka; researchers were surprised to find that participants' views of health and privacy differed greatly from typical Western views, and that the privacy protections they had put in place caused discomfort among participants. Building on this ethics case study, the article explores two main questions. First, can a single definition of privacy possibly do justice to the cultural variations that exist, or does a conceptual definition inevitably run the risk of ethnocentrism? Second, to what extent is strict compliance with research regulations or ethics codes ethically justifiable when following the rules will obviously cause unease in international participants?

We studied differences in the direction and size of inequalities in lung cancer mortality by the educational level of subjects in 10 European populations during the 1990's. We obtained longitudinal mortality data by cause of death, age, sex and educational level for 4 Northern European populations (England/Wales, Norway, Denmark, Finland), 3 continental European populations (Belgium, Switzerland, Austria), and 3 Southern European populations (Barcelona, Madrid, Turin). Age- and sex-specific mortality rates by educational level were calculated, as well as the age- and sex-specific mortality rate ratios. Patterns of educational inequalities in lung cancer mortality suggest that England/Wales, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Belgium are the farthest advanced in terms of the progression of the smoking epidemic: these populations have consistently higher lung cancer mortality rates among the less educated in all age-groups in men, including the oldest men, and in all age-groups in women up to those aged 60-69 years. Madrid appears to be less advanced, with less educated men in the oldest age-group and less educated women in all age-groups still benefiting from lower lung cancer mortality rates. Switzerland, Austria, Turin and Barcelona occupy intermediate positions. The lung cancer mortality data suggest that inequalities in smoking contribute substantially to the educational differences in total mortality among men in all populations, except Madrid. Among women, these contributions are probably substantial in the Northern European countries and in Belgium, but only small in Switzerland, Austria, Turin and Barcelona, and negative in Madrid. In many European countries, policies and interventions that reduce smoking in less educated groups should be one of the main priorities to tackle socioeconomic inequalities in mortality. In some countries, particularly in Southern Europe, it may not be too late to prevent women in less educated groups from taking up the smoking habit, thereby avoiding large inequalities in mortality in the future in these countries.

Family planning technologies, more than simply a means for preventing conception, are involved as identity artefacts in the construction of bodies and in the reproduction of power relations. As such, modern contraceptives, organized by and implemented through, donor-funded programmes constitute a discursive apparatus through which scattered hegemonies are disseminated. Women's use of family planning, traditional and modern, allows them to counter the expectations of these hegemonies at some times, and to embody them at others. Both service providers and clients, construct identities, referenced through women's bodies, using the discourses of international population control and family planning. This paper uses data collected in Tanzania to understand how notions of modernity in the family planning programme construct Tanzanian female bodies as 'traditional' and 'modern', how these discursive inequalities reflect and compound material disparities and how these logics come into play in the ways that women construct themselves and each other.

The discussion focuses on the limitations of research that uses income, consumption, and status as the primary categories of research practice, and demonstrates these limitations by critically analyzing The Health of Nations (by Kawachi and Kennedy). The author concludes that it is essential to use categories of analysis that focus on class relations as well as race and gender relations and their reproduction through the international and national institutions, to study their impact on the health and well-being of populations.

This article reviews the evidence and social assumptions behind this approach to preventing HIV transmission, and argues that these approaches are often inadequate or misguided, particularly in their conflation of the concept of "culture" with social circumstances. By analyzing the socioeconomic circumstances that constrain individual agency, and by combining data from prevention literature with analyses of international trade agreements and the controversies over antiretroviral drug distribution, the author argues that the movement of capital and the maintenance of inequality are central to the problems associated with behavior-change initiatives and must be addressed through new paradigms in order to respond appropriately to the global AIDS pandemic. Hardt and Negri's paradigm of "Empire"-that is, examining the system through which social inequalities are maintained not only between countries but also within them-offers prospects for the design of new interventions and targets for public health workers and social movements.

J	Qato, D				Qato, D			The politics of deteriorating health: The case of Palestine	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								This article reviews the deteriorating health situation of the Palestinian population during the post-Oslo period of the Palestinian Authority and during the current Intifada. It seeks to record findings obtained through primary participants and documents and from personal observations in the field that situate Palestinian health conditions within their political framework. The ongoing crisis highlights longstanding problems in the Palestinian health infrastructure, which make it more vulnerable to Israeli policies, especially the movement restrictions and closures. Efforts by Palestinian professionals and the international health community to provide health services have been constantly thwarted. The Israeli authorities' disregard for Palestinian health care has escalated since 2000 and is directly responsible for a vast number of Palestinian deaths. Israel's indiscriminate obstructions to the coordinated functioning of a health care system in Palestine increase morbidity, degrade health, promote premature deaths, and damage the medical infrastructure. Moreover, the Israeli actions transgress international law and, ultimately, make peace in the region much less likely. This analysis provides further evidence of the social justice violations and the wide-ranging effects on health experienced daily by the Palestinian people as a direct result of the Israeli military occupation.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								Since the 1980s, neoliberal policies have prescribed reducing the role of governments, relying on market forces to organize and provide health care and other vital human services. In this context, international trade agreements increasingly serve as mechanisms to enforce the privatization, deregulation, and decentralization of health care and other services, with important implications for democracy as well as for health. Critics contend that social austerity and "free" trade agreements contribute to the rise in global poverty and economic inequality and instability, and therefore to increased preventable illness and death. Under new agreements through the World Trade Organization that cover vital human services such as health care, water, education, and energy, unaccountable, secret trade tribunals could overrule decisions by democratically elected officials on public financing for national health care systems, licensing and training standards for health professionals, patient safety and quality regulations, occupational safety and health, control of hazardous substances such as tobacco and alcohol, the environment, and affordable access to safe water and sanitation. International negotiations in 2003 in Cancun and in Miami suggested that countervailing views are developing momentum. A concerned health care community has begun to call for a moratorium on trade negotiations on health care and water, and to reinvigorate an alternative vision of universal access to vital services.

J	Sen, K; Mehio-Sibai, A				Sen, K; Mehio-Sibai, A			Transnational capital and confessional politics: The paradox of the health care system in Lebanon	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								For the past two decades there has been a debate over the implementation of structural adjustment policies in the health sector of developing countries, much of it focusing on the political and economic relevance of the reform process for public health provision. However, very few studies have been able to assess the relevance of the private sector, which has had a central role in the restructuring of health services worldwide. Lebanon provides just such a case, with a predominantly private provider and the role of the state relegated to financing, with few controls over supply. This situation has ensured the systematic destruction of what remained of public provision in the 1970s. The country is now faced with one of the most expensive health services in the world, and one in which much of the population continues to live under conditions of considerable economic deprivation. The unique situation of Lebanon is maintained by its politics of confessionalism, with sociopolitical relations dominated by primordial ties of family, tribe, and kin, which does not seem to be an obstacle to the process of globalization. The authors suggest that this context reinforces the gross inequalities in access to health care; they explore the complex relationship between state, finance capital, and confessional politics in the context of health sector reform, in particular the financing of health care.

J	Katz, A				Katz, A			The Sachs report: Investing in health for economic development - Or increasing the size of the crumbs from the rich man's table? Part I	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							MACROECONOMICS; COMMISSION; AID	The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health report (Sachs report) of 2001 has been heralded as inspiring and groundbreaking and is being adopted as the blueprint for global health policymaking. This article argues that the report is deeply conservative and unoriginal. It encourages medico-technical solutions to public health problems; it ignores macroeconomic determinants and other root causes of both poor health and poverty; it reverses public health logic and history; it is based on a set of flawed assumptions; it reflects one particular economic perspective to the exclusion of all others; and it recommends greater amounts of charity while preserving the status quo of a deeply unjust and irrational international economic order. A set of assumptions deriving from a neoliberal approach to health underlies the report. The author proposes an alternative set of assumptions deriving from a social justice and human rights-based approach to health.

To compete financially, many academic medical centers have recruited wealthy foreign patients and established luxury primary care clinics. At these clinics, patients are offered tests supported by little evidence of their clinical and/or cost effectiveness, which erodes the scientific underpinnings of medical practice. Given widespread disparities in health, wealth, and access to care, as well as growing cynicism and dissatisfaction with medicine among trainees, the promotion by these institutions of an overt, two-tiered system of care, which exacerbates inequities and injustice, erodes professional ethics. Academic medical centers should divert their intellectual and financial resources away from luxury primary care and toward more equitable and just programs designed to promote individual, community, and global health. The public and its legislators should, in turn, provide adequate funds to enable this. Ways for academic medicine to facilitate this largesse are discussed.

J	Hepworth, J				Hepworth, J			Public health psychology: A conceptual and practical framework	JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						global health; health inequalities; methods; public health psychology; theory		Increasingly, the development of public health infrastructures requires psychology to re-evaluate its contribution to public health at local, national and global levels. Already familiar to some psychologists, particularly those in community psychology and health promotion, the expansion of public health has implications for psychology in terms of knowledge/practice and working differently in multidisciplinary settings. In this article, I provide a critical overview of the implications of the historical and international development of health psychology and the changing nature of public health to strengthen the establishment of public health psychology. A conceptual and practical framework is proposed in which public health psychology theory, methods and practice are considered as well as its relevance to the health social sciences more generally.

J	Spiegel, JM; Yassi, A				Spiegel, JM; Yassi, A			Lessons from the margins of globalization: appreciating the Cuban health paradox	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY			English	Article							INCOME INEQUALITY; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; PARTICIPATION; DETERMINANTS; TRANSITION; CANADA	It is widely recognized that Cuba, despite poor economic performance, has achieved and sustained health indices comparable to those in developed countries-the Cuban Paradox. There has been, however, remarkably little scholarship evaluating how this has been accomplished, especially during a period of extreme economic hardship. Cuba's exclusion from the mainstream of "globalization," moreover, allows us to gain insights into the population health impact of policies that have accompanied globalization. Cuba's experience challenges the conventional assumption that generating wealth is the fundamental precondition for improving health. As peoples around the world search for cost-effective ways to improve well-being, they might want to learn how alternative public policy approaches, such as those used in Cuba, may be effective. We therefore reviewed the literature on the health-wealth relationship in this globalizing era; then systematically examined public policy in Cuba, not only for health services (financing, vertical and horizontal integration, prevention and primary-care focus, inter-sectoral linkages, etc.) but for non-medical determinants of health as well. These included education, housing, nutrition, employment, etc. plus the community mobilization and social cohesion that the Cuban system has generated. It appears that the active implementation of public policy affecting a wide variety of health determinants explains the Cuban paradox, and that the international community can learn from Cuba's experience. The prospect for healthy public policy can thus exist within, rather than only on the margins of globalization. The importance of monitoring how Cuba sustains such policies as it faces growing challenges in this globalizing era is increasingly worth observing.

J	Walton, DA; Farmer, PE; Lambert, W; Léandre, F; Koenig, SP; Mukherjee, JS				Walton, DA; Farmer, PE; Lambert, W; Léandre, F; Koenig, SP; Mukherjee, JS			Integrated HIV prevention and care strengthens primary health care:: Lessons from rural Haiti	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						HIV; AIDS; primary health care; global health equity	RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS; SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED-DISEASES; RISK-FACTORS; AIDS; TRANSMISSION; THERAPY; HAART	Three decades ago, the world's ministries of health declared primary health care-the delivery of basic preventive and curative services-a top priority. Since then, however, the world's poorest countries have not met most primary health care goals. Twenty-six years after the Declaration of Alma Ara, we are said to be living in a time of "limited resources," a phrase that construes various health interventions as competing priorities. As HIV has become the leading infectious cause of adult death in much of the world, it is difficult to argue that AIDS prevention and care are not ranking priorities for primary health care, yet precisely such arguments have held sway among international health policy makers. We present new information emerging from the scale-up of an established and integrated AIDS prevention-and-care program, based initially in a squatter settlement in central Haiti, to a second site in rural Haiti. The program includes robust prevention efforts as well as community-based therapy for advanced AIDS; three related components-women's health and active case finding and therapy for tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections-were central to this effort. We tracked changes in key indices over the 14 months following the introduction of these services to a public clinic in central Haiti. We found that integrated AIDS prevention and care, including the use of antiretroviral agents, to be feasible in resource-poor settings and that such efforts may have favorable and readily measured impact on a number of primary health care goals, including vaccination, family planning, tuberculosis case finding and cure, and health promotion. Other collateral benefits, though less readily measured, include improved staff morale and enhanced confidence in public health and medicine. We conclude that improving AIDS prevention and treatment can help to reinvigorate flagging efforts to promote universal primary health care.

The IHRA, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and administered by the World Health Organization, recognized the need for us to find effective ways of solving our countries' health problems and acknowledged the special environmental constraints we face in conducting research and exploiting the results. We used this funding to explore alternative ways for harnessing largely untapped resources in our countries to generate and apply knowledge to improve people's health and address inequalities. In the Bangkok Declaration, we joined many others to express our commitment to research as a Vital force for health of all of our people. Six of our ten projects explored, for particular themes or health topics, ways of extending the benefits of research to special groups or populations. Four more proposed specific approaches to consolidate national research policy and systems for allocating public research funds and managing research. From our collective reflection about what we have learned, we note ways in which our experiences represent change, particularly expansion of the traditional boundaries of research: broadening the research agenda by adding new topics, more voices and more perspectives than has been the norm in our settings expanding capacity to design and conduct research by preparing new groups of researchers to pose questions, design and carry out studies, and by engaging more partners and disciplines in addressing national priorities extending dissemination of research results, especially by using websites and mass media to reach decision makers and broader segments of the public encouraging uptake of research for policy and practice. We want research to improve the health of our societies' most disadvantaged groups and to engage them in the process. Our work benefited immeasurably from networks and other forms of collaboration that our grants helped to support-and supported to an extent that was unusual compared to other forms of research funding. We linked our national and regional collaborations to global efforts, but endeavored to do so without being driven or preempted by the latter. We are optimistic about the value of our experiences, but remain acutely aware of the unfinished agenda-an agenda that we incorporate into A CHALLENGE and A CALL for future action. We challenge ourselves, and others, to evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches to research for improving health systems and population health. We call on policy makers to adopt an evidence-based approach and to ensure that health systems are equipped to use rigorous research methods to embrace and analyze information from all participants. We close by asking donors and other international agencies for more flexible support so that we can benefit from global collaboration while maintaining our own priorities and building national and regional infrastructures to implement and evaluate new ways of doing research.

There is little congruence between national trends in income inequality and age- or cause-specific mortality except perhaps for suicide and homicide. The variable trends in some causes of mortality may be associated regionally with income inequality. However, between 1978 and 2000 those regions experiencing the largest increases in income inequality had the largest declines in mortality (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). Understanding the social determinants of population health requires appreciating how broad indicators of social and economic conditions are related, at different times and places, to the levels and social distribution of major risk factors for particular health outcomes.

Although many Latin American countries have nationalized health care systems that could potentially improve access to care, significant barriers to care remain. The authors report the results of a study examining mental health service utilization in the general population of Chile. Methods: The data were drawn from the Chile Psychiatric Prevalence Study, a national household survey of 2,987 persons aged 15 years and older conducted in 1992-1999. As part of the survey, psychiatric diagnoses were obtained by using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, and respondents were asked about their use of general and mental health care services in the past six months and about their experience of barriers to treatment. Results: More than 44 percent of respondents reported use of any health care services in the past six months, and 20 percent reported use of mental health services. Of the respondents who met criteria for a psychiatric disorder, a large proportion (62 percent) did not receive mental health care. Increasing severity of the psychiatric disorder correlated with increasing frequency of overall help seeking, but only a small proportion of the respondents with a psychiatric disorder sought specialized mental health services. Regional disparities and inequities in access to care were found. In addition, indirect barriers to mental health care, such as stigma and misconceptions about the course of psychiatric disorders, were important deterrents to service utilization, particularly among persons with lower socioeconomic status. Conclusions: To reduce the burden of mental illness in Chile, additional efforts are needed to address both the direct and the indirect barriers to mental health care, including regional inequities in access to care.

J	Bossuyt, N; Gadeyne, S; Deboosere, P; Van Oyen, H				Bossuyt, N; Gadeyne, S; Deboosere, P; Van Oyen, H			Socio-economic inequalities in health expectancy in Belgium	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							ACTIVE LIFE EXPECTANCY; SELF-RATED HEALTH; SOCIAL-CLASS; PERCEIVED HEALTH; MORTALITY; EDUCATION; DISABILITY; AGE	Various international studies have demonstrated socio-economic differences in health. Linking the 1991 Census to the National Register and using the Health Interview Survey 1997 has enabled assessment of the association between the level of education and health in Belgium using the composite indicator 'health expectancy'. The Sullivan method was used to calculate health expectancy on the basis of current probability of death and prevalence of perceived health. Two measures of educational attainment were used: absolute educational attainment and the position on a relative hierarchical educational scale obtained by a regression-based method. The latter measure enables international comparisons. Differences in health expectancy by education were spread over the whole range of the educational hierarchy, and were consistently larger among females than mates. At 25 years of age, the difference in health expectancy between different levels of education reached up to 17.8 and 24.7 years in mates and females, respectively. Compared with people with the highest educational attainment, mates and females at the lowest level of education spent more than 10 and 20 additional years in poor perceived health, respectively. Between ages 25 and 75 years, the difference in health expectancy between people with the lowest and highest levels of education was 17 years among mates and 21 years among females. Compared with people at the top of the relative educational scale, mates and females at the bottom of the scale had 13.6 and 19.7 additional years in poor perceived health, respectively. The conclusions of this study in Belgium are consistent with studies in other countries. People with a tow level of education have shorter lives than people with a higher level of education. They also have fewer years in good perceived health, and can expect more years in poor health in their shorter lives. The inequality in health expectancy seems to be greater in females than mates.

J	Macinko, JA; Shi, LY; Starfield, B				Macinko, JA; Shi, LY; Starfield, B			Wage inequality, the health system, and infant mortality in wealthy industrialized countries, 1970-1996	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						income inequality; social epidemiology; health determinants	INCOME INEQUALITY; PSYCHOSOCIAL ENVIRONMENT; TRENDS; CRIME; CARE	This pooled, cross-sectional, time-series study assesses the impact of health system variables on the relationship between wage inequality and infant mortality in 19 OECD countries over the period 1970-1996. Data are derived from the OECD, World Value Surveys, Luxembourg Income Study, and political economy databases. Analyses include Pearson correlation and fixed-effects multivariate regression. In year-specific and time-series analyses, the Theil measure of wage inequality (based on industrial sector wages) is positively and statistically significantly associated with infant mortality rates-even while controlling for GDP per capita. Health system variables-in particular the method of healthcare financing and the supply of physicians-significantly attenuated the effect of wage inequality on infant mortality. In fixed effects multivariate regression models controlling for GDP per capita and wage inequality, variables generally associated with better health include income per capita, the method of healthcare financing, and physicians per 1000 population. Alcohol consumption, the proportion of the population in unions, and government expenditures on health were associated with poorer health outcomes. Ambiguous effects were seen for the consumer price index, unemployment rates, the openness of the economy, and voting rates. This study provides international evidence for the impact of wage inequalities on infant mortality. Results suggest that improving aspects of the healthcare system may be one way to partially compensate for the negative effects of social inequalities on population health.

J	van Ingen, C				van Ingen, C			Therapeutic landscapes and the regulated body in the Toronto front runners	SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT JOURNAL			English	Article							GEOGRAPHIES	The study of therapeutic landscapes (locations where place works as a vector of well-being) has generated substantial international interest. Drawing from Henri Lefebvre's prolific writings on space, this article extends the concept of "landscapes of social relations" as an often-overlooked form of therapeutic landscapes. Consequent to this undertaking, this article examines the health experiences of members of the Toronto Front Runners, a running club for sexual minorities. Specifically, I underline the need for an interpretive analysis that examines notions of pluralism, multiple voices, and difference within therapeutic landscapes in order to highlight the ways in which social inequalities affect health.

It is considered whether social gradients are present over different age strata. Methods: Analyses were performed with records obtained from a German statutory health insurance comprising 77294 women (31.8%) and men (68.2%) of at least 20 years. Occupational status was used as indicator of socio-economic position. Individuals with diabetes were identified using information about antidiabetic medication or by hospital diagnoses according to ICD9. The analyses were performed for the entire insurance population and for different age strata (less than or equal to40yrs/4055 yrs/> 55 yrs). Results: The analyses revealed considerable social differences in diabetes risks. Considering the whole insurance population with the highest socio-economic category as reference group, the odds ratio (OR) for skilled non-manuals was OR = 2.9, for skilled manuals it was OR = 4.7, and OR = 5.6 for unskilled and semi-skilled individuals. After stratifying the insurance population into three age groups the social gradients were reproduced for each stratum, but their magnitudes increased with age. Conclusions: In the health insurance population considered health inequalities with respect to diabetes are considerable, and they are persisting after stratification into age groups.

National and international responses to SARS have profound implications for 3 important ethical values:, privacy, liberty, and the duty to protect the public's health. This article examines, through legal and ethical lenses, various methods that countries used in reaction to the SARS outbreak: surveillance and contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, and travel restrictions. These responses, at least in some combination, succeeded in bringing the outbreak to an end. The article articulates a set of legal and ethical recommendations for responding to infectious disease threats, seeking to reconcile the tension between the public's health and individual rights to privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement. The ethical values that inform the recommendations include the precautionary principle, the least restrictive/intrusive alternative, justice, and transparency. Development of a set of legal and ethical recommendations becomes even more essential when, as was true with SARS and will undoubtedly be the case with future epidemics, scientific uncertainty is pervasive,and urgent public health action is required.

J	Brown, DA				Brown, DA			The importance of expressly examining global warming policy issues through an ethical prism	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						ethics; equity; economics science		A vast scientific and economic literature on global warming has emerged in the last two decades. Surprisingly, however, there has been little written on the ethical dimensions of human-induced climate change despite the numerous, obvious, and profoundly important ethical questions raised by human activities that are now clearly threatening human health, the environment, and many things humans value greatly. This paper argues that ethical analysis of global warming issues is practically imperative for two reasons. First, unless ethical is made analysis is made of global warming issues, ethically dubious decisions about global warming will be made because many of the most important ethical considerations are hidden in what appear to be ethically neutral scientific and economic arguments about global warming policy options. Secondly, unless issues of ethics, justice and equity are expressly dealt with, urgently needed global solutions to global warming will not likely be adopted by many nations. That is, an ethical focus on global warming matters is the key to achieve a globally acceptable solution and to harness political support for action. The paper concludes with a recommendation on how institutions and nations should go about implementing express examination of the ethical dimensions of global warming questions. The paper argues for express identification of ethical issues often hidden in scientific and economic analyses of global warming policy options. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Taylor, AJW				Taylor, AJW			Justice as a basic human need	NEW IDEAS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						justice; morality; behaviour; basic needs	COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY; POLITICS; DISTRESS; ODONOHUE; HEALTH; MODEL	A stark encounter with some of the hostages and their families at the time of a parliamentary coup brought to mind the significance of justice for human development and community discourse. The evidence is presented, the concept of justice explored, human needs defined, and the argument advanced for more psychologists to extend their present academic and professional concerns with aspects of civil and criminal justice to include a concern with the social. The suggestion is that together all three components of justice are sufficiently compelling. a component of human welfare to feature in any list of basic needs. Epistemologically they could also be construed as presenting a combined orthogonal domain to be integrated with moral values and be recognised as a stream of the emerging scientist-practitioner-metaphysician model. In raising the topic, attention is paid to the contributions of constitutional and international lawyers, moral philosophers, and a few pioneer psychologists. The hope is that others in such realms as child development, forensic services, industrial/organisational psychology, pastoral psychology, political psychology, and social psychology, might be sufficiently inspired to consider its relevance, undertake requisite training, and redesign their research accordingly.

This is made worse by increasing inequity, such that there are still many communities in the world in which over 30% of children die before their fifth birthday Estimates of the global burden of childhood pneumonia are based on the assumption that there is a predictable relationship between the childhood mortality rate and the proportion of that mortality that is attributable to pneumonia. As most child deaths occur at home and can only be investigated by verbal autopsy techniques, these estimates are very crude and provide only a guide to the overall burden of pneumonia. Recent estimates from the World Health Organization suggest that 1.9 million children die as a result of acute respiratory infection (ARI), mainly pneumonia, each year. For a number of reasons, this is likely to be an underestimate. Estimates of the morbidity burden attributable to pneumonia are also very approximate, as studies have used different and nonstandardized definitions of pneumonia. These estimates were originally used to assist with planning of ARI intervention activities and for advocacy to draw attention to the problem of ARI. Recently, the introduction of new vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) raised the prospect of prevention of pneumonia by vaccination. For reasons outlined in this paper, great caution must be exercised before using existing pneumonia burden estimates to predict mortality savings that may accompany the introduction of these vaccines into developing countries.

POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW			English	Article							SEX-DIFFERENCES; HEALTH; OLD	IN RECENT YEARS, both population aging and gender have become prominent issues in international forums concerning population, as well as important areas of academic inquiry for social demography. Interest in gender often focuses on inequalities that disadvantage women, while much of aging research focuses on the economic and social vulnerability of older persons. Thus it is not surprising that the discourse related to both topics refers mainly to women and emphasizes their potential disadvantage in old age. It is frequently asserted or implied that older women are universally more vulnerable to social, economic, and health disadvantages than older men.

J	Pande, RP; Yazbeck, AS				Pande, RP; Yazbeck, AS			What's in a country average? Wealth, gender, and regional inequalities in immunization in India	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						immunization; inequality; gender; India	HEALTH-CARE; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; CHILD HEALTH; COMMUNITY; POOR	Recent attention to Millennium Development Goals by the international development community has led to the formation of targets to measure country-level achievements, including achievements on health status indicators such as childhood immunization. Using the example of immunization in India, this paper demonstrates the importance of disaggregating national averages for a better understanding of social disparities in health. Specifically, the paper uses data from the India National Family Health Survey 1992-93 to analyze socioeconomic, gender, urban-rural and regional inequalities in immunization in India for each of the 17 largest states. Results show that, on average, southern states have better immunization levels and lower immunization inequalities than many northern states. Wealth and regional inequalities are correlated with overall levels of immunization in a non-linear fashion. Gender inequalities persist in most states, including in the south, and seem unrelated to overall immunization or the levels of other inequalities measured here. This suggests that the gender differentials reflect deep-seated societal factors rather than health system issues per se. The disaggregated information and analysis used in this paper allows for setting more meaningful targets than country averages. Additionally, it helps policy makers and planners to understand programmatic constraints and needs by identifying disparities between sub-groups of the population, including strong and weak performers at the state and regional levels.

A questionnaire was sent to full-time employees at nine companies in Japan between 1996 and 1998, with an average response rate of 85.2%. Data from 20,654 respondents (17,637 male and 3017 female) were analyzed. We classified the occupations into eight groups according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (1988). Daily energy expenditure, weekly physical activity, and monthly leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) were measured using a physical activity questionnaire and some additional questions. In males, LTPA was significantly different among occupations, with clerks having greater physical activity than managers and blue-collar workers (P<0.001). The pattern was similar even after adjusting for education, age, and working hours. In females, the difference among occupations was not clear. The distribution of LTPA among occupations exhibits a "barrel-shape" in Japan.

J	Mustard, CA; Vermeulen, M; Lavis, JN				Mustard, CA; Vermeulen, M; Lavis, JN			Is position in the occupational hierarchy a determinant of decline in perceived health status?	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						work environment; socioeconomic status; self-rated health; prospective study; Canada	SELF-RATED HEALTH; ISCHEMIC-HEART-DISEASE; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; POPULATION HEALTH; SOCIAL-CLASS; INTERNATIONAL VARIATION; UTILITIES INDEX; RISK-FACTORS; LIFE-STYLE; MORTALITY	This study examines the extent to which position in the occupational hierarchy is predictive of declines in perceived health status over a 48 month period in a representative sample of the Canadian labor force. We hypothesized that the proportion of workers reporting a decline in health status would be greater among persons in lower position in the occupational hierarchy, and that these differences in risk would primarily be explained by characteristics of the psychosocial work environment and secondarily by the baseline prevalence of adverse health behaviors. The study cohort was defined as labor force participants aged 18-64 who reported good, very good or excellent health in the 1994 baseline wave of Canada's National Population Health Survey and who participated in the 1998 follow-up survey. Between 1994 and 1998, 16.6% of labor force participants reporting excellent, very good or good health status at baseline reported a decline in perceived health status. For men, the age-adjusted odds of decline in perceived health status were 1.80 (95% CI: 1.24-2.63) and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.19-2.54) for the two lowest occupational classes relative to the highest occupational class. There was no association between position in the occupational hierarchy and the prospective risk of health status decline for women. For men, the association between position in the occupational hierarchy and decline in perceived health status was moderately reduced but remained statistically significant following adjustment for baseline health, health behaviors and psychosocial work exposures. Adjustment for household income did not alter these findings. When stratified by gender, position in the occupational hierarchy was associated with the prospective risk of health status decline for men but not for women. Among men, the collective influence of health behaviors and psychosocial work exposures explained a moderate component of the decline in perceived health status. A more robust measurement of the characteristics of labor market experiences would be expected to improve understanding of the relationship between work and health in this sample.

We develop indices for 'catastrophe' that capture the intensity of catastrophe as well as its incidence and also allow the analyst to capture the degree to which catastrophic payments occur disproportionately among poor households. Measures of poverty impact capturing both intensity and incidence are also developed. The arguments and methods are empirically illustrated with data on out-of-pocket payments from Vietnam in 1993 and 1998. This is not an uninteresting application given that 80% of health spending in that country was paid out-of-pocket in 1998. We find that the incidence and intensity of 'catastrophic' payments - both in terms of pre-payment income as well as ability to pay - were reduced between 1993 and 1998, and that both incidence and intensity of 'catastrophe' became less concentrated among the poor. We also find that the incidence and intensity of the poverty impact of out-of-pocket payments diminished over the period in question. Finally, we find that the poverty impact of out-of-pocket payments is primarily due to poor people becoming even poorer rather than the non-poor being made poor, and that it was not expenses associated with inpatient care that increased poverty but rather non-hospital expenditures.

Design: Group interviews using nominal group technique with provision of evidence. Setting: One rural and one urban district in Uganda. Participants: People living with HIV/AIDS, people from the general population, planners, health workers and people with hypertension. Main outcome measure: relative ranking of prevention of vertical HIV transmission with nevirapine compared to nine other interventions for different conditions and evaluation of participants' use of evidence in the ranking. Results: In the overall final ranking, prevention of vertical HIV transmission with nevirapine was ranked as number five compared to the other eight conditions. Treatment for childhood diseases and highly active anti retroviral treatment (HAART) for HIV/AIDS were ranked higher. Group specific ranking followed the same pattern, although the people living with HIV-group ranked HAART consistently as number one. Conclusions: Stakeholders seem to rank prevention of vertical HIV transmission lower than treatment for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea. Policies considering prevention of vertical transmission of HIV should consider its implications. This study shows that stakeholders are open to considering evidence in assessing the relative priority of different interventions competing for scarce resources. More research is needed to develop methods that can involve representative stakeholders, including the public, in good and legitimate decisions on priorities. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Wagstaff, A				Wagstaff, A			Child health on a dollar a day: some tentative cross-country comparisons	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						child health; poverty; inequality	HOUSEHOLD WEALTH; INEQUALITIES; INCOME	Children living on a dollar a day-the international extreme poverty line-appear to have radically different chances of dying in childhood and being malnourished, depending on the country in which they live. In Kazakhstan, a child living on a dollar a day, has only a 10% risk of being underweight, while the risk facing a child living on a dollar a day in India is nearly 60%. The Kazakh child has a risk of less than 40 per 1000 of dying before his first birthday, while a child living on a dollar a day in Niger faces a risk of nearly 160 per 1000. Countries where mortality and malnutrition risks at a dollar a day are high are not typically those where there are large gaps in child survival and in malnutrition between the poor and better-off. The two concepts of inequality and health risks at the poverty line are not only conceptually distinct-they are empirically distinct too. The large differences between countries in the risks of mortality and malnutrition in childhood beg the obvious question-what accounts for these differences? Some regression results presented in the paper suggest that these differences may be due to differences across countries in levels of per capita expenditure on the health sector. Regressions find that higher levels of per capita public spending on the health sector are associated with significantly lower levels of mortality and malnutrition amongst children living on a dollar a day.

J	Bonu, S; Rani, M; Baker, TD				Bonu, S; Rani, M; Baker, TD			The impact of the national polio immunization campaign on levels and equity in immunization coverage: evidence from rural North India	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						social inequities; polio national immunization days; disease eradication programs; sustainability of coverage; health systems; North India	ERADICATION; VACCINATIONS; STRATEGIES; PROGRESS	Few studies have investigated the impact of immunization campaigns conducted under the global polio eradication program on sustainability of polio vaccination coverage, on coverage of non-polio vaccines (administered under Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)), and on changes in social inequities in immunization coverage. This study proposes to fill the gaps in the evidence by investigating the impact of a polio immunization campaign launched in India in 1995. The study uses a before-and-after study design using representative samples from rural areas of four North Indian states. The National Family Health Survey I (NFHS I) and NFHS II, conducted in 1992-93 and 1998-99 respectively, were used as pre- and post-intervention data. Using pooled data from both the surveys, multivariate logistic regression models with interaction terms were used to investigate the changes in social inequities. During the study period, a greater increase was observed in the coverage of first dose of polio compared to three doses of polio. Moderate improvements in at least one dose of non-polio EPI vaccinations, and no improvements in complete immunization against non-polio EPI diseases were observed. The polio campaign was successful, to some extent, in reducing gender-, caste- and wealth-based inequities, but had no impact on religion- or residence-based inequities. Social inequities in non-polio EPI vaccinations did not reduce during the study period. Significant dropouts between first and third dose of polio raise concerns of sustainability of immunization coverage under a campaign approach. Similarly, little evidence to support synergy between polio campaign and non-polio EPI vaccinations raises questions about the effects of polio campaign on routine health system's functions. However, moderate success of the polio campaign in reducing social inequities in polio coverage may offer valuable insights into the routine health systems for addressing persistent social inequities in access to health care.

J	Mackenbach, JP; Bakker, MJ				Mackenbach, JP; Bakker, MJ		European Network Interventions Pol	Tackling socioeconomic inequalities in health: analysis of European experiences	LANCET			English	Article							INTERVENTION	Effective strategies must be developed to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in health. Most efforts take place in isolation, and only the UK experience has been discussed widely in international published work. We therefore analysed policy developments on health inequalities in different European countries between 1990 and 2001. We noted that countries are in widely different phases of awareness of, and willingness to take action on, inequalities in health. We identified innovative approaches in five main areas: policy steering mechanisms; labour market and working conditions; consumption and health-related behaviour; health care; and territorial approaches. National advisory committees in the UK, the Netherlands, and Sweden have proposed comprehensive strategies to reduce health inequalities. Variations between these packages suggest that policyrnaking in this area still is largely intuitive and would benefit from incorporation of more rigorous evidence-based approaches. Further international exchanges of experiences with development, implementation, and evaluation of policies and interventions to reduce health inequalities can help to enhance learning speed.

The representative sample of 4,027 children from Rome, aged 6-7 yrs, used for the 1994 ISAAC (International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) initiative, was selected. Individual and small area indicators of socioeconomic status were used. Individual data on parents' education and on childhood asthma were gathered from self-administered parental questionnaires. Two small-area indicators (socioeconomic status index (SES) and average income in 1994) were derived using information available at the census tract of residence. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of parental education and small area indicators with asthma prevalence, severity, and hospitalisation. Parental smoking was considered in the analysis as a potential confounder. Prevalence of physician diagnosis of asthma (11.3%) increased as father's education decreased. Prevalence of severe asthma (1.6%) increased as maternal and paternal educational levels decreased. Lifetime hospitalisation for asthma (2.8%,) was strongly associated with both parental education and small-area indicators of social disadvantage, even when considered simultaneously in the same logistic model. Socioeconomic conditions are associated with asthma occurrence, its severity, and hospitalisation. The association was stronger for asthma severity and hospitalisation. Individual indicators correlated better with the outcomes than area-based indicators. However, living in an underprivileged area is a strong independent predictor of hospital admission for asthma.

Countries and international organizations have recently renewed their interest in how health systems perform. This has led to the development of performance indicators for monitoring, assessing, and managing health systems to achieve effectiveness, equity, efficiency, and quality. Although the indicators populate conceptual frameworks, it is often not very clear just what the underlying concepts might be or how effectiveness is conceptualized and measured. Furthermore, there is a gap in the knowledge of how the resultant performance data are used to stimulate improvement and to ensure health care quality. Addressing the issues. This paper therefore explores, individually, the conceptual bases, effectiveness and its indicators, as well as the quality improvement dynamics of the performance frameworks of the UK, Canada, Australia, US, World Health Organization, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Results. We see that they all conceive health and health system performance in one or more supportive frameworks, but differ in concepts and operations. Effectiveness often implies, nationally, the achievement of high quality outcomes of care, or internationally, the efficient achievement of system objectives, or both. Its indicators are therefore mainly outcome and, less so, process measures. The frameworks are linked to a combination of tools and initiatives to stimulate and manage performance and quality improvement. Conclusions. These dynamics may ensure the proper environment for these conceptual frameworks where, alongside objectives such as equity and efficiency, effectiveness (therefore, quality) becomes the core of health systems performance.

Nevertheless, socio-economic differences in the intake of fat have not consistently been reported in Europe. The objective of our study was to systematically assess differences in total fat (TF) intake and saturated fat (SF) intake across social groups. Methods Representative samples from nine European countries were used to perform a meta-analysis of surveys between 1985-1999, including both published and nonpublished results. Results Because important heterogeneity was found and the estimates for TF from Spain and Estonia were different from all others, we calculated the differences in intake excluding these two countries. We found a lower TF intake in the highest (versus the lowest) occupational level both for men (difference: -1.1% of total energy intake; 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.8%) and women (difference: -0.9%; 95% CI: -1.2 to -0.6%) when Estonia and Spain were excluded. Conclusion European surveys indicate that people in the lowest category of occupation consume more fat and SF than people in the highest category.

J	Westerling, R				Westerling, R			Decreasing gender differences in "avoidable'' mortality in Sweden	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						avoidable mortality; outcome; quality; equity; gender; cause of death	SMALL-AREA VARIATION; MEDICAL INTERVENTION; SOCIAL-CLASS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; HEALTH; DEATH; INEQUALITIES; WOMEN; MEN; DISEASE	Aims: "Avoidable'' mortality, that is mortality from conditions amenable to healthcare intervention, is commonly studied as an indicator of the outcome of healthcare. The objective of this study was to analyse gender equity in avoidable mortality trends in Sweden from 1971 to 1996. Methods: The underlying cause of death was analysed for all deaths in the Swedish population in the age group 0 - 69 years during the period 1971 - 96. On the basis of those used in international studies, 18 indicators of avoidable mortality were identified. The conditions were divided into two groups: those mainly indicating an outcome of medical care and those mainly reflecting the effect of health policy. Age-standardized death rates were calculated for each indicator of avoidable mortality and for total mortality broken down by sex. Gender differences in death rates were studied. The annual trends in death rates were analysed using regression models. Results: For total mortality the death rates were 80% higher for males than for females. The largest gender differences were found among those conditions mainly reflecting the effects of health policy. For most medical care indicators the gender differences were fairly small. For several avoidable causes of death the gender differences decreased considerably and for some causes of death the differences were eliminated. Conclusions: The avoidable mortality method seems to be useful in continuous epidemiological surveillance of the equity in healthcare. The comparatively low gender differences for avoidable death indicators as well as the decrease in these differences indicate decreasing gender inequity in health.

We have developed a high-resolution map of population-to-service access in four districts of Kenya. Theoretical physical access, based upon national targets, developed as part of the Kenyan health sector reform agenda, was compared with actual health service usage data among 1668 paediatric patients attending 81 sampled government health facilities. Actual and theoretical use were highly correlated. Patients in the larger districts of Kwale and Makueni, where access to government health facilities was relatively poor, travelled greater mean distances than those in Greater Kisii and Bondo. More than 60% of the patients in the four districts attended health facilities within a 5-km range. Interpolated physical access surfaces across districts highlighted areas of poor access and large differences between urban and rural settings. Users from rural communities travelled greater distances to health facilities than those in urban communities. The implications of planning and monitoring equitable delivery of clinical services at national and international levels are discussed.

An in-depth analysis of the current health survey instruments in Europe together with a review of past research, found that, although harmonization in instruments appeared to exist superficially, major differences existed. Four instruments have been recommended (where necessary using existing instruments with modifications suggested by the research literature) covering physical and sensory functional limitations, activity restriction, self-perceived health and mental health. Additionally a new global activity limitation indicator (GALI) has been developed. These instruments are firmly anchored to past research and the health concepts behind the indicators and their relevance to policy and guidelines for implementation are explicitly made. The second phase of the project will recommend further instruments, leading to health expectancies that cover all the conceptual framework of population health measurement. This will allow assessment of health inequalities between the European Union countries, an appreciation of the causes and the production of profiles for each country in terms of the various facets of health.

Using Demographic and Health Survey data from over 60 low-income countries, this Study (1) presents global patterns of the level and inequality in child mortality and (2) investigates the determinants of child mortality, both at the national level and separately Cor urban and rural areas. The global patterns of health outcomes reveal two interesting observations. First, as child mortality declines, the gap ill mortality between the poor and the better-off widens. Second, while child mortality in rural areas is substantially higher than in urban areas, the reduction ill child mortality is much slower in rural areas where the poor are concentrated. This suggests that health interventions implemented in the past decade may not have been as effective as intended in reaching the poor. The analysis on mortality determination shows that at the national level access to electricity, incomes, vaccination in the first year of birth, and public health expenditure significantly reduce child mortality. The electricity effect is large and independent of the income effect. While in urban areas, access to electricity is the only significant mortality determinant, ill rural areas, vaccination in the first year of birth is the only significant factor.

How have gender inequality and discrimination against women affected the course of the HIV epidemic? This paper outlines the biological, social and cultural determinants that put women and adolescent girls at greater risk of HIV infection than men. Violence against women or the threat of violence often increases women's vulnerability to HIV/ AIDS. An analysis of the impact of gender on HIV/AIDS demonstrates the importance of integrating gender into HIV programming and finding ways to strengthen women by implementing policies and programs that increase their access to education and information.

Datasets from three household surveys carried out in 1993, 1995, and 1998 were used. Inequities were measured using illness and healthcare-use concentration indices. Self-reported adult illness was greater among the rich in 1993, but this was reversed to reflect higher levels of reported illness among the poor in 1995 and 1998. Inequities were observed in self-reported injury and disability/chronic illness that favour the rich. The poor also reported more days of sickness compared to the rich. Overall, there, were higher levels of use of doctors and hospital services by the rich, relative to their levels of reported illness. In contrast, there was a greater use of public-sector facilities by the poor. The time taken to reach a health facility also had a bias in favour of the rich. Although there were some favourable changes in the levels of inequities between the three time periods, there still remained considerable inequities that favoured the rich in self-reported adult illness and use of health services that need to be addressed. The consequences of higher concentration of chronic illness/disability and injury among the poor have far-reaching negative consequences on the socioeconomic welfare of the individuals and households. Redressing these inequities needs a holistic strategy that transcends the health sector.

GEGA places health equity squarely within a larger framework of social justice, linking findings on socioeconomic and health inequalities with differentials in power, wealth, and prestige in society. The Alliance's 11 country-level partners, called Equity Gauges, share a common action-based vision and framework called the Equity Gauge Strategy. An Equity Gauge seeks to reduce health inequities through three broad spheres of action, referred to as the 'pillars' of the Equity Gauge Strategy, which define a set of interconnected and overlapping actions. Measuring and tracking the inequalities and interpreting their ethical import are pursued through the Assessment and Monitoring pillar. This information provides an evidence base that can be used in strategic ways for influencing policy-makers through actions in the Advocacy pillar and for supporting grassroots groups and civil society through actions in the Community Empowerment pillar. The paper provides examples of strategies for promoting pro-equity policy and social change and reviews experiences and lessons, both in terms of technical success of interventions and in relation to the conceptual development and refinement of the Equity Gauge Strategy and overall direction of the Alliance. To become most effective in furthering health equity at both national and global levels, the Alliance must now reach out to and involve a wider range of organizations, groups, and actors at both national and international levels. Sustainability of this promising experiment depends, in part, on adequate resources but also on the ability to attract and develop talented leadership.

This study aims to give a comprehensive overview of educational and income inequalities in morbidity among the elderly of eleven European countries. Data from the first wave of 1994 of the European Community Household Panel were used. The study population comprised a total of 14,107 men and 17,243 women, divided into three age groups: 60-69, 70-79 and 80+. Three health indicators were used: self-assessed health, cut down in daily activities due to a physical or mental problem, and long-term disability. The results indicate that socioeconomic inequalities in morbidity by education and income exist among the elderly in Europe, in all the countries in this study and all age groups, including the oldest old. Inequalities decline with age among women, but not always among men. Greece, Ireland, Italy and The Netherlands most often show large inequalities among men, and Greece, Ireland and Spain do so among women. To conclude, inequalities in morbidity decrease with age, but a substantive part persists in old age. To improve the health of elderly people it is important that the material, social and cultural resources of the elderly are improved. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objectives of the study were to examine the notion that the burden of disease is broadly similar without regard to country, environment, gender or socio-economic status and to develop detailed descriptions of the experiences of the burden of disease as they related to these contextual factors. The study was a multi-factorial exploratory study employing qualitative and quantitative techniques to obtain data on the effects of country (development), environment (urban versus rural), gender and socio-economic status on people with paraplegia. The data provided an extensive and detailed compilation of context rich descriptions of living with paraplegia. Striking features of the data were the differences between countries with respect to the impact of the health conditions on functioning and highlight a context in which paraplegia of like clinical severity can be fatal in one environment and not in another. While there has been some focus on the control of social determinants of disease, there has been little work on the social determinants of the severity of disease. The underlying assumptions of the DALY, which ignore context in the assessment of the burden of disease, risk exacerbating inequalities by undervaluing the burden of disease in less-developed countries. There is a need to continue to subject the development of indicators to rigorous debate to determine a balance between the assumption of a global "average social milieu" and the treatment of each individual as belonging to their own context in the assessment of population health in order for indicators to be meaningful cross-culturally.

J	Ziv, A; Wolpe, PR; Small, SD; Glick, S				Ziv, A; Wolpe, PR; Small, SD; Glick, S			Simulation-based medical education: An ethical imperative	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							CLINICAL COMPETENCE; ROLE-PLAY; ERRORS; CONSENT; SKILLS; CONSULTATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; OSCE	Medical training must at some point use live patients to hone the skills of health professionals. But there is also an obligation to provide optimal treatment and to ensure patients' safety and well-being. Balancing these two needs represents a fundamental ethical tension in medical education. Simulation-based learning can help mitigate this tension by developing health professionals' knowledge, skills, and attitudes while protecting patients from unnecessary risk. Simulation-based training has been institutionalized in other high-hazard professions, such as aviation, nuclear power, and the military, to maximize training safety and minimize risk. Health care has lagged behind in simulation applications for a number of reasons, including cost, lack of rigorous proof of effect, and resistance to change. Recently, the international patient safety movement and the U.S. federal policy agenda have created a receptive atmosphere for expanding the use of simulators in medical training, stressing the ethical imperative to "first do no harm" in the face of validated, large epidemiological studies describing unacceptable preventable injuries to patients as a result of medical management. Four themes provide a framework for an ethical analysis of simulation-based medical education: best standards of care and training, error management and patient safety, patient autonomy, and social justice and resource allocation. These themes are examined from the perspectives of patients, learners, educators, and society. The use of simulation wherever feasible conveys a critical educational and ethical message to all: patients are to be protected whenever possible and they are not commodities to be used as conveniences of training.

Improvements in health outcomes have not been shared equally among countries and poverty is clearly the main reason. Infectious diseases, which remain the major cause of death worldwide, are an incalculable source of human misery and economic loss. In fact, 25% of all deaths and 30% of the global burden of disease are attributed to infectious diseases. Unfortunately, more than 95% of these deaths, most of which are preventable, occur in the developing world, where poverty is widespread. The 3 major infectious disease killers in these countries are HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The principles of social justice and health as a human right in the developing world have been advocated as the main justification for health assistance from rich to poor countries. Although we do not disagree with this, we argue that a strategy that emphasizes the shared benefit to rich and poor countries would facilitate this process. We propose that the accomplishment of these challenging tasks should be viewed from the perspective of game theory, where the interests of the parties (in this case rich and poor countries) overlap. As the world becomes increasingly integrated, economic development in resource-poor countries will increase the opportunities for richer countries to profit from investment in the developing world. Global health has political and international security implications for the developed world, as well. In view of the current health status of the developing world, we are not playing a game but facing a matter of life and death. "When health is absent, wisdom cannot reveal itself, art cannot becomes manifest, strength cannot fight, wealth becomes useless, and intelligence cannot be applied" Herophilus, 325 (BCE) (Physician to Alexander the Great) The purpose of this article is to address the relationship between health, poverty, and development in the context of game theory. We will focus on the link between economic inequalities and health outcomes, exclusively concentrating our analysis on the impact of infectious diseases. Subsequently, we will outline the game, the players, and the potential win-win outcomes that may potentially result.

Although environmental risks are experienced disproportionately by people in developing countries, environmental health research (EHR) is conducted primarily in developed countries. Human subjects participate in five main types of EHR: (1) documentation and quantification of exposure to potentially hazardous substances; (2) elucidation of biological responses to these materials; (3) characterization and measurement of susceptibility to harmful effects of hazardous materials; (4) trials involving environmental interventions to reduce risk; and (5) documentation and measurement of various manifestations of disease putatively linked to environmental exposures. Although existing frameworks for the ethics of international clinical research are generally relevant to EHR, they currently lack the specificity necessary to confront three inherent problems in EHR, namely under-determination in EHR findings, the unavoidable nature of some environmental hazards, and environmental justice implications. We examine these issues as they relate to community partnership, risk assessment, and the assessment and management of economic and political interests in EHR. We believe that there are 3 general features of ethical EHR, it has health promoting value, the populations studied are not restricted in their ability to avoid environmental hazards by economic or political repression, and the justification for conducting EHR on populations with known exposure to environmental hazards gets stronger as the limits on populations to reduce the hazards or remove themselves from them becomes greater, as long as the first and second conditions are also met.

J	Struble, MB; Aomari, LD				Struble, MB; Aomari, LD			Position of the American Dietetic Association: Addressing world hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION			English	Article							ENVIRONMENT; POPULATION; SECURITY	It is the position of the American Dietetic Association (ADA) that access to adequate amounts of safe, nutritious, and culturally appropriate food at all times is a fundamental human right. Hunger continues to be a worldwide problem of staggering proportions. The Association supports programs and encourages practices that combat hunger and malnutrition, produce food security, promote self-sufficiency, and are environmentally and economically sustainable. The Association is aware that hunger exists in a world of plenty and that poverty, gender inequity, ethnocentrism, racism, and the Jack of political will are key constraints to solving the problems of global hunger and malnutrition. Recognizing that simplistic approaches are inadequate, the ADA identifies sustainable development as the long-term strategy to ending world hunger and achieving food security. Sustainable development requires political, economic, and social changes that include empowering the disenfranchised, widening access to assets and other resources, narrowing the gap between rich and poor, and adjusting consumption patterns so as to foster good stewardship of nature. Additionally, because the health status of future generations is related to the well-being of their mothers, achieving food security will also require increased access for women to education, adequate health care and sanitation, and economic opportunities. This position paper reviews the complex issues of global food insecurity and discusses long-term solutions for achieving world food security. Achieving the end of world hunger has been and is now within our grasp. There is sufficient food to feed everyone, and solutions can be realized now that will benefit all of humanity. As noted in the paper, most people who examine the costs of ending versus not ending world hunger are bewildered by the question of why humanity did not solve the problem a long time ago. The Association supports programs and encourages practices that combat hunger and malnutrition, produce food security, promote self-sufficiency, respect local cultures, and are environmentally and economically sustainable. The ADA recognizes that decisions and actions that dietetics professionals make as practitioners and consumers can, help reduce the extent of poverty and hunger both here and abroad. This paper provides information, resources, and strategies to assist dietetics professionals in improving the public's understanding of key issues, becoming advocates of the poor, and influencing the political will to end world hunger.

The health economics literature, however, tends to overlook the positive analysis of decision making often assuming particular social objectives that may or may not correspond with reality. This perhaps explains why exercises in health economics priority setting on occasions break down. This study is a positive analysis of group decision making. It examines the process of deliberating upon proposed changes to funding arrangements across Divisions of General Practice in Queensland, Australia. Existing levels of funding had, for a number of years, largely been determined by an allocation formula. The motivation for this study was a perceived inequity created by the long-term under-funding of smaller (resource poor or 'marginal') Divisions. The challenge in this project was that any change in funding arrangements required the support of all the Divisions but also would potentially create 'winners' and 'losers'. Decision making within such an institutional context was rendered a zero sum game. This paper documents a consultative process whereby the relevant stakeholders, with clear interests in any decision, were asked to participate in deliberations as to how such a problem should be tackled. The objective was, in the face of adverse incentives, to derive recommendations for addressing existing shortfalls experienced by some of these Divisions. The process involved encouraging relevant players to take into consideration the global allocation issues and to move beyond their localised interests. The results indicate that such a process can be effective in not only generating the necessary goodwill to enable such group decision making, but also in establishing a more realistic set of policy recommendations.

Poor children are more likely than their better-off peers to be exposed to health risks, and they have less resistance to disease because of undernutrition and other hazards typical in poor communities. These inequities are compounded by reduced access to preventive and curative interventions. Even public subsidies for health frequently benefit rich people more than poor people. Experience and evidence about how to reach poor populations are growing, albeit largely through small-scale case studies. Successful approaches include those that improve geographic access to health interventions in poor communities, subsidised health care and health inputs, and social marketing. Targeting of health Interventions to poor people and ensuring universal coverage are promising approaches for improvement of equity, but both have limitations that necessitate planning for child survival and effective delivery at national level and below. Regular monitoring of inequities and use of the resulting information for education, advocacy, and increased accountability among the general public and decision makers is urgently needed, but will not be sufficient. Equity must be a priority in the design of child survival interventions and delivery strategies, and mechanisms to ensure accountability at national and international levels must be developed.

Lately, indigenous Oaxacan women have become a predominant part of this diaspora in the United States. Driven by economic desperation most arrive across the border as undocumented persons that configure them into multiple liminal spaces inimical to health and well-being. This article provides a venue for some of their voices to be heard, some major concerns understood, and for proposing links between postcolonial Mexico, neoliberal globalization, and immigration border policy as driving forces that undergird these conditions. An emancipatory praxis of nursing to promote health and reduce suffering within transnational migrants is proposed as a starting place for future nursing scholarship.

The asbestos industry thrived in France until the health effects of asbestos exposure were made public. At that time, the industry had already moved its mining and manufacture to developing countries, where they were able to take advantage of limited regulation and enforcement of occupational and environmental laws. The author analyzes the compensation systems that were approached with varying degrees of success by the victims of asbestos exposure. France banned all manufacture and use of asbestos in 1997, and in the years that have followed, it has enjoyed many successes in achieving compensation for asbestos victims.

J	Galtry, J				Galtry, J			The impact on breastfeeding of labour market policy and practice in Ireland, Sweden, and the USA	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						breastfeeding; parental leave; family and medical leave; gender equity; early childhood services; Ireland; Sweden; USA	HEALTH; WORK; EMPLOYMENT; WOMEN; TIME	In recent decades there has been a marked rise in the labour market participation of women with infants in many countries. Partly in response to this trend, there are calls for greater emphasis on infant and child health in research and policy development on parental leave and other work-family balancing measures. Yet achieving high rates of breastfeeding as a health objective has thus far received relatively little attention in this context. Biomedical literature outlines the important health benefits conferred by breastfeeding, including upon infants and young children among middle class populations in developed countries. International recommendations now advise exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. However, research indicates that the timing of the mother's resumption of employment is a key factor influencing the duration of exclusive breastfeeding. There would thus appear to be considerable potential for labour policy and practice, particularly maternity/parental leave provisions, to positively influence breastfeeding practice. Taking the case studies of Ireland, Sweden, and the United States, this paper explores the implications of labour market and early childhood policy for breastfeeding practice. The equity tensions posed by the breastfeeding-maternal employment intersection are also examined. The paper concludes that both socio-cultural support and labour market/health/early childhood policy are important if high rates of both breastfeeding and women's employment are to be achieved in industrialised countries.

These challenges include the technology divide, economic disparity, ecological changes, urbanization and industrialization, globalization, political instability, population explosion, and gender inequality. The paper paints a scenario of tropical pediatrics into the year 2015. Problems brought about by both underdevelopment and modernization, with urbanization and industrialization, will persist. Infectious diseases will continue to be the leading causes of deaths. The paper presents some significant achievements in the fight against tropical diseases and tries to predict what future progress will contribute to the alleviation of such diseases. The paper also outlines the commitment of the International Society of Tropical Pediatrics (ISTP) to improve the state of tropical pediatrics in the next 15 years.

City-specific Poisson regression analyses of daily noninjury mortality were fit with predictors of mean daily apparent temperature (a construct reflecting physiologic effects of temperature and humidity), time, barometric pressure, day of the week, and particulate matter less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter. Percentage change in mortality was calculated at 29degreesC apparent temperature (lag 0) and at -5degreesC (mean of lags 1, 2, and 3) relative to 15degreesC. Separate models were fit to death counts stratified by age, race, gender, education, and place of death. Effect estimates were combined across cities, treating city as a random effect. Deaths among Blacks compared with Whites, deaths among the less educated, and deaths outside a hospital were more strongly associated with hot and cold temperatures, but gender made no difference. Stronger cold associations were found for those less than age 65 years, but heat effects did not vary by age. The strongest effect modifier was place of death for heat, with out-of-hospital effects more than five times greater than in-hospital deaths, supporting the biologic plausibility of the associations. Place of death, race, and educational attainment indicate vulnerability to temperature-related mortality, reflecting inequities in health impacts related to climate change.

The objective of this study is to arrive at a systematic assessment of the extent to which the first batch of interim PRSPs actually addresses the health of the poor and vulnerable. A literature study was used to design and test a semi-quantitative approach to assess the pro-poor focus of health policies in national documents. The approach was applied to the existing interim proposals for 23 Highly Indebted Poor Countries. Results show that a majority of proposals lack country-specific data on the distribution and composition of the burden of disease, a clear identification of health system constraints and an assessment of the impact of health services on the population. More importantly, they make little effort to analyze these issues in relation to the poor. Furthermore, only a small group explicitly includes the interests of the poor in health policy design. Attention to policies aiming at enhancing equity in public health spending is even more limited. Few papers that include expenditure proposals also show pro-poor focused health budgets. We conclude that our systematic assessment of a new international development policy instrument, PRSP, raises strong concerns about the attributed role of health in development and the limited emphasis on the poor, the supposed primary beneficiaries of this instrument. There is a need and an opportunity for the international development community to provide assistance and inputs as poor countries shift their policy thinking from an interim stage to fully developed national policies. This paper presents a menu of analytical and policy options that can be pursued.

This work is of interest to public health efforts in Switzerland as well as for co-operative international research into the determinants of socioeconomic differentials in health and mortality. Methods This study is based on a longitudinal data set from the Swiss National Cohort, currently incorporating a probabilistic record linkage of the 1990 Swiss census, and all subsequent deaths until the end of 1997. The Study population covers all Swiss nationals aged greater than or equal to25 years living in German speaking Switzerland, with 19.7 million person-years and 296 929 deaths observed. Educational gradients were analysed using standardized mortality ratios, multiple logistic regression, and the Relative Index of inequality (RII). Results There were sizeable gradients in mortality by education for all age groups and both sexes. The mortality odds ratio decreased by 7.2% (95% Cl: 7.0-7.5%) per additional year of education for men, and by 6.0% (95% Cl: 5.6-6.3%) for women. in men, we found a steady decrease of the gradient from 13.1% (95% Cl: 11.9-14.4%) in the age group 25-39 to 4.5% (95% Cl: 4.0-5.0%) in the age group greater than or equal to75 years. For women in the age groups under 65 the gradients were smaller; over the age of 40 there was no decrease with increasing age. These results were fairly insensitive to variations in the parameters of record linkage. Conclusions Despite a comparatively low overall mortality, Swiss men in the 1990s show larger relative gradients in mortality by education than men in other European countries in the 1980s, with the possible exception of younger men in Italy. In Switzerland there is a sizeable potential for further increasing overall life expectancy by reducing the mortality of those with a lower educational level. The results presented contribute to a reliable assessment of socioeconomic mortality differentials in Europe.

Recent findings Increasingly, there is recognition among health professionals, the judiciary and the public that it is possible to design a system of drug control that has less of an emphasis on criminal law. However, for countries contemplating models of drug law other than strict prohibition, the three main international drug treaties limit the scope of changes to domestic laws. During the past 25 years alcohol policies have shifted from reducing the total population consumption to addressing risky drinking situations and patterns of use in order to reduce alcohol-related problems. With regard to drug use, the evidence supports needle and syringe provision schemes in the community; prison drug substitution treatment and needle exchange programmes; removal of criminal penalties for minor cannabis offences; and supervised injecting facilities in localized areas with open, public drug scenes and associated amenity problems. Schemes that divert drug offenders from the criminal justice system to treatment are increasingly common, but their effectiveness is yet to be demonstrated. Provision of naloxone hydrochloride to heroin users and their friends and family to aid in management of heroin overdose has promise, but more research is needed before widespread distribution can be advocated. Summary Clinical and research practitioners should use their influence to call for policy that facilitates interventions that have been shown to be effective in reducing drug-related harm.

Heavily subsidised farmers in rich countries produce sufficient surplus food to feed the hungry, but not at a price the poor can afford. Even donating the rich world's surplus to the poor would not solve the problem. Most poor people earn their living from agriculture, so a deluge of free food would destroy their livelihoods. Thus, the only answer to world hunger is to safeguard and improve the productivity of farmers in poor countries. Diets of subsistence level farmers in Africa and Latin America often contain sufficient carbohydrates ( through cassava, corn/maize, rice, wheat, etc.), but are poor in proteins. Dietary proteins can take the form of scarce animal products ( eggs, milk, meat, etc.), but are usually derived from legumes ( plants of the bean and pea family). Legumes are vital in agriculture as they form associations with bacteria that 'fix-nitrogen' from the air. Effectively this amounts to internal fertilisation and is the main reason that legumes are richer in proteins than all other plants. Thousands of legume species exist but more common beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are eaten than any other. In some countries such as Mexico and Brazil, beans are the primary source of protein in human diets. As half the grain legumes consumed worldwide are common beans, they represent the species of choice for the study of grain legume nutrition. Unfortunately, the yields of common beans are low even by the standards of legumes, and the quality of their seed proteins is sub-optimal. Most probably this results from millennia of selection for stable rather than high yield, and as such, is a problem that can be redressed by modern genetic techniques. We have formed an international consortium called 'Phaseomics' to establish the necessary framework of knowledge and materials that will result in disease-resistant, stress-tolerant, high-quality protein and high-yielding beans. Phaseomics will be instrumental in improving living conditions in deprived regions of Africa and the Americas. It will contribute to social equity and sustainable development and enhance inter- and intra-cultural understanding, knowledge and relationships. A major goal of Phaseomics is to generate new common bean varieties that are not only suitable for but also desired by the local farmer and consumer communities. Therefore, the socio-economic dimension of improved bean production and the analysis of factors influencing the acceptance of novel varieties will be an integral part of the proposed research ( see Figure 1). Here, we give an overview of the economic and nutritional importance of common beans as a food crop. Priorities and targets of current breeding programmes are outlined, along with ongoing efforts in genomics. Recommendations for an international coordinated effort to join knowledge, facilities and expertise in a variety of scientific undertakings that will contribute to the overall goal of better beans are given. To be rapid and effective, plant breeding programmes (i.e., those that involve crossing two different 'parents') rely heavily on molecular 'markers'. These genetic landmarks are used to position important genes ( e. g. for resistance to particular pests, for yield, etc.) on a chromosome and ensure that they can be 'crossed in' to another plant. There are several ways of obtaining molecular markers but the project will establish partial sequences of messenger RNA's extracted from tissues of interest ( e. g. developing pods). These so-called expressed sequence-tags ( ESTs), can be used like milestones on a chromosome, to position these and othe These efforts will complement current studies on other legumes such as Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula as well as the EST projects in soybean by providing a framework for comparative genomics between legumes. Complete sequencing and molecular analysis of the bean genome will follow. Individual laboratories will be encouraged to internally finance or find additional funding for the construction of cDNA libraries and the sequencing of thousands ESTs. Funds donated to the consortium will be used primarily for sequencing the genome and to co-ordinate the consortium's activities. As sequence and expression data become available it will provide an elaborate framework for plant geneticists to 'design' new, improved common bean lines. Amongst these lines will be higher-yielding varieties, cultivars that are resistant to drought, pests and so on. It will also be possible to enhance the content of essential amino acids, minerals and vitamins in the seeds and so improve the nutrition and health of countless people who consume beans. By considering the socio-economic implications of common bean improvement from the outset, this project should lead to sustainable development, to increased social equity, and to greater use of beans in international trade. The added value in this innovative approach to common beans as model food legumes lies in the combination of existing and novel genetic approaches with socio-economic criteria that will efficiently target the end users.

J	Collins, T				Collins, T			Globalization, global health, and access to healthcare	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						globalization; global health; access to healthcare		It is now commonly realized that the globalization of the world economy is shaping the patterns of global health, and that associated morbidity and mortality is affecting countries' ability to achieve economic growth. The globalization of public health has important implications for access to essential healthcare. The rise of inequalities among and within countries negatively affects access to healthcare. Poor people use healthcare services less frequently when sick than do the rich. The negative impact of globalization on access to healthcare is particularly well demonstrated in countries of transitional economies. No longer protected by a centralized health sector that provided free universal access to services for everyone, large segments of the populations in the transition period found themselves denied even the most basic medical services. Only countries where regulatory institutions are strong, domestic markets are competitive and social safety nets are in place, have a good chance to enjoy the health benefits of globalization.

J	Carpenter, M				Carpenter, M			On the edge: The fate of progressive modernization in Greek health policy	INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW			English	Article						comparative health policy; Greece	REFORM; CARE	The fate of the Greek National Health System (ESY) of 1983 is analyzed by placing its development within a dynamic account of the interaction between national policy processes, international pressures from above and mobilizations from below. While Greece, despite limited economic development, laid the foundations for a health system by the end of the interwar period, rightist Greek governments, propped up by the USA failed to build on this in favorable economic circumstances after World War II. The Greek Socialist Party (PASOK) sought late in the day in 1983 to construct the ESY in difficult international political-economic circumstances. It experienced considerable resistance from domestic vested interests, and made political errors, which magnified inefficiencies and inequities, and more recently lost another opportunity to reform the system in the mid-1990s.

Design: Conceptual discussion. Setting, Patients/Participants, and Main results: not applicable. Conclusions: For the purposes of measurement and operationalisation, equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage - that is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health; health is essential to wellbeing and to overcoming other effects of social disadvantage. Equity is an ethical principle; it also is consonant with and closely related to human rights principles. The proposed definition of equity supports operationalisation of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as indicated by the health status of the most socially advantaged group. Assessing health equity requires comparing health and its social determinants between more and less advantaged social groups. These comparisons are essential to assess whether national and international policies are leading toward or away from greater social justice in health.

Notes on the penalization of poverty in Brazil	PUNISHMENT & SOCIETY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PENOLOGY			English	Article						Americanization; Brazil; inequality; neoliberalism; penal policy; poverty; prison; violence	VIOLENCE	Like many countries of the Second World caught in the throes of post-Fordism before they could reap the full benefits of Fordist-style development, Brazil is tempted to import the US-style discourse and policy of 'zero tolerance' because, enshrouded in the aura emanating from America as the world's sole symbolic superpower and global Mecca of crime control, they appear cutting edge, effective and efficient; and because they are the indispensable order-maintenance counterpart to policies of economic deregulation and fiscal austerity adopted by Latin American countries under the press of international financial agencies. But in Brazil, as in neighboring nations, this borrowing promises to produce a social catastrophe of historic proportions because the depth and scale of urban poverty are much greater, violent crime is more prevalent and more entrenched in the history and economy of the country, and because the Brazilian police is not a remedy against violence but a major source of violence in its own right. Moreover, Brazil does not possess a rationalized court system capable of ensuring minimal protection of constitutional rights and its prisons are plagued by fantastic overcrowding, gross lack of access to food, hygiene and health and inordinately high levels of brutality, akin to concentration camps for the disruptive fractions of the (sub) proletariat. Under such conditions, to respond to the disorders generated by the rise of absolute and relative poverty associated with incorporation in the emergent neoliberal global order with the penal apparatus is tantamount to instituting a chaotic dictatorship over the poor, and therefore antithetical to the project of nation building on a pacified and democratic basis.

Method: Predictors of service use were recorded at baseline, and service use itself at 12-month follow-up, in a representative sample (N =7076) of the Dutch population, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: People with more education were less likely to use primary care but more likely to use mental health care. The effects on both types of care remained significant after adjustment for mental disorder and functional impairment. Lower education tended to strengthen the association between mood or anxiety disorder and primary care use. Conclusion: Further research on inequalities in service use will benefit from additional explanatory analyses and from the inclusion of sociopsychological variables, like cost-benefit considerations in decisions to use services.

J	David, HP; Russo, NF				David, HP; Russo, NF			Psychology, population, and reproductive behavior	AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article								This special section on international perspectives in psychology focuses on population issues and reproductive behavior across national and cultural boundaries, emphasizing the responsibility of psychologists and colleagues in related disciplines to generate and communicate culturally mindful findings likely to shape public health policy and improve human well-being. After considering the historical and policy context, it highlights internationally collaborative research projects in the Czech Republic, Egypt, Mexico, and the United States that address reproductive behavior, women's roles and status, responsible parenthood, and abortion legislation in terms of cultural context, gender equity, the needs of adolescents, and public health policy. The articles illustrate the importance of the cultural context within which psychological research is conducted and how psychology can be informed by international perspectives.

J	Murphy, EM				Murphy, EM			Being born female is dangerous for your health	AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article							ABORTIONS; WOMEN	In this article, the author explores how gender inequity is manifested in poor reproductive and mental health outcomes, including unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, maternal mortality, sexually transmitted infections, depression, and psychosomatic symptoms. Briefly described is a landmark 1994 United Nations conference emphasizing that gender inequity adversely affects women's reproductive health, particularly in developing countries, and the implementation of its recommendations is tracked. Although there is increased recognition of oppression's toll on women's physical and emotional health as well as their intellectual and social potential, progress toward equity goals is uneven and slow. Psychologists as a group play many roles-for example, in research, education, policy, law, communications, industry, international development, and private practice-through which they can make professional contributions to gender equity as a focus or underlying principle.

J	Helliwell, JF				Helliwell, JF			How's life? Combining individual and national variables to explain subjective well-being	ECONOMIC MODELLING			English	Article						subjective well-being; social capital; international comparisons	INCOME INEQUALITY; AMERICAN-DREAM; HAPPINESS; MORTALITY; HEALTH	This paper attempts to explain international trends and differences in subjective well-being over the final fifth of the twentieth century. This is done in several stages. First there is a brief review of some reasons for giving a central role to subjective measures of well-being. This is followed by sections containing a survey of earlier empirical studies, a description of the main variables used in this study, a report of results and tests, discussion of the links among social capital, education and well-being, and concluding comments. The main innovation of the paper, relative to earlier studies of subjective well-being, lies in its use of large international samples of individual respondents, thus permitting the simultaneous identification of individual-level and societal-level determinants of well-being. This is particularly useful in identifying direct and indirect linkages between social capital and wellbeing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

J	Williams, L; Labonte, R; O'Brien, M				Williams, L; Labonte, R; O'Brien, M			Empowering social action through narratives of identity and culture	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						culture; empowerment; narrative; social action	HEALTH PROMOTION	Concern at widening health and wealth inequities between communities accompanying processes of globalization in recent years are reflected in contemporary definitions of health promotion, premised on the stratagem of individuals and communities increasing control over factors that determine health, thereby improving their health status. Such community empowerment practice is commonly accepted within the health promotion literature as encompassing intrapersonal, interpersonal and socio-political elements. Less articulated and understood, however, are the processes whereby the identities and cultures of marginalized communities intersect with and reverberate through these levels of action. The potential of identity and culture as important individual and community resources within social action takes on further significance within global-ized contexts, which simultaneously expose marginalized communities to dominant cultural power relations while affording members new avenues for cultural expression. In this paper we highlight culture and identity as important aspects of the empowerment process, drawing on the experiences of migrant Tongan and Samoan women throughout a social action process in Aotearoa/New Zealand. In particular, narratives of identity and culture within storytelling as an empowerment practice are explicated, as is the articulation of identity and culture within more structurally orientated power relations throughout subsequent activities related to policy advocacy.

J	De Baets, P				De Baets, P			The labour inspection of Belgium, the United Kingdom and Sweden in a comparative perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW			English	Article								This limited comparative study on labour inspection in Belgium, the United Kingdom and Sweden is dominated by a criminological approach. This is not an obvious point of view. Labour inspectorates tend to avoid criminal law and the criminal justice system to resolve occupational health and safety problems. Enforcing occupational health and safety standards, however, should not be considered as a merely technical matter. The increasing international popularity of occupational health and safety management schemes at enterprise level coexists with the growing European awareness that labour inspectorates will have to come down hard on employers who breach legislation that protects workers. Quality of work has become a political priority again and it may affect future inspection efforts considerably. The final outcome remains unclear at the moment, but the functions of labour inspection have unmistakably been set in motion. Administrative authorities appear to play an important role in this, because they provide the necessary impetus with regard to steering. Much attention is paid to the link between the institutional framework on the one hand and law enforcement strategies on the other. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We rely on standardized height as our health indicator since it avoids the measurement pitfalls of more traditional measures of health such as morbidity, mortality, and life expectancy. It also avoids measurement problems associated with using monetary variables such as income or expenditure across time or place to compare welfare. Our calculation of world height inequality indicates that, in contrast with similar research on income inequality, within-country variation is the source of most inequality, rather than the differences between countries.

Between 1995 and 1999, a multisectoral intervention called Plan Cayo Hueso was launched in the inner-city community of Cayo Hueso in Havana, Cuba, to address a variety of health determinants. To provide a better understanding of the political structures and processes involved, the Cuban context is described briefly. The interventions included improvements in housing, municipal infrastructure, and social and cultural activities. A qualitative study, consisting of interviews of key informants as well as community members, was conducted to evaluate the community participatory process. Questions from an extensive household survey pre-and postintervention that had been conducted in Cayo Hueso and a comparison community to assess the effectiveness of the intervention also informed the analysis of community participation, as did three community workshops held to choose indicators for evaluating effectiveness and to discuss findings.. It was found that formal leaders led the interventions, providing the,institutional driving force behind the plan. However, extensive community involvement occurred as the project took advantage of the existing community-based organizations, which played an active role in mobilizing community members and enhanced linkage systems critical to the project's success. Women played fairly traditional roles in interventions outside their households, but bad equivalent roles to men in interventions within their household units. Most impressive about this project was the extent of mobilization to participate and the multidimensional ecosystem approach adopted. Indeed, Plan Cayo Hueso involved a massive mobilization of international, national, and community resources to address the needs of this community. This, as well as the involvement of community residents in the evaluation process, was seen as resulting in improved social interactions and community well-being and enhanced capacity for future action. While Cuba is unique in many respects, the lessons learned about enhancing community participation in urban health intervention projects, as well as in their evaluation, are applicable worldwide.

Although older forms of outpatient commitment have both legal and therapeutic advantages, preventive outpatient commitment raises serious legal problems and potential antitherapeutic consequences that may outweigh its claimed therapeutic value. As a result, alternatives are proposed, including wider availability of community treatment and outreach and case management services, assertive community treatment, police and mental health court diversion programs, and creative uses of advanced directive instruments and behavioral contracting. Proposals also are made for how preventive outpatient commitment can be applied more therapeutically, including hearings that accord patients a sense of procedural justice and techniques designed to motivate individuals facing such hearings to agree to accept treatment voluntarily.

Method: Cost-of-illness findings from the Low Prevalence Disorders Study (LPDS), and related service use and psychosocial data, are used to highlight patterns of expenditure on psychosis and potential resource allocation issues. Arguments are also presented suggesting that mental health resource allocation in Australia should be informed primarily by treatment efficiency, equity and humanitarian considerations, not differences in the global burden of disease. However, our evidence-base about the effectiveness and costs associated with individual treatments, programmes, and organizational structures is also shown to be limited. Conclusions: The patterns of service use and expenditure on psychosis suggest certain imbalances, including an over-reliance on hospitalization, low levels of supported community accommodation, and inadequate provision of evidence-based psychosocial treatments, rehabilitation and supported employment programmes. We need to identify and develop efficient interventions and programmes, re-orientate our services to better utilize those interventions, increase community awareness, improve monitoring of outcomes and costs, and undertake timely evaluations at multiple levels, from the individual to the societal perspective.

This paper describes the national and global causes and health consequences of these phenomena. Causes include overpopulation, pollution, deforestation, global warming, unsustainable agricultural and fishing practices, overconsumption, maldistribution of wealth, the rise of the corporation, the Third World debt crisis, and militarization and wars. Consequences include increased poverty, overcrowding, famine, weather extremes, species loss, acute and chronic medical illnesses, war and human rights abuses, and an increasingly unstable global situation that portends Malthusian chaos and disaster. Because of their scientific training, and due to their privileged socioeconomic status, physicians are in a unique position to recognize these phenomena and to act at all levels, from interactions with their patients, to volunteerism, to service and intervention in areas of great need, to direct political activism and involvement. Specific suggestions for action are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pfeiffer, J				Pfeiffer, J			International NGOs and primary health care in Mozambique: the need for a new model of collaboration	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						NGOs; Mozambique; international aid; primary health care; social inequality	MANAGING EXTERNAL RESOURCES; WORLD-BANK; SECTOR; AID; ORGANIZATIONS; POLICY	In keeping with the neo-liberal emphasis on privatization, international aid has been increasingly channeled through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and their expatriate technical experts to support primary health care (PHC) in the developing world. Relationships between international aid workers and their local counterparts have thus become critical aspects of PHC and its effectiveness. However, these important social dynamics of PHC remain understudied by social scientists. Based on three years of participant-observation in Mozambique, this paper presents an ethnographic case study of these relationships in one central province. The Mozambique experience reveals that the deluge of NGOs and their expatriate workers over the last decade has fragmented the local health system, undermined local control of health programs, and contributed to growing local social inequality., Since national health system salaries plummeted over the same period as a result of structural adjustment, health workers became vulnerable to financial favors offered by NGOs seeking to promote their projects in turf struggles with other agencies. It is argued that new aid management strategies, while necessary, will not be sufficient to remedy the fragmentation of the health sector. A new model for collaboration between expatriate aid workers and their local counterparts in the developing world is urgently needed that centers on the building of long-term equitable professional relationships in a sustainable adequately funded public sector. The case study presented here illustrates how the NGO model undermines the establishment of these relationships that are so vital to successful development assistance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

METHODS: Manitoba and Iowa cancer registries, respectively, provided a total of 2,383 and 1,545 women with breast cancer (1984 to 1992, followed until December 31, 1997). Socioeconomic data for each person's residence at the time of diagnosis was taken from Population Censuses. RESULTS: Socioeconomic status and breast cancer survival were directly associated in the US cohort, but not in the Canadian cohort. Compared with similar patients in Des Moines, residents of the lowest fifth of income areas in Winnipeg experienced a significant 5-year survival advantage (survival rate ratio [SRR] = 1.14). In these lowest income areas, the Canadian survival advantage was larger among women aged 25 to 64 years (SRR = 1.23), and this was observed in the middle fifth of income area, among this younger cohort (SRR = 1.11). The Canadian survival advantage even seemed apparent in the poorest neighborhoods with relatively high representations of Aboriginal people (SRR = 1.16). CONCLUSION: This study replicated the finding of advantaged Canadian cancer survival in smaller metropolitan areas that had been consistently observed in larger metropolitan areas. Canada's single payer health care system seems to offer similar advantages across a number of diverse urban contexts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Morgen, S; Maskovsky, J				Morgen, S; Maskovsky, J			The anthropology of welfare "reform": New perspectives on US urban poverty in the post-welfare era	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Review						neoliberalism; difference; inequality; policy; women	UNITED-STATES; ETHNOGRAPHY; DEVOLUTION; STREET; GENDER; HEALTH; POOR; CARE	Anthropological research on welfare restructuring differs from most poverty research conducted by U.S. policy analysts and many other social scientists by its situating the study of welfare "reform" within an examination of the production of poverty and inequality at the center of the global system of advanced capitalism. In this review we examine urban poverty and welfare-state restructuring in relation to the ascent of neoliberalism, including the rise of market-oriented assumptions about social value, productivity, and investment that dominate civic life and public policy. We focus primarily, though not exclusively, on the United States. After a brief review of four theoretical frameworks that inform ethnographic research on welfare, we explore five approaches or themes in anthropological studies of welfare restructuring in the United States: (a) the ethnographic challenge to claims of policy success by documenting an unfolding crisis in social reproduction for the poor; (b) deconstructing the hegemonic discourse on welfare restructuring and juxtaposing it with the lived realities of impoverished households; (c) contesting and moving beyond the behaviorism of mainstream poverty research; (d) exploring the multiple perspectives of those differently situated within the welfare-state apparatus; and (e) theorizing the relationship between welfare restructuring and an eroding social citizenship of the poor. The analysis of gender, race, and, to a lesser extent, class is central to ethnographic research on welfare-state restructuring.

Social scientists have debated whether such societies are unhealthy because of diminished social cohesion, psychobiological pathways, or the material environment. Anthropologists have questioned these mechanisms, emphasizing that fine-grained ethnographic studies reveal that social cohesion is locally and historically produced; psychobiological pathways involve complex, longitudinal biosocial dynamics suggesting causation cannot be viewed in purely biological terms; and material factors in health care need to be firmly situated within a broad geopolitical analysis. As a result, anthropological scholarship argues that this finding should be understood within a theoretical framework that avoids the pitfalls of methodological individualism, assumed universalism, and unidirectional causation. Rather, affliction must be understood as the embodiment of social hierarchy, a form of violence that for modem bodies is increasingly sublimated into differential disease rates and can be measured in terms of variances in morbidity and mortality between social groups. Ethnographies on the terrain of this neoliberal global health economy suggest that the violence of this inequality will continue to spiral as the exclusion of poorer societies from the global economy worsens their health-an illness poverty trap that, with few exceptions, has been greeted by a culture of indifference that is the hallmark of situations of extreme violence and terror. Studies of biocommodities and biomarkets index the processes by which those who are less well off trade in their long-term health for short-term gain, to the benefit of the long-term health of better-off individuals. Paradoxically, new biomedical technologies have served to heighten the commodification of the body, driving this trade in biological futures as well as organs and body parts.

A mental health treatment court (MHTC) with an assertive community treatment (ACT) model of case management was developed through the cooperative efforts of the criminal justice and mental health systems. Participants were 235 adults with a serious mental illness who were booked into the county jail, and who volunteered for the study. An experimental design was used, with participants randomly assigned to MHTC or treatment as usual (TAU), consisting of adversarial criminal processing and less intensive mental health treatment. Results were reported for 6 and 12 month follow-up periods. Clients in both conditions improved in life satisfaction, distress, and independent living, while participants in the MHTC also showed reductions in substance abuse and new criminal activity. Outcomes are interpreted within the context of changes brought about in the community subsequent to implementation of the MHTC. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Briggs, D				Briggs, D			Environmental pollution and the global burden of disease	BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN			English	Article							AIR-POLLUTION; BIRTH-WEIGHT; RISK-FACTORS; HEALTH; EXPOSURE; JUSTICE; COHORT; WATER	Exposures to environmental pollution remain a major source of health risk throughout the world, though risks are generally higher in developing countries, where poverty, lack of investment in modern technology and weak environmental legislation combine to cause high pollution levels. Associations between environmental pollution and health outcome are, however, complex and often poorly characterized. Levels of exposure, for example, are often uncertain or unknown as a result of the lack of detailed monitoring and inevitable variations within any population group. Exposures may occur via a range of pathways and exposure processes. Individual pollutants may be implicated in a wide range of health effects, whereas few diseases are directly attributable to single pollutants. Long latency times, the effects of cumulative exposures, and multiple exposures to different pollutants which might act synergistically all create difficulties in unravelling associations between environmental pollution and health. Nevertheless, in recent years, several attempts have been made to assess the global burden of disease as a result of environmental pollution, either in terms of mortality or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). About 8-9% of the total disease burden may be attributed to pollution, but considerably more in developing countries. Unsafe water, poor sanitation and poor hygiene are seen to be the major sources of exposure, along with indoor air pollution.

The Third Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health adopted a Charter on Transport, Environment and Health based on four main components: bringing awareness of the nature, magnitude and costs of the health impacts of transport into intergovernmental processes; strengthening the arguments for integration of health into transport policies by developing in-depth analysis of the evidence; developing national case studies; and engaging ministries of environment, health and transport as well as intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations. Negotiation of the Charter was based on two converging processes: the political process involved the interaction of stakeholders in transport, health and environment in Europe, which helped to frame the issues and the approaches to respond to them; the scientific process involved an international group of experts who produced state-of-the-art reviews of the health impacts resulting from transportation activities, identifying gaps in existing knowledge and methodological tools, specifying the policy implications of their findings, and suggesting possible targets for health improvements. Health arguments were used to strengthen environmental ones, clarify costs and benefits, and raise issues of health equity. The European experience shows that HIA can fulfil the need for simple procedures to be systematically applied to decisions regarding transport strategies at national, regional and local levels. Gaps were identified concerning models for quantifying health impacts and capacity building on how to use such tools.

The environmental and health assessment process showed evidence of its ability to minimize the number of deaths from malaria, traffic accidents and construction accidents and the occurrence of minor sexually transmitted diseases, diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory diseases; it also probably limited adverse impacts on wildlife and tropical ecology along the pipeline route. However, the system was unable to deal with the larger issues, which included: the intrinsic unsustainability of this kind of extraction project; its eventual contribution to large amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; the lack of equity in sharing the risks, negative impacts, benefits and decision-making among the various participants in the project; and the possible acceleration of transmission of the AIDS virus into central Africa. Unfortunately, the international panel of experts appointed by the World Bank Group was largely ignored by the project proponents, and had little success in minimizing the most serious impacts or in improving the social equity of the project.

Most studies showed an association between indicators of poverty and the risk of mental disorders, the most consistent association being with low levels of education. A review of articles exploring the mechanism of the relationship suggested weak evidence to support a specific association with income levels. Factors such as the experience of insecurity and hopelessness, rapid social change and the risks of violence and physical ill-health may explain the greater vulnerability of the poor to common mental disorders. The direct and indirect costs of mental ill-health worsen the economic condition, setting up a vicious cycle of poverty and mental disorder. Common mental disorders need to be placed alongside other diseases associated with poverty by policy-makers and donors. Programmes such as investment in education and provision of microcredit may have unanticipated benefits in reducing the risk of mental disorders. Secondary prevention must focus on strengthening the ability of primary care services to provide effective treatment.

Methods WHO mortality data and data on self-reported health from the World Values Survey and the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey were used to compare the above three regions. Life expectancy was calculated using Sullivan's method, with years-of life lived divided into healthy and unhealthy. The gap in healthy life expectancy between the Russian Federation and Western Europe was examined by decomposing the difference by gender and age. Findings The probability of remaining alive and healthy declines faster in the Russian Federation than in Western Europe, with the gap between Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation widening at older ages. In the Russian Federation, this rapid decline is due mainly to the high probability of death or of poor health for men and Women, respectively. Conclusions There is a large toll of premature male mortality in the Russian Federation but there also appears to be a substantial burden of ill-health among women. As in other countries, the responses of men and women to adversity differ, leading to premature death in men but survival in a poor state of health in women. Epidemiological studies including objective measures of health would help policy-makers to estimate more precisely the scale and nature of this problem. Policy-makers must recognize that health i expectancy in the Russian Federation-is reduced in both men and women.

This is evident both in terms of access to health care for individuals, and in relation to the health of whole populations. Disparities in wealth and health within and between nations are widening inexorably and the rapidly expanding global economy has failed to reduce poverty among those with little if any access to health care. In this context the Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains an unrealized aspiration for the majority of the world's people. Given these realities, no single discipline, or body of knowledge is likely to make much difference. For example, approaches based only on neo-liberal economics, as exemplified by the structural adjustment programmes of the World Bank, have not been successful in promoting health equity. The authors believe that an interdisciplinary approach is required, and that bioethics, an interdisciplinary field, can make a contribution towards improving health globally. To do this, the scope of bioethics should be expanded towards a results-oriented global health ethics, based upon widely shared and foundational values that could be carried forward through five transformational approaches.

J	Guillén, AM; Cabiedes, L				Guillén, AM; Cabiedes, L			Reforming pharmaceutical policies in the European Union:: A "penguin effect"?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE REFORM	Pharmaceutical policies form a substantial part of health care services, from the point of view of both equity and efficiency goals. Expenditure on pharmaceuticals has been growing steadily over the last few decades, and countries are finding the financing of drugs increasingly difficult. This article surveys the changes in pharmaceutical policies in the E.U. countries from the mid-1980s through the 1990s. It focuses primarily on policies dealing with cost control of publicly funded pharmaceuticals. In their analysis of these changes, the authors classify policies (or "packages of measures"), map out their incidence in each country, and assess their impact on the control of public pharmaceutical spending. They conclude that the E.U. countries are taking up apparently similar measures-dressing like penguins in a row-despite the limited effectiveness and limited evaluation of many of the measures adopted. The authors also analyze the role of national and international actors (most prominently, the European Union) in defining public pharmaceutical policies; look at how innovative policy ideas could be connected with the economic, political, and social interests that mold public action in this field; and propose new lines of investigation.

J	Horton, R				Horton, R			The health of peoples: Predicaments facing a reasoned utopia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							AID COORDINATION; FAIRNESS; CARE; FRAMEWORK; SECTOR; BENCHMARKS; JUSTICE; REFORM	How might nations cooperate to improve the health of their most vulnerable peoples? There is, presently, no coherent political, social, or ethical framework to answer this question. What progress there is remains piecemeal. Despite a long-term strategy to 2015 enshrining health as part of the process of human development-the Millennium Development Goals-existing institutions are struggling to meet these challenges. The WHO is underfunded and its work in countries is weak. The World Bank is rich but remains unable to free itself from a neoliberal Washington consensus. New institutions-such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria-distort efforts to build a coordinated international strategy for global health. And major policy initiatives (e.g., the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health) lack political commitment to invest in health. In this article, the author traces the beginnings of an answer to the question of what might constitute a political (specifically, foreign policy) approach to improving the health of peoples. A normative model for defining a just health system is urgently required. The author uses the framework of international relations provided by John Rawls to devise a series of policy principles for the health of peoples.

Alcohol abuse due to the DOP system, pesticide poisonings, and other occupational hazards illustrate that the likely success of efforts at redress depends on a greater awareness of the rights and justice dimensions of the health problems facing these workers. International trade policies may exacerbate inequalities that deprive them of opportunities to realize their rights at national level. A public health agenda must integrate into programs and policies to address the health of farm workers the recognition that violations of their rights underlie much of their burden of ill health.

Current discussions of health determinants frequently relegate or entirely dismiss health care contributions despite increasing evidence of the importance of access to primary care. Health centers deliver community-based primary care to a considerable and growing proportion of the nation's most vulnerable and have produced significant health improvements, especially for women and children. Policies that disproportionately benefit those in greatest need are likely to produce the largest gains in national health. Continued expansion of the health center network to ensure primary care for those who remain underserved is both an effective and politically acceptable strategy to improve national health.

Reforming primary care in Norway and Britain	MILBANK QUARTERLY			English	Article							NATIONAL-HEALTH-SERVICE; PUBLIC MANAGEMENT; NHS; INEQUALITIES; ENGLAND; POLICY; MARKET; EUROPE	Many countries are currently reorganizing their health services in response to cultural, economic, and technological changes. Because the changes are global, different countries are drawn toward similar reform programs. But countries' cultural, economic, and political differences also may lead to divergent responses. This article examines the convergence thesis by comparing recent changes in primary care in Norway and Britain. There seems to be a convergence in objectives, a divergence in remuneration systems, and both divergence and convergence in organizational structures. To understand the dynamics of change, divergence is discussed in relation to the social context of the political initiatives. Divergences are explained by economic, political, and cultural differences, as well as differences in physicians' political power and density.

A cross-sectional analysis of a simple random sample of 10,661 women aged 20-49 in Sweden in 1980-1985 and 9585 such women in 1992-1997 was carried out to assess their health. The risk factors for self-reported, poor health and psychosomatic complaints for female refugees and women from Finland, Southern Europe, Western countries and Sweden were examined. Country of birth was a significant risk factor for poor self-reported health and psychosomatic complaints, with women from Southern Europe, female refugees and Finnish women being at higher risk in this respect than Swedish women. The increased risk remained significant after adjustment for demographic and socio-economic factors. Swedish-born women, female refugees, and Finnish women reported poorer health and had more psychosomatic complaints (not Finns) in the 1990s than in the 1980s.

The methodology is based on a matrix system describing the level and flow of health expenditures on HIV/AIDS: an adaptation of the National Health Accounts methods. The expenditures were classified by source (public, private, international), by the use of funds (prevention, care), by object, and by type of provider institution. The results are reported in US$ using the official exchange rate for the year of estimation. For international comparisons monetary units were adjusted by the purchasing power parity (US$PPP). National HIV/AIDS total expenditures were: Guatemala US$PPP29.5 million, Uruguay US$PPP32.5 million, Mexico US$PPP257 million, and Brazil US$PPP587.4 million during 1998, and Honduras US$PPP33.9 million for 1999. The total HIV/AIDS expenditures per capita for 1998 were: Brazil US$2.69, Mexico US$1.25, Guatemala US$1.08, Uruguay US$6.63, and Honduras US$3.6 for 1999. The 1998 distribution of the total HIV/AIDS expenditures in prevention and care were, respectively, Brazil 10 and 80%, Guatemala 15 and 70%, Mexico 29 and 66%, Uruguay 36 and 51%, and Honduras 28 and 65% for 1999. The share of total expenditures on antiretroviral drugs ranged from 52% in Guatemala to 75% in Brazil, even when the estimated coverage of antiretroviral therapy was close to 10% in Guatemala and universal in Brazil. The estimated flow from international sources per capita in 1998 was Uruguay US$0.03, Brazil US$0.24, Guatemala US$0.11, Mexico US$0.01, and Honduras US$1.04 in 1999. The data allow international comparisons and provide critical information to improve equity and efficiency in the allocation of scarce resources.

J	Ernst, WG				Ernst, WG			Global equity and sustainable earth resource consumption requires super-efficient extraction-conservation-recycling and ubiquitous, inexpensive energy	INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW			English	Article							HEALTH	For more than 3.5 billion years, the Earth's biosphere maintained a dynamic equilibrium with solar energy and natural materials derived from the near-surface lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Beginning about 10,000 years ago, however, settled agriculture allowed the division of labor, rise of civilizations, and utilization of terrestrial resources at rates greater than those of replenishment. Demographic estimates put our numbers at 9-10 billion by 2050. About 85 percent of humanity now resides in the Developing Nations, and this proportion is growing. Due to the global information network, this is the first world generation to become acutely aware of the high standard of living confined to the Industrialized Nations. The grossly inequitable distribution of wealth, due partly to Earth resource exploitation, is resented by many people of the Developing Nations; this situation is politically destabilizing and must be ameliorated. But can 10 billion people be afforded comfortable lives without destroying the planetary carrying capacity and habitability through exhaustion of the Earth's natural capital? Humans now control a third of the terrestrial net primary biological production, and our share is increasing. Adverse environmental impacts include increasing air and water pollution; accelerating loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services, topsoil, fisheries, and tropical rain forests; and global warming + sea-level rise. Prospects for the intricate web of life are ominous. Modem societies are sustained by the extraction of fossil energy, water, and other Earth materials far exceeding planetary renewal rates. Island communities provide sobering examples of the collapse of cultures that have overexploited and devastated their environments. Thus, humanity must reach a steady-state stewardship of the planet involving super-efficient, universal mineral resource recovery and conservation while preserving ecosystem integrity. Utilization of renewable resources at or below recharge rates and near-total recycling of nonrenewable Earth materials can only be accomplished employing widely available, inexpensive energy. Unfortunately, the Second Law of Thermodynamics dictates that a portion of the mineral resources and most of the spent energy are irretrievably lost. Scientific research-generated technological advances providing production and ubiquitous availability of low-environmental-impact, cheap energy will be essential to preserving anything approaching steady-state resource utilization. Assuming technical, economic, and political success in achieving global equity and prosperity for 10 billion people (a very large order indeed!), the world ecosystem will be severely compromised through increased human consumption of the Earth's mineral resources. Biospheric equilibrium and ecosystem sustainability-the very carrying capacity of the planet-is already at risk, and this risk is increasing. Without doubt, the greatest long-term challenge facing humanity involves the preservation of a functioning, viable biosphere.

The WCP uses New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo as a laboratory in which to study urban health, particularly the evolution and current organization of public health infrastructure, as well as the health status and quality of life in these cities. Comparing world cities in wealthier nations is important because of (1) global trends in urbanization, emerging health risks, and population aging; (2) the dominant influence of these cities on "megacities"of developing nations, and (3) the existence of data and scholarship about these world cities, which provides a foundation for comparing their health systems and health. We argue that, in contrast to nation-states, world cities provide opportunities for more refined comparisons and cross-national learning. To provide a framework for WCP, we define an urban core for each city and examine the similarities and differences among them. Our current studies shed light on inequalities in health care use and health status, the importance of neighborhoods in protecting population health, and quality of life in diverse urban communities.

J	Luke, N; Watkins, SC				Luke, N; Watkins, SC			Reactions of developing-country elites to international population policy	POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW			English	Article							NATION-STATE; GLOBALIZATION; PROGRAMS; SOCIETY; CAIRO	The authors examine the global diffusion of international population policy, which they consider a cultural item. The process of cultural diffusion is often seen as spontaneous: items of Western culture are in demand because they are universally attractive. Yet cultural flows may also be directed, they may be unattractive to their intended recipients, and their acceptance may depend on persuasion and material incentives. The authors consider the range of responses of national elites to the new population policy adopted by the United Nations at Cairo in 1994. Strongly influenced by feminists, the Cairo Program of Action promotes gender equity and reproductive health and demotes previous concerns with population growth. The data are interviews with representatives of governmental and nongovernmental organizations involved in population and health in five developing countries. To interpret the interviews, the authors draw on two theoretical frameworks. The first emphasizes the attractiveness of new cultural items and the creation of a normative consensus about their value. The second emphasizes differentials in power and resources among global actors and argues that the diffusion of cultural items can be directed by powerful donor states. Interviews in Bangladesh, Ghana, Jordan, Malawi, and Senegal portray a mixed reception to Cairo: enthusiastic embrace of certain aspects of the Cairo policy by some members of the national elite and a realistic assessment of donor power by virtually all. Strategies of rhetoric and action appear to be aimed at maintaining and directing the flows of donor funds.

J	Riches, G				Riches, G			Food banks and food security: Welfare reform, human rights and social policy. Lessons from Canada?	SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						food banks; food security; welfare; rights	INSECURITY	In the past twenty years food banks have established themselves as one of the fastest-growing charitable industries in first world societies. As institutionalized centres or clearing houses for the redistribution of donated and surplus food they have emerged as a key frontline response to the growing problem of food poverty and inequality. As welfare states have been restructured and cut back and basic entitlements have been denied, food banks have become secondary extensions of weakened social safely nets. This paper explores the growth of food banking in Canada and analyses its role in terms of advancing the human right to food, its effectiveness in achieving food security and the extent to which it contributes to, and/or counters the increasing emphasis by governments on welfare reform policies informed by neo-conservative ideology. Food bank are examined from the perspective of their or ins and purposes, institutionalization, usage, food distributed and effectiveness. The rise of food banks in Canada is concrete evidence both of the breakdown of the social safety net and the commodfication of social assistance. As such, they undermine the state's obligation, as ratified in international conventions, to respect, protect and fulfil the human right to food. They enable governments to look the other way and neglect food poverty and nutritional health and well-being. A possible future role for food banks in countries where they are already established lies in public education and advocacy, but their institutionalization makes this seem an unlikely course. In countries where they are in their infancy, the question of whether to support their development should be a matter of urgent public debate.

J	Clarke, PM; Gerdtham, UG; Johannesson, M; Bingefors, K; Smith, L				Clarke, PM; Gerdtham, UG; Johannesson, M; Bingefors, K; Smith, L			On the measurement of relative and absolute income-related health inequality	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						health inequality; international comparisons; SF-36; Sweden; Australia	SF-36	In recent work on international comparisons of income-related inequalities in health, the concentration index has been used as a measure of health inequality. A drawback of this measure is that it is sensitive to whether it is estimated with respect to health or morbidity. An alternative would be to use the generalized concentration index that is based on absolute rather than relative health differences. In this methodological paper, we explore the importance of the choice of health inequality measure by comparing the income-related inequality in health status and morbidity between Sweden and Australia. This involves estimating a concentration index and a generalized concentration index for the eight-scale health profile of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) health survey. We then transform the scores for each scale into a measure of morbidity and show that whether the concentration index is estimated with respect to health or morbidity has an impact on the results. The ranking between the two countries is reversed for two of the eight dimensions of SF-36 and within both countries the ranking across the eight SF-36 scales is also affected. However, this change in ranking does not occur when the generalized concentration index is compared and we conclude with the implications of these results for reporting comparisons of income-related health inequality in different populations.

J	Berger, MC; Messer, J				Berger, MC; Messer, J			Public financing of health expenditures, insurance, and health outcomes	APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; CARE EXPENDITURES; INCOME INEQUALITY; MEDICAL-CARE; DEMAND	The effects of public financing of health expenditures, insurance coverage and other factors on health outcomes are examined within health production models estimated using 1960-1992 data across 20 OECD countries. Mortality rates are found to depend on the mix of health care expenditures and the type of health insurance coverage. Increases in the publicly financed share of health expenditures are associated with increases in mortality rates. Increases in inpatient and ambulatory insurance coverage are associated with reduced mortality. The effects of GDP, health expenditures and age structure on mortality are similar to those in previous studies. Tobacco use, alcohol use, fat consumption, female labour force participation, and education levels are also significantly related to overall mortality rates. Increases in income inequality are associated with lower mortality rates, suggesting that the negative relationship between inequality and health outcomes suggested by some previous studies does not remain when a more complete model is estimated. The result that increases in public financing increase mortality rates is robust to a number of changes in specifications and samples. Thus, as countries increase the level of their health expenditures, they may want to avoid increasing the proportion of their expenditures that are publicly financed.

Research has shown that certain groups of South African children are at particular risk of elevated blood lead levels. Johannesburg is the largest urban complex in southern Africa, with a population of around 3 million and extensive industrial and manufacturing activity. Among the challenges posed in the city are rapid urbanization, extensive poverty, and inequity. Little information on the blood lead distribution of Johannesburg children is available. This study was undertaken to determine blood lead levels among children living in three areas of Johannesburg: inner city suburbs and the low-income townships of Alexandra and Westbury to the north and west of the city center, respectively. The results indicated that blood lead levels ranged from 6 to 26 mug/dL, with a mean level of 11.9 mug/dL. The blood lead levels of 78% of children equaled or exceeded 10 mug/dL, the current international action level. Maternal educational status, the presence of smokers in the home, and living in an informal dwelling were among the factors associated with elevated blood lead levels.

As a consequence, they commonly access services in multiple sectors in addition to the AOD treatment system. This study examined the predictors of contact with agencies in the health, mental health, social welfare and criminal justice sectors by ADD status among a probability sample of homeless adults in Houston, Texas. Method: Cross-sectional data were collected from a multistage random sample of 797 homeless adults (579 men), age 18 or older, who were living in shelters and on the streets of Houston in 1996. Structured face-to-face interviews provided screening diagnoses for ADD disorders, self-report data on AOD treatment use and candidate predictors of treatment use. Service use was tracked retrospectively through administrative data obtained from 10 federal, state, county and municipal agencies that provide funding for physical and mental health services and AOD treatment, as well as emergency income; we also tracked criminal justice contacts. Logistic regression analyses were stratified by AOD status. Results: Adjusting for eligibility factors, key aspects of need were significant predictors of any utilization among those without an AOD problem, but not for those with an AOD problem. For those with AOD disorders, contact with one sector was not predictive of contact with other sectors. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that AOD disorders hinder utilization of public sector services by homeless persons. These disorders may be masking need or otherwise acting as a barrier to accessing treatment and support.

J	Reichenbach, L				Reichenbach, L			The politics of priority setting for reproductive health: Breast and cervical cancer in Ghana	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						priority setting measures; women's health policy and programmes; advocacy and political process; global burden of disease; cost-effectiveness analysis; breast cancer; cervical cancer; Ghana	LEAGUE; POLICY	Priority setting for reproductive health is affected by health sector reform policies, the often politically charged nature of issues such as abortion, decreasing funding for reproductive health activities and the broad agenda of the ICPID Programme of Action. This paper examines the influence of political and organizational factors on national priority setting for reproductive health and argues that existing priority setting tools such as disability-adjusted life years and cost-effectiveness analysis do not consider the influence of politics on the priority setting process or account for the interpretation of evidence in priority setting. It suggests that priority setting tools can be strengthened by incorporating empirical measures of political and organizational attention to an issue, and through a new measure - policy priority. The paper applies this new measure to a case study of attention to breast and cervical cancer in Ghana from 1990-97, illustrating how traditional priority setting methods cannot explain the priority given to breast cancer in Ghana. It demonstrates how local politics can trump scientific and economic evidence and suggests that the priority setting process can have unforeseen equity and social implications. It concludes by arguing that the policy priority measure provides a more complete picture of reproductive health priorities and is useful for better understanding the implications of the priority setting process for reproductive health.

In North America, income inequality seems to be strongly related to mortality rates among American communities such as states and metropolitan areas but largely irrelevant for health at similar levels of geopolitical aggregation in Canada. This article summarizes relevant international and North American evidence and then explores relationships between income inequality and mortality rates among coastal communities in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis was conducted among twenty-four coastal communities in British Columbia, utilizing four measures based on the 1996 Census to measure income inequality and crude, age-standardized and age- and gender-specific mortality rates averaged over the five-year period 1994-98 to measure health. Results: The three valid measures of income inequality were positively and significantly related to the crude mortality rate but were not significantly related to the age-standardized mortality rate. Two of the inequality measures were related to mortality rates for males aged 0-44 and for males aged 45-64 before but not after controlling for mean household income. Discussion: Health researchers have yet to report a meaningful relationship between income inequality and population health within Canada. At the risk of committing the ecological fallacy, these findings provisionally support a psycho-social interpretation of the individual-level relationship between income and health wherein members of these communities compare themselves to an encompassing community, e.g., all Canadians.

J	Martens, P				Martens, P			Health transitions in a globalising world: towards more disease or sustained health?	FUTURES			English	Article							EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION	In this paper, we argue that the concept of transitions is a useful way to address future changes in the health status of the world due to the processes of globalisation. To that end, we discuss the current forces affecting human health and the health transitions we have seen in the past. Next, we describe developments in the health status of populations according to three potential future 'ages': the age of emerging infectious diseases, the age of medical technology and the age of sustained health. Future health transitions are explored along the lines of four development paths (scenario groups), defined along two dimensions (global versus regional dynamics and emphasising economic objectives versus environmental and equity objectives). We conclude that managing the health transition effectively will require a micro- and macro-approach, taking into account the social, cultural and behavioural determinants of health.

The first community was located within a 5-mi perimeter of the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) outside Denver, Colorado. The second community was located on the south side of Tucson, Arizona, adjacent to the Tucson International Airport area (TIAA) Superfund site. Critical theory was the perspective used in this analysis and proposal of public health actions to attain social justice. Differences between the two populations' experiences with risk and contamination coincided with divergent levels of trust in government. RFETS residents demanded monitoring, whereas the minority residents at TIAA were ambivalent about their trust in government cleanup activities. Unraveling the purpose of "facts" and the social force of "truth" can direct nurses to address environmental justice issues. By policing governmental and business activities in halting or cleaning up environmental contamination, nurses may become mouthpieces for the concerns underlying the fragile surface of "virtual trust" in contaminated communities. Cutting through competing rhetoric to police environmental safety, the core function of assurance becomes what nurses do , not what they say.

CROATIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						China; financing, organized; insurance, health; medical savings accounts; Singapore; South Africa; United States	FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS; ADVERSE SELECTION; HONG-KONG; SINGAPORE	Aim. To summarize the international experience of medical savings accounts (MSAs), make a preliminary evaluation of the impact of MSAs, and assess their feasibility in other countries, particularly Central and Eastern Europe. Method. A review of published literature in academic journals, books, Internet sources, and other "gray" literature. Results. Most published studies were theoretical. Advocates argued that MSAs improved the efficiency of insurance, increased consumer choice, and reduced health care expenditures. Critics argued that MSAs led to adverse selection, reduced equity, resulted in cost inflation, and deterred necessary utilization. MSAs have been implemented in China, Singapore, the United States of America, and South Africa. The organization of MSAs varied between countries. MSAs were combined with either a public or private insurance element to cover catastrophic expenses. Few empirical studies of MSAs have been conducted and, therefore, the evidence on their impact is limited. Conclusion. More empirical evaluations are needed on the impact of MSAs. Results of empirical evaluations cannot be easily generalized but depend on the complementary systems of financing and the extent of state regulation. MSAs are not likely to be feasible in countries where the unemployment rate is high, savings rates and average earnings low, and the state weak.

J	Morgan, RE; David, S				Morgan, RE; David, S			Human rights: A new language for aging advocacy	GERONTOLOGIST			English	Article						older persons; public policy; equity; entitlement; principles; values		Purpose: The purpose of this study was to consider how human rights concepts developed by the international human rights movement could contribute to advocacy efforts on behalf of the aging in an era of population aging. Design and Methods: This study evaluated changes in popular perceptions of aging, the concomitant need for a reformulation of aging advocacy, and the role that human rights concepts could play in protecting older persons. It then considered human rights concepts as they are related to the issues of work, retirement security, health care, and long-term care. Results: Human rights apply to all aspects of the life spectrum and can be a powerful force in defending and protecting older persons by operating as a baseline for establishing the underlying values for aging policies and by linking older persons' concerns with the other segments of society.

The burden of illness associated with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) has determined this as a key focus for research at a basic science, individual and population level. Although considerable research has been conducted on specific aspects of the experience of CHD, such as anxiety or depression, there is a lack of research investigating the global aspects of the illness experience from the individual's perspective. Furthermore, there is a paucity of research examining the cross-cultural experiences of patients from Non-English Speaking Backgrounds (NESB). Given the multicultural nature of Australian society, and that health and illness are culturally constructed experiences (Manderson 1990), it is important to include the perspectives of people from minority cultures in health related research in order to provide culturally sensitive and appropriate health care and information during an illness. Further, the potential to prevent and modulate the course of CHD, by strategies such as smoking cessation and lipid management, mandate a health promotion agenda based on equity and access for all members of society. Aims. This article discusses cultural aspects of CHD in relation to nursing and allied health care during the recovery phase of an acute cardiac event. It reviews the research that has been conducted in this area, focusing on the Chinese-Australian population. Literature search. The CINAHL, MEDLINE, FAMILY (Australian Family and Society Abstracts Database), PsychINFO, and Multicultural Australian and immigration Studies (MAIS) databases were searched, identifying literature published from 1982. Keywords used were Chin* (Chinese, China), Asia*(Asia, Asian), experience, adjustment, psychological, heart, coronary, cardiac, health and services. Reports not written in English were excluded. Australian Government reports were also searched, as well as hand searching of nursing and medical textbooks. These searches resulted in over 1000 articles. However, only around 50 were relevant for this review. Implications. Chinese-Australians are one of the fastest growing populations in Australia, and are at increased risk of CHD upon settling to Australia. Recommendations for future research and for the practice of nursing are provided.

This paper argues that the decline of tuberculosis since the nineteenth century is far better understood than its resurgence over the last twenty years. It is suggested that insights gained from the historical study of disease may provide a better analytical framework for understanding the contemporary dynamics of disease epidemiology than the current emphasis on the bio-medical and behavioural characteristics of individual patients. It is concluded that tuberculosis research requires a combination of advances in bio-medical knowledge with a broader understanding of the evolving relationship between disease and modern societies.

HIV/AIDS has been dealt with differently from other sexually transmitted or lethal infectious diseases, despite being Africa's leading cause of death. In this review, we discuss the evolution of the global response to the epidemic, and the importance of redefining HIV/AIDS In Africa as a public health and infectious disease emergency. We discuss reconsideration of policies and practice around HIV testing and partner notification, and emphasise the need for an increased focus on treatment. Human-rights based approaches to HIV/AIDS prevention might have reduced the role of public health and social justice, which offer a more applied and practical framework for HIV/AIDS prevention and care in Africa's devastating epidemic.

It reviews the evidence in regard to how air, water and waste problems differ according to cities' average incomes, This shows that household and neighbourhood level problems such as indoor air pollution and inadequate Provision for household water supplies, sanitation and waste removal are most severe in low-income cities, and that their burdens fall primarily on the urban poor. Affluent cities contribute much more to global stresses such as carbon emissions and aggregate waste generation, whose burdens fall far more widely and are more likely to affect future generations. The article also discusses other important influences on the severity, of cities' environmental burdens - in particular intra-urban inequality, and the quality of governance. The article ends with a discussion of whether the environmental interests of the currently, deprived are complementary to or in conflict with those of future generations, and the potential role of an in reconciling these interests.

J	Hanafin, S; Houston, AM; Cowley, S				Hanafin, S; Houston, AM; Cowley, S			Vertical equity in service provision: a model for the Irish public health nursing service	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						horizontal equity; vertical; policy; service provision; needs; public health; nursing; community; Republic of Ireland; funding		Aims. This paper analyses the policy and conceptual basis of public health nursing service provision in the Republic of Ireland and situates it within an international context. It draws on the principles of horizontal and vertical equity in proposing a new model of public health nursing service provision. It gives the reader an understanding of a model of service delivery underpinned by the principle of vertical equity. Background issues. The Public Health Nurse in the Republic of Ireland has a wide remit encompassing primary, secondary and tertiary care at the level of the individual, family and community. The changing sociological and demographic nature of society in Ireland has impacted on a service that has largely remained unchanged since 1966. Since 1997 four review bodies have provided recommendations that are incompatible with each other. There remains a need to find a solution to the overwhelming demands placed on the public health nursing service in the Republic of Ireland. Key issues. The public health nursing service goes beyond the provision of a purely clinical nursing service. Communities differ in demography, epidemiology, environment, history, composition, support and most importantly needs. Using three exemplars a new model for the public health nursing service is explicated. This model has as its main focus the needs of the community it serves. Conclusions. A service underpinned by the principle of vertical equity can be used to deliver locally based, needs driven public health nursing services. The application of such a model would make the public health nursing service more flexible and responsive to local need. Public health nursing composition and provision must be determined using the principal of vertical equity determined by the needs of the community it serves.

J	Heuveline, P; Guillot, M; Gwatkin, DR				Heuveline, P; Guillot, M; Gwatkin, DR			The uneven tides of the health transition	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						communicable diseases; poverty; mortality; health transition; health policy	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; MORTALITY; BURDEN; TABLE	As spectacular mortality reductions have occurred in all developing nations at all national income levels, the epidemiologic transition theory suggests that cause-of-mortality patterns should shift from communicable diseases especially prevalent among infants and children to problems resulting from non-communicable conditions at older ages. Global estimates confirm this expectation, and mortality from these latter conditions has become predominant worldwide, leading some observers to argue for a corresponding shift in the public health agenda. In this paper, we nuance this finding by studying the important poverty-gradient concealed in the global estimates. Our results demonstrate the remaining cause-of-death disparities between the world's poorest and richest populations. We find that the poorest population (1st quintile) experiences higher mortality than the richest population (5th quintile) in each of the three main groups of mortality causes but that the excess mortality of the poorest population is mostly due to the higher incidence of communicable diseases (77% of excess deaths). Overall, those diseases only account for 34.2% of deaths in the world but still dominate mortality causes among the poorest 20% of the world population (58.6% of all deaths). Moreover, these results appear robust to alternative estimates of the international distribution of the world's poorest people. While recognizing the emerging agenda of the non-communicable conditions, we thus underscore the "unfinished agenda" of communicable diseases in many countries. As populations affected by these diseases are predominantly among the poorer, equity considerations should caution against a premature shift away from these diseases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Additionally, institutional responses are evaluated in light of the various health-promoting activities. The roles of multilaterals, non-governmental organisations, foundations and nations are addressed. A host of current global health issues - for example, public-private partnerships, international orphan drug legislature and patent protection - are addressed.

Allocation of healthcare resources is clearly associated with the concept of distributive justice and to the existence of a right to healthcare. Nevertheless, there is still the question of whether this right should include all types of healthcare services or if it should be limited to selected types. It follows that choices must be made, priorities must be set and that efficiency of healthcare services should be maximum. Objectives and methods: Distributive justice aims at ensuring that everyone has access to necessary care based on the substantive ethical principles of equity and solidarity. Resource allocation is paramount in public policy particularly with regards pharmacoeconomics. The objective of this study is to determine the leading issues regarding the marketing and trade of generic medicines analysing the reasons why there are huge disparities between European countries with regards generic drugs acceptance by practitioners. Results and conclusion: Distributive justice aims at ensuring that everyone has access to reasonable care based on the ethical principles of equity and solidarity. However, universality implies always choice in access and efficiency in delivery. It follows that resource allocation is instrumental in public policy particularly with regards pharmacoeconomics. The acceptance of distributive justice as a new ethical paradigm for professional ethics implies that as long as the best interest of the patient is not at stake physicians should regard the use of generic drugs as a valid instrument to promote the efficiency of the system and therefore as a way to facilitate citizen's global access to healthcare.

J	Starfield, B; Shi, LY				Starfield, B; Shi, LY			Policy relevant determinants of health: an international perspective	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						primary care; income inequality; life expectancy; postneonatal mortality	PRIMARY-CARE	Background: International comparisons can provide clues to understanding some of the important policy-related determinants of health, including those related to the provision of health care services. An earlier study indicated that the strength of the primary care infrastructure of a health services system might be related to overall costs of health services. The purpose of the current research was to determine the robustness of the findings in the light of the passage of 5-10 years, the addition of two more countries, and the findings of other research on the possible importance of other determinants of country health levels. Methods: Thirteen industrialized countries, all with populations of at least 5 million, were characterized by the relative strength of their primary care infrastructure, the degree of national income inequality, and a major manifestation of a behavioral determinant of health that is amenable to policy intervention (smoking), using international data sets and national informants. Health system and primary care practice characteristics were judged according to pre-set criteria. Major indicators of health were used as dependent variables, as were health care costs. Findings: The stronger the primary care, the lower the costs. Countries with very weak primary care infrastructures have poorer performance on major aspects of health. Although countries that are intermediate in the strength of their primary care generally have levels of health at least as good as those with high levels of primary care, this is not the case in early life, when the impact of strong primary care is greatest. A subset of characteristics (equitable distribution of resources, publicly accountable universal financial coverage, low cost sharing, comprehensive services, and family-oriented services) distinguishes countries with overall good health from those with poor health at all ages. Neither income inequality nor smoking status accurately identified those countries with either consistently high or consistently poor performance on the health indicators. Interprelation: A certain level of health care expenditures may be required to achieve overall good health levels, even in the presence of strong primary care infrastructures. Very low costs may interfere with achievement of good health, particularly at older ages, although very high levels of costs may signal excessive and potentially health-compromising care. Five policy-relevant characteri sties appear to be related to better population health levels. There is no consistent relationship between income inequality, smoking, and health levels as measured by various indicators of health in different age groups. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

J	Pfeiffer, J				Pfeiffer, J			African Independent Churches in Mozambique: Healing the afflictions of inequality	MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY			English	Article						Mozambique; social inequality; African Independent Churches; intrahousehold; health	INFERTILITY; WITCHCRAFT; HEALTH; CRIME	The recent explosive proliferation of African Independent Churches (AICs) in central Mozambique coincided with rapid growth of economic disparity in the 1990s produced by privatization, cuts in government services, and arrival of foreign aid promoted by Mozambique's World Bank/International Monetary Fund Structural Adjustment Program. Drawing on ethnographic research in the city of Chimoio, this article argues that growing inequality has led to declining social cohesion, heightened individual competition, fear of interpersonal violence, and intensified conflict between spouses in poor families. This perilous social environment finds expression in heightened fears of witchcraft, sorcery, and avenging spirits, which are often blamed in Shona ideology for reproductive health problems. Many women with sick children or suffering from infertility turn to AICs for treatment because traditional healers are increasingly viewed as dangerous and too expensive. The AICs invoke the "Holy Spirit" to exorcise malevolent agents and then provide a community of mutual aid and ongoing protection against spirit threats.

This paper aims to articulate a rationale for focusing on within- as well as between-country health disparities in nations of all per capita income levels, and to suggest relevant reference material, particularly for developing country researchers. Routine health information can obscure large inter-group disparities within a country. While appropriately disaggregated routine information is lacking, evidence from special studies reveals significant and in many cases widening disparities in health among more and less privileged social groups within low- and middle- as well as high-income countries; avoidable disparities are observed not only across socioeconomic groups but also by gender, ethnicity, and other markers of underlying social disadvantage. Globally, economic inequalities are widening and, where relevant information is available, generally accompanied by widening or stagnant health inequalities. Related global economic trends, including pressures to cut social spending and compete in global markets, are making it especially difficult for lower-income countries to implement and sustain equitable policies. For all of these reasons, explicit concerns about equity in health and its determinants need to be placed higher on the policy and research agendas of both international and national organizations in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. International agencies can strengthen or undermine national efforts to achieve greater equity. The Primary Health Care strategy is at least as relevant today as it was two decades ago; but equity needs to move from being largely implicit to becoming an explicit component of the strategy, and progress toward greater equity must be carefully monitored in countries of all per capita income levels. Particularly in the context of an increasingly globalized world, improvements in health for privileged groups should suggest what could, with political will, be possible for all.

J	McIntyre, D; Gilson, L				McIntyre, D; Gilson, L			Putting equity in health back onto the social policy agenda: experience from South Africa	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						health equity; vertical equity; procedural justice; South Africa	VERTICAL EQUITY; CARE	Over the past decade, international health policy debates have been dominated by efficiency considerations. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in health equity, including consideration of the notions of vertical equity and procedural justice. This paper explores the possible application of these notions within the context of South Africa, a country in which inequities in income and social service distribution between 'racial' groups were systematically promoted and entrenched during four decades of minority rule, guided by apartheid and related policies. With the transition to a democratic government in 1994, equity gained prominence on the South African social policy agenda. Health equity has been awarded a particularly high priority, not least of all because the health sector is seen as vehicle for achieving rapid equity gains. In addition, many of the other equity-promoting social sector policies (such as improved access to housing and water and sanitation services) have been motivated on the basis of their potential health equity gains. The South African experience since 1994 provides useful insights into factors which may facilitate or constrain health equity progress. In particular, the constitutional entitlement to health and civil society action to maintain health equity's place on the social policy agenda are seen as important facilitating factors. Certain health sector programmes have also been developed which are intended preferentially to benefit those who have been historically dis-advantaged, and which thus support vertical equity goals. However, there have been no efforts to promote cross-subsidisation between the private and public health sectors, and initial efforts to promote coherency in social policies (through the Reconstruction and Development Programme) appear not to have been sustained. In addition, macro-economic policies (particularly the highly ambitious budget deficit reduction targets of the government) are likely to undermine some of the equity-promoting social policy initiatives. Most importantly, the potential inter-relation ship of vertical equity and procedural justice goals has not been adequately recognised. As a result, and despite policy rhetoric, this paper concludes that health equity goals are critically dependent on the central involvement of the dis-advantaged in decision-making about who should receive priority, what services should be delivered and how equity-promoting initiatives should be implemented.

J	Legemaate, J				Legemaate, J			Integrating health law and health policy: a European perspective	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						health law; health legislation; legal interventions; legalization	RIGHTS	Health law is intended to create an environment in which the promotion of health goes hand in hand with the protection of individual rights and the general principles of equality and justice. Over the years, the importance of health law has grown, both at national and international level. As health and human rights are closely interlinked, it is important to integrate health law and health policy. It is to be expected that. especially in Europe, the impact of health law on health policy-making will increase as a result of several developments, e.g. the internationalization of health care and health policy, the issue of consumer protection and the legalization of society. This requires a strategy to Stimulate the fruitful relationship between health policy and health law. The most important components of this strategy are discussed.

Pharmaceutical costs have reached 14% of total health care costs in the United States and continue to rise. Many studies have looked at factors that influence utilization of hospital and ambulatory care services in the pediatric population. This study examines the factors that influence utilization of prescription drugs in the pediatric population. Methods. Data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) were used in the analysis. A 2-part multivariate regression analysis was conducted using pediatric (ages 0-17) prescription drug expenditures as the dependent variable. Independent variables were constructed using demographic variables, socioeconomic variables, health status, and medical conditions. Results. Black children are less likely than white children to use any prescription drug (odds ratio: 0.67). Similarly, uninsured children are less likely than privately insured children to use any prescription drug (odds ratio: 0.62). Among children who had any prescription drug expenditure in 1996, children who are black, Asian, and Hispanic had lower prescription drug expenditures than children who are white. Children who are uninsured had lower expenditures than children who are privately insured. Children in near-poor families had lower prescription drug expenditures than those in high-income families, even after controlling for insurance status. Children who are covered by Medicaid had comparable prescription drug expenditures to children who are covered by private insurance. Conclusion. Socioeconomic characteristics such as race, insurance status, and family income levels had significant impact on pediatric prescription drug expenditures, even after controlling for the influences of health status and medical conditions.

J	Balle, F; Vaidya, A				Balle, F; Vaidya, A			A regional analysis of openness and government size	APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; WAGE INEQUALITY; TRADE; UNEMPLOYMENT; COMPETITION; POWER	The effects of international trade have been studied primarily from the perspective of a nation, often overlooking the more direct effects that occur on a regional or state level. Studies have illustrated the relationship between international trade and openness to the size of a nation's government as well as to specific categories of government spending. Because the United States retains strong state governments it is important to correlate openness with government size at the state level. The purpose of this paper is to ascertain whether increased state openness has resulted in state governments responding to the increased international trade activity by offering greater social protection. It is found that both public welfare and health services expenditures are positively correlated with the level of a state's openness. This suggests that US states have had to respond to the adverse effects of increased international trade activity.

It explores whether inequalities found in utilization of psychiatric services according to area are different in degree from inequalities in utilization of medical and surgical specialists, and describes the meeting of perceived needs for mental health care within those seen by psychiatrists. Method: The National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHW) was a community survey employing clustered probability sampling, with a computerized field questionnaire which included sections of the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI), as well as self-reported service utilization and perceived needs for care. Results: By survey estimates, 1.8% of the Australian population consulted a psychiatrist in the last year. Among people with an ICD 10-diagnosed mental disorder, 7.3% consulted a psychiatrist. Only about one in five people seen by a psychiatrist report the psychiatrist as the only mental health care provider. Disadvantaged areas of the cities and remote areas, when compared with the least deprived areas of the cities, showed lower rates of utilization. This effect is stronger in psychiatry than in other specialities. Patients seeing psychiatrists seem to be a more satisfied group than those seeing only other providers; nonetheless, some needs are not well met, and the role of the psychiatrist cannot be isolated as the cause of this satisfaction. Conclusion: Most care delivered by psychiatrists is de facto shared care. Psychiatrists as clinical professionals need to be continually mindful of the need to communicate with others providing care. Psychiatric services in Australia are not delivered in an equitable manner, and the inequalities are greater for psychiatric services than for other medical specialities.

Methods: The present study refers to a representative sample of children from the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, comprising 2491 girls and boys attending public and private schools in different areas of the city. The assessment of caries and treatment needs followed the international methodological standards prescribed by the World Health Organization. We used spatial data analysis to describe epidemiological measures distributed by small areas, and to explore hypotheses of ecological association between caries indexes and indicators of social development. Results: Schoolchildren in central districts were less affected by tooth decay and presented fewer dental treatment needs when compared to those in peripheral deprived areas. At the spatial level, average family income, unemployment rate, household overcrowding, and an index of inequality of income distribution were significantly correlated with variables measuring children's caries experience. Conclusions: The heterogeneous distribution of caries indexes by areas of the city indicates higher levels of dental decay in areas of social deprivation. The delimitation of areas with increased risk of caries and greater dental treatment needs should be helpful to public health services for the formulation of policies and the targeting of resources to address these problems.

J	Barten, F; Montiel, RP; Espinoza, E; Morales, C				Barten, F; Montiel, RP; Espinoza, E; Morales, C			Democratic governance fairytale or real perspective? Lessons from Central America	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION			English	Article							HEALTH	This paper examines the concept of democratic local governance and its relevance for health development in Central America, a region which was torn apart by conflict in the 1980s. Peace-building has been taking place since the 1990s in a difficult macro-level context, as stabilization and structural adjustment policies in the postwar period have led to drastic state reforms with high social costs for the marginalized population. Innovative experiences and strategies in health have also developed in the region over the last decades, based upon local participatory governance, contributions to public health policy, development and peace-building at the local level. This article describes two of these municipal health development processes, the SILOS (Local Health Systems) in the northern zone of San Salvador, El Salvador and the municipal health process in Leon, Nicaragua. The paper examines the relevance and sustainability of these local initiatives and the importance of democratic local governance for (health) development. It also analyzes the extent to which macro-level reform policies have enabled the development of these processes and perspective for sustainability of democratic local governance in countries confronted by serious lack of governability. Whilst the imperative for reform/change is beyond doubt, as well as the advances booked in terms of local democratic governance and health, the authors underline the need to address the incoherence in global reform policies and - in the current situation - the impossibility of achieving democratic governance and equity in health within the confines of the city. Finally, the authors question the relevance of a development paradigm that does not address democratic local governance and existing structural (political, social, economic) inequalities.

J	Benatar, SR				Benatar, SR			Reflections and recommendations on research ethics in developing countries	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						ethics research; ethics committees; developing countries; global health; informed consent; international collaboration; justice; standard of care	HIV VACCINE TRIALS; INFORMED CONSENT; INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; CLINICAL RESEARCH; GLOBAL HEALTH; TUBERCULOSIS; ISSUES	The debate on the ethics of international clinical research involving collaboration with developing countries has achieved a high profile in recent years. Informed consent and universal standards have been most intensively debated. Exploitation and lack of adequate attention to justice in the distribution of risks/harm and benefits to individuals and communities have to a lesser extent been addressed. The global context in which these debates are taking place, and some of the less obvious implications for research ethics and for health are discussed here to broaden understanding of the complexity of the debate. A wider role is proposed for research ethics committees, one that includes an educational component and some responsibility for audit. It is proposed that new ways of thinking are needed about the role of research ethics in promoting moral progress in the research endeavour and improving global health. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Haskell, A; Rovinsky, D; Brown, HK; Coughlin, RR				Haskell, A; Rovinsky, D; Brown, HK; Coughlin, RR			The University of California at San Francisco International Orthopaedic Elective	CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH			English	Article							GLOBAL HEALTH; PHYSICIANS	International volunteerism helps remedy global inequities in orthopaedic care and provides relief for increasing professional disillusionment experienced by many orthopaedic surgeons in the United States. From 1992 to 1998, 41% of residents from the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco volunteered overseas. Approximately, one half of those have continued volunteering internationally after residency, including many who led later trips with residents. Based on the success of these trips, the University of California, San Francisco Department of Orthopaedic Surgery established a 1-month elective rotation in Umtata, South Africa in conjunction with Orthopaedics Overseas. Seventy-six percent of residents have chosen this opportunity since the program's inception in 1998. The University, of California, San Francisco experience suggests that early exposure to international volunteerism during residency promotes continued participation in volunteer activities after graduation. By, providing residents with the opportunity to volunteer overseas, the University of California, San Francisco hopes to enhance resident education, foster a lifelong spirit of volunteerism, and serve as a model for other orthopaedic training programs.

J	Nord, E				Nord, E			Measures of goal attainment and performance in the World Health Report 2000 - A brief, critical consumer guide	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						DALY; evaluation; health systems; World Health Organisation; World Health Report		The World Health Report 2000 presents a set of indicators and global indices by which different countries' goal attainment and performance in health care may be compared. The paper explains the methods employed in some detail and raises a number of critical points. The WHO has gone too far in compressing the results of potentially useful primary measurements in summary indices with unclear meaning, dubious validity and little practical relevance to decision makers facing specific tasks and problems. The WHO has also gone too far in applying the same measuring rods to countries with different histories and values and different stages of development, and in encouraging international comparisons that are of little use to policy makers. The WHO needs to add an indicator of equality in access to its present indicator of fairness in financing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nathan, S; Rotem, A; Ritchie, J				Nathan, S; Rotem, A; Ritchie, J			Closing the gap: building the capacity of non-government organizations as advocates for health equity	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						advocacy; capacity building; health equity; non-government organizations		Seeking achievement of health equity has underpinned national government and global health policies for decades. However, major difficulties and challenges faced in the practice of achieving 'Health for All' has led to a recognition of the need to broaden the focus of efforts to improve health equity. Civil society groups have been identified as key stakeholders in attempts to achieve health equity,, and the importance of strengthening their capacity to influence relevant government policy and practice has been highlighted. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study which examined the role of organizations outside government in advocating for health equity, and the capacities and conditions that were related to their success. In-depth, unstructured interviews were conducted with 26 non-government organizations (NGOs) who were active in three important health policy debates in Australia. The grounded theory method was used to direct data collection and analysis, and member checking was employed to ensure soundness and build ownership of the findings. Effective advocacy was found to be a dynamic process characterized by flexibility and opportunism within a framework of longer term goals. Two key ways of working were identified-in partnership and in conflict with government, with shifts in emphasis in response to organizational strengths and a changing environment. A number of domains of capacity, which together are termed 'capacity for advocacy', were also identified. It is clear that NGOs can learn a great deal from each other, but there needs to be investment by governments, international agencies and NGOs themselves if advocacy for health equity is to be strengthened.

The reconstruction of the health sector in postapartheid South Africa striving for equity in health service delivery and building of a decentralized structure based on health districts. In terms of information systems (IS) development, this reform process translates into standardization of health data in ways that inscribe the goals of the new South Africa by enhancing local control and integration of information handling. We describe our approach to action research and use concepts from actor-network and structuration theories in analyzing the case material. In the detailed description and analysis of the process of IS development provided, we focus on the need to balance standardization and local flexibility (localization); standardization is thus seen as bottom-up alignment of an array of heterogeneous actors. Building on a social system model of information systems, we conceptualize the IS design strategy developed and used as the cultivation of processes whereby these actors are translating and aligning their interests. We develop a modular hierarchy of global and local datasets as a framework within which the tensions between standardization and localization may be understood and addressed. Finally, we discuss the possible relevance of the results 0 the research in other countries.

An integrated framework draw; theoretical perspectives from both approaches and from public health. Determinants of women's health in the geopolitical environment include country-specific history and geography, policies and services. legal rights, organizations and institutions, and structures that shape gender and economic inequality. Culture, norms and sanctions at the country and community level, and sociodemographic characteristics at the individual level, influence women's productive and reproductive roles in the household and workplace. Social capital. roles, psychosocial stresses and resources, health services, and behaviors mediate social, economic and cultural effects on health outcomes. Inequality between and within households contributes to the patterning of women's health. Within the framework, relationships may vary depending upon women's lifestage and cohort experience. Examples of other relevant theoretical frameworks are discussed. The conclusion suggests strategies to improve data, influence policy, and extend research to better understand the effect of gender and socioeconomic inequality on women's health.

Over 98% of deaths occur in resource-poor countries. However, poverty alone neither justifies nor necessarily explains death rates. The Inter-Agency Group for Safe Motherhood, composed of six leading international agencies, has identified major medical causes of unsafe motherhood, and their origins in medical and health system failures, and in the failures of social justice that underlie them. These include women's 'inadequate education, low social status, and lack of income and employment opportunities.' This paper addresses the role of human rights to redress inequities that condition unsafe motherhood, and identifies five critical rights the observance of which would facilitate safe motherhood. These are women's rights to life, to liberty and security of the person, and to health, maternity protection and non-discrimination. (C) 2002 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

We argue that there is a two-way link between poverty and health in which nutrition plays an important role both as an active and as a mediating factor. Key concepts are exposed and expanded: (a) Development per se does not ensure better health; (b) unequal distribution of income has an independent effect on health indicators after adjusting for total income; (c) improving health can make an important contribution to reducing poverty; (d) improving nutrition throughout the whole life course is an indispensable strategy for better health; (e) obesity has to be included amongst the most critical health problems, has different traits, and presents with different challenges in the developing world and in the industrialized countries.

Poor countries tend to have worse health outcomes than better-off countries. Within countries, poor people have worse health outcomes than better-off people. This association reflects causality running in both directions: poverty breeds ill-health, and ill-health keeps poor people poor. The evidence on inequalities in health between the poor and non-poor and on the consequences for impoverishment and income inequality associated with health care expenses is discussed in this article. An outline is given of what is known about the causes of inequalities and about the effectiveness of policies intended to combat them. It is argued that too little is known about the impacts of such policies, notwithstanding a wealth of measurement techniques and considerable evidence on the extent and causes of inequalities.

Although it is accepted that ethics play a central role in health research in developing countries, much of the recent debate has focused on controversies surrounding internationally sponsored research and has taken place largely without adequate participation of the developing countries, The relationship between ethical guidelines and regulations, and indigenously sponsored and public health research has not been adequately explored. For example, while the fundamental principles of ethical health research, such as community participation, informed consent, and shared benefits and burdens, remain sacrosanct other issues, such as standards of care and prior agreements, merit greater public debate within developing countries. In particular, the relationship of existing ethical guidelines to epidemiological and public health research merits further exploration. In order to support health research in developing countries that is both relevant and meaningful, the focus must be on developing health research that promotes equity and on developing local capacity in bioethics. Only through such proactive measures can we address the emerging ethical dilemmas and challenges that globalization and the genomics revolution will bring in their wake.

The trade modes include cross-border delivery of health services via physical and electronic means, and cross-border movement of consumers, professionals, and capital. An examination of the positive and negative implications of trade in health services for equity, efficiency, quality, and access to health care indicates that health services trade has brought mixed benefits and that there is a clear role for policy measures to mitigate the adverse consequences and facilitate the gains. Some policy measures and priority areas for action are outlined, including steps to address the "brain drain"; increasing investment in the health sector and prioritizing this investment better; and promoting linkages between private and public health care services to ensure equity. Data collection, measures, and studies on health services trade all need to be improved, to assess better the magnitude and potential implications of this trade. In this context, the potential costs and benefits of trade in health services are shaped by the underlying structural conditions and existing regulatory, policy, and infrastructure in the health sector. Thus, appropriate policies and safeguard measures are required to take advantage of globalization in health services.

Studies of the literacy rates of girls and women around the world are considered together with studies of maternal schooling, and its effects on a variety of female behaviors. The paper is designed to provoke critical discussion about the future of public schooling worldwide, using the complex relationship between schooling and females' development as a metaphor for this process. The experiences of girls and women within schools are especially informative and suggestive of the potential contributions of public schooling to the general well-being of a nation. However, there have been, and continue to be, many challenges to access and equity within schools and classrooms around the world. The United States of America is the nation used as a case study example for the developed world. We conclude that flexibility and choice are crucial features if useful future options for formal schooling are to be enhanced for girls and women worldwide. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

The data, from the International Collaborative Study of Oral Health Outcomes, were collected through personal interviews and clinical examinations. The research group measured the study sites' overall oral health, examining the percentage of the population with five or more missing and two or more decayed teeth. The group also assessed the magnitude of inequality among education groups by using indices of excess morbidity. Baltimore had the lowest percentage (10.8 percent) of decayed teeth and second lowest percentage (17.3 percent) of missing teeth, but the greatest indices of excess morbidity (79.2 percent for missing, 73.1 percent for decayed). Lodz, by contrast, had the worst overall dentition status (75.3 percent for missing, 70.3 percent for decayed) but the lowest inequality indices (10.6 percent for missing, 13.8 percent for decayed). This study demonstrates the need for policymakers in the study countries to consider not only overall levels but also the distribution of oral health, and it presents various challenges for oral health professionals in designing and implementing oral health programs.

The most significant factors to adolescents' health are found in their environments, and in the choices and opportunities for health-enhancing or health-compromising behaviors that these contexts present (e.g., exposure to violence, supportive families). Inadequate contexts represent a failure to invest in and protect adolescents, a choice to alienate rather than integrate them into society. This article describes a number of societal trends, including growing poverty and income disparities, government instability, the changing health-care system, the spread of HIV/AIDS, increased migration and urbanization, changing family and cultural contexts, and new information technology. The health implications of these trends for the well-being of adolescents in the 21st century are contemplated.

To produce data comparable to recent European Studies. Occupational data in the HUNT Study were reclassified according to the international Erikson Goldthorpe Portocarero (EGP) social class scheme. Methods: To cross-sectional sectional health surveys were undertaken with a 10-year interval. HUNT I (1984-86) and HUNT II (1995-97). This was a primary healthcare, total-county population study, participants for this analysis being men aged 25-69 years. Results: A consistent pattern as found of increasing health problems with decreasing socioeconomic status for four health variables: self-perceived health, temporary disability, any long-standing health problem. and chronic conditions. The prevalence ratio between the highest and lowest status groups for "perceived health less than good" was 2.0 in the first survey and 2.1 in the second 10 years later. The magnitude of differences for the other health outcomes was at this level or smaller, with no significant overall time trend from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. Conclusions: The magnitude of socioeconomic gradients in health in this studs seemed some somewhat smaller than results from national Studies. and on the average compared to Studies from other European countries: there was no detectable time trend in health differentials. International comparative Studies have suggested considerably larger inequalities in health according to social class in Norway a using national data.

J	Jaggar, AM				Jaggar, AM			Vulnerable women and neo-liberal globalization: Debt burdens undermine women's health in the global South	THEORETICAL MEDICINE AND BIOETHICS			English	Article						debt cancellation; gender inequality; neoliberalism; women's health		Contemporary processes of globalization have been accompanied by a serious deterioration in the health of many women across the world. Particularly disturbing is the drastic decline in the health status of many women in the global South, as well as some women in the global North. This paper argues that the health vulnerability of women in the global South is inseparable from their political and economic vulnerability. More specifically, it links the deteriorating health of many Southern women with the neo-liberal economic policies that characterize contemporary economic globalization and argues that this structure is sustained by the heavy burden of debt repayments imposed on many Southern countries. In conclusion, it argues that many Southern debt obligations are not morally binding because they are not democratically legitimate.

J	Filmer, D; Hammer, JS; Pritchett, LH				Filmer, D; Hammer, JS; Pritchett, LH			Weak links in the chain II: A prescription for health policy in poor countries	WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER			English	Article							SUBSIDIES	In an earlier article, the authors outline some reasons for the disappointingly small effects of primary health care programs and identified two weak links standing between spending and increased health care. The first was the inability to translate public expenditure on health care into real services due to inherent difficulties of monitoring and controlling the behavior of public employees. The second was the "crowding out" of private markets for health care, markets that exist predominantly at the primary health care level. This article presents an approach to public policy in health that comes directly from the literature on public economics. It identifies two characteristic market failures in health. The first is the existence of large externalities in the control of many infectious diseases that are mostly addressed by standard public health interventions. The second is the widespread breakdown of insurance markets that leave people exposed to catastrophic financial losses. Other essential considerations in setting priorities in health are the degree to which policies address poverty and inequality and the practicality of implementing policies given limited administrative capacities. Priorities based on these criteria tend to differ substantially from those commonly prescribed by the international community.

Transportation and communication technology plus worldwide health, environmental, and security risks and a world economy driven by transnational corporations are connecting us in a new kind of way. Incredible advances in biotechnology, the pressing demands of equity and justice in resource allocation, and the need for a universal perspective in health ethics are some of the issues challenging our moral imagination in significant ways.

J	Smallman, C				Smallman, C			The reality of "Revitalizing health and safety"	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH			English	Article						health and safety policy; literature review; research agenda	OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; WORKPLACE SAFETY; PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY; ORGANIZATIONAL-FACTORS; WORKERS-COMPENSATION; CONTRACT WORKERS; LABOR UNIONS; RISK CONTROL; LONG-TERM; ACCIDENTS	Problem: Workplace health and safety remains an important international socioeconomic issue, but the progressive declines in reported incidents may be slowing. The British Government has responded by launching a new policy initiative aimed at "Revitalizing Health and Safety" by establishing targets for improvement, strategies, and a series of action points, mainly targeting employers and organizational issues. This paper critically assesses the realities of implementing this policy with respect to the scientific base for each of the strategies. Method: Literature meta-analysis; analysis of policy. Results: Empirically proven determinants of workplace health and safety provide baselines for compensation and conditions of work, workforce characteristics, workplace characteristics, health and safety environment, political and economic factors, and industry characteristics. Support for different policy elements is varied and there are some significant gaps. Summary: An impressive body of research was found that offers a firm foundation for future developments. However, the need for work that is interdisciplinary, ordered, and collaborative is pressing. The need to move away from elegant but simplistic pictures of occupational health and safety (OHS) management practice, and to reflect true complexity is imperative. The reality of health and safety at work is that it is an issue that is taken lightly by those who do not practice or research safe and healthy working, and a serious issue for victims or relatives of victims of shoddy management. It remains one of the bastions of inequality of work worldwide. Impact on industry: The intent of governments in attempting to reinvigorate the suppression of workplace injury and illness is motivated by both social and economic imperatives. Motivation for organizations is not fully understood as there is no obvious business imperative. If organizations can further understand and provide a scientific justification for investment in OHS management, then governments' task will be made easier. By proving the value of OHS to management, we will demonstrate that organizations continue to present considerable hazards to their employees.

J	Crampton, P; Dowell, A; Woodward, A				Crampton, P; Dowell, A; Woodward, A			Third sector primary care for vulnerable populations	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						primary health care; third sector; New Zealand; vulnerable populations	ORIENTED PRIMARY CARE; NEW-ZEALAND; GENERAL-PRACTICE; COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; HEALTH-SERVICES; UNITED-STATES; ASSOCIATIONS	This paper aims to describe and explain the development of third sector primary care organisations in New Zealand. The third sector is the non-government, non-profit sector. International literature suggests that this sector fulfils an important role in democratic societies with market-based economies, providing services otherwise neglected by the government and private for-profit sectors. Third sector organisations provided a range of social services throughout New Zealand's colonial history. However, it was not until the 1980s that third sector organisations providing comprehensive primary medical and related services started having a significant presence in New Zealand. In 1994 a range of union health centres, tribally based Maori health providers, and community-based primary care providers established a formal network - Health Care Aotearoa. While not representing all third sector primary care providers in New Zealand, Health Care Aotearoa was the best-developed example of a grouping of third sector primary care organisations. Member organisations served populations that were largely non-European and lived in deprived areas, and tended to adopt population approaches to funding and provision of services. The development of Health Care Aotearoa has been consistent with international experience of third sector involvement - there were perceived "failures" in government policies for funding primary care and private sector responses to these policies, resulting in lack of universal funding and provision of primary care and continuing patient co-payments. The principal policy implication concerns the role of the third sector in providing primary care services for vulnerable populations as a partial alternative to universal funding and provision of primary care. Such an alternative may be convenient for proponents of reduced state involvement in funding and provision of health care, but may not be desirable from the point of view of equity and social cohesion insofar as the role of the welfare state is diminished.

J	McDonald, R; Burrill, P; Walley, T				McDonald, R; Burrill, P; Walley, T			Managing the entry of new medicines in the National Health Service: health authority experiences and prospects for primary care groups and trusts	HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY			English	Article						costs; drugs; medicines; policy; prescribing; rationing	CONTROLLING PHARMACEUTICAL EXPENDITURE; INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE; INDUSTRY; LESSONS; DRUGS	For the most part, the management of new medicines in the NHS has hitherto been a matter for local discretion. The result is that access to medicines is often determined by where a patient lives, as opposed to some nationally agreed clinical criteria. This 'postcode prescribing' has led to widespread variations in access to medicines and concerns about the resulting inequalities. Primary care groups and trusts are expected to reduce variations in access to care, whilst at the same time balancing their finances, since any overspends on prescribing must be covered by disinvestment in hospital and community services. We interviewed 21 health authority (HA) prescribing advisers to ascertain how they viewed the managed entry of new medicines in order to identify lessons for PCGs. In addition, we report the views of local prescribing managers on the potential impact of recent government policy changes on the process and speculate on the likely implications of these for primary care groups and trusts. What is clear from the stud-v is that HAs often have no explicit objective in relation to new medicines, but that their desire to act is prompted by fears of overspending on prescribing budgets. The danger of this approach is that patients may be denied cost-effective treatments since all new medicines are seen as a problem. It seems likely that PCG/Ts will face the same dilemmas with which the HA advisers in our study have been wrestling for some time. Recent policy changes in relation to prescribing budgets and new medicines are likely to exacerbate these problems. The tensions between local priority setting, which may mean saying no to new medicines, whilst at the same time eradicating postcode prescribing and balancing budgets means that PCG/Ts face difficult policy choices.

However, the operational problems of how to collect ethnicity data in studies of the sociology of health and illness have not been satisfactorily addressed. This paper explores conceptual issues, notably, the meanings of ethnic identity and ethnic origin/ancestry; methodological approaches, including which dimensions to collect, multidimensional versus global measures, and exclusive groups versus optional ethnicity; and also practical issues such as method of assignment. The approach calls for a stronger development of the theoretical understandings of ethnicity and work on how best ethnicity should be conceptualised and measured in the different approaches to explaining ethnic inequalities in health.

J	Freedman, LP				Freedman, LP			Using human rights in maternal mortality programs: from analysis to strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						human rights; emergency obstetric care; maternal mortality		This article describes an approach to maternal mortality reduction that uses human rights not simply to denounce the injustice of death in pregnancy and childbirth, but also to guide the design and implementation of maternal mortality policies and programs. As a first principle, programs and policies need to prioritize measures that promote universal access to high quality emergency obstetric care services, which we know from health research are essential to saving women's lives. With that priority, human rights principles can be integrated into programs at the clinical, facility management, and national policy levels. For example, a human rights `audit' can help identify ways to encourage respectful, non-discriminatory treatment of patients, providers and staff in the clinical setting. Human rights principles of entitlement and accountability can inform mechanisms of community participation designed to improve responsiveness and functioning of health facilities. Human rights principles can inform analysis of health sector reform and its impact on access to emergency obstetric care. Whether applied to the intricacies of human relationships within a facility or to the impact of international financial institutions on health systems, the ultimate role of human rights is to identify the workings of power that keep unacceptable levels of maternal morality as they are and to use the human rights vision of dignity and social justice to work for the re-arrangements of power necessary for change.

A number of arguments for increasing the role of private finance that focus on the impact of private finance on the efficiency of the public sector are examined in conjunction with empirical evidence from a number of OECD countries. The conclusion is that the case for some extension of private finance Is finely balanced. There is little evidence to show that Increasing private finance would improve the efficiency of the NHS. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that it is unlikely that increasing private finance at the margin will alter the support for the NHS, and thus willingness of individuals to pay taxes for public care. In addition, if private finance is supplementary, increased finance will be progressive in terms of payments for health care.

J	Bloom, G				Bloom, G			Equity in health in unequal societies: meeting health needs in contexts of social change	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						equity; finance; regulation; health sector reform	RURAL CHINA; REFORM; POVERTY; MARKET; LESSONS; WELFARE; AGENDA; STATES; CARE	The paper explores the implications for health policy of the segmentation of society into social groups with very different levels of income and wealth. Discourses on equity in health are presently dominated by a debate between 'European' and 'American' models of health delivery. This has led to a focus on ideal outcomes rather than practical options for organising and financing health services in poor countries undergoing rapid change. The paper argues for a more explicit acknowledgement of the dynamic character of health development and the political nature of the negotiations regarding the use of government powers. Unregulated markets for health care are neither equitable nor efficient. Government must play a role in supporting the organisation of health services used by different social groups. Countries with low levels of inequality may be able to provide universal access to relatively sophisticated health services. Otherwise, governments need to operate within a segmented system. This means the negotiation of strategies to reduce the burden of sickness and premature death, whilst meeting the needs of different social groups. The discussion is organised in terms of the powers of government to require individuals and institutions to transfer resources for social uses, enforce regulations and generate and disseminate information. The paper concludes that governments committed to equity-enhancing health development need to increase their capacity to facilitate coalition building and manage change. It proposes an international public health legal framework that might include a definition of minimum standards for certain health services, to be underwritten by national and international financial commitments.

J	Rushby, JF; Hanson, K				Rushby, JF; Hanson, K			Calculating and presenting disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in cost-effectiveness analysis	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article							WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT; GLOBAL BURDEN; DISEASE; HEALTH; METHODOLOGY; EQUITY; TIME	Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) are the sum of the present value of future years of lifetime lost through premature mortality, and the present value of years of future lifetime adjusted for the average severity (frequency and intensity) of any mental or physical disability caused by a disease or injury. They have been used as an outcome indicator in micro economic evaluations as well as sectoral prioritization exercises using league tables of cost-effectiveness. However, many of the current analyses are not comparable or transferable because either the assumptions used differ or are unclear, and because results are not presented in a way that allows researchers or policy-makers to re-calculate and re-interpret findings for use in an alternative context. However, at times there have also been miscalculations. This may happen either because evaluators disagree with the assumptions behind DALYs or because the methods of calculation have not been set out clearly. This paper shows how to calculate DALYs for cost-effectiveness analysis using a worked example. It also shows the impact of changing the age weighting and discount rates on estimates of cost-effectiveness, and suggests a set of minimum reporting criteria for using DALYs in cost-effectiveness analysis. Finally, readers are introduced briefly to a selected literature arguing for and against the use of DALYs.

J	Mittelmark, MB				Mittelmark, MB			Promoting social responsibility for health: health impact assessment and healthy public policy at the community level	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						health impact assessment; healthy public policy; social responsibility		The 1997 Jakarta Declaration on Health Promotion into the 21st Century called for new responses to address the emerging threats to health. The declaration placed a high priority on promoting social responsibility for health, and it identified equity-focused health impact assessment as a high priority for action. This theme was among the foci at the 2000 Fifth Global Conference on Health Promotion held in Mexico. This paper, which is an abbreviation of a technical report prepared for the Mexico conference, advances arguments for focusing on health impact assessment at the local level. Health impact assessment identifies negative health impacts that call for policy responses, and identifies and encourages practices and policies that promote health. Health impact assessment may be highly technical and require sophisticated technology and expertise. But it can also be a simple, highly practical process, accessible to ordinary people, and one that helps a community come to grips with local circumstances that need changing for better health. To illustrate the possibilities, this paper presents a case study, the People Assessing Their Health (PATH) project from Eastern Nova Scotia, Canada. It places ordinary citizens, rather than community elites, at the very heart of local decision-making. Evidence from PATH demonstrates that low technology health impact assessment, done by and for local people, can shift thinking beyond the illness problems of individuals. It can bring into consideration, instead, how programmes and policies support or weaken community health, and illuminate a community's capacity to improve local circumstances for better health. This stands in contrast to evidence that highly technological approaches to community-level health impact assessment can be self-defeating. Further development of simple, people-centred, low technology approaches to health impact assessment at the local level is called for.

J	Murphy, CN				Murphy, CN			Political consequences of the new inequality	INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY			English	Article								This article proposes agendas for teaching and-research about shifting global patterns of equality and inequality, a very different agenda than was appropriate when the last undergraduate professor was president of ISA, almost forty years ago. Today, unlike in that Cold War world, formal democracy is flourishing, state power is diminishing, gender inequality has diminished, and income inequality has risen. Consequences of these new patterns that demand our attention as teachers and scholars include: (1) more frequent protracted social conflicts, (2) a newly politicized sphere of international public health, (3) the. new global gender politics, (4) the new global politics of the super-rich, and (5) the new politics and ethics of the world's privileged, a group that includes most ISA members and most of our students. Our responsibilities as teachers have grown, in part, because popular media present a decreasingly coherent picture of each of these patterns; and that incoherence, itself, may help sustain global inequalities.

Large-scale national surveys to assess smoking, intake of sweets, soft drink consumption, and toothbrushing among Norwegian adolescents were conducted in November 1985, 1989, 1993, and 1997. The sun,cys were part of the World Health Organisation (WHO) international study, Health Behaviour in School-aged Children. A total of 3955 (1985), 5037 (1989), 4952 (1993), and 5026 (1997) 11-, 13-, and 15-year-old students completed anonymous questionnaires at school. The response rates varied from 79% to 90%. The results showed a strong increase in the percentages reporting ever smoking and daily intake of soft drinks and sweets with age from 11 to 15 years in each sun ey year. In 1997, at the age of 15 years, most students reported toothbrushing more than once a day (94% boys, 97% girls) and ever smoking (39% boys, 36% girls), whereas moderate proportions confirmed daily intake of soft drinks (28% boys, 19% girls). Comparison of the results across the survey years, from 1985 to 1997, showed an overall decrease in ever smoking (boys, 59% versus 39%; girls, 52% versus 36%) and toothbrushing more than once a day (boys, 95% versus 94%; girls, 99% versus 97%). Contemporary increases occurred with regard to daily soft drink consumption. Inequalities in ever smoking and daily soft drink consumption between socioeconomic status groups decreased and increased, respectively, from 1985 to 1997. The sex disparities observed in 1985, with boys being more likely than girls to report ever smoking and daily soft drink consumption, leveled off in 1997.

It is these ethical issues-which are often not acknowledged by commentators-that are the subject of this paper. It asks why there should be a focus on the poor, and explores the link between improving the health of the poor, and reducing health inequalities between the poor and better-off. It discusses difficult ethical issues at both the global level (including debt relief and the link between country ownership and donor commitment) and the country level (including user fees and whether providing assistance to the non poor may in the long run be a way of helping the poor).

J	Maantay, J				Maantay, J			Zoning, equity, and public health	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article								Zoning, the most prevalent land use planning tool in the United States, has substantial implications for equity and public health. Zoning determines where various categories of land use may go, thereby influencing the location of resulting environmental and health impacts. Industrially zoned areas permit noxious land uses and typically carry higher environmental burdens than other areas. Using New York City as a case study, the author shows that industrial zones have large residential populations within them or nearby. Noxious uses tend to be concentrated in poor and minority industrial neighborhoods because more affluent industrial areas and those with lower minority populations are rezoned for other uses, and industrial zones in poorer neighborhoods are expanded. Zoning policies, therefore, can have adverse impacts on public health and equity The location of noxious uses and the pollution they generate have ramifications for global public health and equity; these uses have been concentrated in the world's poorer places as well as in poorer places within more affluent countries. Planners, policymakers, and public health professionals must collaborate on a worldwide basis to address these equity, health, and land use planning problems.

J	Miller, AM				Miller, AM			Uneasy promises: Sexuality, health, and human rights	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; HIV	Although attention to the links between health and human rights is growing globally, the full potential of a progressive human rights approach to health has not yet been explored, and it is even more faintly understood in the United States than in the rest of the world. At the same time, global claims for sexual rights, particularly for those identifying as gay, lesbian, transsexual, or bisexual, are increasingly being made as human rights claims. All of these approaches to rights advocacy risk limiting their own transformative impact unless advocates critique their own strategies. Paradoxically, using health as a way to bring attention to nonheteronormative sexualities can be both helpful and potentially dangerous, especially when coupled with human rights. Recognizing sexuality as a critical element of humanity; and establishing a fundamental human right to health, can play a role in broader social justice claims, but the tendency of both public health and human rights advocacy to "normalize" and regulate must be scrutinized and challenged.

After presenting data on the level and distribution of resources, three topics are examined. The first is the lessons from international comparisons of evidence on expenditure, equity and healthcare outcomes. The second is the lessons from the recent internal market reforms. The third is the lessons from an analysis of the role for private finance in UK healthcare. The review concludes that economists and policymakers need to focus more attention on the relationship between healthcare inputs expenditure - and health outcomes, and, within this, on the incentives facing suppliers and demanders of healthcare.

Specifically, I present the view that there are within feminist approaches to bioethics some conceptual and methodological tools necessary to forge a bioethics that embraces the health-related concerns of both developing and developed nations equally. To support my argument I discuss some of the challenges that have historically confronted feminists. If feminists accept the idea that women are entirely the same, then feminists present as fact the fiction of the essential "Woman.'' Not only does "Woman'' not exist, "she'' obscures important racial, ethnic, cultural, and class differences among women. However, if feminists stress women's differences too much, feminists lose the power to speak coherently and cogently about gender justice, women's rights, and sexual equality in general. Analyzing the ways in which the idea of difference as well as the idea of sameness have led feminists astray, I ask whether it is possible to avoid the Scylla of absolutism (imperialism, colonialism, hegemony) on the one hand and the Charybdis of relativism (postmodernism, fragmentation, Balkanization) on the other. Finally, after reflecting upon the work of Uma Narayan, Susan Muller Okin, and Martha Nussbaum, I conclude that there is a way out of this ethical bind. By focusing on women's, children's, and men's common human needs, it is possible to lay the foundation for a just and caring global bioethics.

J	Auer, AM; Andersson, R				Auer, AM; Andersson, R			Canadian Aboriginal communities: a framework for injury surveillance	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Aboriginal; community-based; injury surveillance; safety promotion	HEALTH; PREVENTION	At the international level, evidence supports the position that regardless of whether a country is industrialized or less developed vulnerable populations living in poor social conditions are at disproportionate risk of injury. The Aboriginal population of Canada is one such vulnerable population. In addition to poor social conditions and marginalization related to historical injustices, this population is faced with the challenge of working with little or no descriptive injury data relevant to the community level. It has been and continues to be a significant barrier to the adoption and implementation of injury prevention strategies and programs. Recognizing that surveillance is an intrinsic component of public health practice this study was undertaken to address a critical data gap facing Aboriginal communities. The objective of the study was to develop the conceptual design of an injury surveillance framework that would be culturally relevant, that is 'acceptable and owned by the target population: and would meet the specific requirements for injury data and data collection methods for the study population. The methodology was undertaken with focus groups at national and community levels, and relied on the use of strategic activities such as benchmarking guided discussions, nominal group technique exercises and critical document reviews The process of benchmarking served to identify that injury surveillance systems described in the literature, linking data to action, are not a predominant reality The locus of control is often removed from the population of interest and resides primarily with experts under the jurisdiction and control of designated authorities. In order for the surveillance system to have cultural relevance, the focus group identified that the locus of control must be defined by the population of interest at the community level, and that the system must be germane and flexible to consider the local environment. The Aboriginal framework proposed places the locus of control with the community, in partnership with its data sources. Surveillance activities remain largely distinct from communities of interest, leading us to consider whether structural changes can serve to promote a link between data and action. Traditional or standard surveillance systems, by virtue of their structure, promote a disassociation between information and community action. Data management under the complete jurisdiction of sources external to a community appears to obstruct potential linkages between information and action.

Methods We examined the association between self-rated health and limiting longstanding illness and specific health problems at two ages (23 and 33 years), and assessed change over the 10-year period for each health measure relative to another. Longitudinal data were taken Gum the nationally representative British birth cohort for which health measures were obtained at ages 23 and 33. Results Self-rated health and limiting longstanding illness were strongly associated with each other as well as with specific health problems, particularly with serious conditions (e.g. epilepsy, cancer, diabetes) and more weakly with less serious conditions (e.g. enema and hay fever). Rating of overall health and limiting longstanding illness was highly stable during the 10-year period with most, but not all, health change reflecting a deterioration in health status. Deterioration in limiting illness corresponded to an even greater health decline in specific conditions. Conclusions Self-rated health and limiting longstanding illness are valid health measures appropriate for use in general health surveys.

J	Benson, JS				Benson, JS			The impact of privatization on access in Tanzania	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						accessibility; health facilities; equity; Tanzania	HEALTH-CARE; USER FEES; ADJUSTMENT; DISEASE; AFRICA	In the late 1980s, many developing countries were forced to adopt structural adjustment policies as a condition for securing loans From the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. One of the World Bank's recommended policies was to change the mix of private and public health facilities. This study, based on fieldwork done in Tanzania in 1993, examines the impact of this policy on health-care accessibility in two northern Tanzanian districts, one rural and one urban. Accessibility was measured in terms of equality and equity of coverage. The placement of the very few government clinics opened during the years 1985-1993 did much more to improve coverage than the haphazard location of many new private clinics. Equity was not improved as very few clinics were placed in demographically needy areas. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We compared the inequality index as published in the World Health Report 2000 with available evidence on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in 15 industrialised and 43 less-developed countries. We found that the World Health Report index does not correspond with international variations in the size of socioeconomic inequalities in mortality. These findings indicate that the index should not be interpreted as a reflection of socioeconomic inequalities in health, nor should the index be used to replace the indices developed to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in health.

AGE AND AGEING			English	Article						aged; eligibility determination; health planning; long-term care; mental disorders	INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEMENTIA; DIAGNOSIS; PEOPLE	Background: in 1996, the British government directed health authorities to draw up local eligibility criteria for National Health Service continuing health care. Objectives: to examine whether elderly mentally ill continuing-care National Health Service patients fulfilled a variety of eligibility criteria for their placement, and to identify the characteristics of patients who met local eligibility criteria. Design: descriptive study. Setting: four continuing-care units for elderly mentally ill patients in and around London. Subjects: 67 continuing-care inpatients. Methods: interview with nurse carer and, where possible, the patient with the use of standard global, functional, behavioural and cognitive rating scales. We determined fulfilment of Royal College of psychiatrists' guideline criteria and three local eligibility criteria for elderly mentally ill continuing care. We identified clinical differences between those eligible and ineligible. Results: although there were wide variations between local eligibility criteria, their effects were the same. In total, 58% of patients fulfilled all local eligibility criteria; 42% fulfilled none. Patients who fulfilled local eligibility, criteria scored much higher on ratings of aggression, activity disturbance (wandering, and purposeless and inappropriate activity) and paranoid and delusional ideation. Ten percent of patients fulfilled Royal College of psychiatrists' criteria but not local eligibility, criteria. Conclusions: comprehensive and unambiguous national eligibility criteria should be introduced to reflect clinical needs and provide equity of access.

J	Klavus, J				Klavus, J			Statistical inference of progressivity dominance: an application to health care financing distributions	JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						health care finance; progressivity; dominance; statistical tests	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; LORENZ CURVES; INCOME SHARES; EQUITY	This paper employs a distribution-free statistical test suitable for comparisons based on dependent samples to analyse changes in health care financial distributions on Finnish data. In distinction to the more general summary index approach used in most studies of progressivity measurement, the difference between the Lorenz curve of income inequality and the concentration curves of various taxes and payments is used to evaluate progressivity dominance and changes in progressivity. Sample weights are applied to account for the effect of sampling design and non-response. The analysis demonstrates that the dominance approach can be successfully applied to various types of distributional problems besides comparisons concerning differences in income distributions. As an empirical application the paper presents estimation results for the progressivity of various health care financing sources using data from the 1987 and 1996 Finnish Health Care Surveys.

J	Geistfeld, M				Geistfeld, M			Reconciling cost-benefit analysis with the principle that safety matters more than money	NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW			English	Review							LEGAL RULES; LIABILITY; DAMAGES; INCOMMENSURABILITY; EFFICIENCY; CAUSATION; VALUATION; EQUITY; LAW	Some health and safety laws emphasize safety over cost considerations by invoking the principle that safety matters more than money. Other laws rely on cost-benefit analysis (CBA) that equates safety and money. In this Article, Professor Mark Geistfeld argues that, despite their apparent inconsistency, the two regulatory approaches can be reconciled. He first explains why the safety principle most plausibly stands for a distributive claim that in the context of nonconsensual risk impositions, the safety interests of potential victims deserve greater weight than the ordinary economic interests of potential injurers. Although this claim seems to be inconsistent with CBA, Professor Geistfeld analyzes cost-benefit tort rules to demonstrate how potential victims are inadequately compensated for certain types of nonconsensual risks threatening death, an inequity that can be quantified with rest-benefit methodology. He shows that the inequity is defensibly remedied by altering the duty of care to give safety interests greater weight than economic interests (the weighting sanctioned by the safety principle), which ultimately yields a well-defined decision rule that modifies CBA for certain types of nonconsensual risks threatening serious physical injury. Subsequently, he contends that modified CBA (1) satisfies the requirements of modern welfare economics, (2) can accommodate a wide range of normative concerns, and (3) closely conforms to important tort practices, suggesting that it implements a version of the safety principle closely corresponding to the version adopted by the tort system. Finally, Professor Geistfeld concludes that the value of modified CSA is illustrated by the structure it gives to the precautionary principle, a vague regulatory approach based on the safety principle that has become increasingly important and controversial in international law.

Perhaps this is the reason why very few studies recently have dealt with the social and economic consequences of long-term illness in Sweden. Aims: The research question raised here is therefore to examine chronic illness (defined as limiting longstanding illness, LLSI) as a causal factor contributing adverse financial conditions, unemployment or labour market exclusion. Methods: A longitudinal design was employed with data from a sample of 27,773 people interviewed twice (Swedish Surveys of Living Conditions performed by Statistics Sweden), including subjects (n=12,556) at interview I, without chronic illness or adverse socioeconomic conditions. Results: The odds ratios for labour market exclusion, unemployment, and financial difficulties among people who had acquired LLSI at interview II varied between 1.4 and 4.0 for the outcomes. The elevated OR decreased after testing For the mediating effect of social context and the labour market position for financial difficulties but remained significantly elevated. Conclusions: The results suggest that LLSI increases the risk of adverse financial conditions, unemployment, and of not being economically active.

The main concept of this principle is to select options so as to maintain exposures at a reasonable level. The feature of this concept is to look for the minimal total cost, i.e., the sum of the costs of protection and health detriment. In its publications, ICRP emphasized the need for developing models which also take into account the "subjective" aspects of health detriment in the optimization process, such as the perception of risk by individuals and the need to put more emphasis on equity in the distribution of individual doses. This paper proposes a modified alpha-value model based on CEPN's model (Centre d'Etude sur L'Evaluation de la protection dans le Domaine Nucleaire) to put more emphasis on recently published considerations about the smaller effects of the portion of collective dose derived from small doses. The parameters of the monetary value of unit collective dose averted, which is a key element of this type of model, can be estimated by means of approaches like human capital (HC) and willingness to pay (WTP) from the point of view of economic theories. The present study summarizes the results achieved by WTP among the radiation specialists mainly from the Paks Nuclear Power Plant, Hungary. The aim of the effort was to determine the value of a statistical life and the monetary value of a unit person-sievert associated with averted occupational exposure due to ionizing radiation. To apply the WTP method, a questionnaire has been prepared on the basis of the one introduced by CEPN in the late 1990's. The investigations show that the value of US$6,200 person-Sv(-1) seems to be acceptable for the alpha (base)-value for the occupational situation In Hungary in 1999. WTP assessments should be applied with caution since the economic level of the country, the workplace surveyed, and the computational methods affect the results. In addition, achieving a high level safety culture must rely on international cooperation both from the theoretical and practical viewpoints, and international markets affect the associated costs. Therefore the monetary requirements cannot always be assessed solely on a national basis.

J	Pearce, MS; Parker, L				Pearce, MS; Parker, L			Childhood cancer registrations in the developing world: Still more boys than girls	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						sex ratio; childhood cancer; cancer registration; inequality	HEALTH; CHILDREN; CARE	It has been shown previously that in many developing countries the reported incidence of childhood cancer for boys is substantially higher than for girls and that this difference is related to economic development of the country under study. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the sex ratio of children registered with malignant diseases and national economic development. Sex ratios for childhood cancer registration were obtained for populations within 53 countries from the second volume of the International incidence of Childhood Cancer (range boys: girls 1.09-2.05). Demographic, economic and health data for the corresponding countries were obtained from published statistics and used to determine the extent to which sex ratios were associated with national economic status. The ratio of boys:girls registered with childhood cancer increased with decreasing gross domestic product and with increasing infant mortality, suggesting that boys are increasingly more likely than girls to be registered with increasing economic disadvantage. Combining these results with childhood cancer registration data from northern England suggests that little of the predominance of boys reaching a specialist centre can be explained by differences between boys and girls in early deaths from the disease. The previously observed differences in the childhood cancer registration sex ratio in developing countries still exist. Hence, international differences in the incidence of childhood cancer should be interpreted cautiously as they may not necessarily reflect only differences in the underlying occurrence of disease.

This study examined the relationship between potential childhood risk factors and social phobia in an epidemiological sample. Identifying risk factors such as childhood adversities can often uncover important clues as to the aetiology of a disorder. This information also enables health care providers to predict which individuals are most likely to develop the disorder. Methods. Data came from the Mental Health Supplement to the Ontario Health Survey of a survey of 8116 Canadian respondents, aged 15-64. Social phobia was diagnosed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Childhood risk factors were assessed by a series of standardized questions. Results. A positive relationship was observed between social phobia and lack of close relationship with an adult, not being first born tin males only), marital conflict in the family of origin, parental history of mental disorder, moving more than three times as a child, juvenile justice and child welfare involvement, running away from home, childhood physical and sexual abuse, failing a grade, requirement of special education before age 9 and dropping out of high school. Many of these variables remained significant after controlling for phobias, major depressive disorder and alcohol abuse. The data also suggest that some childhood risk factors may interact with gender to influence the development of social phobia. Conclusions. Although an association was detected between social phobia and childhood risk factors, naturalistic prospective studies are needed to clarify the aetiological importance of these and other potential risk factors for the disorder.

However, few studies have attempted to assess whether differences in access, utilization, and satisfaction exist between Medicaid and commercially sponsored children who are enrolled in the same managed care plan. Objective.-To systematically answer the following research question: Within the same large, nonprofit, group-model health maintenance organization (HMO), how do children enrolled in Medicaid compare with children enrolled commercially across the domains of access, utilization, and satisfaction with care? Methods.-We compared access, satisfaction, and utilization of services between Medicaid and commercially sponsored children enrolled in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California during 1998 through use of a telephone survey and administrative data. Kaiser Permanente is a nonprofit, integrated, group HMO that serves 2.8 million members in more than 15 counties in northern California. The sample for this survey included 510 Medicaid- enrolled children and 512 commercially enrolled children. An overall response rate of 82% was achieved. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare Medicaid and commercially enrolled children. Results.-We found few differences between commercial and Medicaid enrollees across the domains of access, utilization, and satisfaction. Where access differences were present (problems in finding a personal care provider, problems getting care overall, and experiencing I or more barriers to care), the differences favored Medicaid-enrolled children. That is, Medicaid enrollees were reported to experience significantly fewer access problems and barriers than commercial enrollees, even after adjustment for confounding factors. Only one difference was found between Medicaid and commercial enrollees across the 6 utilization variables examined (volume of emergency department visits), and no differences were found among the 4 satisfaction and 2 global assessments of care received. Taken together, our results suggest that Medicaid-enrolled children experience as good as or better care than their commercially enrolled counterparts. However, there are other possible explanations for our findings. It may be that families of Medicaid-enrolled children hold their care providers to a lower standard than families of commercially enrolled children, given historic inequities in care between poor and nonpoor families. In addition, some degree of selection bias may be present in our sample, although that is true for both the Medicaid and commercial populations. Conclusions.-Our findings suggest that large commercial HMOs are capable of eliminating the access barriers and stigma traditionally associated with the Medicaid program. However, this conclusion must be tempered with the knowledge that other explanations for our findings may also be at play.

Focus on Africa, where the heterosexual epidemic has attained catastrophic proportions, reveals some cultural particularisms but many more regularities in the social production of disease. Global inequalities of class, gender, and ethnicity are revealed, as poverty, powerlessness, and stigma propel the spread of HIV. Anthropologists' witness to suffering, their concern and engagement, are potent elements in the research process and in advocacy in national and international arenas. The combined strength of theory and practice in the field of international research on AIDS is a significant contribution to anthropology in the twenty-first century.

For some time the disability has been relatively neglected by those interested in public health. Public health priorities have largely been determined by statistics on mortality. The World Health Organization has argued for some time that public health should be concerned with 'adding life to years' as well as 'adding years to life'. This article will argue that depression should be a key priority for public health research.

There is now a general consensus that the integration of the universalist and culturally relativist approaches, and their methodologies, is required to generate a truly international psychiatric epidemiology. The large body of research investigating the influence of culture on the epidemiology of depression has produced a number of key findings: the clinical presentation of depression in all cultures is associated with multiple somatic symptoms of chronic duration; psychological symptoms, however, are important for diagnosis and can be easily elicited. The diagnostic differentiation between depression and anxiety in general health care settings is not clinically valid. Culturally appropriate terminology for depression can be identified and their use may improve levels of recognition and treatment compliance. It is also evident that culture is only one factor in the difference between, and within, human societies which has a bearing on the epidemiology of depression. Other factors, which may interact with culture, such as gender and income inequality, are major risk factors for depression. Future international research must focus on two themes: (i) intervention studies including cost-effectiveness outcomes; and (ii) research aiming to bridge the gap between regional public health priorities and the concern that psychiatrists have about depression.

Inadequate access to pharmaceuticals plays a role in perpetuating this disparity. Drugs and vaccines may not be accessible because of weak distribution infrastructures or because development of the desired products has been neglected. This situation can be tackled with push interventions to lower the costs and risks of product development for industry, with pull interventions providing economic and market incentives, and with the creation of infrastructures allowing products to be put into use. If appropriately motivated, pharmaceutical companies can bring to partnerships expertise in product development, production process development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution -all of which are lacking in the public sector. A large variety of public-private partnerships, combining the skills and resources of a wide range of collaborators, have arisen for product development, disease control through product donation and distribution, or the general strengthening or coordination of health services. Administratively, such partnerships may either involve affiliation with international organizations, i.e. they are essentially public-sector programmes with private-sector participation, or they may be legally independent not-for-profit bodies. These partnerships should be regarded as social experiments; they show promise but are not a panacea. New ventures should be built on need, appropriateness, and lessons on good practice learnt from experience. Suggestions are made for public, private, and joint activities that could help to improve the access of poor populations to the pharmaceuticals and health services they need.

J	Dollar, D				Dollar, D			Is globalization good for your health?	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article						commerce; international cooperation; income; economic development; public health; risk factors; health policy; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/transmission/prevention and control; pharmaceutical preparations/supply and distribution; patents; developing countries	GROWTH	Four points are made about globalization and health. First, economic integration is a powerful force for raising the incomes of poor countries. In the past 20 years several large developing countries have opened up to trade and investment, and they are growing well - faster than the rich countries. Second, there is no tendency for income inequality to increase in countries that open up, The higher growth that accompanies globalization in developing countries generally benefits poor people, Since there is a large literature linking income of the poor to health status, we can be reasonably confident that globalization has indirect positive effects on nutrition, infant mortality and other health issues related to Income. Third, economic integration can obviously have adverse health effects as well: the transmission of AIDS through migration and travel is a dramatic recent example. However, both relatively closed and relatively open developing countries have severe AIDS problems. The practical solution lies in health policies, not in policies on economic integration. Likewise, free trade in tobacco will lead to increased smoking unless health-motivated disincentives are put in place, Global integration requires supporting institutions and policies. Fourth, the international architecture can be improved so that It Is more beneficial to poor countries. For example, with regard to intellectual property rights, it may be practical for pharmaceutical innovators to choose to have intellectual property rights in either rich country markets or poor country ones, but not both. In this way incentives could be strong for research on diseases in both rich and poor countries.

J	Cornia, GA				Cornia, GA			Globalization and health: results and options	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article						commerce; international cooperation; health status; income; economic development; socioeconomic factors; developed countries; developing countries	INEQUALITY	The last two decades have witnessed the emergence and consolidation of an economic paradigm which emphasizes domestic deregulation and the removal of barriers to international trade and finance. If properly managed, such an approach can lead to perceptible gains in health status. Where markets are non-exclusionary, regulatory institutions strong and safety nets in place, globalization enhances the performance of countries with a good human and physical infrastructure but narrow domestic markets. Health gains in China, Costa Rica, the East Asian "tiger economies" and Viet Nam can be attributed in part to their growing access to global markets, savings and technology. However, for most of the remaining countries, many of them in Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, globalization has not lived up to its promises due to a combination of poor domestic conditions, an unequal distribution of foreign investments and the imposition of new conditions further limiting the access of their exports to the OECD markets. In these developing countries, the last twenty years have brought about a slow, unstable and unequal pattern of growth and stagnation in health indicators. Autarky is not the answer to this situation, but neither is premature, unconditional and unselective globalization, Further unilateral liberalization is unlikely to help them to improve their economic performance and health conditions, For them, a gradual and selective integration into the world economy linked to the removal of asymmetries in global markets and to the creation of democratic institutions of global governance is preferable to instant globalization.

J	Loewenson, R				Loewenson, R			Globalization and occupational health: a perspective from southern Africa	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article						employment; occupational health; occupational diseases/etiology; commerce; public policy; international cooperation; social justice; Africa; southern	DISEASE	Increased world trade has generally benefited industrialized or strong economies and marginalized those that are weak, This paper examines the impact of globalization on employment trends and occupational health, drawing on examples from southern Africa, While the share of world trade to the world's poorest countries has decreased, workers in these countries increasingly find themselves in insecure, poor-quality jobs, sometimes involving technologies which are obsolete or banned in industrialized countries. The occupational illness which results is generally less visible and not adequately recognized as a problem in low-income countries. Those outside the workplace can also be affected through, for example, work-related environmental pollution and poor living conditions. In order to reduce the adverse effects of global trade reforms on occupational health, stronger social protection measures must be built into production and trade activities, including improved recognition, prevention, and management of work-related ill-health, Furthermore, the success of production and trade systems should be judged on how well they satisfy both economic growth and population health.

J	Seis, M				Seis, M			Confronting the contradiction: Global capitalism and environmental health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							OCCUPATIONAL-SAFETY; CRIME	This paper examines the contradiction of economic globalization and environmental health. Despite the emergence of a significant environmental movement, the ecological health of many democratic industrial nation-states remains poor and the overall environmental health of the planet is declining rapidly (Brown 2000). The first section of this paper reviews literature that suggests that the inability of democratic industrial nation-states to reduce environmental degradation results from compromising environmental health in the interests of capital accumulation by regulating rather than eliminating environmentally destructive behaviors. The failure of democratic industrial nation-states to achieve environmental health is being exacerbated further by the creation of a globalized capitalist system managed by a variety of international free-trade agreements and the World Trade Organization. In the second section, we examine decisions made by these new managers of capital over the interests of environmental health. In the last section of this paper, we deconstruct the ideological tenets of global capitalism as they pertain to achieving environmental health and social justice.

This article provides a synopsis of the document and a commentary, concentrating on the issue of equity, which is central to WHO policy, and discussing cultural differences that underpin the notion of equity. The meaning of "equity" implies measurement, and the authors develop an approach to definitions of social strata and data issues that are used to quantify health differences. Finally, they discuss the way in which policies invoking equity are implemented into programs and present a rights-based approach as a case study of one way in which policy is being translated into action.

World Bank loans and their attached policy conditions have promoted several social security reforms within a neoliberal framework that privileges the role of the market in the provision of health and pensions. Moreover, by endorsing the privatization of health services in Latin America, the World Health Organization has converged with these policies. The privatization of social security has benefited international corporations that become partners with local business elites. Thus the World Health Organization, international financial institutions, and transnational corporations have converged in the neoliberal reforms of social security in Latin America. Overall, the process represents a mechanism of resource transfer from labor to capital and sheds light on one of the ways in which neoliberalism may affect the health of Latin American populations.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, psychopathology and level of functioning in a random sample of 312 committed and detained youth (60 females, 252 males) were assessed. Youth diagnostically, classified met criteria for mental disorder using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) combined with a cut-off score (60 or below) on the Child Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), as established by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Findings: Fifty-three percent were classified with diagnosable mental disorders on the DISC, but were above the cut-off scores on the CGAS. Forty-six percent met criteria for diagnosis and low functioning. Twenty-six Percent of youth indicated need for immediate mental health services. Fourteen percent with serious mental disorders and substantial functional impairment were in need of a highly restrictive environment as determined by the severity of their offenses. Conclusions: The number of youth in the Maryland juvenile justice System in need of mental health services indicates a need to examine treatment options that meet the requirements for security, and treatment. The complexity of problems found in this sample indicates the need for collaborative efforts between mental health and juvenile justice personnel in planning for the immediate and future needs of these youth.

Few theories pertain to women's health and illness experiences, with gender issues embedded in social, cultural, and historical contexts. Organizing Construct: Significance, definition, and philosophical bases of gender-sensitive theories. Findings: Six major components should be incorporated in the development of gender-sensitive theories: (a) gender as a major feature, (b) women's own words and experiences, (c) nature Of women's experiences, (d) theorists' perspectives, (e) contexts, and (f) guidelines for actions. Conclusions: We believe that the development of gender-sensitive theories in nursing could enable researchers to transcend androcentric and ethnocentric views on women's health, decrease gender inequity in health care, enhance women's well being, and ultimately contribute to knowledge development in nursing.

The policy prescription of capitation is perceived to address both equity objectives (of great importance in publicly funded systems of health care) and efficiency objectives (the dominant concern in competitive insurance markets). An examination of the current state of the art in 20 countries outside the United States in which health care capitation has been implemented confirms that capitation has assumed central importance within diverse systems of health care. In practice, however, the setting of capitation payments has been heavily constrained to date by poor data availability and unsatisfactory analytic methodology.

J	Dahl, E; Elstad, JI				Dahl, E; Elstad, JI			Recent changes in social structure and health inequalities in Norway	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						health inequalities; Norway; social change	EMPLOYMENT	Aim: The article explores whether changes in social structure from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s have been accompanied by any changes in ill health, both in the general population and in the association between socioeconomic positions and ill health. Data and methods: Data were derived from four interview surveys conducted by Statistics Norway: The Health Surveys from 1985 and 1995 and the Surveys of Level of Living from 1987 and 1995. These surveys provide nationwide representative samples of the adult population. The analyses are confined to the population between 25 and 64 years of age. Simple cross-tabulations, age-standardized cross-tabulations and logistic regression analysis were used. In addition, a more genuine measure of inequality was calculated - the so-called concentration index. Results: In the examined period, the educational level of the population gradually improved, and more people had white collar jobs. On the other hand, the decade was a turbulent one in economic terms, and more people experienced unemployment and early retirement from work during the early 1990s than during the preceding period. Nevertheless, levels of ill health, as measured in terms of self-reported limiting long-standing illness and global self-perceived health, were only marginally altered. Also, health differentials according to socioeconomic positions were only trivially changed during this period. Conclusion: In the mid-1990s, as in the mid-1980s, lower socioeconomic positions, such as unemployment and early retirement, only basic education, and workers' occupations, are generally connected to poorer health. No substantial change in this association is detected in this period.

There is an absence of Australian studies on the effect of social class on the health of this age group. Aims: To examine the association between social class and health among 16-year-old Australians. Methods: The data on 1048 16-year-olds came from the fifth wave (1993) of the Australian Youth Survey conducted by the former Department of Employment, Education and Training. Outcome measures were self-rated general health and psychological health (GHQ-12). Binary logistic regression was used to analyse data. Results: Neither social class of origin nor current social class was associated with self-rated general health or psychological health. Conclusion: The argument that social class inequalities in health exist in childhood, disappear during early youth, and reappear later appears to hold ground within the Australian context.

An analysis of data from the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing	AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Australia; general practitioners; mental health services; psychiatrists; psychologists; sociodemographic factors	HELP-SEEKING; PSYCHIATRIC-TREATMENT; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; PUBLIC ATTITUDE; PATHWAYS; CARE; DETERMINANTS; PERSPECTIVES; REPLICATION; POPULATION	Objective: This study sought to identify sociodemographic and psychological measures associated with utilisation of mental health services in Australia, using information collected through the 1997 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. Method: Twenty-one potential predictor variables were selected from the National Survey. Predisposing and enabling factors included age, sex, marital status, labour force status, geographical location and level of education. Predictor variables measuring need for services included the General Health Questionnaire score, a neuroticism scale, diagnoses of affective, anxiety and substance-abuse disorders from the Composite International Diagnostic interview, and self-identified depression, anxiety and substance abuse. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were undertaken to identify predictor variables associated with use of mental health services from general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists and other health professionals. Results: General practitioners were the most commonly reported providers of mental health services with 76% of those receiving any mental health care reporting using this type of service. Using multiple logistic regression, the predictor variables most associated with use of mental health services were measures of the need for such services, such as psychological distress and mental disorder. After controlling for need variables, the sociodemographic variables associated with using services provided by any health professional were being female, level of education and being separated. Living in a remote area was associated with lower use of specialist services, but not with general practitioner services. Older age was associated with less use of psychologists and other health professionals. income and having a usual language other than English did not affect service use. Conclusions: The factors most strongly related to Australians' use of mental health services are their having a diagnosed affective, anxiety or substance-abuse disorder and their self-identifying as having depression or anxiety. Although there are regional inequalities in levels of utilisation of mental health services, these are seen more with specialist services than with those provided by general practitioners.

J	Cohen, J				Cohen, J			The Global Burden of Disease Study: a useful projection of future global health?	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICINE			English	Article						cost-benefit analysis; disability-adjusted life year; DALY; health planning	EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION; DISABILITY; MORTALITY; UTILITY; POLICY; CARE	One major conclusion of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBDS) is that the global burden of disease will not change significantly from 1990 to 2020, in developed regions, developing regions or as a whole. Using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), the Study estimates the burden as a result of 107 diseases, accidents and their disabling sequelae, disaggregated with respect to cause, sex, age and geographical region. The basic data used to construct estimates are sparse, and the DALY as a tool has received many criticisms. It obscures the distribution of disease and its impact in terms of handicap, and includes several social and economic value judgements. This weakens its power as a guide for the rational allocation of health resources at any point in time. Does it have use in guiding future planning and preventive action? At a global level, exceeding ecological capacity primarily through relative overpopulation is likely to be the greatest threat to overall health, yet overpopulation is not considered as a risk factor in itself. This reflects the understanding of health as an issue of the individual Father than the community. Together with the productivity-orientated weighting of DALYs, the Study appears to be more concerned with cost-effectiveness of health interventions rather then their equity. This underlies the reservations of the World Health Organization regarding the Study's use as a rational tool in health policy.

International research indicates that blue-collar employees typically exhibit lower rates of leisure-time physical activity. While "lack of time" and "work demands" are commonly reported barriers to activity, the extent to which time-at-work mediates the relationship between occupation and leisure-time physical activity is unclear. This study investigated the association between occupation, time spent in paid employment, and participation in leisure-time physical activity. Methods. This was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the 1995 Australian Health Survey, focusing on employed persons ages 18-64 years (n = 24,454), Occupation was coded as per the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations and collapsed into three categories (professional, white-collar, blue-collar). Hours worked was categorized into eight levels, ranging from 1-14 to more than 50 h per week. Participation in leisure-time physical activity was categorized as either insufficient or sufficient for health, consistent with recommended levels of energy expenditure (1600 METS-min/fortnight). The relationship between occupation, hours worked, and leisure-time physical activity was examined using logistic regression. Analyses were conducted separately for male and female, and the results are presented as a series of models that successively adjust for a range of potential covariates: age, living arrangement, smoking status, body mass index, and self-reported health. Results. Individuals in blue-collar occupations were approximately 50% more likely to be classified as insufficiently active. This occupational variability in leisure-time physical activity was not explained by hours worked. There was a suggested relationship between hours worked and leisure-time physical activity; however, this differed between men and women, and was difficult to interpret. Conclusions. Occupational variability in leisure-time physical activity cannot be explained by hours worked. Therefore, reports that work constitutes a barrier to participation should be explored further. Identification of the factors contributing to occupational variability in leisure-time physical activity will add to our understanding of why population subgroups differ in their health risk profiles, and assist in the development of health promotion strategies to reduce rates of sedentariness and health inequalities.

J	Shiffman, J				Shiffman, J			Can poor countries surmount high maternal mortality?	STUDIES IN FAMILY PLANNING			English	Article							INFANT-MORTALITY; RATES; DETERMINANTS; INEQUALITY; CARE	Does poverty bind developing countries to high levels of maternal death in childbirth? Or, as safe-motherhood advocates claim, do public health and social policy interventions have the potential to accelerate maternal mortality transitions? Globally, almost one in 200 live births leads to the death of the mother, making maternal mortality an issue of critical international import. This article presents an analysis of the determinants of national maternal mortality levels with a view to shedding light on these questions. A cross-national regression of 64 countries shows that wealth indicators explain only a portion of the variance in national maternal mortality levels. Other determinants, including women's educational levels and Nle proportion of deliveries attended by trained health personnel, are more clearly associated with national maternal mortality levels than are measures of wealth. The results offer grounds for optimism concerning the potential for global safe-motherhood efforts to induce maternal mortality transitions.

J	Donaldson, L				Donaldson, L			Disease emergence and health transitions in the last millennium	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OF LONDON			English	Article								For most of the first millennium, average expectation of life was only 30 or 40 years. The beginning of the 20th century saw the start of improvements, which by the century's end meant that a baby boy could expect an average 75 years of life, a baby girl even longer. The successes of the 20th century were not products of advances in medicine alone, but consequences of the great sanitary reforms that fuelled the public health movement in late Victorian Britain. However, health challenges also grew and changed: the rise in so-called modern epidemics (coronary heart disease, cancer, accidents and mental illness); the ageing of the population; the containment of the costs of rapid technological advances; the marked and intractable inequalities in health status between rich and poor, and between North and South. The dawn of a new millennium sees many of these health problems carried over from the late 20th century, whilst communicable diseases, once thought conquered, continue to pose a serious threat to human health because of their global significance. This paper traces progress in the health of the population and identifies some of the key challenges for medicine in the 21st century.

Although the Act was welcomed as groundbreaking legislation, delays in implementing it led to increasing frustration. This paper describes an advocacy campaign conducted by the Soul City institute for Health and Development Communication in partnership with the National Network on Violence against Women, to ensure the effective implementation of the DVA. Lessons from the campaign stress the importance of coalition building to draw on diverse strengths, and the use of a combination of advocacy tools, including lobbying media advocacy and social mobilisation to achieve campaign goals. Given the critical role NGOs dealing with victims/survivors of domestic violence and the justice system played in lobbying for change and drafting the new law, their exclusion from the implementation process was ironic. While many advocacy efforts focus on the development of policy and legislation, ongoing efforts are needed to ensure effective implementation, the commitment of adequate resources and monitoring to identify gaps and propose new solutions. Our experience highlights the important role of policy advocates in connecting the multiple streams at play in the policy and legislative arena.

This study reviews the international experience with phasing out leaded gasoline; considerations affecting adoption of unleaded fuel are identified, and difficulties underlying change are synthesized. Factors related to technology, supply availability, distribution channels, economics, and social equity are underlined. International experience is distilled into a set of desirable characteristics of policies for phasing out leaded fuel. Such desirable properties include robustness vis-a-vis enforcement and compliance, the existence of a few "control points", flexibility with respect to future vehicle and fuel technologies, cost-neutrality, and fairness in terms of incidence on socio-economic groups. The case of Lebanon is considered in structuring a practical strategy for phasing out leaded fuel. Positive and negative factors likely to affect the success of lead phaseout strategies in Lebanon are identified. Consideration of these factors along with the desirable attributes of successful policies has led to the development of a recommended plan for leaded fuel phaseout. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The "inverse equity hypothesis" is proposed to explain how such health inequities may get worse, remain the same, or improve over time. We postulate that as new public-health interventions and programmes initially reach those of higher socioeconomic status and only later affect the poor, there are early increases in inequity ratios for coverage, morbidity, and mortality Indicators. Inequities only improve later when the rich have achieved new minimum achievable levels for morbidity and mortality and the poor gain greater access to the interventions. The hypothesis was examined using three epidemiological data sets for time trends in child-health inequities within Brazil. Time trends for inequity ratios for morbidity and mortality, which were consistent with the hypothesis, showed both improvements and deterioration over time, despite the indicators showing absolute improvements in health status between rich and poor.

J	Daly, JA				Daly, JA			Studying the impacts of the Internet without assuming technological determinism	ASLIB PROCEEDINGS			English	Article							CLIMATE	Developing countries generally have low levels of Internet services, and as a result require different approaches to impact measurement than developed countries. A conceptual Framework is proposed which accepts a role for technological innovation, but which rejects technological determinism. It recognizes that economic, social, political and cultural factors affect the penetration and use of the Internet. It emphasizes direct and indirect impacts of the Internet on people, while including impacts on institutions and the environmental factors and policies that affect institutional impacts. Ultimately the Internet is an induced innovation, but developing countries still suffer from the Matthew principle - that those who have most will be given still more. Impacts of the Internet range from communications cost savings, to changes in performance of individual businesses, NGOs, government agencies, and schools, to changes in performance of markets, to those measured in terms of economic growth, equity, health status, knowledge, and environmental quality. The overall view of the impacts of the Internet emerges (as does the picture in a jigsaw puzzle) from combining many studies of specific effects, each conveying a part of the picture. The majority of the people of the world live in low and middle income countries; they have the greatest need of the Internet to help solve the pressing problems of poverty, and they are the least prepared to use the technology and appropriate its benefits. Clearly great benefits are available to developing countries from appropriate uses of even their scarce Internet networks. Many of the institutions affected by the Internet are international. Internet impacts on these international institutions must be confronted. Thus developing countries may face significant risks from participation in international financial, labor and goods and services markets, because of significant gaps in connectivity and in knowledge and information. On the other hand, they may benefit greatly from power uses of the Internet abroad, of which Africans are scarcely aware, such as famine early warning and epidemiological alert systems. Donor agencies encourage the development of the Internet in developing countries, and especially in Africa. Several have agreed to work collaboratively to learn the lessons from their experience. Such efforts are important if the potential of the Internet is to be realized in developing countries, the risks inherent in the Internet are to be avoided or ameliorated, and the net effect to be enhanced equity and social and economic growth.

It does not only extend previous work by using more recent data from a larger set of countries, but also uses new methods and presents disaggregated results by various types of care. In all countries, the lower-income groups are more intensive users of the health care system. But after indirect standardization for need differences, there is little or no evidence of significant inequity in the delivery of health care overall, though in half of the countries, significant pro-rich inequity emerges for physician contacts. This seems to be due mainly to a higher use of medical specialist services by higher-income groups and a higher use of GP care among lower-income groups. These findings appear to be fairly general and emerge in countries with very diverse characteristics regarding access and provider incentives. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, these improvements have not been shared equally and health in equalities within and among countries are entrenched. The fragility of health gains has been seen in response to economic, political, and social changes changes, and civil disruption. The limitations of health-status measure hinder our ability to map health trends except in the simplest way. There is an urgent need for better regional and national health surveillance systems to underpin efforts to address the complex mixture of old and new health concerns.

J	McMichael, AJ; Beaglehole, R				McMichael, AJ; Beaglehole, R			The changing global context of public health	LANCET			English	Article							EPIDEMIOLOGY; GLOBALIZATION; MORTALITY; DISEASE	Future health prospects depend increasingly on globalisation processes and on the impact of global environmental change. Economic globalisation-entailing deregulated trade and investment-is a mixed blessing for health. Economic growth and the dissemination of technologies have widely enhanced life expectancy. However, aspects of globalisation are jeopardising health by eroding social and environmental conditions, exacerbating the rich-poor gap, and disseminating consumerism. Global environmental changes reflect the growth of populations and the intensity of economic activity. These changes include altered composition of the atmosphere, land degradation, depletion of terrestrial aquifers and ocean fisheries, and loss of biodiversity. This weakening of life-supporting systems poses health risks. Contemporary public health must therefore encompass the interrelated tasks of reducing social and health inequalities and achieving health-sustaining environments.

This study assessed the consistency and magnitude of the association between educational level and relative body weight in populations with widely different prevalences of over-weight and investigated possible changes in the association over 10 years. Methods. Differences in age-adjusted mean body mass index (BMI) between the highest and the lowest tertiles of years of schooling were calculated for 26 populations in the initial and final surveys of the World Health Organization (WHO) MONICA. (Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) Project. The data are derived from random population samples, including more than 42 000 men and women aged 35 to 64 years in the initial survey (1979-1989) and almost 35 000 in the final survey(1989-1996). Results. For women, almost all populations showed a statistically significant inverse association between educational level and BMI; the difference between the highest and the lowest educational tertiles ranged from -3.3 to 0.4 kg/m(2). For men, the difference ranged from -1.5 to 2.2 kg/m(2). In about two thirds of the populations, the differences in BMI between the educational levels increased over the IO-year period. Conclusion. Lower education was associated with higher BMI in about half of the male and in almost all of the female populations, and the differences in relative body weight between educational levels increased over the study period. Thus, socioeconomic inequality in hearth consequences of obesity may increase in many countries.

Data and methods: Data on self-reported height of men and women aged 20-74 years were obtained from national health, level of living or multipurpose surveys for 1987-1994. Regression analyses were used to estimate height differences between educational groups and to evaluate whether the differences in average height between countries and between educational groups were smaller among younger than among older birth cohorts. Results: Men and women were on average tallest in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands and shortest in France, Italy and Spain (range for men: 170-179 cm; range for women: 160-167 cm). The differences in average height between northern and southern European countries were not smaller among younger than among older birth cohorts. In most countries average height increased linearly with increasing birth-year (approximate to 0.7-0.8 cm/5 years for men and approximate to 0.4 cm/5 years for women). In all countries, lower educated men and women on average were shorter than higher educated men (range of differences: 1.6-3.0 cm) and women (range of differences: 1.2-2.2 cm). In most countries, education-related height differences were not smaller among younger than among older birth cohorts. Conclusions: The persistence of international differences in average height into the youngest birth cohorts indicates a high degree of continuity of differences between countries in childhood living conditions. Similarly, the persistence of education-related height differences indicates continuity of socio-economic differences in childhood living conditions, and also suggests that socio-economic differences in childhood living conditions will continue to contribute to socio-economic differences in health at adult ages.

We have made a comparative analysis of these inequalities in the United States and ii western European countries. The aims of the analysis were (1) to compare the size of inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality between countries, and (2) to explore the possible contribution of cardiovascular risk factors to the explanation of between-country differences in inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality. Data and Methods Data on ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and total cardiovascular disease mortality by occupational class and/or educational level were obtained from national longitudinal or unlinked cross-sectional studies. Data on smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and infrequent consumption of fresh vegetables by occupational class and/or educational level were obtained from national health interview or multipurpose surveys and from the European Union's Eurobarometer survey. Age-adjusted rate ratios for mortality were correlated with age-adjusted odds ratios for the behavioural risk factors. Results In all countries mortality from cardiovascular diseases is higher among persons with lower occupational class or lower educational level. Within western Europe, a north-south gradient is apparent, with relative and absolute inequalities being larger in the north than in the south. For ischaemic heart disease, but not for cerebrovascular disease, an even more striking north-south gradient is seen, with some 'reverse' inequalities in southern Europe. The United States occupy intermediate positions on most indicators. Inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality are associated with inequalities in some risk factors, especially cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Conclusions Socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular disease mortality are a major public health problem in most industrialized countries. Closing the gap between low and high socioeconomic groups offers great potential for reducing cardiovascular disease mortality. Developing effective methods of behavioural risk factor reduction in the lower socioeconomic groups should be a top priority in cardiovascular disease prevention.

J	Maijala, K				Maijala, K			Cow milk and human development and well-being	LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						animal fat; animal protein; cholesterol; diet; health; heredity; interactions, milk, mortality, optimum, versatility	CORONARY HEART-DISEASE; MIDDLE-AGED MEN; DIETARY-CHOLESTEROL; PLASMA-CHOLESTEROL; SERUM-CHOLESTEROL; FATTY-ACIDS; ANTICARCINOGENIC AGENTS; PRIMARY PREVENTION; BLOOD CHOLESTEROL; LINOLEIC-ACID	Fifty years ago animal foods were considered complete foods and important for human health. In most developed countries substantial dairy cattle and milk production industries existed which made major contributions to human welfare including the provision of cow milk to infants and young children. Then, over the last forty years, hypotheses have been developed largely by the medical profession and associated fields of research on the unfavourable roles of dietary cholesterol (DC), animal fats and serum cholesterol (SC) in coronary heart diseases (CHD). These postulates resulted in new and strange equalities such as DC + animal fat = SC = CHD. These hypotheses were followed by simplistic dietary recommendations with warnings against animal fats. These warnings have been heeded by the medical profession in many developed countries and under medical authority large sections of the public have made dietary changes and the per capita consumption of milk has fallen. More recently other risk factors have been found for CHD, and knowledge of their relative importance has increased. Understanding has grown over the question of versatility, optima and interactions between nutrients. Other new factors in this field include: the minor effect of DC on SC, the U-shaped effect of SC on total mortality in men with no effect in women less than 50 years of age, positive effects of other milk constituents on SC, different effects of high density C (HDL-C) and low density C (LDL-C) and of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (SFA, MUFA, PUFA) on CHD risk, the harmful effects of trans-FA, the meaninglessness of the P/S ratio, the medical and non-medical side effects of lowering SC and the high heritability of SC. These new recoveries have not been given the publicity accorded to the original hypotheses. It is the aim of this paper to seek a balanced review of the subject in the light of new scientific evidence. Further the broader implications of the topic for society, human development and well-being are also considered. Thus there are two main theses in this paper. One is to review the hypotheses of the relationship between cow milk and human coronary heart disease. These hypotheses are examined and their original historic deficiencies are discussed. This is followed by the new and emerging scientific evidence to support, question or refute these original hypotheses. The second major thesis in this paper deals with the impact which these hypotheses have had upon the pattern of human nutrition which are reflected in many important economic, social and other nutritional issues, all of which merit attention. It is considered inadequate to base general recommendations in the field of human health and well-being solely or mainly upon postulations about the relationship between milk and CHD without taking into account the larger and more complex issues. In addition to the general field of human health, the consequences of these hypotheses include the responses of the dairy production and processing industries. For example, if the hypotheses are reliable, tested and to become basic components of human nutrition, then the milk production industry has to reshape its system to produce a product more suited to the changes in consumption. If however, the assumptions are not substantiated permanently the such a re-tooling of milk production is futile. Milk production represents a major component in global food production and the implications of change are enormous. Issues to be considered include the efficiency of dairy cow in converting plant material, inedible to humans, to a human food of high nutritional value, the economic and nutritional contribution of dairy cattle production systems to beef production, the strong genetic correlations between the fat content, the protein content and the yield of milk per cow, the slowness of achieving changes in milk composition in bovine species with low reproductive rates and long generation intervals, and interactions between nutrients. Further, there are other broader issues including the incidence of other human conditions and diseases besides CHD, which can be affected by the presence or absence of milk in the diet, the genetic differences between individuals and human races, the need to address the hunger of the world's human population and further economic, social and psychological factors. Many questions need research to find sustainable breeding goals and milk production systems which are related to the reality of how milk contributes to human development and welfare. The paper concludes by considering the negative impact which the questionable hypotheses have had upon an important component of food production, namely dairy cattle farming which historically has contributed enormously to human development and welfare. The author considers there is a vacuum of knowledge here which cannot be filled simply by expertise in the medical field alone. The issue is a prime candidate for interdisciplinary research.

Overview of structural-factors literature: Most of the research on structural and environmental factors can be grouped into a small number of analytically distinct but interconnected categories: economic (under)development and poverty; mobility, including migration, seasonal work, and social disruption due to war and political instability; and gender inequalities. An additional focus in research on structural and environmental factors has been on the effects of particular governmental and intergovernmental policies in increasing or diminishing HIV vulnerability and transmission. Interventions: A smaller subset of the research on structural factors describes and/or evaluates specific interventions in detail. Approaches that have received significant attention include targeted interventions developed for heterosexual women, female commercial sex workers, male truck drivers, and men who have sex with men. Conclusions: The structural and environmental factors literature offers important insights and reveals a number of productive intervention strategies that might be explored in both resource-rich and -poor settings. However, new methodologies are required to document and evaluate the effects of the structural interventions, which by their very nature involve large-scale elements that cannot be easily controlled by experimental or quasi-experimental research designs. Innovative, interdisciplinary approaches are needed that can move beyond the limited successes of traditional behavioral interventions and explicitly attempt to achieve broader social and structural change.

There is a need to focus these scarce resources on research that will optimize health benefits and lead to equity. This paper reviews processes and methods that have been used for setting research priorities. Past and current processes have focused on expert-driven research agenda, emphasizing scientific autonomy and global analyses. Methods for setting priorities have focused on the metrics of disease burdens, while less attention has been placed on who sets' priorities and how choices are made. The paper proposes a strategy of priority setting, based on lessons learned from essential national health research (ENHR) approaches attempted in several developing countries. With equity in health and develop ment as its goal, the proposed model is demand-driven, and involves multi-dimensional inputs and multiple stakeholders. Various steps of the process are discussed: getting participants involved; gathering evidence and information; determining criteria for priority setting; and implementation and evaluation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the gap between national research priorities and the research agenda set at regional and global levels, an issue that needs to be satisfactorily addressed in the future.

J	Avi-Yonah, RS				Avi-Yonah, RS			Globalization, tax competition, and the fiscal crisis of the welfare state	HARVARD LAW REVIEW			English	Review							INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY; UNFAIR-COMPETITION; HORIZONTAL EQUITY; INCOME TAXATION; LEVIATHAN; HARMONIZATION; INSTRUMENTS; CONSTRAINTS	This Article examines the increased use of tax incentives as weapons in the international competition to attract investment. Professor Avi-Yonah argues that the establishment of tax havens allows large amounts of capital to go untaxed, depriving both developed and developing countries of revenue and forcing them to rely on forms of taxation less progressive than the income tax. He points to social insurance programs, many of which are already on uncertain courses as aging populations imperil their fiscal health, as likely to bear the brunt of the revenue loss that tar: havens cause. Professor Avi-Yonah contends that both economic efficiency and equity among individuals and among nations support limits on international tar competition, and he presents a proposal that accommodates the competing concern for democratic states' ability to set their tax rates independently. He proposes the coordinated imposition of withholding taxes on international portfolio investment, with the goal of ensuring that all income may be taxed in the investor's home jurisdiction. Professor Avi-Yonah also proposes that multinational corporations be taxed initially in the jurisdictions where their goods and services are consumed. Under the framework this Article outlines, both developed and developing nations would be able to preserve the progressivity of the income tar and to broaden and stabilize their tax bads in time to stave off the fiscal threat to the welfare state.

Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more likely to engage in health-damaging behaviours, experience poorer psychosocial health, make less use of the healthcare system for preventive purposes. and have a more adverse risk factor profile. These are the main contributing factors to the poorer physiological health of low socioeconomic groups. At present, our knowledge of how socioeconomic status and health are related is limited, a necessary step in improving our understanding of this issue is to draw together all the empirical evidence and use it as the basis for developing a theory of socioeconomic health inequalities. We present a conceptual framework to facilitate this process.

Subjects Men and women aged 20 to 44 years and 45 to 74 years. Setting 12 European countries, around 1990. Main outcome measures Relative differences (odds ratios) and absolute differences in the prevalence of ever smoking and current smoking for men and women in each age group by educational level. Results In the 45 to 74 year age group, higher rates of current and ever smoking among lower educated subjects were found in some countries only. Among women this was found in Great Britain, Norway, and Sweden, whereas an opposite pattern, with higher educated women smoking more, was found in southern Europe. Among men a similar north-south pattern was found but it was less noticeable than among women. In the 20 to 44 year age group, educational differences in smoking were generally greater than in the older age group, and smoking rates were higher among lower educated people in most countries. Among younger women, a similar north-south pattern was found as among older women. Among younger men, large educational differences in smoking were found for northern European as well as for southern European countries, except for Portugal. Conclusions These international variations in social gradients in smoking, which are likely to be related to differences between countries in their stage of the smoking epidemic, may have contributed to the socioeconomic differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease being greater in northern European countries. The observed age patterns suggest that socioeconomic differences in diseases related to smoking will increase in the coming decades hi many European countries.

J	Lee, MR				Lee, MR			Modernization, gender equality, and mortality rates in less developed countries	SOCIOLOGICAL SPECTRUM			English	Article							DETERMINANTS; INFANT; HEALTH	Although greater accessibility to health care and increasing levels of education among residents of less developed countries have clearly contributed to mortality decline, few theoretical models to date have adequately explained the relationship. A comprehensive model of mortality decline should document both the factors that directly drive down mortality rates and the underlying structural dynamics that give rise to such direct effects. The present article draws on fundamental diffusion concepts and a psychosociological model of modernization that attempts to explain how less developed countries increase their availability of health care services and reduce gender inequality. Two diffusion mechanisms are argued to be operating: the transfer of raw material goods and technology through the international capitalist exchange system and the transfer of modern values, ideas, practices, and knowledge through the mass media. The model was tested with data on four measures of mortality for a sample of 43 less developed countries circa 1993. Partial support is found for the model, and suggestions for future research are made.

J	Reich, MR				Reich, MR			The global drug cap	SCIENCE			English	Article							COMMUNITY; HEALTH	Global inequities in access to pharmaceutical products exist between rich and poor countries because of market and government failures as well as huge income differences. Multiple policies are required to address this global drug gap for three categories of pharmaceutical products: essential drugs, new drugs, and yet-to-be-developed drugs. Policies should combine "push" approaches of financial subsidies to support targeted drug development, "pull" approaches of financial incentives such as market guarantees, and "process" approaches aimed at improved institutional-capacity. Constructive solutions are needed that can both protect the incentives for research and development and reduce the inequities of access.

The full range of potential human health impacts of global climate change is diverse and would be distributed differentially spatially and over time. Changes in the mortality toll of heatwaves and changes in the distribution of vector-borne infectious diseases may occur early. The public health consequences of sea level rise and of regional changes in agricultural productivity may not occur (or become apparent) for several decades. Vulnerability is a measure of both sensitivity to climate change and the ability to adapt in anticipation of, or in response to, its impacts. The basic modes of adaptation to climate-induced health hazards are biological, behavioural and social. Adaptation can be undertaken at the individual, community and whole-population levels. Adaptive strategies should not introduce new health hazards. Enhancement of the acknowledged public health infrastructure and intervention programmes is essential to reduce vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change. In the longer-term, fundamental improvements in the social and material conditions of life and in the reduction of inequalities within and between populations are required for sustained reduction in vulnerability to environmental health hazards.

J	Magadza, CHD				Magadza, CHD			Climate change impacts and human settlements in Africa: Prospects for adaptation	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						human settlements; climate change; adaptation; Africa		Climate change impacts on African human settlements arise from a number of climate change-related causes, notably sea level changes, impacts on water resources, extreme weather events, food security, increased health risks from vector borne diseases, and temperature-related morbidity in urban environments. Some coastlines and river deltas of Africa have densely populated low-lying areas, which would be affected by a rise in sea level. Other coastal settlements will be subjected to increased coastal erosion. Recent flooding in East Africa highlighted the vulnerability of flood plain settlements and the need to develop adaptive strategies for extreme weather events management and mitigation. In the semi arid and arid zones many settlements are associated with inland drainage water sources. Increases in drought will enhance water supply related vulnerabilities. Inter-basin and international water transfers raise the need for adequate legal frameworks that ensure equity among participating nations. Similarly, water supply and irrigation reservoirs in seasonal river catchments might fail, leading to poor sanitation in urban areas as well as food shortage. Hydroelectric power generation could be restricted in drought periods, and where it is a major contributor to the energy budget, reduced power generation could lead to a multiplicity of other impacts. States are advised to develop other sources of renewable energy. Temperature changes will lead to altered distribution of disease vectors such as mosquitoes, making settlements currently free of vector borne diseases vulnerable. Rapid breeding of the housefly could create a menace associated with enteric disorders, especially in conditions of poor sanitation. The dry savannahs of Africa are projected as possible future food deficit areas. Recurrent crop failures would lead to transmigration into urban areas. Pastoralists are likely to undertake more trans-boundary migrations and probably come into conflict with settled communities. Adaptive measures will involve methods of coastal defences (where applicable), a critical review of the energy sector, both regionally and nationally, a rigorous adherence to city hygiene procedures, an informed agricultural industry that is capable of adapting to changing climate in terms of cropping strategies, and innovations in environment design to maximise human comfort at minimum energy expenditure. In the savannah and arid areas water resource management systems will be needed to optimise water resource use and interstate co-operation where such resources are shared. Climate change issues discussed here raise the need for state support for more research and education in impacts of climate change on human settlements in Africa.

Design: Cross-sectional analysis of a random survey of adults in 1998. Subjects: 5059 adults ages 18 and over in five English-speaking countries: Australia, Britain; Canada, New Zealand and the United States (approximate to 1000 per country) Main outcome measures: Failure to receive needed carl, difficulty getting care, waiting time for elective surgery, problems paying medical bills, failure to fill prescriptions due to cost, perceived qualify of medical care received and of most recent doctor visit. Results: There were two to three-fold differences between those with above and below average incomes on measures of access to care in the US, Australia and New Zealand. In Britain and Canada indicators of access to cars were similar for the two income groups. Problems paying medical bills were most prevalent in the US. yet significant differences by income also existed in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Those with below average incomes were more likely to have not filled a prescription due to cost in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US, with gaps by income most severe in the US. Ratings of quality of doctor visit were significantly different for the two income groups in the US, but not other countries. Conclusions: The analysis finds striking differences among countries in the relative equity of health care experiences. In general, care experiences are more unequal in three countries such as the US, Australia and New Zealand where systems have relatively greater reliance on private health insurance and markets. Greater inequality ill care experiences is also associated with more divided public opinion regarding the need for system reform and the direction of recent policy changes. In Canada and Britain where care experiences are more equal, views of the health system are similar across income groups. Reliance on private insurance and patient user fees appears to lead to more divided views of the overall health system as well as inequity in access to care. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Health Economics 3, 281-291) to measure the degree of income-related inequality in self-reported health in Canada by means of concentration indices. It finds that significant inequalities in self-reported ill-health exist and favour the higher income groups - the higher the level of income, the better the level of self-assessed health. The analysis also indicates that lower income individuals are somewhat more likely to report their self-assessed health as poor or less-than-good than higher income groups, at the same level of a more 'objective' health indictor such as the McMaster Health Utility Index. The degree of inequality in 'subjective' health is slightly higher than in 'objective' health, but not significantly different. The degree of inequality in self-assessed health in Canada was found to be significantly higher than that reported by van Doorslaer et al. (1997, income related inequalities in health: some international comparisons, Journal of Health Economics 16, 93-112) for seven European countries, but not significantly different from the health inequality measured for the UK or the US. It also appears as if Canada's health inequality is higher than what would be expected on the basis of its income inequality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the 20th century, patterns of immigration and migration, changes in the global economy, increases in income inequality, and more federal support for suburbanization have made it increasingly difficult for cities to protect the health of all residents. In the last 25 years, epidemics of human immunodeficiency virus infections and substance abuse and increases in homelessness, lack of health insurance, rates of violence, and concentrations of certain pollutants have also damaged the health of urban residents. Several common strategies for health promotion are described, and their relevance to the unique characteristics of urban populations is assessed. To identify ways to strengthen health promotion practices in U.S. cities, lessons have been taken from five related fields of endeavor: human rights, church- and faith-based social action, community economic development, youth development, and the new social movements. By integrating lessons from these areas into their practice, public health professionals can help to revitalize the historic mission of public health, contribute to creating healthier cities, and better achieve national health objectives.

One reason for the surge in theoretical and applied interest in the disorder is the development and widespread adoption of reliable and valid methods for its measurement. The Hare PCL-R provides researchers and clinicians with a common metric for the assessment of psychopathy, and has led to a surge in replicable and meaningful findings relevant to the issue of risk for recidivism and violence, among other things. Most of the research thus far has been based on North American samples of offenders and forensic psychiatric patients. We summarize this research and compare it with findings from several other countries, including England and Sweden. We conclude that the ability of the PCL-R to predict recidivism, violence, and treatment outcome has considerable cross-cultural generalizability, and that the PCL-R and its derivatives play a major role in the understanding and prediction of crime and violence.

In these countries the disintegration of health systems and difficulties of access are major obstacles to the immunization and surveillance strategies necessary for polio eradication. In such circumstances, eradication requires special endeavours, such as the negotiation of ceasefires and truces and the winning of increased direct involvement by communities. Transmission of poliovirus was interrupted during conflicts in Cambodia, Colombia, El Salvador, Peru, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. Efforts to achieve eradication in areas of conflict have led to extra health benefits: equity in access to immunization, brought about because every child has to be reached; the revitalization and strengthening of routine immunization services through additional externally provided resources; and the establishment of disease surveillance systems. The goal of patio eradication by the end of 2000 remains attainable if supplementary immunization and surveillance can be accelerated in countries affected by conflict.

There is an almost universal problem of affordability in the health systems of these countries, arising from the tension between the willingness of populations to pay taxes and the eagerness of patients to use health services where these are free or heavily subsidized at the point of use. These tensions are likely to be exacerbated by a surge of new medical technologies adding to demands for health care. Some observers have predicted the breakdown of publicly funded systems of health care under new spending pressures. However, governments can deploy a range of policies for handling new demands. They can also lake comfort from the fact that many of them have already coped with successive waves of technological change in health care without abandoning their core commitment to the public funding of health systems. Furthermore, if standards of living continue to rise, public and private insurers should find it easier to obtain the revenues needed to pay for the improved health care expected by consumers.

We intend to make statistical information available for national level comparisons. National level data were collected from numerous international databases, and supplemented by national household surveys and World Bank expenditure reviews. The results were tabulated and analysed in an exploratory fashion to provide benchmarks for groupings of African countries and individual country comparison. There is wide variation in scale and outcome of health care spending between African countries, with poorer countries lending to do worse than wealthier ones. From 1990-96, the median annual per capita government expenditure on health was nearly US$ 6, but averaged US$ 3 in the lowest-income countries, compared to US$ 72 in middle-income countries. Similar trends were found for health services and outcomes. Results from individual countries (particularly Ethiopia, Ghana, Cote d'lvoire and Gabon) are used to indicate how the data can be used to identify areas of improvement in health system performance. Serious gaps in data, particularly concerning private sector delivery and financing, health service utilization, equity and efficiency measures, hinder more effective health management. Nonetheless, the data are useful for providing benchmarks for performance and for crudely identifying problem areas in health systems for individual countries.

This paper reviews the issues and challenges in the design and application of summary measures and presents a framework for evaluating different alternatives. Summary measures have a variety of uses, including comparisons of health in different populations and assessments of the relative contributions of different diseases, injuries and risk factors to the total disease burden in a population. Summary measures may be divided into two broad families. health expectancies and health gaps. Within each family, there are many different possible measures, but they share a number of inputs, including information on mortality, non-fatal health outcomes, and health state valuations. Other critical points include calculation methods and a range of conceptual and methodological issues regarding the definition, measurement and valuation of health slates. This paper considers a set of basic criteria and desirable properties that may lead to rejection of certain summary measures and the development of new ones. Despite the extensive developmental agenda that remains, applications of summary measures cannot await the final resolution of all methodological issues, so they should focus on those measures that satisfy as many basic criteria and desirable properties as possible.

Cities have multiplied and expanded rapidly worldwide over the past two centuries. Cities are sources of creativity and technology, and they are the engines for economic growth. However, they are also sources of poverty, inequality, and health hazards from the environment. Urban populations have long been incubators and gateways for infectious diseases. The early industrializing period of unplanned growth and laissez-faire economic activity in cities in industrialized countries has been superseded by the rise of collective management of the urban environment. This occurred in response to environmental blight, increasing literacy, the development of democratic government, and the collective accrual of wealth. In many low-income countries, this process is being slowed by the pressures and priorities of economic globalization. Beyond the traditional risks of diarrhoeal disease and respiratory infections in the urban poor and the adaptation of various vector-borne infections to urbanization, the urban environment poses various physicochemical hazards. These include exposure to lead, air pollution, traffic hazards, and the "urban hear, island" amplification of heatwaves. As the number of urban consumers and their material expectations rise and as the use of fossil fuels increases, cities contribute to the large-scale pressures on the biosphere including climate change. We must develop policies that ameliorate the existing, and usually unequally distributed, urban environmental health hazards and larger-scale environmental problems.

J	Weil, TP				Weil, TP			How to enhance the efficacy of health network growth	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						health networks; economics of regulation; strategic health planning; corporate divestitures; managed care; public health regulation	UNITED-STATES; CARE; MERGERS	In almost every American metropolitan area, health executives are busily enhancing the efficacy of their health networks by corporately restructuring so that their organization can become a fiscally and politically powerful oligopoly or a regulated monopoly. When the formation of these alliances are initially announced by the local media, they are reported to be vehicles to enhance access, social equity and quality of care, and to reduce costs. Since an increasing number of these health networks are currently experiencing fiscal, cultural and other difficulties, it is critical to study: (a) what factors should be considered when developing an effective and efficient health network?; (b) what are the practical issues in their strategic formation and management so they eventually achieve their full potential?; and (c) why will some divestitures among these health networks occur and how will these corporate 'spin offs' impact on consumers, providers, insurers and governmental agencies? Within the next decade the United States will face some inevitable economic difficulties. At that time, enhancing access and reducing costs will become more critical issues for health networks. These alliances may then need to become more responsive to consumer pressures as the Americans shift their political proclivities from the current quasi-competitive to a more quasi-regulatory position. In this context, the use of global budgetary targets is discussed as a possible option in the United States to constrain costs, an approach used in almost all other western industrialized nations.

J	Franco, S				Franco, S			International dimensions of Colombian violence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							GUN OWNERSHIP; HOME	Violence is the main public health problem in Colombia, as demonstrated by current homicide rates (the highest in the world), the strong effect of violence on the health care sector, and the forceful displacement of citizens, among other factors. This violence has international dimensions and consequences: inequity resulting from the political-economic system and increased by the neoliberal adjustments; the international traffic of drugs and weapons; exile and forceful: displacement of persons into bordering countries; and frequent violations of human rights and humanitarian international rights. The international community can play a role in the search for a solution to this problem, as the author discusses in terms of contributions made in the past and those that could be made in the near future. Colombian violence can be viewed as a problem, a message, and a challenge for international public health, and the author suggests specific areas in which international public health could contribute to the study and solution of this complex situation.

The purpose of this review was threefold: (I) to synthesize data on the distribution of women's work efforts in the areas of paid employment, household chores, and childcare; (2) to outline research which addresses the impact of women's workload on their well-being and careers; and (3) to make international and gender comparisons regarding women's work responsibilities. Our findings showed that women from each of the three countries examined-the United States, Sweden, and The Netherlands-contribute more effort to household chores and childcare and less to the workplace than men do. As a result, their total workloads appear to be somewhat greater and more diffusely distributed than those of men. Heavy workloads may adversely affect women's health, especially in the presence of certain role characteristics (e.g., having a clerical, managerial, professional, or executive position, or caring for young children). Heavy work responsibilities may also undermine marital happiness, particularly if there is perceived inequity in the way partners share household work. Finally, women's total work responsibilities often impact their careers due to compensatory reductions in work commitment and job status. These observations point to the need for further research on women's workload and work roles, on the relationship of work to well-being, and on methods of preventing or alleviating adverse effects on overburdened workers.

This study compared differences in total and cause-specific mortality by educational level among women with those among men in 7 countries: the United States, Finland, Norway, Italy, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Estonia. Methods. National data were obtained for the period ca. 1980 to ca. 1990. Age-adjusted rate ratios comparing a broad lower-educational group with a broad upper-educational group were calculated with Poisson regression analysis. Results. Total mortality rate ratios among women ranged from 1.09 in the Czech Republic to 1.31 in the United States and Estonia. Higher mortality rates among lower-educated women were found for most causes of death, but not for neoplasms. Relative inequalities in total mortality tended to be smaller among women than among men. In the United States and Western Europe. but not in Central and Eastern Europe, this sex difference was largely due to differences between women and men in cause-of-death pattern. For specific causes of death, inequalities are usually larger among men. Conclusions. Further study of the interaction between socioeconomic factors, sex, and mortality may provide important clues to the explanation of inequalities in health.

J	Milliez, J				Milliez, J			Economics and justice: the ethical aspects of inequity or inequality in health care	BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH IN CLINICAL OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY			English	Article						health care; accessibility; inequality	MATERNAL MORTALITY; GLOBAL BURDEN; OBSTETRICS; GYNECOLOGY; INFECTION; DISEASE; WORLD; BIRTH	Inequality in access to health care exists under a variety of aspects in different parts of the world. In the USA, the absence of universal health insurance leaves 15% of the population, including 12 million children, unprotected. Managed care and health maintenance organisations (HMOs) tend to further deepen this inequality. In Europe, where state-regulated Social Security covers most of the population, welfare policies affect income-related inequalities leaving others untouched, namely inequalities related to family history, education and occupation. In developing countries, poverty is the main cause of inaccessibility to health care and both internal structural reforms and international support could contribute to alleviating such an appalling injustice.

Methods: A cross-sectional study using a representative stratified sample of the non-institutionalized population resident in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 was performed. Included were 1,667 women over 29 years of age. The variables studied were periodic gynaecological check-up, periodic smear and periodic mammography, as well as age, marital status, educational level, job situation and social class. Multivariate analysis was performed in order to determine predictive factors of gynaecological preventive practices, through logistic regression models. Results: Unmarried women had a higher risk of not having a periodic cervical smear [odds ratio (OR) adjusted for age, marital status, education level and job situation = 2.53 with 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.66-3.86] or periodic mammography (OR=2.84 and 95% CI: 1.77-4.54), Women with a lower educational level followed preventive practices less often. Women who were unemployed, retired or students had a higher risk of not having periodic smears (OR=2.14 and 95% CI: 1.45-3.18) and of not having periodic mammography (OR=1.69 and 95% CI: 1.12-2.55), Conclusions: Opportunistic screening is more susceptible to social inequalities than systematic screening programmes. The risk of not performing these practices increased with women's low social indicators (class and education) and age. This study has a significative relevance in the international context because it shows a population-based analysis that is very scarce in southern Europe and could be used for comparisons in future studies of inequalities in health.

SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						DALY; gender and health; Global Burden of Disease; health priority; women's health	MORTALITY	Addressing women's health goes beyond merely producing gender-disaggregated data. A women's perspective on health issues involves an analysis based on knowledge of broader gender differences than those that can be attributed to biology alone. Women and men live different lives. It is therefore important to evaluate whether women's health issues are disfavoured by known health burden estimators in general use. The Global Burden of Disease and Disability Adjusted Life Years framework was presented to the public health community by the World Bank in 1993. The data presented are applied for the year 1990. The estimators have been criticized for not being able to address social inequity within populations, and for failure to predict how serious the HIV/AIDS epidemic would be. Some of the critical voices have also centred around how the methodology will affect the way women's health priorities are incorporated; however, the debate is still in its infancy. This paper examines this new concept of measuring health burdens from a women's health perspective.

The WTO's aim is to extend the free market in the provision of traditional public services. Governments in Europe and the US link the expansion of trade in public services to economic success, and with the backing of powerful medico-pharmaceutical, insurance, and service corporations, the race is on to capture the share of gross domestic product that governments currently spend on public services. They will open domestic European services and domestic markets to global competition by government procurement agreements, dispute-settlement procedures, and the investment rules of global financial institutions. The UK has already set up the necessary mechanisms: the introduction of private-sector accounting rules to public services; the funding of public-sector Investment via private-public partnerships or the private finance initiative; and the change to capitation funding streams, which allows the substitution of private for public funds and services. We explain the implications of these changes for European public-health-care systems and the threat they pose to universal coverage, solidarity through risk-pooling, equity, comprehensive care, and democratic accountability.

During the study years, in 1998 dollars, the cast of job-based insurance increased 2.6-fold, and employees' contributions for coverage increased 3.5-fold. The percentage of nonelderly Americans covered by job-based insurance plummeted from 71 percent to 64 percent. This decline occurred exclusively among non-college-educated Americans. An information-based global economy is likely to produce not only greater future wealth but also greater inequalities in income and health benefits.

J	Sikora, K				Sikora, K			Practice guidelines: A global view	ONCOLOGY-NEW YORK			English	Article							CANCER	The incidence of cancer is rising dramatically throughout the world. This is especially true in, the developing countries. The trend is due to rapidly aging populations, a decline in mortality from infectious disease, and increasing globalization and urbanization leading to unhealthy life-styles. The public fears cancer more than any other disease. Politicians and policy makers are interested in developing highly visible strategies to reduce the burden of cancer and improve its care. Guidelines are an essential component of a national cancer program. They are vital for setting quality standards and for ensuring equity for all components of the cancer plan. Evidence-based guidelines, agreed upon in advance by all those involved in cancer service delivery, can be applied to education, prevention, detection, referral networks, treatment, and palliative care. They must be adapted to ileal with the wide economic spectrum as well as the varied financial mechanisms for health-care funding and the differing epidemiologic patterns of cancer. Clear tailoring to local expertise, facilities, and geography is essential. The widespread adoption of such guidelines would be the most effective method to significantly reduce global cancer morbidity and mortality over a short time period.

Approximately 85% of all 1103 women enrolled in the comparative trial completed their initial and final questionnaires, To better assess the comparison of a new and extant method of contraception, outcome data were divided among MPA/E2C users and new and previous oral contraceptive (OC) users. Despite the inherent inequalities' in comparing an injectable to an oral method of contraception, Jew treatment assessment and satisfaction outcomes were significantly different hen comparing MPA/E2C users to new OC (NET/EE) users. More women in the MPA/E2C study group reported discomfort with their method than women in either NET/EE study group; however, only 19.4% of MPA/E2C users rated the administration of their contraceptive to be moderately uncomfortable or worse, compared to 12.7% of new NET/EE users and 13.4% of previous OC users. Among MPA/E2C users, 86.3% reported no interference with social activities compared with 90.4% of new NET/EE users. MPA/E2C and new NET/EE users were also similar in their responses recommending their respective contraceptive method to friends, with >90% of both groups stating that they had a very favorable experience and would definitely recommend their method to a friend. In general, MPA/E2C was well accepted by women in the study group. Their attitudes and perceptions are similar to those of women who were starting OCs for the first time. These data support the premise that MPA/E2C may become a well-accepted, first-line contraceptive option for women in the US. CONTRACEPTION 1999;60:215-222 (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Lee, S				Lee, S			Diagnosis postponed: Shenjing shuairuo and the transformation of psychiatry in post-Mao China	CULTURE MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MENTAL-ILLNESS; NEURASTHENIA; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; CULTURES	Building on Arthur Kleinman's seminal work in Hunan, this paper examines the social context in which shenjing shuairuo (neurasthenia), a ubiquitous psychiatric disease in China prior to 1980, is contested, marginalized, and reconstituted as the popular Western disease of depression among academic psychiatrists in urban China. It is argued that this dramatic change of diagnostic labelling is not only based on empirical evidence. Rather, it is also a product of interests and strategies that are themselves embedded in a confluence of historical, social, political, and economic forces. Specifically, China's open door policy, the hegemony of DSM discourse, the depoliticization of experience, and the transnational commercialization of suffering have all played a role in creating the new-found disease of depression. As a new social construct in China, depression may serve different social functions for different institutional groups, such as drug companies' marketing of new antidepressant therapy, and academic psychiatrists' effort to render the study of suicide more admissible to the state. Because of the government's budgetary limitations and drastic changes in health care financing, however, global diagnostic technology and markets for drugs merely reinforce people's markedly unequal access to health care, which is but one facet of the pervasive social inequity that is China nowadays.

Policies and programs designed to address these problems have too often focused on the characteristics of individuals as the root cause and have failed to address significantly core problems. The research reported here suggests that researchers, program planners, and policy makers should go beyond the focus on individual to incorporate and target larger structural issues such as increasing poverty, growing economic inequalities between rich and poor, and eroding public social programs. This research demonstrates the importance of larger social structures for individuals' health. It also has implications for policy, namely: Neighborhoods are an important target for intervention; policy makers must take a multi-issue approach to addressing problems of the inner city; programs should look at building on community resources and infrastructure, as well as address the needs of individual community residents; and a "one-size-fits-all" mentality is nor appropriate when designing programs to serve neighborhoods.

At the same time, the changes in quality of life as income grows are surprisingly uneven. Either in levels or changes, moreover, the effect of exogenous shifts over time is surprisingly strong compared to growth effects. This article reaches this conclusion with a panel dataset of 81 indicators covering up to four time periods (1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990). The indicators cover seven subjects: (1) individual rights and democracy, (2) political instability and war, (3) education, (4) health, (5) transport and communications, (6) inequality across class and gender, and (7) "bads." With a SUR estimator in levels, income per capita has an impact on the quality of life that is significant, positive, and more important than exogenous shifts for 32 out of 81 indicators. With a fixed-effects estimator, growth has an impact on the quality of life that is significant, positive, and more important than exogenous shifts for 10 out of 81 indicators. With a first-differences IV estimator, growth has a causal impact on the quality of life that is significant, positive, and more important than exogenous shifts for six out of 69 quality of life indicators. The conclusion speculates about such explanations for the pattern of results as (1) the long and variable lags that may come between growth and changes in the quality of life and (2) the possibility that global socioeconomic progress is more important that home-country growth for many quality-of-life indicators.

A recent series of epidemiological, demand and needs surveys reveal a lack of appropriate services to meet the needs of young people at the interface of mental health and criminal justice systems. Recent legislative changes in England and Wales have provided a timely mandate for the development of services. Models of service delivery are explored which can provide safe transition, assessment and treatment for young offenders with high risk mental health problems. Such services must encompass appropriate training in order to recruit and retain staff, and all treatment programmes will require careful monitoring and evaluation. Future research needs to be readily disseminated to ensure that research informs ongoing clinical practice. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

In a comparison of Czechoslovakia with England and Wales, the objectives of this study were to examine data sources and to report time trends and regional distributions in hospital bed supply, hospital doctor supply and hospital utilisation. Methods: For the specialties of general medicine and general surgery in both countries from 1960 to 1986, data were collated on bed supply, hospital doctor supply, discharge rates and length of stay. Issues concerning the comparability of the data were addressed, for example those of the definitions of specialty, length of stay and casemix. Results: In the period 1960 to 1986, in the specialties of general medicine and general surgery, there was a relative excess in the supply of hospital doctors and beds in Czechoslovakia compared with England and Wales. Hospital performance in terms of discharge rates, discharges per bed and length of stay remained relatively static in Czechoslovakia during this period compared to marked increases in discharge rates and reduced length of stay in England and Wales. Both countries recorded reductions in the regional variation of bed and doctor supply and hospital utilisation. Conclusions: International studies of hospital utilisation need to be interpreted carefully in the light of definitions of hospital stay, casemix, the use of day cases and the availability of other services. Subject to these caveats, discharge rates were high and duration of stay long in Czechoslovakia compared with England and Wales; however, both countries achieved important improvements in regional equity.

J	Spruit, IP				Spruit, IP			Ecstasy use and policy responses in the Netherlands	JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES			English	Article							MDMA	During the last 25 years, the Netherlands has attempted to achieve a balanced, two-track, public health and justice policy on drugs. This paper considers the implementation of that policy for ecstasy, a drug that has gained popularity throughout Europe during this decade. Prevention is the Dutch government's primary policy aim. Research, monitoring, and registration are important foundations for the public health aspects of Dutch policy. Important policy instruments include the development of regulations directed towards reductions in the environmental risks posed by house parties and efforts to educate users and non-users about the drug. The justice elements of Dutch ecstasy policy include the outlawing of compounds (since 1988), passing new criminal legislation, and enhancing national and international co-operative enforcement efforts. In 1996, the Public Prosecutor reviewed the criminal investigation and prosecution policy and ordained that all hard drugs (predominantly heroin, cocaine, and ecstasy) had to be criminally investigated and prosecuted along the same lines. Some public health and criminal justice elements of the national policy reinforce each other but others are conflicting. Policy efforts are directed towards the continuing process of maintaining a balance between these approaches and the control of conflicting interests.

We have surmounted this problem by employing an ecological design which applies national income data to local mortality and occupational data. Methods This ecological, cross-sectional study used 1991 mortality and Census data on the 366 English local government districts, and 1991 New Earnings Survey data for England, to determine the independent effect of income inequalities within English local authorities on the variation in all cause mortality between them. The subjects were all men and women recorded as economically active in the 1991 Census. We carried out linear regression analyses between all cause, all ages standardized mortality ratios, income inequality indexes and mean income levels of the local government districts. Results Both income inequality and mean income were independently associated with mortality. Conclusions It is likely that income inequality makes an independent contribution to life expectancy in English local authorities. This finding adds further to the international evidence supporting the potentially positive health impact of increasing the scale of redistributive fiscal policies.

The hospital records of a random, stratified sample (N = 2110) of all patients admitted to the three public psychiatric hospitals in the Western Cape for a calendar year were studied for gender and racial differences regarding demographics. admission-related variables, diagnosis and management, both during hospitalisation and on discharge. Analysis was done for race groups within females and males and differ-ences between groups were tested by chi-square tests. Consistently significant differences in psychiatric diagnosis and management across race and gender were found, many in line with other international and African studies. Anomalies of diagnosis and treatment reflect past inequities of South African Society and suggest the role of both social factors and bias in psychiatric hospital practice. Implications for future mental health research, training and practice are raised.

This paper reviews the issue as it is discussed in the international literature. No real strategies seem to exist for covering the health care of the indigent. Frequently, definitions of poverty and indigence are imprecise, the assessment of indigence is difficult for conceptual and technical reasons, and, therefore, the actual extent of indigence in Africa is not well known. Explicit policies rarely exist, and systematic evaluation of experiences is scarce. Results in terms of adequately identifying the indigent, and of mechanisms to improve indigents' access to health care, are rather deceiving. Policies to reduce poverty, and improve indigents' access to health care, seem to pursue strategies of depoliticizing the issue of social injustice and inequities. The problem is treated in a 'technical' manner, identifying and implementing 'operational' measures of social assistance. This approach, however, cannot resolve the problem of social exclusion, and, consequently, the problem of excluding large parts of African populations from modern health care. Therefore, this approach has to be integrated into a more 'political' approach which is interested in the process of impoverishment, and which addresses the macro-economic and social causes of poverty and inequity.

J	Ruff, TA				Ruff, TA			Immunisation strategies for viral diseases in developing countries	REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY			English	Article							HEPATITIS-B VACCINATION; EXPANDED PROGRAM; IMMUNIZATION; CHILDREN; EFFICACY; INTEGRATION; MEASLES	In just under a quarter of a century, the Expanded Programme on Immunisation has been associated with an increase in infant immunisation coverage from around 5% to 80%, and the prevention of at least 3 million deaths annually, at very low cost. The global target of poliomyelitis eradication by the year 2000 appears feasible. Measles is the next likely target for eradication via immunisation, through 'catch-up', 'keep up' and 'follow-up' strategies which have proven highly effective in the Americas. Yet much needs to be done in order to extend readily achievable immunisation benefits equitably to all the world's people and to realise the potential of existing and soon to be available vaccines for disease control and eradication, as experience with yellow fever and hepatitis B vaccines demonstrates. Unsafe injection practices are widespread, have received inadequate attention, and cause a substantial global burden of blood-borne infections. The risk of increasing global inequity in immunisation highlights the centrality of resource allocation priorities in determining the extent to which the benefits of immunisation will be realised, particularly for new vaccines which are significantly more costly than established EPI vaccines. WHO/UNICEF strategies to target more effectively immunisation support to the neediest countries, to prioritise new vaccines, and to target carefully vaccine procurement and encourage sharply tiered vaccine pricing support both equity and sustainability. However, increasing the resources available to immunisation is vital and requires powerful advocacy on public health, moral, cost-effectiveness and legal grounds. More appropriate resource allocation priorities could readily provide the means necessary to address both technical and operational immunisation challenges. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Lessons from this episode can improve international and national planning for influenza pandemics in seven areas: expanded international commitment to first responses to pandemic threats; surveillance for influenza in key densely populated areas with large live-animal markets; new, economical diagnostic tests not based on eggs; contingency procedures for diagnostic work with highly pathogenic viruses where biocontainment laboratories do not exist; ability of health facilities in developing nations to communicate electronically, nationally and internationally; licenses for new vaccine production methods; and improved equity in supply of pharmaceutical products, as well as availability of basic health services, during a global influenza crisis. The Hong Kong epidemic also underscores the need for national committees and country-specific pandemic plans.

Social outcome and patient perceptions	SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PSYCHIATRIC-PATIENTS; ILL; COMMUNITY	Objective. To assess patient functioning in the community, attitudes to the service and living and care preferences. Design, setting and subjects. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 114 patients attending selected psychiatric outpatient clinics and with 22 'defaulting' patients traced from these clinics into the community. Results and conclusion. Social adjustment, community behaviour and psychiatric functioning were within reasonable limits compared with those reported for discharged patients in international studies. Functioning was found to be poor in a small minority. Patients expressed their satisfaction with the mental health service, for example 96% of patients said that coming to the clinic helped them. However, they identified a number of problems, including insufficient time spent with nurses and problems in receiving and paying for medication. Racial inequities in service provision were noted, for example in rates of hospital admission, attendance at community clinics, and time spent in queues. Fifty-four black patients (63%) and 6 white patients (21%) reported a preference for long-stay hospital over community care. The expressed need for day care was high, with 61 black patients (72%) and 16 white patients (55%) requesting this facility. Almost half of the patients interviewed had consulted a traditional healer regarding their illness and 25% continued to do so. Differences between clinic attenders and 'defaulters' were not significant. Recommendations include the need for additional inpatient beds as well as more community facilities and services.

Most cases occur in young adults but it is also a major cause of illness and death in children. The problem has been exacerbated in recent years by the HIV pandemic and by the emergence of multidrug resistance. Go-infection with HIV greatly enhances the risk of overt tuberculosis and in 1999 it is expected that tuberculosis will account for 30% of the predicted 2.5 million AIDS-related deaths, By inducing clinically and radiologically atypical forms of tuberculosis, and by increasing pressure on diagnostic facilities by sheer numbers, serious diagnostic difficulties are increasingly occurring in both adults and children in the tropics. Ar the present time, 2% of all cases of tuberculosis are multidrug resistant but, as the treatment of such cases is often grossly inadequate in many tropical countries, their frequency will doubtless grow. There are no simple solutions to the global emergency of tuberculosis: clearly there is a need for better use of available control measures but there is also a need to reach a much clearer understanding of the underlying immune phenomena in this disease so as to develop more effective vaccines and therapeutic agents. Finally, it cannot be ignored that tuberculosis is a disease of poverty-95% of cases and 98% of deaths due to it occur in the developing nations-and thus a major control measure is a resolution of the gross inequities in health care provision both between and within nations.

J	Taipale, V				Taipale, V			Ethics and allocation of health resources -: <i>The influence of poverty on health</i>	ACTA ONCOLOGICA			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY	Poverty and health are examined from the global and Nordic perspectives. Thr data From global social policy research, Nordic comparisons and equity in health research provide a basis for the discussion. At the global level the consequences of poverty are growing and the resultant problems posed are becoming increasingly evident. poverty and sickness are interwoven; poverty aggravates mental problems, a situation regarding which we have seen steady deterioration. Research suggests that social cohesion, the Factor that creates social capital and empowerment in societies, is a major factor that promotes health and the economy. Structural measures to combat poverty would require a global social policy: global redistribution, global regulation and global provision. However, the international community is not yet fully prepared for this discussion. At the Nordic level, Finland is a laboratory in which the viability of the welfare state has been tested in the worst recession ever to hit an OECD country.. On the whole, it stems that income disparity has not grown during the recession and that services have functioned moderately well despite budget cuts. However, during that period the correlation between unemployment and sickness became apparent, and the challenges to healthcare more evident. We must make headway in untangling these relationships, because the tendency towards greater income disparity is growing in the: post-recession boom. At the social welfare and health service level even the Nordic welfare states are not in full command of the means to alleviate poverty and its related health problems. Has the time come to dispel our Nordic arrogance and look at how the present services may in fact be generating inequity?

J	Hinman, A				Hinman, A			Eradication of vaccine-preventable diseases	ANNUAL REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						vaccines; infectious diseases	INFLUENZAE TYPE-B; RUBELLA SYNDROME CRS; POLIO ERADICATION; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ETHICAL DILEMMAS; CONTROLLED TRIAL; PERTUSSIS; MENINGITIS; TUBERCULOSIS; METAANALYSIS	Eradication is the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent as a result of deliberate efforts; intervention measures are no longer needed. To date, the only infectious disease that has been eradicated is smallpox. Poliomyelitis is targeted for eradication by the year 2000, and the eradication initiative is well under way, with the Western Hemisphere certified as being polio-free and more than one year having passed since polio cases occurred in the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization. A review of the technical feasibility of eradicating other diseases preventable by vaccines currently licensed for civilian use in the United States indicates that measles, hepatitis B, mumps, rubella, and possibly disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b are potential candidates. From a practical point of view, measles seems most likely to be the next target. Global capacity to undertake eradication is limited, and care must be taken to ensure that a potential measles eradication effort does not impede achievement of polio eradication. Even in the absence of eradication, major improvements in control are both feasible and necessary with existing vaccines. New and improved vaccines may give further possibilities of eradication in the future. Eradication represents the ultimate in sustainability and social justice.

INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PERSPECTIVES			English	Article								Context: The 1994 international Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) established goals for the expansion of reproductive health services and estimated the funding that would be required from the international community and national governments to meet those objectives. Methods: Available data are examined to determine the extent to which funding has met the ICPD estimates of resources needed. Results: Annual global spending on family planning as of the mid-1990s was less than half the $17 billion that the ICPD estimated will be required in the year 2000 international lending has grown, but support from international donors has not increased to fill the gap; when adjusted for inflation domestic spending in many countries has fallen. Funding for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases also falls far short of the projected need. Some 4-17% of government health expenditures in developing countries are committed to maternal health. However, since many women lack even the most basic reproductive health services, the ICPD projections likely underestimate the resource requirements. Conclusions: Funding for reproductive health services falls substantially below ICPD goals. Consumer spending may be able to fill part of the shortfall, but other strategies for meeting the goals will be needed that do not adversely affect demand or social justice. Priorities will have to be carefully set if available resources are to be used as cost-effectively and equitably as possible.

J	Anwar, H				Anwar, H			Emerging environmental, health and safety issues in China: practical impacts on international investors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION			English	Article						China; environment; investment; policy		The Chinese government at the highest levels continues to stress the importance of environmental protection. The environmental consequences of rapid industrialization and a burgeoning population are now unavoidable to citizens and government ministers alike. Among the major challenges for environmental protection and health and safety regulations in China are improving the transparency of government bodies and statistics, encouraging horizontal and vertical coordination on regulation and projects between and within ministries, ensuring economic viability of both municipal and commercial sector environmental protection projects, and enforcing ever-strengthening regulations. Government officials at all levels will no doubt feel pressure to advance new legislation while maintaining a high level of GDP growth, which invariably will place a priority on development and not on environmental, health and safety issues. Given the increasingly precarious economic conditions and ongoing reform of state-owned enterprises, it may be difficult for the Chinese government to follow through on high-minded efforts. This paper discusses the changing regulatory framework, likely enforcement inequities and implications for multinationals seeking to comply.

WHO recommended that governments develop and implement national policies and programs for cancer pain relief This report evaluates national health policy and the systems of health care delivery in relation to cancer pain management in the new South Africa. This field study included multiple methods of data collection: analysis of documents, field trips with participant observation in sites of care delivery, focused interviews, and in-depth interviews of key informants. The purposive sample of hey informants (n = 33) represented multiple stakeholders in a variety of settings. Strengths of the developing health policy include specific recommendations related to palliative cal-e; the shift to universal primary care; policies to support drug availability; the inclusion of morphine and codeine as essential drugs at the primary health care level; and the development of a national standard related to cancer pain management. Health services are characterized by two parallel systems of care (private and public) with numerous vestiges of the inequities of apartheid. The management of pain varies by provider and setting major problems with access exist in the rural areas. Health services in South Africa have been plagued by inequity and inadequate resources. New health policies have set a path to ensure universal access to health care including palliative care for cancer: Their successful implementation is the next necessary step toward improving health services and alleviating the suffering of increasing numbers of individuals with cancer.

This study examines the Mexican health decentralization efforts of the past decade to discern the motivations for the reform, the context for its implementation, the politics of its downfall, and the reform's impact at subnational levels of government. Sparked by economic crisis and pressure from international creditors for fiscal reform; demands for greater democracy, equity, and quality; and technocratic impulses to rationalize health services delivery, the decentralization reform could not overcome the authoritarian centralism of the federal government and its corporatist clients. In the end, even in the most technically capable states, the reform was unable to overcome political obstacles to decentralizing fiscal power, redistributing resources in an equitable fashion, and eliminating the inefficiencies of separate but unequal health systems for social security recipients and the uninsured population.

We systematically searched Medline, BIDS Embase, Econlit and BIDS ISI and the reference lists of located papers to identify relevant empirical studies comparing salaried doctors with those paid by alternative methods. Only studies which reported objective outcomes and measures of the behaviour of doctors paid by salary compared to an alternative method were included in the review. Twenty-three papers were identified as meeting the selection criteria. Only one of the studies in this review reported a proxy for health status, but none examined whether salaried doctors differentiated between patients on the basis of health needs. Therefore, we were unable to draw conclusions on the likely impact of salaried payment on efficiency and equity. However, the limited evidence in our review does suggest that payment by salaries is associated with the lowest use of tests, and referrals compared with FFS and capitation. Salary payment is also associated with lower numbers of procedures per patient, lower throughput of patients per doctor, longer consultations, more preventive care and different patterns of consultation compared with FFS payment.

The study covers the 10 million people aged 25-64 years at the time of the 1970 censuses in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, and the 1 million incident cancer cases diagnosed among these people during the subsequent 20 years. The project was undertaken as a cohort study with linkage of individual records based on the personal identification numbers used in all the Nordic countries. In the 1970 censuses, information on occupation for each economically active member of the household was provided in free text in self-administered questionnaires. The data were centrally coded and computerized in the statistical offices. Norway, Sweden, and Finland used the Nordic Classification of Occupations, while Denmark used a national coding scheme. However, all the data could be reclassified into 53 occupational groups and 1 group of economically inactive persons. Person-years at risk were accumulated from 1 January 1971 until the date of emigration, date of death or 31 December 1987 in Denmark, 1989 in Sweden, 1990 in Finland, and 1991 in Norway. The 4 countries all had nationwide registration of incident cancer cases during the entire study period. All incident cancer cases during the individual risk periods were included in the analysis. Despite minor differences between the countries, the international Classification of Diseases, 7th revision, formed the core basis for the diagnostic coding in all 4 countries. For the present study the incident cancer cases have been classified into 35 broad diagnostic groups. The observed number of cancer cases in each group of persons defined by country, gender, and occupation was compared with the expected number calculated from the age-, gender-, and period-specific person-years and the incidence rates for the national population. The result has been presented as a standardized incidence ratio (SIR), defined as the observed number of cases divided by the expected number and multiplied by 100. In the tables of this report, all the SIR values for which the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is below 100 are printed in green and all those for which the lower limit of the confidence interval is above 100 are printed in red. For all cancers combined, the study showed a wide variation among the men, from an SIR of 79 for farmers to 159 for waiters. The occupations with the highest SIR values also included seamen and workers producing beverages and tobacco. Among the women the SLR values varied from 83 for gardeners to 129 for tobacco workers. Low SIR values were found for farmers and teachers. Outdoor workers such as fishermen and gardeners had the highest risk of lip cancer, while the lowest risk was found among indoor workers such as physicians and artistic workers. Almost all pleural cancers are associated with asbestos exposure. Accordingly, plumbers, welders, mechanics, and seamen were the occupations with the highest risk. There was also an excess risk of pleural cancer in the occupational group of technical, chemical, physical, and biological workers, including, among others, engineers and chemists potentially exposed to asbestos. The wood workers included in the present study had the highest risk of nasal cancer. Most studies of nasal cancer have shown increased risks associated with exposure to wood dust, both for those in furniture making and for those exposed exclusively to soft wood. Nickel refinery workers are also known for their high risk of nasal cancer. In the present study they were included in the occupational group of smelting workers. Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer among men in the present study. Tobacco smoking is the major risk factor for this disease, but occupational exposures also play an important role. Waiters and tobacco workers had the highest risk of lung cancer. Miners and guarry workers also had a high risk of lung cancer, which may be related to their exposure to silica dust and radon daughters. Among women, tobacco workers had the highest risk of lung cancer and farmers and gardeners had the lowest risk. Waiters had the highest risk of bladder cancer for men, and they were one of the groups at highest risk among the women. Chimney sweeps and male hairdressers also had high SIR values for bladder cancer. Chimney sweeps are exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from chimney soot, and the carcinogenicity of these compounds is well documented. Almost all occupational groups with low SIR values for bladder cancer also had low SIR values for lung cancer, groups such as farmers, gardeners, and those working in pedagogical work. Exposure to the known hepatocarcinogens, Hepatitis B virus and aflatoxins is rare in the Nordic countries, and a large proportion of primary liver cancers can therefore be attributed to alcohol consumption. When primary liver cancer was classified by occupation, high risks were found for occupational groups with easy access to alcohol at the workplace or with cultural traditions for high alcohol consumption. Among men, waiters, journalists, cooks, beverage workers, and seamen had the highest risk. The lowest SIR values were found for farmers, forestry workers, teachers, wood workers, and gardeners. The risk of colon cancer has been related to sedentary work. The findings in the present study were in agreement, especially for men with this pattern, as journalists and physicians had the highest risk and outdoor workers such as farmers and forestry workers had the lowest risk. The occupational categories with the highest risks of breast cancer in the present study are accompanied by a university or equivalent education. This pattern is in agreement with a relatively late age at first birth among the well-educated Nordic women from the relevant birth cohorts. Malignant melanoma showed the same strong social gradient as cancers of the colon and breast. The major risk factor for malignant melanoma is intermittent sunlight exposure and sunburns of susceptible persons, which occur particularly during leisure time. The Nordic countries are well known for equity and free and equal access to health care for all citizens. The present study shows that the risk of cancer, even under these circumstances, is highly dependent on the person's position in society.

Men's and women's responses to structured prompting on a standard question on long standing illness	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						gender; reporting; morbidity; longstanding illness	SEX-DIFFERENCES; GENDER DIFFERENCES; CANCER-PATIENTS; HEALTH; MORTALITY; INEQUALITIES; PERCEPTIONS; ORIENTATION; SYMPTOMS; SCOTLAND	It is frequently observed in contemporary industrialised societies that although women live longer than men, they are sicker than men in that they report higher rates of morbidity, disability and health care use. One common element of the explanation for women's higher rates of morbidity is that there are gender differences in the way that symptoms are perceived, evaluated and acted upon. It is widely assumed that women will be more ready to report illness and to seek help and that they have greater flexibility in their lives to accommodate illness. The few studies that have examined men and women with the same conditions or symptoms are contradictory, but lend little support to this hypothesised greater propensity, yet it is still widely believed. Here we compare men's and women's answers to a global, commonly used question about chronic illness and to a series of more specific prompts and classify the conditions reported by an externally defined categorisation of severity and International Classification of Disease chapter. Contrary to the common expectation that women report higher rates of morbidity and are more ready to report mental health problems, we found: no gender differences in the initial reporting of conditions; men reported a higher proportion of their conditions in response to the initial global question; and no evidence that women were more likely to report 'trivial' or mental health conditions in response to the initial question.

J	Engelhardt, HT				Engelhardt, HT			Critical care: Why there is no global bioethics	JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						critical care; global bioethics; indigenous bioethics; inequality		The high technology and the costs involved in critical care disclose the implausibility of applying the American standard version of bioethics in the developing world. The American standard version of bioethics was framed during the rapid secularization of the American culture, the emergence of a new image for the medical profession, the development of high technology medicine, an ever greater demand in resources, and a shift of focus from families and communities to individuals. This all brought with it a particular ideology of health care which promised Americans (1) the best of care, (2) equal care, and (3) physician/patient choice, without (4) runaway costs. This essay argues that this moral project is impossible in practice. This impossibility is especially salient in developing countries. In addition to the fact that it is financially impossible to provide all in the developing world with the standard of care accepted by law, policy, and convention in developed countries, different moral perspectives with different orderings of values will seem more or less plausible in different cultures. Indeed, such an approach would be harmful. A concrete bioethics applicable across the world does not appear possible.

There are reasons to expect that these differences are relatively small in southern European countries or in Nordic welfare states. This report therefore presents an international overview of socioeconomic differences in stroke mortality. Methods-Unpublished data on mortality by occupational class were obtained from national longitudinal studies or cross-sectional studies. The data refer to deaths among men aged 30 to 64 years in the 1980s. A common occupational class scheme was applied to most countries. The mortality difference between manual classes and nonmanual classes was measured in relative terms (by rate ratios) and in absolute terms (by rate differences). Results-In all countries, manual classes had higher stroke mortality rates than nonmanual classes. This difference was relatively large in England and Wales, Ireland, and Finland and relatively small in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy, and Spain. Differences were intermediate in the United States, France, and Switzerland. In Portugal, mortality differences were intermediate in relative terms but large in absolute terms. In most countries, inequalities were much larger for stroke mortality than for ischemic heart disease mortality. Conclusions-Socioeconomic differences in stroke mortality are a problem common to all countries studied. There are probably large variations, however, in the contribution that different risk factors, such as tobacco and alcohol consumption, make to the stroke mortality excess of lower socioeconomic groups. Medical services can contribute to reducing socioeconomic differences in stroke mortality.

Although attention has been paid to areas such as provision of essential drugs, strengthening of infrastructures and service delivery, human rights, and appropriate health technologies, great inequalities remain. The HIV epidemic has highlighted these differences, because technological advances and the response of people infected with HIV have enabled the sharing of experiences across regions and brought the contrast into focus.

J	Labonte, R				Labonte, R			Healthy public policy and the World Trade Organization: a proposal for an international health presence in future world trade/investment talks	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						globalization; health determinants; healthy public policy; public health		Poverty, other forms of social inequality and human impacts on the environment are increasingly recognized as important, perhaps fundamental, health determinants. These determinants, in turn, are largely conditioned and constrained by economic practices, and by government legislation that regulates such practices or seeks to mitigate inequalities that arise from them. Over the past two decades the ability of national governments to intervene in economic practices has been reduced by two interrelated phenomena: the dominance of a neoliberal economic orthodoxy, which emphasizes free (unregulated) markets and a 'minimal' welfare state, and the growth in regional and global free trade and investment agreements. There is mounting evidence that policies based on neoliberal economic theory, including free trade/investment agreements, may seriously undermine public health by increasing social inequalities, depleting natural resources and increasing environmental pollution. This evidence has sparked a call among many public interest non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and policy 'think tanks' for appending strong 'social clauses' to global trade and investment agreements to ensure that such agreements are socially just and environmentally sustainable. This paper proposes creation of a strong public health lobby, both nationally and internationally, to join with of her public interest NGOs in,the social clause campaign. It begins by defining and critiquing some of the basic tenets of neoliberal economic orthodoxy which underpin the push towards global free trade and investment agreements. It then describes the current status of these agreements, and provides examples of how such agreements might imperil public health. The paper then discusses the social clause initiative, and concludes by advancing a proposal for a public health lobby presence at those fora where trade and investment agreements are negotiated and monitored.

J	Vokk, R; Boeing, H				Vokk, R; Boeing, H			Public Health aspects of nutritional science in Estonia: Status, research activities, and perspectives	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ERNAHRUNGSWISSENSCHAFT			English	Review						food and nutrition policy; Estonia; nutritional situation; public health; nutritional science	POLICIES; EUROPE	At the beginning of the 1990s Estonia was characterized by remarkable social and economic changes that also affected nutrition. An important step in the development of a Food and Nutrition policy was the adoption of a new 'Food Law' in February 1995. The publication of dietary recommendations followed recently. Scientific activities in Estonia are promoted by the 1993 established 'Estonian Society of Nutrition Researchers' (ESNS). The 'Ministry of Social Affairs' is of great importance for coordination of research into nutrition and it is making a great effort to connect Estonian nutrition research activities to European and international programs. An important field of scientific interest is concentrated on the nutrition of children and elderly people. With support of the 'Ministry of Social Affairs' a national health program for children and teenagers was established in which a school lunch project is integrated. Such a project has the aim to improve the quality of school lunches and to enable school teachers to conduct nutritional education. Within this national health program 1 900 schoolchildren were interviewed. This examination will also help to detect inequalities of the nutritional situation between social groups and to identify specific aims for a nutritional program in the different counties of Estonia. Health promoting units at schools will play an important role in realizing these aims. The nutritional supply and status of older persons will become an increasing problem. A survey of food supply with 429 subjects in social care facilities for older people was used to develop a new menu-planning system which meets the nutritional recommendations. Nutritional epidemiology is concentrated at the 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics' of the 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine' in Tallinn. This department is also running the cancer registry of Estonia which has international reputation. Nutritional research of Estonia should aim to continue with the development of a new Food and Nutrition Policy. Important areas of activities will be concentrated on the training of young scientists, development of a food and nutrient data base, regular national nutrition and health surveys, and etiological-epidemiological studies on the basis of the Estonian Cancer Registry. The main targets of the 'Estonian Society of Nutrition Researchers' are directed to improve the scientific basis for research into nutrition and health.

These include destruction of aquatic ecosystems and extinction of species, millions of deaths from water-related illnesses, and a growing risk of regional and international conflicts over scarce, shared water supplies. As human populations continue to grow, these problems are Likely to become more frequent and serious. New approaches to long-term water planning and management that incorporate principles of sustainability and equity are required and are now being explored by national and international water experts and organizations. Seven "sustainability criteria" are discussed here, as part of an effort to reshape long-term water planning and management. Among these principles are guaranteed access to a basic amount of water necessary to maintain human health and to sustain ecosystems, basic protections for the renewability of water resources, and institutional recommendations for planning, management, and conflict resolution. "Backcasting" a positive future vision of the world's water resources as a tool, for developing rational policies and approaches for reducing water-related problems is also discussed in the context of the Comprehensive Freshwater Assessment prepared for the United Nations General Assembly in 1997.

J	Blaug, M				Blaug, M			Where are we now in British health economics?	HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Review							PHYSICIAN-INDUCED DEMAND; CARE MARKET; QALYS; SERVICE; EQUITY; COST; WILLINGNESS; RESOURCES; CONTRACTS; INSURANCE	Health economics took off in 1970 or thereabouts, just after the take-off date for the economics of education. Although early health economics made use of human capital theory as did the economics of education, it soon took a different route inspired by Arrow's work on medical insurance. The economics of education failed to live up to its promising start in the 1960s and gradually ran out of steam. The economics of health, however, has made steady theoretical and empirical progress since 1970, principally in coming to grips with the implications of supplier-induced demand and the difficulties of evaluating health care outcomes. Some of the best work on British health economics has been in the area of normative welfare economics, defining more precisely what is meant by equity in the delivery of health care and measuring the degree of success in achieving equity. Recent efforts to reform the NHS by the introduction of 'quasi markets' have improved the quantity and quality of health care in Britain. In short, British health economics has been characterised by the use of Pigovian piecemeal rather than Paretian global welfare economics, retaining a distinctive style that sets it apart from American health economics.

Methods: Prevalence data were gathered using lay interviewers administering structured diagnostic instruments based on DSM-III-R criteria to 150 youths booked into a reservation-based juvenile detention center from July 1995 through April 1996. Results: Approximately 49% of the sample had at least one alcohol, drug, or mental health disorder; 12.7% had two disorders; and 8.7% had three or more disorders. The most common diagnoses were substance abuse/dependence (38%), conduct disorder (16.7%), and major depression (10%). Females were significantly more likely than males to have major depression and/or anxiety disorders and were significantly more likely to have three or more disorders, These rates were higher in comparison with general and Indian adolescent community samples. Conclusions: These American Indian adolescent detainees had a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Local juvenile justice systems should be vigilant for the presence of psychiatric disorders and appropriately connected with psychiatric services to address this considerable need. Careful psychiatric assessment is necessary to ensure a more coordinated community service response to juvenile delinquency.

J	Sihvonen, AP; Kunst, AE; Lahelma, E; Valkonen, T; Mackenbach, JP				Sihvonen, AP; Kunst, AE; Lahelma, E; Valkonen, T; Mackenbach, JP			Socioeconomic inequalities in health expectancy in Finland and Norway in the late 1980s	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						health expectancy; life expectancy; health inequalities; Finland; Norway	ACTIVE LIFE EXPECTANCY; INTERNATIONAL VARIATION; UNITED-STATES; SOCIAL-CLASS; MORTALITY; MORBIDITY; ENGLAND; WALES; DIFFERENTIALS; DISABILITY	Studies on health inequalities have usually focused either on mortality or on morbidity. This concerns national studies as well as international comparisons of health inequalities. This paper seeks to bridge the gap by applying health expectancy as a synthetic overall measure of health. The purpose of the study is to compare socioeconomic inequalities in health expectancy in Finland and Norway in the late 1980s. Additionally, the major methodological issues in the use of health expectancy in the study of health inequalities are identified. Data on mortality by level of education derive from linked national follow-up studies (1986-1990) of population censuses. Data on the prevalence of morbidity by level of education derive from nationally representative surveys of the noninstitutionalised adult population in 1985/87. Persons aged 25-74 years were included. Four measures of morbidity were used: limiting long-standing illness, extremely limiting long-standing illness, functional disabilities and perceived less than good health. The association between mortality/morbidity and level of education in each 5-year age/sex group was determined by a regression-based method. Partial life expectancies and partial health expectancies for ages 25-74 were then calculated by using the mortality quotients and morbidity prevalences predicted by the regression model for those at the top and the bottom of the educational hierarchy in each 5-year age group, using an application of the method first presented by Sullivan. Although various measures of health expectancy were used, the result were consistent. In absolute terms the size of socioeconomic inequalities in health expectancy in Finland and Norway is on the same level. In relative terms, however, the size of inequalities in health expectancy is greater in Norway. If one considers premature mortality to be more severe than any indicator of morbidity, the mortality-morbidity mix of the health inequalities is less favourable to Finland, since the size of absolute inequalities in mortality is greater in Finland. Health expectancy measures provide a promising measure for assessing and comparing the pattern and the size of health inequalities. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Langeweg, F				Langeweg, F			The implementation of Agenda 21 'our common failure'?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						sustainable development; policy analysis; human health; security; damage to nature; natural resources; economic instruments; scenarios		Sustainable development has for a long time been considered the starting-point for environmental policy, with Agenda 21 leading the way to such development. Social and economic equity, as well as global efficiency and development, are considered among the requirements for sustainable development. Only when such development is reached, will the solution to environmental problems come into perspective. Although we are now 5 years along the road marked out by Agenda 21, the perspectives for achieving the objectives stated are still slight. Despite economic growth, global inequity is on the increase. The conversion of natural areas to agricultural land will greatly increase due to the population growth, especially in Asia and Africa. In North America and Europe this trend seems reversed: life expectancy is longer and people's health has improved. The developing world is catching up. However, there is more needed to bring the world population's welfare and social security levels up to par. At the same time the environmental pressures on the world's natural areas will have to be brought down substantially. This can be done using market-based instruments, supplemented where necessary with orders, bans, fiscal measures and agreements at national and international levels. Internationally, a policy directed to investments and trade is needed to stimulate developing regions to undertake technological renewal and work away backlogs. The technological potential is still gigantic, but investment in the social system - in other words, in people - will be necessary if we are actually to use this potential.

These are aggravated by poverty, poor living conditions, ignorance concerning health education, and lack of government funding and policy to provide sufficient oral health care workers. WHO and FDI have identified the problems and developed strategies. However, acceptable goals and standards of oral health have to be agreed. Furthermore, barriers to oral health promotion need to be overcome through co-operation at all levels and appreciation of cultural sensitivity. There is the need for research to determine which types of oral health care systems are most effective in reducing the extent of inequality in oral health. In developing countries where there are huge problems, intervention programmes focusing on primary care and prevention should be designed and implemented urgently and their effectiveness monitored and analysed scientifically. The WHO, FDI and national and international professional organisations should play a leading role in encouraging a determined, co-ordinated effort towards improving the oral health status of disadvantaged people in developing countries.

Nationally representative data on mortality by occupational class among men 30-64 years at death were obtained from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. A common social class scheme was applied to most data sets, The magnitude of mortality differences was quantified by three summary indices. Three major data problems were identified and their potential effect on inequality estimates was quantified for each country individually. For men 45-59 years, the mortality rate ratio comparing manual classes to non-manual classes was about equally large for four Nordic countries, England and Wales, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Relatively large ratios were only observed for France. The same applied to men 60-64 years (data for only 5 countries, including France). For men 30-44 years, there was evidence for smaller mortality differences in Italy and larger differences in Norway, Sweden and especially Finland (no data for France and Spain). Application of other summary indices to men 45-59 years showed slightly different patterns. When the population distribution over occupational classes was taken into account, relatively small differences were observed for Switzerland, Italy and Spain. When national mortality levels were taken into account, relatively large differences were observed for Finland and Ireland. For each summary index, however, France leads the international league table. Data problems were found to have the potential to bias inequality estimates, substantially especially those for ireland, Spain and Portugal. This study underlines the similarities rather than the dissimilarities between European countries. There is no evidence that mortality differences are smaller in countries with more egalitarian socio-economic and other policies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Special guest lecture given during the Conference on Global Lung Health and 1997 Annual Meeting of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Palais des Congres, Paris, France, 1-4 October 1997	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Article						health sector reform; lung health; TB control; respiratory diseases	CARE	Health sector reform, which is currently taking place in low or middle income countries following the implementation of structural adjustment programmes, advocates the use of rational measures aimed at increasing the efficiency of the health services. These measures are being applied unevenly. Cuts in governments' social budgets have had the effect of favouring the development of the private medical and pharmaceutical sector, rather than rationalising the choice of priorities. The emphasis on cost recovery in basic health services is penalising the poorest and most vulnerable groups. In developing countries, a managerial approach that does not take into account the socio-political structures of these countries and the priorities of health policies only serves to aggravate the inequalities inherent in obtaining access to health care. Under these circumstances, the promotion of lung health runs the risk of being forgotten or compromised. The persisting or worsening weaknesses of the basic health services do not facilitate the application of an integrated approach to respiratory diseases (including tuberculosis), nor the support of a minimum package of health activities to offer to the population. Environmental factors affecting respiratory health (such as smoking and air pollution) are not taken into account in health sector reform, even though they constitute an obvious threat and demand urgent, widespread action. It is a new challenge for health personnel to promote and guarantee lung health.

This paper presents current population data documenting the still serious problem of perinatal outcome in the USA as well as in other economically developed countries. International comparisons suggest that nations which have the greatest inequality of income and social opportunity also have the most adverse perinatal, child and adult health outcomes. Furthermore, the data assert that these effects are independent of average national wealth or gross national economic productivity. Health status differs by social class and race, even among the most affluent sectors of the population. All social classes, even the wealthiest, suffer the health consequences of social inequalities. An explanatory socio-psychological theory of causality is proposed.

Methods Data were obtained from national health interview surveys or similar surveys between 1986 and 1992. Four morbidity indicators were included. For each country, individual-level data on occupation were recoded according to one standard occupational class scheme: the Erikson-Goldthorpe social class scheme. To describe the pattern of morbidity by occupational class, odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each class using the average of the population as a reference. The size of morbidity differences was summarized by the OR of two broad hierarchical classes. All OR were age-adjusted. Results For all countries, a lower than average prevalence of morbidity was found for higher and lower administrators and professionals as well as for routine nonmanual workers, whereas a higher than average prevalence was found for skilled and unskilled manual workers and agricultural workers. Self-employed men were in general healthier than the average population. The relative health of farmers differed between countries. The morbidity difference between manual workers and the class of administrators and professionals was approximately equally large in all countries. Consistently larger inequality estimates, with no or slightly overlapping confidence intervals, were only found for Sweden in comparison with Germany. Conclusions Thanks to the use of a common social class scheme in each country, a high degree of comparability was achieved. The results suggest that morbidity differences according to occupational class among men are very similar between different European countries.

Design and methods-National representative data on morbidity by educational level were obtained from health interview surveys, level of Living surveys or other similar surveys carried out between 1985 and 1993. Four morbidity indicators were included and a considerable effort was made to maximise the comparability of these indicators. A standardised scheme of educational levels was applied to each survey. The study included men and women aged 25 to 69 years. The size of morbidity differences was measured by of the based Relative of Inequality. Main results-The size of inequalities in health was found to vary between countries. In general, there was a tendency for inequalities to be relatively large in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and to be relatively small in Spain, Switzerland, and West Germany. Intermediate positions were observed for Finland, Great Britain, France, and Italy. The position of the Netherlands strongly varied according to sex: relatively large inequalities were found for men whereas relatively small inequalities were found for women. The relative position of some countries, for example, West Germany, varied according to the morbidity indicator. Conclusions-Because of a number of unresolved problems with the precision and the international comparability of the data, the margins of uncertainty for the inequality estimates are somewhat wide. However, these problems are unlikely to explain the overall pattern. It is remarkable that health inequalities are not necessarily smaller in countries with more egalitarian policies such as the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries. Possible explanations are discussed.

J	Lee, K				Lee, K			Shaping the future of global health cooperation: where can we go from here?	LANCET			English	Article								A review of recent studies and initiatives on global health cooperation groups their findings into ten key reform issues. In addressing these issues, policy makers need to improve their understanding of what is meant by the shift from International to global health. Attention must also be paid to the fundamental question of what we want from a system of global health cooperation. Three main views currently exist on what priority activities such a system should pursue-traditionalist, essentialist, and social justice. Reconciliation of these views can then be followed by consideration of the structural features of a global health organisation for the 21st century. Achievement of the above will require a reform process that is more broadly participatory, well-informed, and coherent in purpose and direction.

Feast and famine: socioeconomic disparties in global nutrition and health	PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION			English	Article						Malnutrition; Overnutrition; Obesity; Non-communicable diseases; Epidemiological transition; Socioeconomic disparties in health		Objective. To review current information on under-and over-malnutrition and the consequences of socioeconomic disparities on global nutrition and health. Design: Malnutrition, both under and over, can no longer be addressed without considering global food insecurity, socioeconomic disparity, both globally and nationally, and global cultural, social and epidemiological transitions. Setting: The economic gap between the more and less affluent nations is growing. At the same time income disparity is growing within most countries, both developed and developing. Concurrently, epidemiological, demographic and nutrition transitions are taking place in many countries. Results: Fully one-third of young children in the world's low-income countries are stunted because of malnutrition. One-half of all deaths among young children are, in part, a consequence of malnutrition. Forty per cent of women in the developing world suffer from iron deficiency anaemia, a major cause of maternal mortality and low birth weight infants. Despite such worrying trends, there have been significant increases in life expectancy in nearly all countries of the world, and continuing improvements in infant mortality rates. The proportion of children malnourished has generally decreased, although actual numbers have not in subSaharan Africa and south Asia. Inequalities are increasing between the richest developed countries and the poorest developing countries. Social inequality is an important factor in differential mortality in both developed and developing countries. Many countries have significant pockets of malnutrition and increased mortality of children, while obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) prevalences are increasing. Not infrequently it is the poor and relatively disadvantaged sectors of the population who are suffering both. In the industrialized countries, cardiovascular disease incidence has declined, but less so in the poorer socioeconomic strata. Conclusions The apparent contradictions found represent a particular point in time (population responses generally lag behind social and environmental transitions). They do also show encouraging evidence that interventions can have a positive impact, sometimes despite disadvantageous circumstances. However, it seems increasingly unlikely that food production will continue to keep up with population growth. It is also unlikely present goals for reducing protein-energy malnutrition prevalence will be reached. The coexistence of diseases of undernutrition and NCDs will have an impact on allocation of resources. Action needs to be continued and maintained at the international, national and individual level.

J	Goodland, R				Goodland, R			Environmental sustainability in agriculture: diet matters	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						ecotax; food efficiency conversion tax; agricultural sustainability; environmental sustainability; food equity; food ethics; food chain	POPULATION; FOOD	There is no agreement that diet matters for environmental sustainability in the agriculture sector. Much current agriculture is unsustainable and worsening; the environmental impact of agriculture degrades natural capital (e.g. loss of topsoil, waste and pollution of water, nutrient loss, extinction of species). Cattle raising is one of the most damaging components of agriculture. Livestock now eat about half of global grain production. There is limited scope for improving food supply and what scope there is will further damage the environment. All means to improve nutrition, especially for the poor, will be needed as population increases. One such means is to improve diets of the rich by eating lower down the food chain. While most people in the world thrive on mainly grain-based diets, carnivory is high in OECD and is increasing in LDCs. In order to reduce food wastage and to improve health and food availability, a food conversion efficiency tax is proposed. The least efficient converters (pork, beef) would be highly taxed; more efficient converters (poultry, eggs, dairy) would be moderately taxed. Most efficient converters (ocean fish) would be taxed lowest. Grain for human food would not be taxed, while coarse grains might be modestly subsidized. Non-food agriculture also would be taxed: highest on tobacco and on starches destined for alcoholic beverages produced from land suitable for food production.

J	Soderlund, N; Khosa, S				Soderlund, N; Khosa, S			The potential role of risk-equalization mechanisms in health insurance: the case of South Africa	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article							CARE MARKET; ADVERSE SELECTION; PLANS; INFORMATION; EXPERIENCE; COVERAGE; INSURERS; REFORM; POLICY	International agencies such as the World Bank have widely advocated the use of health insurance as a way of improving health sector efficiency and equity in developing countries. However, in developing countries with well-established, multiple-player health insurance markets, such as South Africa, extension of insurance coverage is now inhibited by problems of moral hazard, and associated cost escalation and fragmentation of insurer risk-pools. Virtually no research has been done on the problem of risk selection in health insurance outside developed countries. This paper provides a brief overview of the problem of risk fragmentation as it has been studied in developed countries, and attempts to apply this to middle-income country settings, particularly that of South Africa. A number of possible remedial measures are discussed, with risk-equalization funds being given the most attention. An overview is given of the risk-equalization approach, common misconceptions regarding its working and the processes that might be required to assess its suitability in different national settings. Where there is widespread public support for social risk pooling in health care, and government is willing and able to assume a regulatory role to achieve this, risk-equalization approaches may achieve significant efficiency and equity gains without destroying the positive features of private health care financing, such as revenue generation, competition and free choice of insurer.

The author's generation participated in these revolutions and contributed to the global intellectual process by which gender equity and reproductive health assumed a central role in world affairs. A rapidly aging world population constitutes another major challenge. Its likely impact on the very fundaments of our future social, economical, health and even political infrastructures is - as yet - incompletely comprehended by the international community.

We argue that the conceptual and technical basis for DALYs is flawed, and its assumptions and value judgements are open to serious question. In particular, the implications of age-weighting and discounting are found to be unacceptable. Moreover, the proponents of DALYs do not distinguish between the exercises of measuring the burden of disease and of allocating resources. But the appropriate information sets for the two exercises are quite different. Allocating resources by aggregate DALY-minimization is shown to be inequitable. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Long, A				Long, A			Nursing: A spiritual perspective	NURSING ETHICS			English	Article						counselling; healing; nursing; promoting health; spirituality; unity		This article explores and examines the fundamental need for nurses to include the promotion of the spiritual dimension of the health of human beings as well as the physical, mental and social facets if they truly wish to engage in holistic care. The author attempts to define the phenomenon of spirituality, aware of the dilemma that many individuals face when thinking and reflecting on this very personal and intangible issue. To be spiritual is to become fully human, the article argues, and the reverse is also true. Spirituality in health is inextricable in each person's search for the discovery of the truth about self and the meaning and purpose of life. Healthy communities are the product of healthy individuals who sow spiritual seeds such as unconditional positive regard, acceptance, respect and dignity for the benefit and advancement of individuals and humankind as a whole. The global nature of the phenomenon of spirituality is also shown by using examples of people who demonstrate compassion and communion with other human beings, in other countries in times of suffering, war and disaster. Compassion and empathy is expressed and experienced for victims of earthquakes that happen miles from home and far removed from personal or religious beliefs. Yet at such times we are all connected in the tapestry of life by our own human spirituality and earthiness. Abstract themes like compassion and justice are treated in the text within the context of spirituality. The author argues that being just and fair means that all patients have the right to achieve spiritual healing regardless of their belief systems, culture or creed. The works of some spiritual philosophers are used to reflect on this integral aspect of human caregiving. Historical symbols of spirituality are examined. The need for nurses to explore and reflect on the paradoxical concepts involved in their own spirituality is highlighted. Nurses are the essential providers of care and, therefore, the paper argues, guardians of that essential humanity that ensures that patients never become less than full human beings, whatever their condition, faith, culture or belief, or whoever they may be. The author contends that this responsibility is uniquely essential to being a nurse.

A cost analysis study compared the package of health services, costs, resource utilisation (drugs and staff) and financing mechanisms at Halley Stott Health Centre and Umbumbulu Clinic with those of other primary care providers in KwaZulu-Natal, Options identified were used to improve efficiency, resource allocations and financing of health services in KwaZulu-Natal, Design/outcome measures. The direct accounting method was used to calculate unit costs for the following cost centres - paediatrics and adult curative consultations, antenatal/postnatal care, family planning, the under-5s clinic and the mobile services, Staff efficiency was assessed using the Centre for Health Policy method based on workload estimates, while the International Network for the Rational Use of Drugs indicators were used to assess the efficiency of drug usage, Results. There was considerable variation in the package of services provided at all the health facilities; the average costs ranged from R5.94 to R134.76 and the unit costs ranged from R29.30 to R161.92 for curative care, The bulk of the resources (64 - 73%) were spent on personnel costs, providing mainly curative care, Underutilisation of antenatal care, the under-5s clinic and paediatric consultations were reflected in reduced time utilisation and lower levels of staff efficiency, while family planning services were over-utilised, which reflected a relative staff shortage, The components of health services provided at the two health facilities exceeded those recommended by the World Bank, Conclusions, Cost analysis has the potential to quantify staff and drug efficiency, facilitate resource allocation and improve health service efficiency, Defining the package of health services for each province contributes to the development of the nationally agreed basic package of health services, and enables managers and policy-makers to choose different options rationally, control costs, shift resources and achieve equity.

J	Hermans, HEGM				Hermans, HEGM			Patients' rights in the European Union - Cross-border care as an example of the right to health care	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						authorization; cross-border care; legal cases; legal principles; patients' rights		The rights of patients to receive health care in other member states of the European Union (EU) are dependent upon both individual rights and social rights. The problem is that these rights differ in character and the way they can be claimed, The right to health care falls under the category of social rights which require the state to provide the necessary health care services, Patients' rights to access to care are sometimes included in administrative regulations and in civil medical contract acts. European legislation and the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Communities played an important role in reinforcing the rights of patients to have access to health care in other member states, The practical consequences of the existing procedures and criteria have also been investigated. The entitlements based on differing legal procedures and criteria between and even within member states has led to confusion and inequality. Cases with different outcomes based on different legal grounds make it apparent that the rights of patients are dependent on several legal and practical factors, The conclusion is that, in the case of cross-border health care, a balance may be struck between the rights and criteria. This balance should create an equilibrium between general legal principles and national and international legislation.

Only one major study has been done in this area. That study was based on data for 1981 and confined to aggregate deaths for males aged between 15 and 64. The objective of this paper is to extend the previous work along a number of important dimensions. Combined deaths data for males for the period 1986-1991 are used, thereby allowing differentials to be estimated with more precision. Mortality differentials for males by cause of death are also explored using this data. Methodological issues associated with trend analysis are highlighted in the paper. There is some discussion on both causal relationships and policy implications arising from analysis of the data. The results confirm international trends in this area: poorer people have higher mortality relative to people in more advantaged circumstances. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Buse, K; Walt, G				Buse, K; Walt, G			An unruly melange? Coordinating external resources to the health sector: A review	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Review						health policy; donor coordination; managing external resources; health sector; international assistance	INTERNATIONAL HEALTH; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; REFORM; AFRICA; DONOR; AID; ASSISTANCE; MANAGEMENT; EQUITY; POLICY	The past two decades have witnessed an upsurge in the number of external agencies involved in the health sectors of developing countries. Concomitantly, there has been an increase in the volume of resources transferred through multilateral, bilateral and non-governmental organizations to these health systems. Notwithstanding the beneficial impact of increased resources, recipients and donors are increasingly concerned about the effects of this trend. This is particularly pertinent where the effort lacks adequate coordination. Recipients despair of an unruly melange of external ideas and initiatives, that too often results in project proliferation and duplication, unrealistic demands, and ultimately a loss of control over the health development process. Donors on the contrary, are concerned about aid efficiency and effectiveness, two areas it is assumed will gain from increased attention to coordination. Both recipients and donors are looking for ways of better managing the aid relationship. Although there has been considerable experience with coordination strategies, most writing has considered external assistance in general, rather than the health sector in particular. The literature is striking in its bias towards the needs and perspectives of the donor community. There has been little analysis of the manner in which recipient ministries of health manage donors and the influx of resources. This review begins to fill this gap. Its focus is country-level, where most direct gains from co-ordination are to be reaped. The paper begins with an enumeration of the many and diverse trends which have raised the salience of aid coordination. A definition of coordination, a term used ambiguously in the existing literature, is then developed and the principles of aid coordination outlined. Finally, attention is directed to the initiatives of recipients and donors to improve the coordination of health sector aid. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The proportion of the elderly (65 years and over), will increase from 5.1% (1950) to 6.8% by the year 2000 and to 8.8% by 2020, when out of an elderly population of 796 million people, 124 million are projected to be 80 years and over. Due to an increasing gender inequality in life expectation, the majority of the elderly will be women. An aged population is a basically new feature in the history of humanity, the implications of which are - as yet - incompletely understood. It is clear, however, that the last years of life are accompanied by an increase in disability and sickness, with very high demands for health and social services. Hence, the soaring elderly population will raise major social, economic and ethical issues worldwide and may strain to the limit the ability of health, social and economic infrastructures of many countries. It may also result in an increasingly large proportion of humanity (the elderly in general and elderly women, in particular) living in absolute poverty. The demographic, health, socioeconomic and ethical dimensions of the problem are discussed with particular emphasis on the situation of elderly women and a plea is made for greatly increased medical and socioeconomic research.

We explore how educational level is related to utilization of GPs, specialists, hospitals, dentists and physiotherapists, taking into account the effects of sex, age and inequalities in health. The study also examines whether these relationships vary according to the unit of analysis: probability (or incidence) of services use versus overall volume of contacts. The data were derived from the Curacao Health Study, a health interview survey among a random sample (N = 2248) of the non-institutionalized population aged 18 and over. The results indicate that there is socioeconomic inequity in the probability of health care utilization in Curacao. People with a higher educational level are more likely to consult a specialist, dentist or physiotherapist, and are also more likely to be hospitalized. This is not only the case when the mediating effects of socioeconomic inequalities in health (need) are taken into account, but also before adjustment for health inequalities. In other words: there appears to be both vertical inequity (i.e. greater needs for services ate not met by greater use) and horizontal inequity (i.e. similar needs for care are not met by similar levels of services use). The observed inequalities in use of specialists and hospitals contrast with findings from international research. The volume of health services use (i.e. the numbers of consultations) appears to be hardly connected with a person's position in the SES hierarchy; only dental services are used more extensively by higher educated individuals.

We tried to overcome these difficulties in a large study that compared inequalities in morbidity and mortality between different countries in western Europe. Methods Data on four indicators of self-reported morbidity by level of education, occupational class, and/or level of income were obtained for 11 countries, and years ranging from 1985 to 1992. Data on total mortality by level of education and/or occupational class were obtained for nine countries for about 1980 to about 1990. We calculated odds ratios or rate ratios to compare a broad lower with a broad upper socioeconomic group. We also calculated an absolute measure for inequalities in mortality, a risk difference, which takes into account differences between countries in average rates of illhealth. Findings Inequalities in health were found in all countries, Odds ratios for morbidity ranged between about 1.5 and 2.5, and rate ratios for mortality between about 1.3 and 1.7. For men's perceived general health, for instance, inequalities by level of education in Norway were larger than in Switzerland or Spain (odds ratios [95% CI]: 2.57 [2.07-3.18], 1.60 [1.30-1.96], 1.65 [1.44-1.88], respectively). For mortality by occupational class, in men aged 30-44, the rate ratio was highest in Finland (1.76 [1.69-1.83]), although there was no large difference in the size of the inequality in those countries with data. For men aged 45-59, for whom France did have data, this country had the largest inequality (1.71 [1.66-1.77]). In the age-group 45-64, the absolute risk difference ranked Finland second after France (9.8% [9.1-10.4], 11.5% [10.7-12.4]), with Sweden and Norway coming out more favourably than on the basis of rate ratios. In a scatter-plot of average rank scores for morbidity versus mortality, Sweden and Norway had larger relative inequalities in health than most other countries for both measures; France fared badly for mortality but was average for morbidity. Interpretation Our results challenge conventional views on the between-country pattern of inequalities in health in western European countries.

J	Evans, RG				Evans, RG			Going for the gold: The redistributive agenda behind market-based health care reform	JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLITICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article							SUPPLIER-INDUCED DEMAND; MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS; UNITED-STATES; COST-CONTAINMENT; EXPENDITURES; REEXAMINATION; COMPETITION; EXPERIENCE; SINGAPORE; LESSONS	Political conflict over the respective roles of the state and the market in health care has a long history. Current interest in market approaches represents the resurgence of ideas and arguments that have been promoted with varying intensity throughout this century. (In practice, advocates have never wanted a truly competitive market, but rather one managed by and for particular private interests.) Yet international experience over the last forty years has demonstrated that greater reliance on the market is associated with inferior system performance-inequity, inefficiency, high cost, and public dissatisfaction. The United States is the leading example. So why is this issue back again? Because market mechanisms yield distributional advantages for particular influential groups. (1) A more costly health care system yields higher prices and incomes for suppliers-physicians, drug companies, and private insurers. (2) Private payment distributes overall system costs according to use (or expected use) of services, costing wealthier and healthier people less than finance from (income-related) taxation. (3) Wealthy and unhealthy people can purchase (real or perceived) better access or quality for themselves, without having to support a similar standard for others. Thus there is, and always has been, a natural alliance of economic interest between service providers and upper-income citizens to support shifting health financing from public to private sources. Analytic arguments for the potential superiority of hypothetical competitive markets are simply one of the rhetorical forms through which this permanent conflict of economic interest is expressed in political debate.

As in other countries, the system becomes pressured by increasing healthcare costs. This paper describes the actual situation in Belgium with special focus on pharmaceutical products and the potential role of pharmacoeconomics in decision making on price and reimbursement. Nearly all people in Belgium are covered by compulsory health insurance. The system is paid for by social security, the patients and the federal and regional authorities. The part of the consumption of pharmaceuticals that is charged to insurance was about 62.1 billion Belgian francs (BeF), i.e. about 50% of the pharmaceutical market in 1994. Price setting in Belgium has been rather low due to the positive reimbursement list, where the price of a new drug is compared to existing drugs in a comparable therapeutic class (so-called reimbursement criteria). The expenditure on pharmaceuticals is increasing faster than global funding for public health. In order to control drug budgets, different cost-containment measures have been or are being taken, i.e. a mix of price, reimbursement and volume controls. These cost-containment measures are not necessarily in accordance with a health economic approach. This paper suggests the scope for better implementation of pharmacoeconomic evaluation, which can lead to more flexible reimbursement systems in specific indications. Therefore, a formal recognition of the role of objective economic evaluations is needed for both hospital and ambulatory care. This process should be proceeded by improving the understanding and robustness of pharmacoeconomic evaluations.

IN FACT, THIS WEALTH OF LITERATURE HAS MADE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR PRACTITIONERS TO DECIPHER THE TRUE NATURE OF YOUTH VIOLENCE AND TO ANALYZE THE RESPONSES. IN ORDER TO ASSIST PRACTITIONERS IN THEIR TASK OF COPING WITH AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT YOUTH, THIS ARTICLE WILL APPLY A TRANSACTIONAL-ECOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK TO THE PROBLEM OF YOUTH VIOLENCE. BY VIEWING THIS TROUBLESOME ISSUE WITHIN A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK, READERS WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM, TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN ROLE IN PREVENTING AND TREATING IT, AND TO EVALUATE CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS.

J	Barrett, B				Barrett, B			Identity, ideology and inequality: Methodologies in medical anthropology, Guatemala 1950-1995	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Guatemala; anthropology; methodology; ideology; identity; ethics	HEALTH; COMMUNITY; BEHAVIOR; CHILDREN; POLICY	This paper sketches the history of medical anthropology in Guatemala, focusing on how investigations carried out during the 1950s served as methodological and ideological foundations for subsequent work. Problematic examples from the literature and from the author's experience are used to provide insight into the nature of the anthropologist's role in applied research and development. For example, medical anthropologists are often hired to help navigate the gulf between the ideological identities of indigenous peoples and those of biomedical researchers and international development specialists. Instead of recognizing the inherently ethical nature of this work and acting accordingly, many anthropologists have adopted a detached, ''scientific'' and impossibly value-free perspective. This paper proposes a transformation of this role into one that (1) maintains an independent and critical relationship to mainstream science, (2) elaborates and advocates the indigenous agenda, and (3) adopts an explicitly value-filled ideology, methodology and theoretical framework.

Health interview survey data were used to construct concentration curves of self-assessed health, measured as a latent variable. Inequalities in health favoured the higher income groups and were statistically significant in all countries. Inequalities were particularly high in the United States and the United Kingdom. Amongst other European countries, Sweden, Finland and the former East Germany had the lowest inequality. Across countries, a strong association was found between inequalities in health and inequalities in income. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

It also provides some indication of the 'effectiveness' of these strategies in terms of income generation, and analyses their potential impact on the functioning of the health care system. It is based on semi-structured interviews of 21 doctors working in the public health sector in sub-Saharan Africa and attending in 1995 an international Master's course in Public Health in Belgium or in Portugal. This small sample of physicians yielded reports about 28 different types of individual strategies. Most of these potentially affect hearth service delivery more through reduced availability of staff than through the more blatant misappropriations. Activities related to the health field are mentioned most often. Allowances and per diems seem to be top regarding frequency and effectiveness, followed by secondary jobs, private practice or gifts from patients. None of the interviewees, however, admits using public resources for private purposes. Side activities may bring in very considerable amounts of income, out of proportion to the official salary, and can also be very time consuming. Nevertheless, all interviewees identify themselves in the first place as civil servants. Individual coping strategies may lead to undesirable side-effects for health care delivery, through a net transfer of resources (qualified personnel-time and material resources) from the public to the private-for-profit sector. There may also be positive effects though, be it in terms of mobilization of additional resources, of stabilization of qualified personnel or of realization of professional goals. However, these emerging strategies call for innovative mechanisms, likely to shape coping strategies in such a way that they remain compatible with equity and quality of care to the population.

Attention is then turned to mathematical programming models ranging from fairly simple deterministic linear programs to quite sophisticated stochastic models which have appeared in the literature dealing with these topics, This is followed by extensions reflecting some of the work we have undertaken in association with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, a regulatory agency in Texas, Application and potential use of models is the central theme of this survey, Issues for future research are presented at the end and an extensive list of publications is provided in the references at the end of the article. Principal air quality issues of local, national, and international concern are listed below in increasing order of difficulty based on the number of different types of pollutants and problems in quantification of the risks the pollutants pose: 1. Stratospheric ozone depletion: one relatively easily controllable class of trace gases - ozone depleting chemicals, or ODCs, principally chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) - with relatively well quantified risks; 2. Criteria pollutants: six common pollutants - ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), and particulate matter less than 10 microns in size (PM10) - regulated since 1970 in the U.S. and presenting relatively well quantified risks; 3. Acid precipitation: two relatively easily controllable classes of trace gases - oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) with relatively well quantified risks; 4. Global warming/climate change: a few difficult to control trace gases - principally carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and CFCs - with highly uncertain risks; 5. Toxics or HAPs (hazardous air pollutants): hundreds of types of gaseous chemicals and particles with uncertain risks; 6. Somewhat dated, but nevertheless useful, is the following reference: Glossary on Air Pollution (Copenhagen, World Health Organization, 1980).

J	Russell, S; Gilson, L				Russell, S; Gilson, L			User fee policies to promote health service access for the poor: A wolf in sheep's clothing?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							CHARGES; CARE	An international survey of health service user fee and exemption policies in 26 low- and middle-income countries assessed whether user fee policies were supported by measures that protect the poor. In particular, it explored whether governments were introducing a package of supportive measures to promote service improvements that benefit disadvantaged groups and tackle differential ability to pay through an effective series of exemptions. The results show that many countries lack policies that promote access for disadvantaged groups within user fee systems and quality improvements such as revenue retention at the health care facility and expenditure guidelines for local managers. More significant policy failures were identified for exemptions: 27 percent of countries had no policy to exempt the poor; in contrast, health workers were exempted in 50 percent of countries. Even when an official policy to exempt the poor existed, there were numerous informational, administrative, economic, and political constraints to effective implementation of these exemptions. The authors argue that user fee policy should be developed more cautiously and in a more informed environment. Fees are likely to exacerbate existing inequities in health care financing unless exemptions policy can effectively reach those unable to pay.

Because the health budgets of many low income countries are highly aid dependent, donors are strongly placed to make aid conditional on health care reforms. However, given the growing number and heterogeneity of multilateral, bilateral and international non-governmental donors operating in many of these countries, there is concern that if external efforts are not coordinated, the aims of health care reform-namely improving efficiency, effectiveness and equity-will not be met. Evidence is mounting that without effective coordination arrangements, donors may weaken rather than improve fragile health systems, undermining attempts to reform those systems. This paper traces the factors fuelling current interest in coordination, in particular with reference to its contribution to the goals of health sector reform. Aid coordination is defined and its principles elaborated. A framework is developed by which to assess the variety of coordination mechanisms which are evolving at the country level. In light of this framework, a case is made for greater and more critical analysis of aid coordination arrangements. The paper concludes that if health sector reform is to be successful in low income countries, current enthusiasm for coordination needs to be harnessed. The framework offered here provides away of assessing the variety of coordination mechanisms currently proliferating, which could be used to enhance health sector reform.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						psychogeriatric; community teams; outcomes; dementia	ELDERLY PEOPLE; CARE	Objective: To monitor key processes and outcomes in joint health and social services community psychogeriatric teams. Design: Six month follow-up of new referrals to 4 teams in Cambridge. Data collected from structured clinical assessment forms at baseline and interviews with keyworkers at follow-up. Data for groups with and without dementia were compared. Setting: Two rural and two urban teams in area with relatively large long stay inpatient facility but low independent sector provision. All were routine service teams, rather than run for research purposes. Main outcome measures: The main outcome measures were survival, institutionalisation, key worker assessments of avoidable admissions, appropriateness of placement, unmet needs, carer stress and global outcome for patient and carers. Results: Rates of referral to urban teams were double rural rates. Around forty percent of the dementia group had a social worker as assessor and keyworker. The dementia group was significantly more dependent and received more informal and formal care. After six months, only 54% of the dementia group were alive and living outside institutional care, compared to 79% in the functionally ill group. Unplanned admissions to hospitals or homes were rarely judged avoidable by keyworkers. Outcomes for carers were judged poor in 15% of both groups, and 13% and 11% of carers respectively were judged to be under severe stress. Unmet needs were more common in the dementia group, and related principally to residential care and carer respite. A number of measures, including evidence of geographical inequity and identification of unmet needs, provided an important contribution to local policy development. Further work is needed on the validity of keyworker assessments of carer stress, given the findings of the carer interview sub-study.

The process of responding to an EC research call, preparing a proposal and negotiating a contract are explored with areas of general applicability being highlighted. The case study is drawn from the Avicenne Initiative in the area of health systems research. The difficulties and inequality of access to information, administrative research support and resourcing are explored as both issues for individuals and institutions and also as part of the difficulties of developing south-north or east-west research partnerships. The backstage of research is explored in order to highlight issues of discourse, practice and procedure which, if tackled, could provide a more level playing field for researchers from a wide range of institutions and countries.

Yet such inequalities have powerfully sculpted not only the distribution of infectious diseases, but also the course of disease in those affected. Outbreaks of Ebola, AIDS, and tuberculosis suggest that models of disease emergence need to be dynamic, systemic, and critical. Such models-which strive to incorporate change and complexity, and are global yet alive to local variation-are critical of facile claims of causality, particularly those that scant the pathogenic roles of social inequalities. Critical perspectives on emerging infections ask how large-scale social forces influence unequally positioned individuals in increasingly interconnected populations; a critical epistemology of emerging infectious diseases asks what features of disease emergence are obscured by dominant analytic frameworks, Research questions stemming from such a reexamination of disease emergence would demand close collaboration between basic scientists, clinicians, and the social scientists and epidemiologists who adopt such perspectives.

It also describes the health problems from which low-income groups in urban areas suffer more than richer groups including those that are not linked to poor sanitary conditions and those that are more linked to relative poverty (and thus the level of inequality) than to absolute poverty.

J	Chen, LC; Wittgenstein, F; McKeon, E				Chen, LC; Wittgenstein, F; McKeon, E			The upsurge of mortality in Russia: Causes and policy implications	POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW			English	Article							HEALTH; COUNTRIES	This note summarizes conclusions reached at a recent international conference that considered the causes and policy implications of the upsurge of mortality in Russia following the collapse of the communist regime in 1989. The mortality crisis is genuine, not a case of ''Glasnost in statistics.'' There is Little evidence to support the popular perception that the crisis is due to environmental deterioration or the collapse of medical services. These problems are real but they do not account for the rise in mortality. Rather, the crisis is the manifestation of economic, social, and political pathologies in Russian society. The responsible causes are probably a combination of historical and contemporary forces: catch-up effects from previous lifestyle risks and deferred deaths from the successful anti-alcohol campaign in the late 1980s; and current turmoil characterized by economic impoverishment, widening social inequality, and the breakdown of political institutions. Russia does not and did not conform to the standard model of ''health transition'' distilled from Western experience.

J	Wilkin, P				Wilkin, P			New myths for the South: Globalisation and the conflict between private power and freedom	THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY			English	Article								The overall argument of this article is reasonably straightforward. My concern is with the way in which the broad changes in the global economy that have taken place since the decline of the Bretton Woods system in the late 1960s and early 1970s have helped to generate a range of what I would call 'new myths' about the world-system. The most important of these is the way in which freedom and its possibilities have become synonymous with the transcendence and extension of a particular conception of private power. The reach of these ideas, underpinned as they are by important structural changes in the global economy, represents one aspect of the qualitative transformation in the power of a capitalist world-system to produce, reproduce and transform itself over time and space.(2) As has frequently been observed in the literature on globalisation, the compression of global time and space that has been facilitated by technological developments in the postwar period has intensified the transmission of diverse ideas, practices and forms of social, economic and political organisation.(3) Nonetheless, we need to be clear here that this does not mean that there is any simple or linear relationship between the transmission of these ideas and practices and either how they are received or whether they are even seen as legitimate by the world's population. As we will see later, it is reasonably clear that they do not have anything like universal legitimacy. My claim, then, is that these are real mechanisms and structures that reflect the power of prevailing social forces in the capitalist world-system that have developed in the past 25 years. The revival of liberal conceptions of freedom has coincided with the restructuring of the global economy that has taken place since the mid-1970s and has led to a widening of inequality across a whole range of indices, from wealth and income to mortality and morbidity ratios.(4) This fact raises an initial contradiction for the new mythology of private power and freedom as this deepening inequality excludes those without the necessary social, economic and political power from either control over or consumption of the very products that capitalism is able to generate.(5) My main contention is that this restructuring of the world-economy and its attendant ideological entrenchment have served to bring about two substantive changes in the world-system First, it has reinforced and sought to legitimise the diverse forms of exploitation and inequality in the world-system, the aforementioned inequalities of health, income, wealth and mortality, and so on. These inequalities, in turn, reflect the inequalities of social power felt by conflicting social forces and are essentially concerned with questions of class relations.(6) Second, if we are to understand the social forces that have helped to generate these changes then we need to recognise that prevailing ideas as to what we mean by the terms 'North' and 'South' must be seriously revised. By this I mean that the types of objective indices by which we attempt to measure inequality in its diverse social, political and economic forms have become increasingly synonymous with parts of what has conventionally been described as the North as well as the South.(7) Conversely, specific parts of the South have become significantly wealthy and powerful and seem set to increase this power in the years ahead.(8) If we map these inequalities globally, as well as nationally, we find that there are substantive grounds for redefining our understanding of North-South in the world-system.(9) Most crucial here, I would argue, is that these transformations reflect the ongoing production and realignment of class relations in the world-system, as transnational capitalist institutions, actors and social and economic structures help to intensify the speed and dynamism of what is already a world-system. Having established the boundaries of this article's concern with globalisation, we can briefly set out what I take to be its general dynamic and its broad implications for the world-system, before turning to the powerful claims and contradictions of liberal conceptions of freedom and private power.

J	Schulpen, TWJ				Schulpen, TWJ			Migration and child health: The Dutch experience	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS			English	Article						migrant children; child health; social paediatrics; intercultural aspects; tropical medicine		Nearly one million of the fifteen million inhabitants of the Netherlands are directly descending from migrant parents, Of these inhabitants, 75% come from former colonies (Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles) and Mediterranean countries like Turkey and Morocco. The mortality rate of Turkish and Moroccan children under 15 years of age is two to three times higher compared to Dutch children. Main causes are perinatal death (including congenital malformations), accidents and drowning, infectious diseases and death during holidays in the country of origin. Inequalities in health between the migrant and Dutch children are demonstrated in several surveys conducted at both national and local levels. Apart from socio-economic differences, this can be attributed to three main causes; different pathology due to imported infectious diseases or inherited disorders, different life style and sociocultural factors. The cumulative factor explains the differences in health, comparable with several other countries in Europe where migrants from Mediterranean countries and former colonies live. Conclusion Migration has an increasing impact on the daily practice of Dutch paediatricians as well as elsewhere in Europe. Inclusion of intercultural and international aspects of health in the curriculum of the medical paediatric education is paramount.

J	Kennedy, BP; Kawachi, I; ProthrowStith, D				Kennedy, BP; Kawachi, I; ProthrowStith, D			Income distribution and mortality: Cross sectional ecological study of the Robin Hood index in the United States	BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; MEDICAL INTERVENTION; HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; INEQUALITY	Objective-To determine the effect of income inequality as measured by the Robin Hood index and the Gini coefficient on all cause and cause specific mortality in the United States. Design-Cross sectional ecological study. Setting-Households in the United States. Main outcome measures-Disease specific mortality, income, household size, poverty, and smoking rates for each state. Results-The Robin Hood index was positively correlated with total mortality adjusted for age (r = 0 . 54; P < 0 . 05). This association remained after adjustment for poverty (P < 0 . 007), where each percentage increase in the index was associated with an increase in the total mortality of 21 . 68 deaths per 100000. Effects of the index were also found for infant mortality (P = 0 . 013); coronary heart disease (P = 0 . 004); malignant neoplasms (P = 0 . 023); and homicide (P < 0 . 001). Strong associations were also found between the index and causes of death amenable to medical intervention. The Gini coefficient showed very little correlation with any of the causes of death. Conclusion-Variations between states in the inequality of income were associated with increased mortality from several causes. The size of the gap between the wealthy and less well off-as distinct from the absolute standard of living enjoyed by the poor-seems to matter in its own right. The findings suggest that policies that deal with the growing inequities in income distribution may have an important impact on the health of the population.

J	McPake, BI				McPake, BI			Public autonomous hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa: Trends and issues	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						hospitals; autonomy; Africa; health sector reform; policy		Since the late 1980s, many countries in Africa have been granting increased autonomy to their main teaching hospitals. This policy has significant international support but has been evaluated little from either theoretical or empirical perspectives. This paper attempts to fill this gap by assembling evidence from policy documents, theoretical debates and empirical evidence of related policy changes in other contexts such as the development of trust hospitals in the UK NHS. The paper attempts to locate the policy in the broader context of the package of health sector reform measures proposed at international level, and to identify the role it is intended to play in the achievement of the implicit objectives of that package. The objectives identified are improvements in allocative efficiency and equity, improvements in internal efficiency and improvements in responsiveness. accountability and choice. Each of these objectives presents difficulties which suggest that only modest short-term expectations of the policy can be justified. Given the lack of evidence from existing experience, a research agenda is suggested, which aims;to provide information to guide further implementation of the policy.

Participants ranged in age from forty to fifty years. Results suggested that while the number of family roles and social activities are the same for men and women, women perceive a greater availability of social support and report they give more than they take in relationships with family. There was no association found between the perceived availability of social support and global indices of equality of interpersonal relationships; suggesting an independence between these two psychological aspects of social support. Further, multiple regression correlational analyses indicated gender, level of social activity, and self-esteem as significant predictors of perceived social support; with self-esteem being the best single predictor. Relatedly, gender and number of children were found to be significant predictors of the perceived equality of relationships with family. These findings suggest differences in mid-life men and women's psychological perception of the availability of social support, and the give and take of relationships with family.

The human health risks, environmental impacts, and sociopolitical issues potentially associated with these alternatives were assessed in an international context. For each alternative, the health risks from workplace and transportation accidents are greater in magnitude than the risks from potential exposure to radioactive materials or chemicals. The nonradiological risks are at least twice as high for disposal and replacement as they are for recycling, with the result that recycling has lower health risks overall. Environmental impacts from disposal and replacement of scrap metals are likely to be orders of magnitude higher than those for recycling. This is true of effects on land, water, and air quality, as well as for mineral and energy resources. In addition to risks and costs, issues affecting the choice between radioactive scrap metal management alternatives include low-level waste disposal site availability, public acceptability of recycling, potential impacts on metal markets, impacts of radioactivity on sensitive industrial uses of metal, and international equity issues.

The Nordic countries have important common denominators with respect to political structure, education, religion, languages, cultural traditions and attitudes towards human values. A comprehensive national health service exists in all Nordic countries and there are important common legal foundations with great similarities between countries. However, in areas related to biotechnology there are considerable legal differences, but these differences do not necessarily reflect differences in underlying principles. Important ethical principles relevant to genetic testing that are shared by the Nordic countries include the concept of social justice with great stress on equality of treatment, the right to autonomy, the right to full disclosure of test results, strict confidentiality with respect to test results, the requirement that participation in testing programs must always be voluntary and based on information, and a responsible balance between risks or inconveniences on one hand and benefits on the other.

Five facets of the problem are examined. The nature and scope of the international pesticide flow is first examined. Political-economic forces characterizing relations between (and within) DCs and LDCs that have increased the pesticide flow to the LDCs are discussed. The extent to which this stream has contributed to health, environmental, and other risks in LDCs is discussed. Major policies that have been proposed and enacted as solutions to the problem are critically reviewed. The article concludes with the argument that the adoption of sustainable techniques of pest control is the best means for dealing with the problem.

But the World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health shows that these monies could be spent much more wisely, in the process doing a great deal to help the world's 1 billion poor. Essential national public health and clinical packages are proposed based on assessment of the burden of disease (measured in disability adjusted life years) and the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Governments can play a central role in improving the health of their citizens: they can foster an environment that enables households to improve health and they can also improve their own spending on health, targeting it to support universal access to essential national public health and clinical packages based on the above methods. This is a good example of the concept of needs-based technology assessment, combining the disciplines of epidemiology, economics, and policy formulation. When applied, it should lead to improved effectiveness, efficiency, and equity.

J	LAIRSON, DR; HINDSON, P; HAUQUITZ, A				LAIRSON, DR; HINDSON, P; HAUQUITZ, A			EQUITY OF HEALTH-CARE IN AUSTRALIA	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						EQUITY; HEALTH CARE FINANCE; HEALTH CARE DELIVERY	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; DELIVERY	This paper examines the equity characteristics of health care financing and delivery in Australia and compares its performance with recent findings on systems in Europe and the United States. Vertical equity of finance is evaluated with income and payment concentration indices derived from published survey data on taxes and expenditure by income decile. Horizontal equity of health care delivery is assessed with standardized expenditure concentration coefficients for three measures of health status and four types of health services, derived from household survey data on health care utilization, health status, income and demographics. Health cover is available to the entire population. Results show the financing system is slightly progressive despite the fact that 30% of payment comes from private sources, which are regressive. The equity index compares favorably to many European countries and is much better than the U.S. which has a regressive financing system. The Australian system fares less well in terms of equity of health care delivery. Several features favor privately insured higher income persons in use of health care and this is reflected, for some health status measures and types of service, in inequity favoring the better off. This contrasts with inequity favoring the less well off in many European countries and the U.S. This analysis provides a benchmark for monitoring the equity of the Australian system and provides information on the equity of a mixed private and public financing system that covers the entire population. This is relevant to the U.S. which is moving in this direction by extending private cover to the uninsured and to European countries that are increasing private sector involvement in health care financing.

Method: Notes from the conference were summarized and supplemented by a computer search of relevant literature. Drafts were circulated for comment to national and international experts, some of whom joined as coauthors. Results: Issues addressed include possible overprotection by policy makers and institutional review boards arising out of the recognition of children's special vulnerability without equal recognition of their need for research; the definition of minimal risk, which has often been equated with no risk in the case of children; assessment of the risk-benefit ratio; procedures for minimization of risk, such as improved technology, ''piggybacking'' onto clinical tests, and age-appropriate preparation; the difficulty of justifying risk for normal controls; age-graded consent; special considerations about neuroimaging; ''coercive'' inducement, both material and psychological; disposition of unexpected or unwanted knowledge about individuals, including the subject's right not to know and parent's right not to tell; and socioeconomic status and cultural/ethnic equity. Conclusions: The working group adopted a position of advocacy for children's right to research access while recognizing that this advocacy must be tempered by thoughtful protections for child and adolescent subjects.

J	HOUTEPEN, R				HOUTEPEN, R			THE MEANING OF OLD-AGE AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF HEALTH-CARE RESOURCES	AGEING & SOCIETY			English	Article						DISTRIBUTION OF CARE RESOURCES; MEANING OF OLD AGE; POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY; ETHICS; COMMUNITARIANISM; LIBERALISM	LIBERALISM	Daniel Callahan has maintained that a common understanding of the meaning of old age and the proper role of old people in society is a prerequisite for decisions on the distribution of health-care resources to the elderly. The call for such a common understanding is traced to the writings of Thomas Cole and Harry Moody. A discussion of their ideas is followed by a philosophical analysis of communitarian accounts of meaning and the good life in general. It is concluded that viable interpretations of the meaning of old age should comply with the values of liberal individualism. Meaning should be localised less at the level of global ideas and images and more at the level of local and heterogeneous practices. The practice of distributing health-care resources cannot and should not be regulated by communitarian interpretations of the value of old age. It would seem to be sufficiently infused by liberal individualist interpretations of meaning and justice.

J	STEPHENS, C				STEPHENS, C			THE URBAN-ENVIRONMENT, POVERTY AND HEALTH IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Review							SANITATION; CHILDREN; GROWTH	The process of urbanization could be described as one of the major global environmental changes directly affecting human health today. Populations particularly affected are in developing countries where rapid urban growth has been accompanied by massive urban poverty. Urban environmental health impacts, particularly the impact on adults of an environment of poverty, are still poorly understood. Definitions of the urban environment tend to be physical, excluding the complex ramifications of a social setting of disadvantage. This paper provides a brief overview of existing knowledge on the links between environment, poverty and health in urban areas of developing countries, with an emphasis on the policy implications implied by research on health differential between groups within cities. The paper argues that urban poverty and inequalities in conditions between groups within cities present a central crisis confronting urban policy in terms of human health and quality of life. The paper suggests that definitions of the urban environment tend to consider only the physical, and not the social complexity of the urban setting. The review concludes that the scale and the complexity of the urban crisis in developing countries demands a real commitment to re-thinking the management of cities to address multiple deprivation. The paper suggests that this challenges urban professionals who continue to act with a bias towards unintegrated single sector solutions despite claims to the contrary.

Included among the issues are not only concerns about safety for workers, but also for their progeny. Equality among the sexes is also assuming a prominent position. In several countries, existing and proposed legislation already considers these matters. In the course of this article it is argued that this legislation and its implementation are inadequate. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, what constitutes health risks for workers exposed to chemical substances is subject to different interpretations. This is further complicated when one includes risks to reproductive function and to the progeny: the reproductive risks of toxicity. The different interpretations of the concepts of safety and equality are also discussed. There are differences in regulations and in standards about whether or not safety factors should be used when knowledge is uncertain. The operation of reasonable measures with a generic or sex specific policy also differs. Secondly, the current occupational exposure limits are set too high. These aspects are considered and it is probable that the policy aims should be made more specific. An elaborated approach that includes the ''precautionary principle'' in safety standards is proposed. To advise employers in their role as managers of reproductive risks of toxicity, a recently developed system for occupational health and safety services is described. This system is based on two criteria: effectiveness and reasonableness of proposed measures. The effectiveness criterion includes the precautionary principle; the reasonableness criterion includes equal rights and opportunities for men and women. Finally, a supportive governmental policy that is consistent with the most international developments is recommended.

J	HAMMER, JS; BERMAN, P				HAMMER, JS; BERMAN, P			ENDS AND MEANS IN PUBLIC-HEALTH POLICY IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY; HEALTH STATUS; EQUITY; UTILITY	CARE	International discussions of public health policy strategies in developing countries have been characterized by strong and conflicting positions. Differences regarding the means of health sector improvement can often be traced to differences about the ends, that is, the goals of the health sector. Three types of health sector goals are reviewed: health status improvement, equity and poverty alleviation, and individual welfare (utility) improvement. The paper argues that all three must be considered in developing health sector reform strategies in all countries. Highly normative policy positions often can be attributed a unidimensional affiliation with one health sector goal and denial of the relevance of the others. The current global interest in using cost-effectiveness analysis to set national health priorities is assessed in light of this eclectic approach. Examples are provided of how a health sector strategy based on cost-effectiveness would give sub-optimal solutions. These examples include situations where a private health care sector exists and provides some degree of substitution for publicly provided services; significantly high income elasticities exist for health care such that higher income beneficiaries may differentially capture public subsidies; and market failures exist in insurance. It is argued that these conditions are virtually universal in developing countries. Thus, rational policy development should explicitly consider multiple goals for the health sector.

Design - Cross sectional data on the association between educational level and several health indicators were obtained from national health interview surveys. This association was quantified by means of an inequality index based on logistic regression analysis. Setting - The national, non-institutionalised populations of the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, the United States, and Canada were studied. The age group was 15-64 years, and the study period was 1983-90. Participants - Representative population samples with the number of respondents ranging from approximately 6000 (Denmark) to 90 000 (the United States) were studied. Main results - For men, the smallest health inequalities were observed for the United Kingdom and Sweden, and the largest inequalities for Italy and the United States. Other countries held an intermediate position. The same international pattern was observed for women, except that relatively small inequalities were also observed for Dutch women. Conclusions - The results agree to a large extent with those of previous comparative studies. The international pattern observed here may be partly related to ''subjective'' aspects of self reported health, such as the propensity to complain and illness behaviour. The results challenge the view that disease and disability are distributed less equally in the UK than in countries Like Sweden.

J	TORKINGTON, NPK				TORKINGTON, NPK			BLACK MIGRANT WOMEN AND HEALTH	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article								This article, which focuses on the health of Black migrant women in Europe, argues that health issues cannot be analysed in a vacuum without the interconnections among health, environmental/social factors, and daily life experiences, rooted in the wider social, political, and economic structures of Europe, within which exist the inequalities which determine the health status of individuals. For Black migrant women, their present health status and the ways in which they are treated within the health service is structured primarily by the historical global inequalities embodied in slavery, colonialism, and imperialism. The legacy from these phenomena which Black women brought with them to Europe ensures their vulnerability to poverty, which is at the core of ill health. It also ensures that they receive poor service from health professionals who are influenced by a variety of stereotypes in the portrayal of Black women. The article ends with a plea for Black women in Europe to seek each other out and work together against their oppression. In that fight they must forge links with all women so that we can free ourselves from the clutches of racism, capitalism, and patriarchy.

Critiques of the biological concept of race have led many anthropologists to adopt a ''no-race'' posture and an approach to intergroup difference highlighting ethnicity-based principles of classification and organization. Often, however, the singular focus on ethnicity has left unaddressed the persistence of racism and its invidious impact on local communities, nation-states, and the global system. Within the past decade, anthropologists have revitalized their interest in the complex and often covert structures and dynamics of racial inequality. Recent studies shed light on race's heightened volatility on contemporary sociocultural landscapes, the racialization of ethno-nationalist conflicts, anthropology's multiple traditions of antiracism, and intranational as well as international variations in racial constructions, including the conventionally neglected configurations of whiteness.

J	NUTBEAM, D; HARRIS, E				NUTBEAM, D; HARRIS, E			CREATING SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS FOR HEALTH - A CASE-STUDY FROM AUSTRALIA IN DEVELOPING NATIONAL GOALS AND TARGETS FOR HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						HEALTH PROMOTION; RE-ORIENTING HEALTH SERVICES; SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS		Creating healthy living and working conditions are central goals in public health which have re-emerged in prominence in the past decade. The roots of this revival of interest can be traced to include improved understanding of the relationship between living conditions and health, prompting by the World Health Organization (WHO) through its 'Health for All' strategy which has drawn attention to underlying causes of inequities in health in society, and a more general international concern with ecologically sustainable development. Australia has responded uniquely to the challenge of developing a strategy to create sustainable, supportive environments for health through its National Health Goals and Targets. These targets, published in 1993, include a range of targets for Healthy Environments which were developed from a 'health' perspective, but in co-operation with the different sectors of government responsible for action to achieve them. These include housing, transportation, education and employment. Early responses to the publication of the targets are encouraging, but will require sustained governmental support to reach fruition. Critical to success in developing and implementing the targets will be recognition by government, and particularly the health sector, of the legitimacy of inter-sectoral action for health. Negotiations to resolve potential conflicts in the priorities of different sectors should ensure that attention is focused on the common ground for practical inter-sectoral action to improve health. The Australian Targets Report identifies a series of concrete actions required to create supportive environments for health. A willingness to account for progress in achieving the targets for Healthy Environments' will be an important measure of the commitment of the Australian federal and state governments to the health and well-being of their citizens.

J	BAUM, F; SANDERS, D				BAUM, F; SANDERS, D			CAN HEALTH PROMOTION AND PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE ACHIEVE HEALTH FOR ALL WITHOUT A RETURN TO THEIR MORE RADICAL AGENDA	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						HEALTH FOR ALL; HEALTH PROMOTION; PRIMARY HEALTH CARE	AIDS	Primary health care (PHC) and health promotion (HP), codified in the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978 and the Ottawa Charter of 1986, and aiming to achieve Health for All by the year 2000 (HFA 2000), are strikingly similar in their conception and evolution. Originally conceived as global strategies to reduce inequities in health between and within nations and emphasising intersectoral and community action, both have tended to be reduced to a more limited and technical approach to selected diseases within natiom In the implementation of these strategies, four trends threatening the achievement of HFA 2000 are analysed. Managerialism, manifesting in a goals and targets approach to health promotion has come to dominate and constrict its implementation in Australia and other industrialised countries, detracting from social and environmental imperatives and community action in addressing these. The increasing dominance of market economics and the promotion of economic growth at all costs is reinforcing inequities in health experience globally and within countries. Individualism, the philosophical accompaniment of market economics, has reinforced a behavioural and lifestyle focus and undermined a collective approach to HP and PHC. Environmental degradation, a growing global threat to public health and ultimately amenable only to global economic restructuring has been perilously ignored in the managerialist implementation of HFA. The elements of an agenda for action are identified with some suggested broader goals. A return to the original more radical philosophy underpinning the strategies of PHC and HP, it is argued, is fundamental to the achievement of HFA, even if this is no longer possible by the year 2000.

To provide incentives for efficiency, the US Federal Government has sought objective measures of inpatients' need for resources. In the UK National Health Service, resources are allocated for acute hospital services as part of a global budget to purchasers, who then contract with hospitals. To provide equity in resource allocation, the Department of Health in England, has sought objective measures of populations' need for resources. Methods. Examination of policy and technology that has used variations in utilization of resources to derive objective measures of efficiency and equity. Results. The technology of developing empirical measures of resources needed by patients has lacked information on outcomes, which is vital for measures of efficiency. The technology of developing empirical measures of resources needed by populations has relied on aggregate data. Analyses of specific procedures and conditions consistently find that these variations are explained by differences in medical practice and not by need. Conclusions. There is scope for multidisciplinary research to explain small area variations for specific procedures and conditions in resources used by populations. It seems unlikely, however, that governments will be interested in findings from this research.

J	DSOUZA, MF				DSOUZA, MF			THE MULTIFUND AND OUTCOME RESEARCH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article								The UK health reforms, among other things, have allowed some family practitioners ('fundholders') to control part of the budget used to purchase secondary care for the patients registered with their practices. Some feared that this change in organization might threaten the equity of the National Health Service (NHS) by giving advantages to the patients of fundholding general practitioners (GPs). This has led to the formation of the first large GP 'Multifund' in the UK. Whilst the first small fundholding co-operatives were conceived simply as a way of improving the business efficiency of ordinary fundholding, the much larger Kingston and Richmond (KandR) Multifund is a professional co-operative of fundholding family practitioners who share a common management allowance, which controls pound 32.6 million per annum, about 20% of the public funds devoted to health care in its locality, and has a broader agenda. It sets out to end any two-tier system discriminating between the patients of fundholding and other practitioners within a locality by making it possible for all GPs to become fundholders within an open, democratic doctors' co-operative. Its declared aims are to maintain equity and clinical integrity, to plan health care and to undertake scientific evaluation. Its overall goal is to preserve and improve upon the economic and ethical success of the British NHS. A brief evaluation is included which suggests that Multifund members believe their organization is currently meeting most of these aims. The essay argues for GP-led Multifund systems centred on outcome evidence. A new generalized global tool for measuring outcome, is being developed to assist in this process and it is briefly described here and is designed to facilitate: (1) the selection of cost-effective interventions, (2) the negotiation of appropriate funding from government and (3) the demonstration of ethical behaviour in rationing health provision within a limited budget. It is envisaged that the Multifund's scope will be extended, to administer the majority of the funds available for health care, by involving all local primary health providers and becoming a 'careholding' consortium. This would mean obtaining local accountability through new community health forums and improving mutual trust through public professional affirmations. If all this is successful multifunding could become a community-centred model for the management of health service money which may in turn have international application.

Measures of social support for this sample were uniformly low. Scores on the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory showed that 64 percent of the women were in the clinical range for mental health problems. Scores obtained from the Short Drug Abuse Screening Test indicated that 83 percent of the women were in the substance abuse range. When child and adult sexual abuse were combined, 81 percent of the women had been sexually victimized at some time in their lives. The data point to the need for improved programs and conditions within penal settings and for intermediate sanctions for nonviolent female offenders. Such sanctions could include both correctional day treatment and community-based correctional living sites.

Two parallel transformations in the understanding of rape have been central to the international effort to achieve this declaration. The first is increased recognition of the extent to which rape typically involves intimates. The second is the shift from regarding rape as a criminal justice matter towards an appreciation of its implications for women's health. The focus of this paper is the health burden of rape, which is addressed from the global perspective and includes discussion of its prevalence and psychological, sociocultural, somatic, and reproductive health consequences. Quantitative efforts to capture the relative economic impact of rape compared to other threats to women's health are also discussed. The paper concludes with an agenda for future research on rape that could enrich activists' efforts on behalf of women's health and development.

Facilities for caring for very old or disabled people differ throughout Europe in scope and means of funding, and the countries of the European Union are far from equity in the status of pensioners. Health expectations have increased in older people-most of the calculated gain in life expectancy is likely to be without disability. Most countries now have specialist geriatric medicine facilities, and international research programmes are under way.

J	CARRHILL, RA				CARRHILL, RA			EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY IMPLICATIONS OF THE HEALTH-CARE REFORMS	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						HEALTH CARE REFORMS; ACCOUNTABILITY AND EQUITY; EFFECTIVENESS; EFFICIENCY AND EVIDENCE		The purpose of the paper is to reflect on the recent health care reforms in both developed and developing countries, in the light of the evidence that has accumulated over the last few years about the efficiency and equity of different fiscal and organisational arrangements. The scene is set by a brief review of the definitions of efficiency and equity and of the confusions that often arise; and of the problems of making assessments in practice with real data. The evidence about effectiveness, efficiency and equity at the macro level are reviewed: among OECD countries, there is little evidence that variations in the levels and composition of health service expenditure actually affect levels of health; equity in financing and delivery appears to mirror equity in other sectors in the same countries; about the only solid-although rather limp-conclusion which is transferable is that costs can be contained best via global budgeting. The range of reforms in the North is sketched: despite calls to give people 'freedom' to opt out, public finances continues to be preferred among OECD countries; and the evidence that health care markets can actually function is 'weak'. Whilst geographical redistribution of finance has proved to be possible, inequalities in health remain in most countries. But the overwhelming impression is that the quality of the data base for many of these studies is appalling, and the analytice techniques used are simplistic. The move to introduce user charges in the South is discussed. It seems unlikely that they will raise a significant fraction of overall revenue; exemptions intended for the poor do not always work; and other trends are likely to exacerbate the patchy coverage of health care systems in the South. The final section reflects on the pressures for increased accountability. The emphasis on consumerism in the North has led to an increasing number of poorly designed 'patient satisfaction' surveys; in the South, there has been an increasing rhetoric on community participation, but little sign of actual devolution of control. The flavour of the decade is 'outcome measurement' which has been promoted feverish but with little rigour. We must also be concerned that this emphasis will, once again, be hijacked by the most articulate.

This paper highlights several issues related to gender and health in the Third World on which information, especially of an empirical nature, is inadequate. These include certain health conditions and diseases for which gender differnces remain largely uncharted, gender inequalities in the development of health and contraceptive technology, the lack of gender-sensitivity in the provision of health services, and gender inequalities in health policies, focusing mainly on structural adjustment. Questions urgently requiring research are identified and suggestions are made for improving the gender sensitivity of health policies and interventions.

To study health and health care during pregnancy for manual workers Design. A prospective population-based study of all women who were registered for antenatal care during 1986 in the catchment areas of three health centers. Setting. Three district antenatal clinics in southern Sweden. Subjects. 409 pregnant women; of whom 403 with singleton pregnancies; of whom 185 were manual workers and 175 were non-manual employees. Main outcome measures. Problems encountered (registered according to the international classification of diseases) and measures taken. Results. The study population resembled all women who gave birth in Sweden during the same year. Both manual workers and non-manual employees registered for antenatal care in early pregnancy (96% and 97%, respectively, before 15 completed weeks). The women in both groups made the same number of visits to the antenatal clinics (median 12 and 13, respectively). There were no differences between the two groups of women as regards the percentage figures for obstetric problems encountered during pregnancy. The manual workers had a higher frequency of diseases of the musculoskeletal system (mainly low-back pain) compared with the non-manual employees (RR=1.89; 95%CI=1.20-2.98), and they were sicklisted more often (RR=1.21; 95%CI=1.01-1.46). On the other hand, their frequency of amniocentesis was lower (RR=0.39; 95%CI=0.19-0.80); the reason for this was that the manual workers were younger than the non-manual employees. Otherwise, there were no differences between the two groups of women as regards the percentage figures, either for non-obstetric problems encountered, or measures taken, or regarding the outcome of pregnancy. Conclusion. In Sweden, both manual and non-manual working women appear to enjoy equal antenatal health and receive equal antenatal care. This conclusion is based on a small study population, meticulously monitored prospectively throughout pregnancy.

The purposes of the study were to assess the potential impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on medical care in Mexico and to identify internal measures Mexico could take to increase the benefits and minimize the risks of free trade. Methods. The dual nature of the health sector is examined; the Mexican, Canadian, and US health care systems are compared; and modes and consequences of international exchange of health services are analyzed. Results. Four issues require immediate attention: accreditation of health care facilities, licensing and certification of professionals, technology assessment, and financial equity. Conclusions. NAFTA offers opportunities for positive developments in Mexico, provided risks can be anticipated and preventive measures can be taken to avoid negative impacts on the health system. Medical services, like other elements of the Mexican economy, must be modernized to respond to the demands of global competition. The Mexican National Academy of Medicine has recommended to the Mexican government (1) internal strengthening of the Mexican health care system to improve its ability to respond to the new conditions created by NAFTA and (2) a gradual process to facilitate equitable and mutually beneficial interactions among the three countries.

The Swedish system is organized into several levels, with the Federation of County Councils at the top, and with regional, county, and local levels. In theory, the four hospital tiers developed by these different levels provide a clear hierarchy for acquisition of sophisticated new technologies. In practice, certain problems have emerged, especially rigidity of the system. Reforms are underway. Sweden was one of the first countries to become involved in the assessment of health care technology. From the beginning, technologies were assessed to determine if they were 'consistent with proven scientific knowledge and good experience'. Sweden has a national program in health care technology assessment (TA), and TA is increasingly visible to policy makers and physicians. Health care TA has been effectively institutionalized in Sweden and has a bright future. The greatest problem in the Swedish context is the large number of unassessed technologies. Because of this, international cooperation is essential.

This study reassesses the international pattern of inequalities in mortality using an inequality index devised recently. Methods, Data on mortality by social class were obtained from longitudinal studies from seven countries. The data referred to men aged 35-64 years. The follow-up period was approximately 1971-1981. The size of mortality differences associated with occupational status was measured using a modification of the Relative Index of inequality. Results, The smallest inequalities in mortality are observed for Norway and Denmark. Larger inequalities are observed for Sweden (compared to Norway circa 1.5 times as large), England and Wales (2 times), Finland (4-5 times) and France (6-8 times). inequalities in a Dutch city, Rotterdam, are as large as in Danish and Swedish cities, and smaller than in Finnish and French cities. Results of sensitivity analyses suggest that probably only a smalt part of this international pattern can be attributed to differences between countries with respect to occupational classification. Conclusions.The results of most previous international comparisons agree with the general pattern observed here. This simultaneous comparison of Various countries shows that the frequently cited difference between Sweden, and England and Wales is small when viewed in a wider international context.

Method: Consecutive primary care patients (N=1,810) were screened by using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, and a stratified random sample (N=373) completed the 28-item General Health Questionnaire and Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Telephone interviews and computerized records were used to examine use of mental health services inside and outside the HMO over the following 3 months. Results: Over 3 months, 6.7% of the screened patients used mental health services within the HMO. Utilization increased with higher General Health Questionnaire score (2.9% among those scoring 0, 22.3% among those scoring 8 or more) and decreased with higher out-of-pocket cost for mental health visits (7.5% for those with no charge, 3.3% for those paying $30/visit). Among the interviewed subjects, 5.1% used mental health services within the HMO (mean=2.92 visits) and 8.9% used outside mental health services (mean=8.86 visits). Use of outside services was more strongly related to sociodemographic factors, and use of inside services was more related to severity of psychological disorder. Conclusions: Among these subjects, use of mental health care was high and services purchased outside the HMO exceeded those inside the HMO. Increasing copayment levels progressively reduced demand without respect to severity of illness. Attempts to control outpatient mental health costs must address equity and clinical need.

This study addresses the question of whether inequalities in premature mortality related to educational level differ among countries. Methods. Data on mortality by educational level were obtained from longitudinal studies from nine industrialized countries. The data referred to men between 35 and 64 years of age. The follow-up periods occurred between 1970 and 1982. The size of mortality differences associated with educational level was measured by means of two inequality indices, both based on Poisson regression analysis. Results. Inequalities in mortality are relatively small in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway and about two times as large in the United States, France, and Italy. Finland and England and Wales occupy intermediate positions. The large inequalities in mortality in the United States and France can be attributed in part to large inequalities in education in these countries. Conclusions. The international pattern found in this study was also observed in a comparison that used occupation as the socioeconomic indicator. Differences between countries in levels of inequality in mortality may be partially explained by the countries' different levels of egalitarian social and economic policies.

There was little evidence of differential care provided to Whites and Asians as reflected in the types of services received. With respect to service effectiveness, few significant ethnic group differences were found in premature termination, early termination, treatment duration, or clinical outcome. These results were found even when the effects of certain demographic and clinical variables (that have tended to covary with ethnicity) were controlled. The notable exception involved Southeast Asian clients who were more likely to terminate early in treatment compared with other Asian groups and received significantly less individual therapy, the most intensive and expensive type of treatment, than White clients. The findings strongly suggest that for most Asian-American groups equitable care and service effectiveness can be achieved through the use of ethnic-specific services. However, even within the parallel configuration, further service modifications and innovations may be needed to better address the mental health needs of Southeast Asian refugee communities.

J	PAULY, MV				PAULY, MV			THE CLINTON PLAN - WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TOUGH CHOICES	HEALTH AFFAIRS			English	Article								This paper points out four difficult choices embedded in the Clinton plan. First, universal coverage is achieved, but with regressive head-tax financing on many workers-since the cost of the employer mandate ultimately will fall on workers' wages. Perhaps such an approach can be made politically acceptable. Second, cost containment is entrusted to global spending limits, which will limit the rate of improvement in quality. Third, the offering of choice among a variety of health plans of different costs and quality, although desirable in itself, may lead to inequity. Finally, the plan's financing will make it difficult for voters to tell what trade-offs they are making, because employer mandates and budget cuts disguise choices.

In the case of OECD (the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) data for 1990, the variation in total expenditure on health among 24 countries can be explained by various factors including Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Among these, the variables representing the level of public sector involvement through social protection or public-private mix within a health care system, such as the Public-to-Total Expenditure Ratio, Coverage Rate and Public Cost Sharing, are significantly negative when factors such as GDP are controlled. This suggests that countries attaining higher equity or accessibility are in a better position to gain higher cost-containment or macro-economic-efficiency. The results of this study may be helpful for developing countries searching for a long-term health care system as well as for developed countries facing health care system reforms.

This article first describes differentials in self-reported limiting longstanding illness and its distribution according to educational level. Age-standardized prevalence rates according to education are examined, and top and bottom prevalence ratios are compared between countries and genders. Secondly, the article attempts to assess the 'global' extent of inequalities in illness. This is made by calculating concentration indices for each country and gender. The description shows large illness differentials according to educational level in each country. A similar socio-economic pattern emerges from all three countries and both genders; i.e. lower socio-economic positions are associated with higher illness levels. This pattern is more distinct for men than for women. The gap in illness between top and bottom educational groups is widest for Norwegian men and smallest for Finnish women. However, top and bottom comparisons overlook other than the extreme groups, and give no information on the sizes of the groups. To avoid these problems concentration indices were calculated to assess the extent of inequalities in illness. According to these indices Norwegian men also show the highest extent of inequality, but differences to Swedish and Finnish men are small. The extent of inequality among women is smaller than among men; among Finnish and Norwegian women it is smaller than among their Swedish counterparts. Measures of inequalities such as the concentration index are useful tools, although complex inequalities cannot be captured by single measures. In the assessment of health inequalities not only relative but also absolute differentials need to be considered. Egalitarian health and welfare policies should pursue simultaneously lower absolute illness levels and smaller relative socio-economic differentials in illness.

J	FRENK, J				FRENK, J			DIMENSIONS OF HEALTH SYSTEM REFORM	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						SYSTEMS; REFORM; INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; HEALTH TRANSITION; PUBLIC PRIVATE MIX	TRANSITION; CARE	During recent years there has been a growth of worldwide interest in health system reform. Countries at all levels of economic development are engaged in a creative search for better ways of organizing and financing health care, while promoting the goals of equity, effectiveness, and efficiency. Together with economic, political, and ideological reasons, this search has been fueled by the need to find answers to the complexities posed by the epidemiologic transition, whereby many nations are facing the simultaneous burdens of old, unresolved problems and new, emerging challenges. In order to better understand reform attempts, it is necessary to develop a clear conception of the object of reform: the health system. This paper presents the health system as a set of relationships among five major groups of actors: the health care providers, the population, the state as a collective mediator, the organizations that generate resources, and the other sectors that produce services with health effects. The relationships among providers, population, and the state form the basis for a typology of health care modalities. The type and number of modalities present in a country make it possible to characterize its health system. In the last part, the paper proposes that health system reform operates at four policy levels: systemic, which deals with the institutional arrangements for regulation, financing, and delivery of services; programmatic, which specifies the priorities of the system, by defining a universal package of health care interventions; organizational, which is concerned with the actual production of services by focusing on issues of quality assurance and technical efficiency; and instrumental, which generates the institutional intelligence for improving system performance through information, research, technological innovation, and human resource development.The dimensions of reform offer a repertoire of policy options, which need to be enriched by cross-national comparison of experiences and rigorous social experimentation. Maybe then reform will be a more systematic effort, and nations will be better able to learn from each other.

J	HICKLINGHUDSON, A				HICKLINGHUDSON, A			THE ENVIRONMENT AS RADICAL POLITICS - CAN THIRD-WORLD EDUCATION RISE TO THE CHALLENGE	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION			English	Article								The pattern of industrial development which has been adopted globally in the last two centuries by both capitalist and socialist economies has caused unprecedented damage to the physical and ecological health of our planet. This paper argues that any challenges to these systems, including educational challenges, will involve political understanding and activism. It examines the potential of educational structures in Third World regions, using the Caribbean as the main example, for implementing eco-political education. This would involve encouraging students to use ecological and social justice criteria for comparing consumerist with sustainable development approaches to rethinking and refashioning the international economy, particularly the Third World share of it. It would involve teachers and students exploring how political and economic structures could be challenged and altered to obtain a fairer quality of life for the majorities now living in poverty and an adjustment of the opulent and wasteful lifestyles of affluent minorities primarily responsible for environmental degradation. Finally, those in eco-political education would work to achieve such goals within broad movements and pressure groups in rich and poor countries.

Comparatively little attention has been given to the role of rail transport in the Third World in the post-colonial era. Following recent World Bank-financed efforts to rehabilitate the railways of many developing countries, this article attempts to provide some fresh analytical insights into rail transport investment in countries whose economies are becoming ever more dependent on international economic institutions. Moroccan Railways (ONCF) are considered as a specific case study. With reference to the structural adjustment programmes of the World Bank and IMF, this article seeks theoretical explanations for the substantial investment that occurred in Moroccan railways during the 1980s. The study shows that state investment in railways. while critical to Morocco's economic growth, has resulted in insufficient resources for social equity issues like health, housing and literacy.

An assessment is made of whether the new UK NHS will result in more efficient and equitable health care provision than the 'old' NHS. Regarding financing of health care, most countries seem to be moving in the direction of NHS or public-insurance-based systems. New Zealand and The Netherlands are among the few countries attempting to inject competition into health care financing. There is a greater move, globally, towards competition in the provision of services. In terms of allocative efficiency and equity, we believe that, on balance, the new NHS will bring no improvement. Indeed, in terms of equity, it may be detrimental. If there is any improvement, it is likely to be in technical efficiency.

J	LOEWENSON, R				LOEWENSON, R			STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT AND HEALTH-POLICY IN AFRICA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								World Bank/International Monetary Fund Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) have been introduced in over 40 countries of Africa. This article outlines their economic policy measures and the experience of the countries that have introduced them, in terms of nutrition, health status, and health services. The evidence indicates that SAPs have been associated with increasing food insecurity and undernutrition, rising ill-health, and decreasing access to health care in the two-thirds or more of the population of African countries that already lives below poverty levels. SAPs have also affected health policy, with loss of a proactive health policy framework, a widening gap between the affected communities and policy makers, and the replacement of the underlying principle of equity in and social responsibility for health care by a policy in which health is a marketed commodity and access to health care becomes an individual responsibility. The author argues that there is a deep contradiction between SAPs and policies aimed at building the health of the population. Those in the health sector need to contribute to the development and advocacy of economic policies in which growth is based on human resource development, and to the development of a civic environment in Africa that can ensure the implementation of such policies.											25	61	70	0	16	BAYWOOD PUBL CO INC	AMITYVILLE	26 AUSTIN AVE, AMITYVILLE, NY 11701	0020-7314			INT J HEALTH SERV	Int.

J	PEREIRA, J				PEREIRA, J			WHAT DOES EQUITY IN HEALTH MEAN	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article							CARE; EFFICIENCY; EQUALITY; WELFARE; QALYS	Up until very recently, the international debate on health inequality tended to disregard the issue of specifying equity objectives precisely. This was unfortunate, given the importance of normative analysis for understanding why people care about social justice in the field of health; the extent to which specific types of inequality are compatible with equity; how the concept should be measured; and how rational policies may be formulated and monitored. This article critically appraises six well established approaches to defining equity-egality, entitlement, the decent minimum, utilitarianism, Rawlsian maximin, and envy-free allocations-as well as two alternative formulations recently proposed by health economists-equity as choice and health maximisation. All of these are found wanting in some respect when applied to the health sector. It is argued that Sen's 'capabilities' concepts, strangely ignored by health services researchers in the past, could prove an effective framework within which to organise research and policy formulation in the area of health and health care inequality.

J	SEABROOK, J				SEABROOK, J			BIOTECHNOLOGY AND GENETIC DIVERSITY	RACE & CLASS			English	Article								The article which follows is based on the work of three individuals who have received awards from the Right Livelihood Foundation. The Foundation, which receives no government or institution finding, was set up in 1980 by Jakob von Uexkull, a translator, journalist and stamp-dealer, to recognise outstanding contributions in the fields of peace sustainable development, environmental integrity, social justice and human rights. Since the inception of the Foundation, its awards - sometimes known as 'alternative Nobel' prizes have been given to over forty individuals and groups, out of 250 submissions from more than fifty countries. The work of Cary Fowler and Pat Mooney, who together won the award in 1985, has been largely concerned with the world food crisis and the erosion of the world's genetic resources. Fowler and Mooney have worked together since 1975. One of their proposals was the establishment of international seedbanks, which was adopted by the UN in 1985. Their book Shattering: the diversity of life in the age of biotechnology was published in 1989 by the University of Arizona Press. Since 1978, they have worked for the Rural Advancement Fund International (RAFI), a small, non-profit organisation which focuses on the socio-economic impact of new technologies on rural societies. RAFI played a major role in stimulating the creation of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Commission and Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources and the International Fund of Plant Genetic Resources. Since the 1988 publication by RAFI of The Laws of Life: another development and the new biotechnologies, RAFI has been developing a study/action programme dealing with the impact of biotechnology on agriculture, food processing, basic community health, and the threat of biological warfare.											2	3	4	0	2	INST RACE RELATIONS	MITCHAM	120-126 LAVENDER AVE, MITCHAM, SURREY, ENGLAND CR4 3HP	0306-3968			RACE CLASS	Race Cl.

It distinguishes between the tax-financed systems of Denmark, Portugal and the U.K., the social insurance systems of France, the Netherlands and Spain, and the predominantly private systems of Switzerland and the U.S. It concludes that tax-financed systems tend to be proportional or mildly progressive, that social insurance systems are regressive and that private systems are even more regressive. Out-of-pocket payments are in most countries an especially regressive means of raising health care revenues.

Equity is taken to mean that persons in equal need of health care should be treated the same, irrespective of their income. Two methods are used to investigate inequity: an index of inequity based on standardized expenditure shares, and a regression-based test. The results suggest that inequity exists in most of the eight countries, but that there is no simple one-to-one correspondence between a country's delivery system and the degree to which persons in equal need are treated the same.

J	TUMWINE, JK				TUMWINE, JK			ZIMBABWE SUCCESS STORY IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH - WILL IT WEATHER ECONOMIC STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF HEALTH			English	Article							CARE	The beginning of the 1980s saw the birth of Zimbabwe as a result of a protracted liberation war. It coincided with global interest in primary health care, the concept of universal primary school education and, unfortunately, moves towards economic stabilisation and structural adjustment programmes. Economic structural adjustment was adopted by several sub Saharan African countries with dire consequences for the poor and vulnerable. Zimbabwe's commitment to social justice and to equitable distribution of resources demonstrated a practical move away from the culture of rhetoric so characteristic of many governments and non-governmental organisations and agencies. This commitment has been translated into impressive improvements in health and education. Current evidence shows that education has had a positive impact on health and related areas like contraceptive use, child mortality and the nutrition status of children. Conversely nutrition and health conditions among school children are important determinants of educational outcomes. Hitherto Zimbabwe's economy has been sufficiently strong to avoid excessive dependence on the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other foreign financial institutions. Unfortunately, however, the current economic recession together with economic structural adjustment programmes are beginning to have a negative impact on health and education. Will true synergism between health and education weather these structural problems? It seems that the people and government of Zimbabwe have the capacity and resolve to weather such a storm.

It reviews the experience of Jamaica with various development models from the 1950s to the 1990s, with special attention focused on the experience of the Seaga government of the 1980s. It also draws lessons from the successful development experience of small European countries and of the East Asian Newly Industrialized countries. In normative terms, the alternative development model attempts to combine growth with equity and democracy. In analytical terms, it takes account of the constellation of domestic forces and appropriate political strategies, as well as of international economic and political conditions. The main features are a strong role for the state in economic interactions with transnational corporations, in identification of export markets and promotion of export production, in selective protection of domestic industry with an export potential, in promotion of agriculture linked to industrial development, in improvement of human resources and promotion of regional economic integration. Within these parameters, a crucial role is assigned to the domestic private sector and a complementary one to foreign investment. Distribution is to be addressed primarily through distribution of productive assets and access to health care and education.

A 'worst case' scenario for the burden of fatal disease is taken as a poor agrarian society precariously dependent on starchy staples and a narrow range of other foods. In such a society life expectancy may be as low as 20. However in many 'pre-modern' societies the regime of roughly matching fertility and mortality levels was set at a 'submaximal' level, with completed fertility rates moderated by marriage conventions. The relative importance of the factors contributing to the historical decline in fatal infection continues to be debated. Evidence on the central role of maternal literacy in the recent decline in Third World mortality suggests the importance of changes in the body of civil society as well as the activities of professionals and public agencies. The decline in fatal infections has been offset to varying extents by an increase in non-communicable disease (NCD): the Mediterranean and East Asia having smaller epidemics of NCDs and Eastern Europe having sustained rises of NCDs. Most industrialised countries have experienced declines in overall NCD mortality in the last 2 decades. Both the fall in fatal infection and the rise and early fall of NCDs can usefully be viewed against the baseline of hunter gatherer cultures. When this is done, the relationship between economic development and disease is seen to be complex. Much 'progress' has been achieved by countering (and then doing better than countering) the adverse effects of earlier developments. Although most members of the generation now alive have experienced marked health benefits from economic and technical advance, it is unclear whether these gains can be both sustained and generalised. It is possible that adverse lagged effects of current industrial (and military) activities will disrupt the habitat of future generations of our species through processes such as stratospheric ozone depletion, global warming and others as yet unpredicted. Modern hygienists have dealt successively with influences on survival mainly operating in early life (infection) and influences operating across the lifespan (determinants of chronic disease). They have now to deal with even greater separations in time and space between potential health determinants and their ultimate effects. To a high level of scientific uncertainty is added the ethical problem of equity between generations.			ADDENBROOKES HOSP, DEPT COMMUNITY MED, CAMBRIDGE CB2 2QQ, ENGLAND.

The 19th century revolution in public health had as its cornerstone the improvement of social and physical environment. The favorable social development has since that time significantly contributed to the decrease of traditional health hazards in developed countries. New public health problems, chronic diseases have emerged in these countries. In some of these nations a new trend has started that may be called the second revolution in public health, i.e. the reduction of chronic diseases. However, the major part of the world's population still suffers from the traditional illnesses that should and could have been set aside by the 19th century revolution. Obviously, the social environment has not been altered sufficiently in these areas to have the desired impact on the health status. The observations from the Eastern European countries stress the need for a purposeful avoidance of deprivation in the social and physical environment as prerequisites for the prevention and control of diseases. Generally, low socio-economic status has been found to relate to an increased risk in many diseases. Usually there is a definite time lag between changes in social trends and disease patterns which causes difficulties for research in this area. The same fact generates problems for the planning and implementation of interventions to prevent the socially affected diseases. Changes in disease patterns are not only determined by altered social trends, but disease patterns can also influence social tendencies in several ways. Studying the interaction of social and health trends quantitatively and experimentally has yielded results which are hard to interpret. Therefore, observational and 'soft' methods are employed here to describe the relationship of social and health trends more aptly.

This was an important breakthrough for WHO as it was the first time Member States in a Region endorsed a common health policy and agreed to be monitored on their progress towards attainment of the strategy. The paper reviews the progress of Member States to date towards the Regional Health For All goal. Progress is discussed within the context of the six fundamental principles which underpin the Health For All concept, vis: equity; health promotion; community involvement; multisectoral participation; primary (local) health care; and, international cooperation. The paper argues that the commitment of Member States to the Health For All Strategy has been patchy with only moderate success towards meeting the 38 Regional Targets. Poor progress is attributed to changing national and international political and economic circumstances and limited resources but perhaps most importantly to a lack of political will to take the strategy seriously.

This complex of causes is driving a spiral of class inequality, political instability, and military repression in many less developed nations. These nations share a uniform security doctrine, which has major health impacts. Here five impacts are noted: diversion of resources, suppression of dissent, military classism, environment damage, and crime and terrorism. The demand stimulated by the recent Persian Gulf War for expensive, high-technology weapons may deepen Third World debt and fuel the cycle of poverty, ill health, social unrest, and military oppression. International health workers need to take account of the causes and effects of militarism in their studies of health problems. Their work could be aided by organizations that promote disarmament and environment preservation.

This paper analyzes the continued reliance on pesticides in the current development strategy and the socioeconomic implications of the ecological disruption the chemical technology generates. Relying on interviews with producers, exporters and government officials from Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and the United States, as well as surveys of Guatemalan farmers, the authors argue that the current agricultural development strategy perpetuates social and technological factors which heighten the potential for renewed crisis in the agrarian sector. Inadequate knowledge of pesticide hazards and a lack of control over pesticide use is leaving farmers, farm workers, and exporters increasingly vulnerable to economic, public health and environmental problems. Paradoxically, some measures to overcome these problems threaten to undermine efforts to improve social equity by further concentrating land and resources in the hands of large national and transnational production units.

J	MARTIN, CD; MARTIN, DH				MARTIN, CD; MARTIN, DH			EFFICACY OF ETHICS CODES FOR COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS	IFIP TRANSACTIONS A-COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES; SOCIAL ISSUES		To determine the ethical standards recognized by computer professionals, the existing codes of ethics from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the Data Processing Managers Association (DPMA), and the Institute for Certification of Computer Professionals (ICCP) were compared1. A number of common themes emerged as the core of ethical behavior for all computer professionals. They are 1) personal integrity / claim of competence; 2) personal accountability for work; 3) responsibility to employer / client; 4) responsibility to profession; 5) confidentiality of information / privacy; 6) conflict of interest; 7) dignity / worth of people; 8) public safety, health, and welfare; 9) participation in professional societies; and 10) increase public knowledge about technology. It is encouraging that in all of the ethics codes of the computer professional societies there is an emphasis on the relationship and interaction of the computer professional with other people, rather than with machines. This places the focus of ethical behavior upon ethical or right dealings with people, rather than upon the technology. With the recent efforts of the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) to undertake the ambitious task of developing an international code of ethics for information technology professionals, new areas of concern have been added to the code. In attempting to cut across international boundaries in a multicultural arena, the proposed IFIP ethics code goes far beyond ethics into the areas of international law and cultural values, At the individual level it covers some of the same issues of the four previous codes. With the exception of participation in professional societies, the common ethics themes from previous ethics codes are found, either directly or indirectly, in the new IFIP code. Eight additional themes raised in the IFIP code not found in previous codes are a specific statement of social responsibility, the establishment of standards, an emphasis on quality of life, equity, protection of intellectual property, consequences of networks, basic human rights, and the rights of users, To judge the efficacy of the IFIP code of ethics we must ask whether it will be able to fulfill the functions of a professional code of ethics delineated by Frankel2. Will it be an enabling document for professionals, a source of public evaluation, a source of professional socialization, an enhancement of professional reputation and public trust, a deterrent to unethical behavior, a support system for members, and a source of adjudication?

J	THRUPP, LA				THRUPP, LA			STERILIZATION OF WORKERS FROM PESTICIDE EXPOSURE - THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF DBCP-INDUCED DAMAGE IN COSTA-RICA AND BEYOND	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								Public health hazards from the use of agricultural pesticides have received increasing attention in developing as well as industrial nations. This article examines a remarkable case of massive sterilization of approximately 1,500 workers in Costa Rica, due to exposure to a toxic nematicide called DBCP (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), applied in large commercial banana plantations. Although the product was used during the 1970s, sterile victims have continued to be diagnosed through the 1980s. The effects include psychological trauma as well as permanent infertility. The case has international repercussions because several hundred workers have filed law suits against the U.S.-based transnational DBCP manufacturers, and because DBCP use was continued during the 1980s in other developing nations. The author analyzes the causes behind this serious impairment. It is argued that the contributing factors include not only biomedical processes and technical dimensions (i.e., how DBCP was used), but most importantly, political-economic factors that explain how and why DBCP was used despite the severe hazard. The crucial determinants pertain to the dominance of short-term profit motives, and the control over information and technology by the manufacturers (who concealed early toxicological research evidence of the reproductive hazards) and by the managers of the banana producer-companies. This case well illustrates problems and injustices from labor exploitation and resource extraction from transnational agro-industries. The article concludes with a brief summary of policy implications from the case.

Drawing upon observations from Ethiopia, Malaysia and Liberia, cases are presented where attempts were made to provide domestic water to villagers and rural town dwellers. In all cited cases attempts to provide safe water have failed or are in jeopardy. Conclusions drawn from these cases include acknowledgement that global goals will best be achieved by approaching local problems one-by-one and recognizing the technical, environmental and human constraints upon safe water provision interact differently from one site to another. To properly plan, implement and maintain safe water systems the current technical solutions must be combined with the contributions of social and environmental scientists on a case-by-case basis.
