J	Clancy, B				Clancy, Bridget			Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Rural Health Equity Strategic Action Plan: excellence through equity	ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Review						health equity; global surgery; indigenous health; military surgery; rural surgery		Wherever there are people there will be a need for surgical care. Rural people have all kinds of problems and need all kinds of surgeons. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) Rural Health Equity Strategic Action Plan (RHESAP) was endorsed by Council in December 2020. The goal is to increase the rural surgical workforce and increase access to care, through providing motivated surgeons with the training they need to work where they are needed most. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Surgical Education and Training Programs (SET) aim to train generalist surgeons across all nine surgical disciplines. To increase the rural surgical workforce and increase access to care, we need to select for rural origin, rural medical school and rural work experience, provide all trainees with the opportunity for positive rural work exposure with an aligned rural curriculum, and we need to support surgeons already living and working in rural areas. In future, with persistent health inequity for underserved populations and the impacts of climate change, we anticipate an increasing need for a culturally and emotionally intelligent, broad-scope surgical workforce, across all surgical disciplines, with the skills, confidence and motivation to work collaboratively and effectively in surgical teams, in areas of need and limited resource environments, including globally.

Geographic variation of rates is not well understood. Purpose To assess the spatial distribution of skin melanoma in Gran Canaria Island (Canary Islands, Spain) and to evaluate the role of environmental, socio-economic, and demographic factors in this distribution. Methods We performed a small-area study with disease mapping at the census-tract level (CT) in Gran Canaria between 2007 and 2018. After testing for spatial autocorrelation, we integrated individual-level health data with census-based demographic and socio-economic indicators, and satellite-based environmental data. Finally, we assessed the role of demographic, socio-economic and environmental factors on skin melanoma incidence using a Bayesian analytical framework, with options for non-spatial and spatial random effects. Results 1058 patients were diagnosed with invasive skin melanoma in the study period and geolocated to a CT (number of CT in Gran Canaria = 565). We found evidence of global spatial autocorrelation in skin melanoma incidence (Moran's I = 0.09, pseudo p-value = 0.001). A few hotspots were detected, fundamentally in urban northern tracts. A radial pattern of high values was also observed in selected ravines with historical isolation. Multivariable conditional autoregressive models identified urbanicity, percent of females, and a high socio-economic status as risk factors for disease. Solar radiation did not show a significant role. Conclusion Urbanicity and a high socio-economic status were identified as the main risk factors for skin melanoma. These associations might reflect differential melanoma susceptibilities or be explained by health inequalities in detection. This study also uncovered high-risk areas in particular ravines. Future targeted research in these regions might help better understand the role of genetic and toxic factors in melanoma pathogenesis.

Methods This cross-sectional data secondary study was a part of the fifth Childhood and Adolescence Surveillance and Prevention of Adult Non-communicable disease (CASPIAN-V) in 2015. A total of 14,400 students 7-18 years and their parents living in 30 provinces in Iran were studied. A validated questionnaire of the World Health Organization on Global School-based Health Survey (WHO-GSHS) was used to measure the outcomes and socioeconomic variables. Family's socioeconomic status (SES) was determined using principal component analysis (PCA). The crude and adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval (CI)) were estimated using multiple logistic regressions for each outcome. Results A total of 14,274 students completed the study, of whom 50.6% were boys. Overall, the prevalence of bullying, being a victim, life dissatisfaction (LDS), and poor SRH among students was 35.6, 21.4, 21.1, and 19.0%, respectively. In multiple-logistic regression analysis (Adjusted OR, (95%CI), students with an illiterate father and mother (1.60, (1.25-2.04), 1.28, (1.03-1.61), unemployed father (1.58, (1.29-1.81)), and one-parent family (1.32, (1.05 - 1.64) had a higher odd of Poor-SRH. Besides, a family size larger than four members (1.14, (1.03-1.25), and low-SES (1.35, (1.15-1.56), and illiteracy of the mother (1.64, (1.30-2.08) had a direct association with LDS. Mother illiteracy also increased the odds of bullying (1.77, (1.45-2.16) and being a victim (1.58, (1.26-1.98). Conclusions Some socioeconomic variables can be proposed as the statistically significant attribution of bullying and being a victim, LDS, and Poor-SRH in children and adolescents.

J	Scher, MS				Scher, Mark S.			Gene-Environment Interactions During the First Thousand Days Influence Childhood Neurological Diagnosis	SEMINARS IN PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Review							DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS; UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY; ENCEPHALOPATHY; TERM; ANGIOGENESIS; ASSOCIATION; VILLITIS; PRETERM; BIRTH	Gene-environment (G x E) interactions significantly influence neurologic outcomes. The maternal-placental-fetal (MPF) triad, neonate, or child less than 2 years may first exhibit significant brain disorders. Neuroplasticity during the first 1000 days will more likely result in life-long effects given critical periods of development. Developmental origins and lifecourse principles help recognize changing neurologic phenotypes across ages. Dual diagnostic approaches are discussed using representative case scenarios to highlight timedependent G x E interactions that contribute to neurologic sequelae. Horizontal analyses identify clinically relevant phenotypic form and function at different ages. Vertical analyses integrate the approach using systems-biology from genetic through multi-organ system interactions during each developmental age to understand etiopathogenesis. The process of ontogenetic adaptation results in immediate or delayed positive and negative outcomes specific to the developmental niche, expressed either as a healthy child or one with neurologic sequelae. Maternal immune activation, ischemic placental disease, and fetal inflammatory response represent prenatal disease pathways that contribute to fetal brain injuries. These processes involve G x E interactions within the MPF triad, phenotypically expressed as fetal brain malformations or destructive injuries within the MPF triad. A neonatal minority express encephalopathy, seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy of prematurity as a continuum of trimester-specific G x E interactions. This group may later present with childhood sequelae. A healthy neonatal majority present at older ages with sequelae such as developmental disorders, epilepsy, mental health diseases, tumors, and neurodegenerative disease, often during the first 1000 days. Effective preventive, rescue, and reparative neuroprotective strategies require consideration of G x E interactions interplay over time. Addressing maternal and pediatric health disparities will maximize medical equity with positive global outcomes that reduce the burden of neurologic diseases across the lifespan.

There is a large and growing literature on pandemic prevention and control. However, these existing studies seldom focus on the role of sustainable social development in this process. By setting specifications of fixed-effect models based on the score data of sustainable development goals (SDG) and infection case data from 257 Chinese cities, we evaluate the positive effect of sustainable social development on pandemic control. Our results show that sustainable social development leads to a remarkable improvement in pandemic prevention and control, especially for SDG4 (Quality Education) and SDG5 (Gender Equality). Significant positive effects of sustainable social development still exist in the post-pandemic era. This study highlights the importance of promoting social SDGs by linking them with pandemic prevention and control and suggests region-specific policies based on the heterogeneous analysis results.

Vaccine manufacturing experts, leaders from global public health organizations and dignitaries from governments and multilateral organizations discussed the challenges and opportunities emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 350 delegates from 33 countries, representing over 70 organizations partook in the meetings deliberations. The development and scaled-up production of several safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 resulted in over 12 billion doses being produced by the end of 2021. Unfortunately, this scientific achievement and outstanding industry effort has been overshadowed by the striking inequity in access to COVID-19 vaccines. High and upper middle-income countries have received 75% of the vaccines, while in Africa, less than 5% of the people are fully vaccinated. The inequitable access to vaccines is an issue of national health security, which has stressed the need to establish local vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa. Key partnerships, initiatives and the deliberate strategies required to achieve sustainable manufacturing on the continent were discussed. The ability to acquire technology, access markets and financing mechanisms, and workforce development were reported as key enablers to achieving a healthy ecosystem. Innovative vaccine technologies, new regulatory approaches, and the importance of voluntary technology transfers in increasing the global supply capacity of both COVID-19 vaccines and traditional vaccines were highlighted. In reviewing the lessons learned from the pandemic, speakers shared a consensus that innovation and partnerships will be central to any solution proposed to mitigate the current pandemic and prepare for future ones.

Methods: Using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software, data from the 1993-2014 GDHSs were analyzed. We disaggregated full immunization by five equity stratifiers: wealth quintile, education, sex, residence, and region. Second, we measured the inequality through summary measures, namely Difference, Population Attributable Risk, Ratio, and Population Attributable Fraction. Statistical significance was pegged at 95% Uncertainty Interval. Results: From 1993 to 2014, full immunization was higher among children born to mothers of the richest wealth index compared with those born to mothers of the poorest wealth index. Children with highly educated mothers dominated in full immunization coverage from 1993 (86.67%; UI = 70.38, 94.68] to 2014 (79.90%; UI = 73.94, 84.78). Within the same period, children of women without education recorded the least prevalence. Full immunization coverage was high among urban children in 1993 (71.07%; UI = 63.20, 77.84) but favoured rural children in 2008 (80.09%; UI = 74.30, 84.84) and 2014 (79.50%; UI = 74.00, 84.09) compared to urban children. More females were fully immunized in 1993 (56.68%; UI = 50.32, 62.82). In 2003, 2008 and 2014, Volta region (82.29%; UI = 70.32, 90.11), Brong Ahafo (93.94%; UI = 82.00, 98.14) and Upper East (95.27%; UI = 87.35, 98.32) regions dominated in full immunization coverage respectively. Conclusion: The inequality estimates revealed significant socio-economic inequality in full immunization coverage between 1993 and 2014 in Ghana. Similarly, urban children and children of women with secondary or higher education were predominantly fully immunized. To accelerate full immunization, policy makers should consider these disparities in the implementation of policies on childhood immunization in Ghana. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Insufficient attention has been paid to addressing the massive inequities worsened by COVID-19. In July 2020, Partners In Health (PIH) and the University of Global Health Equity (UGHE) delivered a four-module short course, 'An Equity Approach to Pandemic Preparedness and Response: Emerging Insights from COVID-19 Global Response Leaders.' Objective: We describe the design and use of a case-based, short-course education model to transfer knowledge and skills in equity approaches to pandemic preparedness and response. Methods: This course used case studies of Massachusetts and Navajo Nation in the US, and Rwanda to highlight examples of equity-centered pandemic response. Course participants completed a post-session assessment survey after each of the four modules. A mixed-method analysis was conducted to elucidate knowledge acquisition on key topics and assess participants' experience and satisfaction with the course. Results: Forty-four percent of participants identified, 'Immediate need for skills and information to address COVID-19' as their primary reason for attending the course. Participants reported that they are very likely (4.75 out of 5) to use the information, tools, or skills from the course in their work. The average score for content-related questions answered correctly was 82-88% for each session. Participants (similar to 70-90%) said their understanding was Excellent or Very Good for each session. Participants expressed a deepened understanding of the importance of prioritizing vulnerable communities and built global solidarity. Conclusion: The training contributed to a new level of understanding of the social determinants of health and equity issues surrounding pandemic preparedness and response. This course elucidated the intersection of racism and wealth inequality; the role of the social determinants of health in pandemic preparedness and response; and the impacts of neocolonialism on pandemic response in low- and middle-income countries.

Gender transformative approaches to social change have the potential to address the underlying causes of inequality. This paper draws insights from studies funded by Canada's International Development Research Centre to understand how integrating gender transformative approaches to research can support social change. The findings suggest that gender transformative research is most successful in supporting change when it analyzes and addresses the multiple causes of inequality, takes an intersectional and structural approach, embeds the research in local contexts, and engages power holders and perpetrators of inequality.

Data were analyzed from the Korea Community Health Survey 2016-2020 concerning adults (19-65 years old) living in seven metropolitan municipalities of South Korea (N = 190,761). The independent variables were socioeconomic status (household income and educational attainment) and community environment (density of physical activity facilities and social cohesion), and the dependent variable was the PAR, as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form, a recall-based subjective survey. Multilevel logistic regression models with age, sex, and body mass index as covariates were applied. The results showed that the PAR increased from 37.26% (2016) to 40.84% (2019), during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic, but it sharply decreased to 31.59% (2020) during the COVID-19 confinement (trend p < 0.001); PAR disparities were observed following socioeconomic status, as indicated by household income (trend p < 0.001) and educational attainment (trend p < 0.001). Furthermore, significant moderation effects were observed from socioeconomic status and community environment, but the direction of the effects varied by indicator and COVID-19-related confinement period. Lower educational attainment and higher income were associated with a greater decrease in PAR during the pandemic. This study shows that PAR substantively decreased in South Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic, although it had shown a steady increase through 2019. In addition, PAR disparities by socioeconomic status were found, and socioeconomic status and community environment had distinct influences on PAR trends, depending on their indicators and pre- and post-pandemic periods. Lower educational attainment is associated with greater decreases in PAR during the pandemic, suggesting the necessity for a public campaign to maintain a physically active lifestyle during such social disaster.

J	Hayes, K; Dos Santos, V; Costigan, M; Morante, D				Hayes, Karen; Dos Santos, Vagner; Costigan, Moses; Morante, Danielle			Profile of occupational therapy services in non-urban settings: A global scoping review	AUSTRALIAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY JOURNAL			English	Review							MENTAL-HEALTH; STROKE SURVIVORS; AUSTRALIA; PROGRAM; INJURY; AREAS	Introduction Regional, rural, and remote people represent nearly half the world's population yet experience disproportionally higher disease, mortality, and disability rates, coupled with limited healthcare access. Occupational therapy has committed to occupational justice, yet no descriptive framework of services provided by occupational therapists in non-urban locations exists. Understanding current non-urban service practices will provide a basis for non-urban service development and research to reduce this inequity. Methods Four databases were systematically searched for publications describing non-urban occupational therapy services, from any country, written in English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish, from 2010 to 2020. Publications were screened against criteria for inclusion, and data were identified using an extraction tool and presented in a frequency table, on a map, and in a searchable supporting information Table S1. Results Only 117 publications were included discussing services provided to populations across 19 countries. They were mostly published in English (98%) and about populations from English-speaking countries (70%). Included publications discussed individualist services (65%), for defined age groups (74%), and for people with specific medical diagnoses (58%). Services were commonly provided in the client's community (56%), originating from urban locations (45%) where the provider travelled (26%) or contacted clients using telehealth (19%). Individual 1:1 enabling strategies were most described (59%), including remediation (34%), compensation (9%), or education (7%). Community enablement strategies were infrequently described (14%), focused primarily on transformation to improve existing service delivery (9%), with some redistributive justice (3%), and one community development strategy (1%). Exploratory research services accounted for the remaining studies (27%). Differences were noted between Global North and South approaches. Conclusion Globally, occupational therapy has limited focus on non-urban services and favours individualist rehabilitative strategies provided by therapists remote from the client's context. Further research is required on the effectiveness and appropriateness of occupational therapy strategies to improve rural/urban inequity and health outcomes.

Certain groups may be missed out of these healthcare services, such as women with disabilities, as they face many access barriers due to underlying inequalities and negative attitudes. However, the data have not been reviewed on whether women with disabilities face inequalities in the uptake of these services. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to compare the uptake of breast and cervical cancer screening in women with and without disabilities. A search was conducted in July 2021 across four databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, Global Health, and CINAHL. Quantitative studies comparing the uptake of breast or cervical cancer screening between women with and without disabilities were eligible. Twenty-nine studies were included, all from high-income settings. One third of the 29 studies (34.5%, n = 10) were deemed to have a high risk of bias, and the remainder a low risk of bias. The pooled estimates showed that women with disabilities have 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72-0.84) lower odds of attending breast cancer screening and have 0.63 (95% CI: 0.45-0.88) lower odds of attending cervical cancer screening, compared to women without disabilities. In conclusion, women with disabilities face disparities in receipt of preventative cancer care. There is consequently an urgent need to evaluate and improve the inclusivity of cancer screening programs and thereby prevent avoidable morbidity and mortality.

In this context, early years programs, as a key population health initiative, have the potential to play a critical role in fostering family and child wellbeing. Methods: Informed by intersectionality, this rapid literature review captured a broad range of international, transdisciplinary literature in order to identify promising approaches for orienting early years systems of care towards equity in Canada. Results: Findings point to the need for a comprehensive, integrated and socially responsive early years system that has top-down political vision, leadership and accountability and bottom-up community-driven tailoring with an explicit focus on health promotion and maternal, family and community wellness using relational approaches. Conclusions: Advancing child health equity in wealthy countries requires structural government-level changes that support cross-ministerial and intersectoral alliances. Employing intersectionality in this rapid review promotes contextualized and nuanced understandings of what is needed in order to advance a responsive, comprehensive and quality early years system of equity-oriented care. Further research is needed to prevent child health inequities that are disproportionally experienced by Indigenous and racialized children in wealthy countries such as Canada. olicy and research recommendations that have relevance for high-income countries in diverse global contexts are discussed.

While there is a growing recognition of the importance of equity-focused responses to climate change, if and how health equity measures are incorporated into climate-change-related policy decisions has not yet been adequately explored. There are numerous approaches and frameworks for conducting policy analysis, and for understanding equity in the context of climate change and public health separately; however, a comprehensive framework for exploring the complexity of these interacting factors is hard to find. This review aims to systematically identify policy analysis frameworks and studies focusing on health equity in climate change related policies. Five electronic databases will be searched for peer-reviewed articles in English and from 2000. Articles will be subjected to systematic retrieval and quality assessment, and thematic analysis will be used for data analysis. The study findings will provide insight into different existing policy-analysis frameworks and policy-analysis approaches to understand health equity considerations in climate change policies and in health policies related to climate change.

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL using both medical subject headings (MeSH) and free-text keywords for empirical studies exploring inequity in ambulatory services offered virtually. Forty-one studies were included, most of them cross-sectional in design. Included studies were extracted using a customized extraction tool, and descriptive analysis was performed. The review identified widespread differences in accessing and using virtual care interventions among cultural and ethnic minorities, older people, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, people with limited digital and/or health literacy, and those with limited access to digital devices and good connectivity. Potential solutions addressing these barriers identified in the review included having digitally literate caregivers present during virtual care appointments, conducting virtual care appointments in culturally sensitive manner, and having a focus on enhancing patients' digital literacy. We identified evidence-based practices for virtual care interventions to ensure equity in access and delivery for their virtual care patients.

To examine the intra-generational equity from the space dimension and the inter-generational equity from the time dimension, a new measurement of global equity in a sustainability is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a comprehensive assessment index of regional development and an index of regional equity are constructed based on panel data using an entropy weight method (EVW) and a coefficient of variation method (CVM). Secondly, the intra-generational equity within different continents and echelons and the inter-generational equity in seven fields over the last 30 years are analyzed. Lastly, the global equity index for the next 10 years is predicted based on a panel data autoregressive model. The results of the study will be a reference for global equity strategies.

Today, more than 50% of the global population lives in urban areas, and in Europe the number is 75%. We present a narrative review to explore considerations and necessary requirements to achieve health and well-being within strategies for healthy design and urban planning whilst rethinking urban spaces for a post-COVID-19 and carbon-neutral future. The achievement of health and well-being demands healthy design strategies, namely, (1) moving from the concept of infrastructure for processes to the infrastructure for healthy living-requirements for healthy places, cycling, walking, disintegrating the role of polluting traffic from the urban environments, social vulnerability and equality; (2) physical space that will achieve standards of 'liveable communities'-open, green space requirements and standards for any built environment; (3) mainstreaming 'in-the-walking distance' cities and neighbourhoods for healthy physical activities for daily living; (4) exploring any of the new concepts that connect the nexus of urban spaces and public health and improving of the population's well-being. Public health needs to be prioritised systematically in planning of built environments, energy generations, sustainable food production, and nutrition.

J	Jain, V; Atun, R; Hansen, P; Lorgelly, P				Jain, Vageesh; Atun, Rifat; Hansen, Paul; Lorgelly, Paula			Which countries need COVID-19 vaccines the most? Development of a prioritisation tool	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						COVID-19; Health policy; Health economics; Vaccination		Background The COVID-19 pandemic and associated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have affected all countries. With a scarcity of COVID-19 vaccines there has been a need to prioritize populations, but assessing relative needs has been challenging. The COVAX Facility allocates vaccines to cover 20% of each national population, followed by a needs assessment that considers five quantitative metrics alongside a qualitative assessment. The objective of this study was to identify the most important factors for assessing countries' needs for vaccines, and to weight each, generating a scoring tool for prioritising countries. Methods The study was conducted between March and November 2021. The first stage involved an online Delphi survey with a purposive and snowball sample of public health experts, to reach consensus on country-level factors for assessing relative needs for COVID-19 vaccines. The second stage involved a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to determine weights for the most important factors. Results Responses were received from 28 experts working across 13 different countries and globally. The most common job titles reported were director and professor, with most based in national public health institutes (n = 9) and universities (n = 8). The Delphi survey found 37 distinct factors related to needs. Nine of the most important factors were included in the DCE. Among these, the most important factor was the 'proportion of overall population not fully vaccinated' (with a mean weight of 19.5), followed by 'proportion of high-risk population not fully vaccinated' (16.1), 'health system capacity' (14.2), 'capacity to purchase vaccines' (11.9) and the 'proportion of the population clinically vulnerable' (11.3). Conclusions Several factors exist, extending beyond those currently used, which may lead to some countries having a greater need for vaccines compared to others. By assessing relative needs, this scoring tool can build on existing methods to further the role of equity in global COVID-19 vaccine allocation.

COVID-19, Macroeconomic and Sustainability Shocks, Moral Hazard and Resolution of Systemic Banking Crises: Designing Appropriate Systems of Public Support	EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Banking crisis; Bailouts; Bank regulation; Non-performing loans; Asset management companies; COVID-19		Banks have so far weathered well the financial turbulence caused by COVID-19 while at the same time being central in the economic and financial response. As the crisis moves from its initial phase as a short-term liquidity shock, the financial sector is facing increasing volumes of non-performing loans, raising the spectre of a banking solvency crisis. In economies already burdened with low-quality assets, the COVID-19 fallout is intensifying existing problems with legacy loans heightening the risk of a banking crisis. These issues are now being worsened by the impact of inflation and the invasion of Ukraine. Thus, addressing increasing volumes of bad loans, while supporting the proper functioning of the financial system, is a major challenge with systemic repercussions for a range of economies. This paper identifies a great paradox: since the bank rescues of the 2008-9 Global Financial Crisis there has been a disproportionate focus on the liability side of bank balance sheets through resolution measures such as bail-in and the accumulation of bail-inable debt. Post-crisis bank resolution regimes have overlooked solutions lying within the asset side of bank balance sheets. This paper analyses historical evidence to argue that concentrating on a liability-focused approach to the exclusion of asset-side solutions is ill-conceived. An excessive accumulation of non-performing loans on the asset side of bank balance sheets inevitably renders resolution interventions on the liability/equity side ineffective or at the very least insufficient to maintain banking system viability and financial stability. Bank asset restructuring involving the use of asset management companies, asset protection schemes and even capital injections can play a critical role in achieving an expeditious restoration of banking systems' health following a major macroeconomic, sustainability or financial crisis.

Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey conducted in Global South countries between 2010 and 2020 among 13- to 17-year-old adolescents. Country-context variables were retrieved from secondary data sources (World Health Organization, World Bank, and Human Development Reports). PA was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire querying the number of days in the past week in which participants were physically active for a total of at least 60 min. PA absolute gender inequalities were evaluated by the differences in the prevalence between boys and girls, 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were estimated using the bootstrap method. Relative inequalities were obtained through Poisson regression. Meta-analyses with random effects were used to calculate pooled estimates of absolute and relative inequalities. Results: Based on 64 Global South countries/surveys, the prevalence of PA was 6.7 percentage points (p.p.) higher in boys than in girls, ranging from 0.5 p.p. in Afghanistan to 15.6 p.p. in Laos (I-2= 85.1%). The pooled ratio for all countries showed that boys presented a PA prevalence 1.58 times higher than girls (95%CI: 1.47-1.70) on average. The highest absolute and relative inequalities were observed in high income countries. Countries with higher Human Development Index rankings and lower Gender Inequality Index rankings also presented greater gender differences. Conclusion: Given that girls are overall less active than boys across the globe, the findings of this study reinforce that macro- and micro-level changes should be actively sought if we aim to increase population levels of PA in adolescents and promote equity in PA.

In this context, vaccination is one way - among many and varied actions needed - in which people can reduce risk of further exclusion. This article summarises early findings from a study focusing on the experiences of communities in informal settlements in four major cities in the global South - Harare, Kampala, Lilongwe, and Mumbai - which was conducted in partnership with national affiliates of Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI). By providing a snapshot of how global vaccine inequalities play out at the local level, we aim to contribute to understanding the challenges faced by low-income residents in informal settlements in accessing Covid-19 vaccines and their perceptions of those challenges, and to generate insights about good practices to help ensure more equitable vaccine distribution.

Implementation of international guidelines in Latin American settings requires additional considerations. Objective: To provide evidence-based guidelines about VTE prevention for Latin American patients, clinicians, and decision makers. Methods: We used the GRADE ADOLOPMENT method to adapt recommendations from 2 American Society of Hematology (ASH) VTE guidelines (Prevention of VTE in Surgical Patients and Prophylaxis for Medical Patients). ASH and 12 local hematology societies formed a guideline panel composed of medical professionals from 10 countries in Latin America. Panelists prioritized 20 questions relevant to the Latin American context. A knowledge synthesis team updated evidence reviews of health effects conducted for the original ASH guidelines and summarized information about factors specific to the Latin American context, that is, values and preferences, resources, accessibility, feasibility, and impact on health equity. Results: The panel agreed on 21 recommendations. In comparison with the original guideline, 6 recommendations changed direction and 4 recommendations changed strength. Conclusions: This guideline ADOLOPMENT project highlighted the importance of contextualization of recommendations in other settings, based on differences in values, resources, feasibility, and health equity impact.

Literatures focusing on economic-related inequalities in HBV infection among pregnant women are scarce. We aimed to quantify the economic-related inequalities and the change over time in HBV infection among pregnant women in mainland China from 2013 to 2020 to inform strategies considering economic-related inequalities. Methods We used national cross-sectional secondary data of pregnant women in 30 provinces from the National Integrated Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B Programme (iPMTCT Programme) from 2013 to 2020. We calculated concentration index and adjusted difference between the rich and the poor in the multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to measure economic-related inequality, after adjusted other risk factors. Findings In this study, a total of 115,789,148 pregnant women of mainland China from 2013 to 2020 were included, the overall hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence was 6.27% (95%CI: 6.26%-6.28%). The curve lay above the equality line, with the negative value of the concentration index of -0.027, which indicated that economic-related health disparities exist in the distribution of HBV infection and the inequality disadvantageous to the poor (propoor). The concentration index showed a trend of fluctuating decline, indicating that economic-related inequalities in HBsAg prevalence were narrowing. The adjust difference between counties with lowest economic level and counties with highest economic level (reference group) were 46.3% in HBsAg prevalence (all p < 0.05) in the multivariable GEE model, after controlling other confounders. A significant dose-response relationship was observed between low economic level and high HBsAg prevalence that the adjust difference increased from 15.6% (aOR=1.156, 95% CI: 1.064-1.257) in the high-economic group to 46.3% (aOR=1.463, 95% CI: 1.294-1.824) in the lowest-economic group, compared with the highest-economic group. The association between low economic level and high HBsAg prevalence was stable in the sensitivity analysis. Interpretation HBV infection was more concentrated among population with lower economic status. Economic-related inequalities in HBV infection decreased in the past decade. Our findings highlight the importance of developing equity-oriented policies and targeted interventions to reduce HBV infection among the poor and hard-to-reach populations to achieve the 2030 HBV elimination goals on time.

Background Meeting the health needs of formerly incarcerated people in community, rather than through the criminal justice system, may prevent further experiences of criminalization. Research is needed to understand what community-based health interventions have been implemented internationally to inform the design of an intervention in Canada. Design Scoping review using the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology. Methods In consultation with a medical research librarian, key databases and journals were searched for English language articles, from any country, with no specified date range. Three authors independently screened titles and abstracts to identify articles for full-text review. The study adheres to PRISMA-EQUATOR guidelines. Results Thirty-six studies met the present criteria and were reviewed in full text. Method, setting, participants, sample, relevant outcomes and relevant findings were extracted from each study for synthesis. Included studies had varied methods and were published from 1999 to 2020. Thirty-one studies were based in the United States, one in Puerto Rico and two each in Canada and the United Kingdom. The most common health issue focus was human immunodeficiency virus and/or hepatitis c virus. The most common outcome was uptake of offered services, such as a transitional clinic. Conclusions Gaps in the research pertain to a lack of attention to clinical outcomes and patient experience, and a lack of consideration of sexual and reproductive health concerns. Women were the minority population in all studies that included both men and women; transgender participants were mentioned in only four of thirty-six studies. The specific needs of women, trans and nonbinary people must be taken into consideration. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses must be conscious of the elevated health risks associated with exposure to correctional institutions and the risks associated with the period of transition.

Exploring systematic SDG strategies is urgently needed to aid recovery from the pandemic and reinvigorate global SDG actions. Based on available data and comprehensive analysis of the literature, this paper highlights ongoing challenges facing the SDGs, identifies the effects of COVID-19 on SDG progress, and proposes a systematic framework for promoting the achievement of SDGs in the post-pandemic era. Progress towards attaining the SDGs was already lagging behind even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inequitable distribution of food-energy-water resources and environmental crises clearly threaten SDG implementation. Evidently, there are gaps between the vision for SDG realization and actual capacity that constrain national efforts. The turbulent geopolitical environment, spatial inequities, and trade-offs limit the effectiveness of SDG implementation. The global public health crisis and socio-economic downturn under COVID-19 have further impeded progress toward attaining the SDGs. Not only has the pandemic delayed SDG advancement in general, but it has also amplified spatial imbalances in achieving progress, undermined connectivity, and accentuated anti-globalization sentiment under lockdowns and geopolitical conflicts. Nevertheless, positive developments in technology and improvement in environmental conditions have also occurred. In reflecting on the overall situation globally, it is recommended that post-pandemic SDG actions adopt a "Classification-Coordination-Collaboration" framework. Classification facilitates both identification of the current development status and the urgency of SDG achievement aligned with national conditions. Coordination promotes domestic/international and inter-departmental synergy for short-term recovery as well as long-term development. Cooperation is key to strengthening economic exchanges, promoting technological innovation, and building a global culture of sustainable development that is essential if the endeavor of achieving the SDGs is to be successful. Systematic actions are urgently needed to get the SDG process back on track.

This is critical to facilitate development of solutions to the public health burden of many rare and common diseases across the continent. AfSHG fully supports the Black Lives Matter movement, which is dedicated to fighting racism and ensuring that society values the lives and humanity of Black people. The AfSHG would like to add its "voice" to the public outcry against racism sparked by George Floyd's death and to declare its commitment to ensuring that injustice and systematic racism, as well as abuse and exploitation of Africans and their biological material, are no longer tolerated. This is particularly relevant now as African genomic variation is poised to make significant contributions across several disciplines including ancestry, personalized medicine, and novel drug discovery. "Black Lives Matter and Black Research Matters" is AfSHG's call for the global community to support halting, and reversing, the perpetuation of exploitation of African people through neocolonial malpractices in genomic research. We also propose five key ways to curb racism in science, so that we can move forward together, with a common humanity, collectively embracing scientific endeavors.

This rapid systematic review analyses the barriers to COVID-19 health products in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). It does so from the canon of global health equity and access to medicines by proposing an access to health products in low-and middle-income countries framework and typology adapted to underscore the complex interactive and multiplicative nature and effects of barriers to health products and their root cause as they coexist across different levels of society in LMICs. Methods: Modified versions of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) reviewers' manual for evidence synthesis of systematic reviews and the PRISMA-ScR framework were used to guide the search strategy, identification, and screening of biomedical, social science, and gray literature published in English between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2021. Results: The initial search resulted in 5,956 articles, with 72 articles included in this review after screening protocol and inclusion criteria were applied. Thirty one percent of the articles focused on Africa. The review revealed that barriers to COVID-19 health products were commonly caused by market forces (64%), the unavailability (53%), inaccessibility (42%), and unaffordability (35%), of the products, incongruent donors' agenda and funding (33%) and unreliable health and supply systems (28%). They commonly existed at the international and regional (79%), health sectoral (46%), and national cross-sectoral [public policy] (19%) levels. The historical heritage of colonialism in LMICs was a commonly attributed root cause of the barriers to COVID-19 health products in developing countries. Conclusion: This review has outlined and elaborated on the various barriers to health products that must be comprehensively addressed to mount a successful global, regional, national and subnational response to present and future epidemics and pandemics in LMICs.

Eye Health Programmes tackle this by providing screening, primary eye care, refractive correction, and referral to hospital eye services. One point where patients can be lost in the treatment journey is adherence to hospital referral. ContextPeek Vision's software solutions have been used in Pakistan with the goal of increasing eye health programme coverage and effectiveness. This involved collaboration between health system stakeholders, international partners, local community leaders, social organizers and "Lady Health Workers". ResultsFrom the beginning of the programmes in November 2018, to the end of December 2021, 393,759 people have been screened, 26% of whom (n = 101,236) needed refractive services or secondary eye care, and so were referred onwards to the triage centers or hospital services. Except for a short period affected heavily by COVID-19 pandemic, the programmes reached an increasing number of people over time: screening coverage improved from 774 people per month to over 28,300 people per month. Gathering and discussing data regularly with stakeholders and implementers has enabled continuous improvement to service delivery. The quality of screening and adherence to hospital visits, gender balance differences and waiting time to hospital visits were also improved. Overall attendance to hospital appointments improved in 2020 compared to 2019 from 45% (95% CI: 42-48%) to 78% (95% CI: 76-80%) in women, and from 48% (95% CI: 45-52%) to 70% (95% CI: 68-73%) in men. These patients also accessed treatment more quickly: 30-day hospital referral adherence improved from 12% in 2019 to 66% in 2020. This approach helped to utilize refractive services more efficiently, reducing false positive referrals to triage from 10.6 to 5.9%. Hospital-based services were also utilized more efficiently, as primary eye care services and refractive services were mainly delivered at the primary healthcare level. DiscussionDespite various challenges, we demonstrate how data-driven decisions can lead to health programme systems changes, including patient counseling and appointment reminders, which can effectively improve adherence to referral, allowing programmes to better meet their community's needs.

"Planetary Health" is a breakthrough concept and emerging research field based on the recognition of the interdependent relationships between living organisms-both human and non-human-and their ecosystems. In that regards, there have been numerous calls by healthcare professionals for a greater recognition and adoption of Planetary Health perspective. At the same time, current Western healthcare systems are facing their limits when it comes to providing affordable, equitable and sustainable healthcare services. Furthermore, while hospital-centrism remains the dominant model of Western health systems, primary care and public health continue to be largely undervalued by policy makers. While healthcare services will have to adapt to the sanitary impacts of environmental degradations, they should also ambition to accompany and accelerate the societal transformations required to re-inscribe the functioning of human societies within planetary boundaries. The entire health system requires profound transformations to achieve this, with obviously a key role for public health. But we argue that the first line of care represented by primary care might also have an important role to play, with its holistic, interdisciplinary, and longitudinal approach to patients, strongly grounded in their living environments and communities. This will require however to redefine the roles, activities and organization of primary care actors to better integrate socio-environmental determinants of health, strengthen interprofessional collaborations, including non-medical collaborations and more generally develop new, environmentally-centered models of care. Furthermore, a planetary health perspective translated in primary care will require the strengthening of synergies between institutions and actors in the field of health and sustainability.

However, most urban indicator frameworks use coarse spatial scales that either only allow between-city comparisons, or require expensive, technical, local spatial analyses for within-city comparisons. This study developed a reusable, open-source urban indicator computational framework using open data to enable consistent local and global comparative analyses. We show this framework by calculating spatial indicators-for 25 diverse cities in 19 countries-of urban design and transport features that support health and sustainability. We link these indicators to cities' policy contexts, and identify populations living above and below critical thresholds for physical activity through walking. Efforts to broaden participation in crowdsourcing data and to calculate globally consistent indicators are essential for planning evidence-informed urban interventions, monitoring policy effects, and learning lessons from peer cities to achieve health, equity, and sustainability goals.

What next? Expanding our view of city planning and global health, and implementing and monitoring evidence-informed policy	LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article								This Series on urban design, transport, and health aimed to facilitate development of a global system of health-related policy and spatial indicators to assess achievements and deficiencies in urban and transport policies and features. This final paper in the Series summarises key findings, considers what to do next, and outlines urgent key actions. Our study of 25 cities in 19 countries found that, despite many well intentioned policies, few cities had measurable standards and policy targets to achieve healthy and sustainable cities. Available standards and targets were often insufficient to promote health and wellbeing, and health-supportive urban design and transport features were often inadequate or inequitably distributed. City planning decisions affect human and planetary health and amplify city vulnerabilities, as the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted. Hence, we offer an expanded framework of pathways through which city planning affects health, incorporating 11 integrated urban system policies and 11 integrated urban and transport interventions addressing current and emerging issues. Our call to action recommends widespread uptake and further development of our methods and open-source tools to create upstream policy and spatial indicators to benchmark and track progress; unmask spatial inequities; inform interventions and investments; and accelerate transitions to net zero, healthy, and sustainable cities.

J	Pratt, B				Pratt, Bridget			Sustainable global health practice: An ethical imperative?	BIOETHICS			English	Article						climate change; ethics; global health; justice; solidarity; sustainability	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOLIDARITY; FOOTPRINT	We are in the midst of a crisis of climate change and environmental degradation that will only get worse, unless significant changes are rapidly made. Globally, the healthcare sector causes a large share of our total environmental footprint: 4.4% of greenhouse gases. Sustainable healthcare has emerged as a way for healthcare sectors in high-income countries to help mitigate climate change by reducing their emissions. Whether global health should be sustainable and what ethical grounds might exist to support such a claim are not questions that have been investigated. The paper argues that global health practice-the delivery of health services to underserved populations in resource-poor areas of the world-should be sustainable as a matter of climate justice and solidarity. Reducing climate change-related risks and harms for the vulnerable is integral to the mission of global health and thus it is necessary to consider the climate impact of its practice. The field has a duty to provide sustainable health services that are responsive to climate change-related changes in the local burden of disease and to build sustainable health system infrastructure. Specific responsibilities for global health funders, managers, and implementers to uphold the duty are proposed.

Materials and methods: A cross-sectional sample of 1,845 3- to 5-year-old children attending 61 preschools was selected by stratified cluster sampling. Dental caries was classified as non-cavitated/early lesions (d(1-2)), cavitated (d(3-6)) lesions, and cavitated/non-cavitated (d(1-6)) lesions using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System. A self-administered parental questionnaire captured sociodemographic and behavioural data. Multivariate logistic regression and Poisson mixed model analysis was used to examine associations amongst sociodemographic variables, child oral health behaviours, and decayed tooth surfaces. Results: In all, 56.6% (n = 1,044) of the children had ECC; more than one-third (36.6%) presented exclusively non-cavitated/early lesions, 5.7% solely cavitated lesions, and 14.2% both. Children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds had higher levels of dental caries. Parental pensioner/health care card status (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.76, 95% CI, 1.57-1.97), non-English-speaking background (IRR = 2.09, 95% CI, 1.80-2.43), and Indigenous status (IRR = 1.91, 95% CI, 1.50-2.43) were associated with higher rates of cavitated lesions. Children who consumed soft drinks once or more per week had 1.66 times more cavitated lesions (95% CI, 1.48-1.86) compared to children who never/rarely consumed soft drinks. Soft drink consumption of once or more per week was associated with parental health care/pensioner card status (odds ratio [OR] = 1.73, 95% CI, 1.36-2.18), non-English-speaking background (OR = 1.58, 95% CI, 1.11-2.27), and Indigenous status (OR = 1.92, 95% CI, 1.04-3.52). Conclusions: Higher levels of more severe caries rates in children from socioeconomically disadvantaged background highlight an opportunity for early preventive interventions targeting these groups.

During 2020, many institutions shifted learning online overnight as the sector closed its doors and opened new sites for remote teaching. This article reports on an international study [Phillips et al., 2021] that sought to capture how cross-sectoral teachers experienced these emergency changes during the first months of restrictions. The data, analysed using narrative identity theory, revealed concerns that fall into two broad categories: technologies and relationships. Significantly, it was not a loss of content delivery or changes to assessment that prompted the greatest anxiety for our colleagues, but that they held significant concerns about their students' mental health; inequities of access to a range of services including technological; and challenges connecting emotionally with their students at a distance. The results provide actionable strategies for higher education institutions to apply in future emergencies where remote teaching is necessary.

The Delivery of COVID-19 Vaccines and the Pharmaceutical Industry's Role in Widening the Access Gap	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pharmaceutical Industry; Vaccines; APAs; Equity; Human Rights	UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES; COMMERCIAL DETERMINANTS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; HUMAN-RIGHTS; MEDICINES; BUSINESS; TRIPS	Background: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic entails a comprehensive strategy that ensures equitable access to all COVID-19-fighting technologies. To achieve this goal, the international community has acknowledged immunization as a public good. However, a trend of grossly unequal dose distribution emerged, owing, among other factors, to pharmaceutical companies' profit-driven actions, jeopardizing the mechanisms built to increase vaccine access. The contradiction between public health interests and corporate discretion in determining vaccine dose distribution poses critical concerns about the health risks associated with lengthening the duration of the pandemic and the eventual liability of companies for violations of human rights. Methods: To evaluate the risks posed to the COVID-19 immunization program, data on vaccine allocation and delivery, vaccine dose application, immunized populations, and the volume of Advanced Purchase Agreements (APAs) between countries and pharmaceutical companies were compiled and assessed. A descriptive analysis was then conducted to analyze the role of pharmaceutical companies in providing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Results: When the data is broken down by income (as of June 2021), it shows that high income countries have already crossed the COVAX 20% immunization threshold. However, countries of all other income levels have yet to achieve this mark for fully vaccinated people. Upper-middle-income countries have approximately 3%, low-and-middle-income countries have approximately 2% and low-income countries have less than 0.1% of fully vaccinated people per hundred. The supply shortage is expected to last until the second half of 2021. Conclusion: As a result of the COVAX failure, a health gap emerged with countries living in a pre-immunization period for an extended time. The existing conflict between the international response to tackle COVID-19 and corporate profit-driven behavior contributed to prolonging pandemic, especially in Africa. Accordingly, there is a need to approve an international treaty that targets the activities of all actors, including the pharmaceutical companies, in protecting human rights and the right to health realms.

Blue-space availability, environmental quality and amenity use across contrasting socioeconomic contexts	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Urban landscapes; Habitat quality; Blue spaces; Freshwater distribution; Freshwater network	CONSERVATION VALUE; LANDSCAPE FACTORS; GREEN SPACE; MEXICO-CITY; URBAN GREEN; WATER; BIODIVERSITY; URBANIZATION; JUSTICE; ASSEMBLAGES	Over 60% of the global population are expected to live in urban areas by 2050. Urban blue spaces are critical for biodiversity, provide a range of ecosystem services, and can promote human health and wellbeing. Despite this, access to blue space is often unequally distributed across socioeconomic gradients, and the availability of quality blue space could extend to environmental justice issues. Three stages of analysis were carried out in Mexico City, Mexico and Bristol, UK to (i) assess associations between blue space and socioeconomic metrics at a regional scale, (ii) apply a rapid assessment tool to assess amenity, access and environmental quality, (iii) consider local quality across socioeconomic gradients at a regional scale. Still water availability was indicative of higher socioeconomic status, but contrasting city evolutions underpinned differences. Locally, there were environmental gradients from more complex to disturbed habitats that influenced potential wellbeing and amenity benefits. In combination, this may exacerbate inequalities and risk increasing ecosystem disservices. If cities are to be socially, and environmentally resilient to higher levels of disturbance in the future, healthy ecosystems will be key. However, further research is needed to address various dimensions of injustice in urban areas beyond blue space distribution.

Sex and gender differences in chronic kidney disease and access to care around the globe	SEMINARS IN NEPHROLOGY			English	Review						gender sex global disparity CKD inequity	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY; RISK-FACTORS; TRANSPLANTATION; CHILDREN; HEALTH; OUTCOMES; CKD; MEXICO; HEMODIALYSIS	The difference between sex, the biological construct, and gender, the social construct, may be most evident in settings of vulnerability. Globally, chronic kidney disease is more prevalent among women, but the prevalence of end-stage kidney failure, and especially receipt of kidney replacement therapy, is higher in men. These differences likely reflect a combination of physiological and social/structural risk factors that independently modulate kidney disease and/or its progression. The distribution of the most common risk factors such as hypertension and obesity differ between men and women and may impact disease risk differentially. Social and structural gender-related inequities remain stark across the globe. More women live in poverty, receive less education, and are more dependent on others for health care decision making, but men may have a higher risk of injury, occupational exposures, and less access to screening, prevention, and primary care. In this article, we explore how social determinants of health affect kidney disease risk and access to care differentially across genders, and differently across the globe. We also describe specific challenges experienced by boys and girls with kidney disease, how culture and geography may impact kidney care in places where resources are particularly limited such as sub-Saharan Africa, and give examples of social and structural circumstances that place young men and women at high risk of kidney disease in Mexico and Central America, illustrated by case vignettes. The coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic has raised awareness of pervasive gender-based inequities within all societies. This applies to kidney disease and is not new. The nephrology community must add its voice to the calls for action, for a more just society overall, and for the recognition of the roles of sex and gender as modulators of kidney disease risk and access to care.

By centering immigrant organizations (IOs) as a unit of analysis, migration scholars can reconsider whether and how IOs affect well-being, integration, political voice, identities, globalization, and development. Migration scholars must learn from scholars of organizations, but organization scholars must in turn question assumptions of nativity and citizenship in their research. Doing so illuminates the unique challenges-and, at times, opportunities-faced by IOs, especially regarding inequities tied to legal status and stigmatization. We further argue that cross-national and transnational analyses of IOs help unpack organizational embeddedness-that is, the ways in which contexts at the local, national, binational, and geopolitical levels generate opportunities and constraints. Studying IOs raises critical questions of civic inequality and organizational stigma but also highlights IOs' potential to give voice to and effect positive change for migrant communities.

This review traces the intellectual and historic context in which women's status and empowerment in lower- and middleincome countries have been measured, the conceptual and operationalization challenges in shaping research questions, the use of empirical measures and their connection to levels of social analysis, and the identification of emerging directions for future research. With the recognition that empowerment is as much a collective process as it is individual, we argue that a more integrative and multidisciplinary approach to empowerment is needed. This would require incorporating an intersectional lens, employing the life course approach, and tapping into diverse sources of data that can together strengthen future research.

However, an overview of specific issues relevant to the European context on harmonizing methodological requirements for the valuation of costs to be used in health economic evaluation is lacking. We aimed to inform the development of an international, harmonized and multi-sectoral costing framework, as sought in the European PECUNIA (ProgrammE in Costing, resource use measurement and outcome valuation for Use in multi-sectoral National and International health economic evaluAtions) project. Methods We conducted a scoping review (information extraction 2008-2021) to a) to demonstrate the degree of heterogeneity that currently exists in the literature regarding central terminology, b) to generate an overview of the most relevant areas for harmonization in multi-sectoral and multi-national costing processes for health economic evaluations, and c) to provide insights into country level variation regarding economic evaluation guidance. A complex search strategy was applied covering key publications on costing methods, glossaries, and international costing recommendations augmented by a targeted author and reference search as well as snowballing. Six European countries served as case studies to describe country-specific harmonization issues. Identified information was qualitatively synthesized and cross-checked using a newly developed, pilot-tested data extraction form. Results Costing methods for services were found to be heterogeneous between sectors and country guidelines and may, in practice, be often driven by data availability and reimbursement systems in place. The lack of detailed guidance regarding specific costing methods, recommended data sources, double-counting of costs between sectors, adjustment of unit costs for inflation, transparent handling of overhead costs as well as the unavailability of standardized unit costing estimates in most countries were identified as main drivers of country specific differences in costing methods with a major impact on valuation and cost-effectiveness evidence. Conclusion This review provides a basic summary of existing costing practices for evaluative purposes across sectors and countries and highlights several common methodological factors influencing divergence in cost valuation methods that would need to be systematically incorporated and addressed in future costing practices to achieve more comparable, harmonized health economic evaluation evidence.

This study measures relative and absolute socio-economic inequality in mortality among multimorbid Chinese. Methods For this study, the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) enrolled 512 712 participants ages 30-79 y from 10 areas of China between 25 June 2004 and 15 July 2008. All-cause mortality was accessed with a mean follow-up period of 10 y (to 31 December 2016). Associations between multimorbidity and mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, with the relative index of inequality (RII) and slope index of inequality (SII) in mortality calculated to measure disparities. Results Mortality risk was highest for those who had not attended formal school and with four or more long-term conditions (LTCs) (hazard ratio 3.11 [95% confidence interval {CI} 2.75 to 3.51]). Relative educational inequality was lower in participants with four or more LTCs (RII 1.92 [95% CI 1.60 to 2.30]), especially in rural areas. Absolute disparities were greater in adults with more LTCs (SII 0.18 [95% CI 0.14 to 0.21] for rural participants with three LTCs). Conclusions Whereas the relative inequality in all-cause mortality was lower among multimorbid people, absolute inequality was greater among multimorbid men, especially in rural areas.

More-than-national and less-than-global: The biochemical infrastructure of vaccine manufacturing	ECONOMY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						vaccine R&D; COVID-19; biochemical engineering; infrastructure; equity	HEALTH; INNOVATION; CAPACITY; COVID-19; MARKET; TEMPORALITY; POLITICS; HISTORY; MATTERS; ACCESS	The recent efforts to mount an R&D response to public health emergencies of international concern have led to the formation of what we term a biochemical infrastructure of vaccine development and production. In principle, this infrastructure is expected not only to curtail existing pandemics but also anticipate and contain yet-to-emerge future threats. Critically, by nature of its geographical distribution and technical modularity, that infrastructure promises both to accelerate and expand access to essential medical tools, and in so doing, redress global health inequities. In practice, however, the biochemical infrastructure of vaccines remains highly uneven, fragmented and unjust. Moving beyond calls for 'global health solidarity', this paper examines the key actors, normative techniques and socio-technical assemblages, from viral platform technologies to intellectual property waivers and from accelerated regulatory pathways to advance market commitments, that serve to link 'just-in-case' and 'just-in-time' modalities of global health R&D. We argue that the biomedical infrastructure of vaccine development and production emerging in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is unfolding across an innovation ecosystem that is more-than-national and yet less-than global: a reconfiguration that may offer possibilities for a new, radically-overhauled, model of vaccine equity.

American Cancer Society depicts that the most common cancers are diagnosed in men and women in 2021. We aim to study socioeconomic inequalities in related cancers to investigate whether the cancer prevalence differs within the family income to poverty ratio (PIR). MethodsThe study investigated data from adults aged 20-85 years participated in the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) who had complete data available on PIR and cancer or malignancy information (n = 49,720). Participants were stratified into 3 categories of PIR: high income (PIR >= 4), middle income (>1 and <4), or at or below the federal poverty level (<= 1). ResultsThe prevalence of prostate cancer was higher in the middle-income (3.61% [n = 464]) and high-income groups (3.36% [n = 227]) than in the low-income group (1.83% [n = 84], all p < 0.001). The prevalence of breast cancer was higher in middle-income (2.86% [n = 390]) and high-income participants (3.48% [n = 218]) than in low-income participants (2.00% [n = 117], all p < 0.001). Compared with the low-income group in men (0.48% [n = 22]), a higher prevalence of colon and rectum cancer occurs in the middle-income (0.87% [n = 112], p = 0.012) and high-income groups (0.89% [n = 58], p = 0.018). The prevalence of lung cancer in women was lower in high-income participants than middle-income participants (0.10% [n = 6] vs. 0.29% [n = 39], p = 0.014). ConclusionsIncreasing disparities in cancer prevalence were identified across all socioeconomic categories analyzed in this study. To ensure the sustainable development goals, it is a global health priority to understand inequalities in health and to target interventions accordingly.

Recognition of power imbalances between clients and healthcare providers is critical to enhancing cross-cultural interactions in healthcare delivery. While cultural humility has been broadly examined in healthcare, knowledge gaps exist regarding its application in occupational therapy (OT) practice. This scoping review protocol aims to: (1) describe the extent and nature of the published health literature on cultural humility, including concepts, descriptions and definitions and practice recommendations, (2) map the findings from objective one to OT practice using the Canadian Practice Process Framework (CPPF), and (3) conduct a consultation exercise to confirm the CPPF mapping and generate recommendations for the practice of cultural humility in OT. Methods and analysis We will search Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid PsycINFO, Ebsco CINAHL Plus, ProQuest ASSIA, ProQuest Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest ERIC, WHO Global Index Medicus, and Web of Science databases. Published health-related literature on cultural humility will be included. There will be no restrictions on population or article type. Following deduplication on Endnote, the search results will undergo title, abstract, and full-text review by two reviewers working independently on Covidence. Extracted data will include descriptors of the article, context, population, and cultural humility. After descriptive extraction, data describing cultural humility-related content will be descriptively and interpretively analysed using an inductive thematic synthesis approach. The data will also be mapped to OT practice through deductive coding using the CPPF. Occupational therapists and clients will be consulted to further critique, interpret and validate the mapping and generate practice recommendations. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was not required for this scoping review protocol. We will disseminate the findings, which can enhance understanding of cultural humility in OT, facilitate cross-cultural encounters between occupational therapists and clients and improve care outcomes through publications and presentations.

Methods: Our cross-sectional observational study included ID or microbiology journals according to the 2019 Clarivate Journal Citation Reports. Journals' Q ranking, open-access status, and number and gender of editors-in-chief and editorial board members were collected from the journals' official websites. We conducted a binary gender assignment for each editor using names, pictures, and other online descriptors. Journals with over 100 editorial board members and those with over 25% of board members for whom we could not determine gender were excluded. Editorial teams with >50% women were considered women dominant. Univariate and multivariable analyses for female editor dominance were performed. Results: Overall, 167 journals were included, with total 6057 editorial members, 1655 (27.3%) of whom were women. Of 214 editors-in-chief, 48 (22%) were women, and only 25% (40 of 162) of journals had female editor-in-chief dominance. Factors associated with female dominance in the editor-in-chief role in univariate analysis were higher quartile rank, higher impact factor, and open access. Open-access journals remined significant in multivariable analysis (odds ratio (OR) 2.521; 95% CI, 1.140-5.576, p = 0.022). Larger editorial boards were less likely to have female dominance. Female editor-in-chief dominance was significantly associated with women-dominant editorial boards. Discussion: ID and microbiology journals have significantly few women as editors-in-chief and editorial board members. Understanding the reasons for this inequality is required as an important step to confront and resolve it. (C) 2022 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

On race and ethnicity during a global pandemic: An 'imperfect mosaic' of maternal and child health services in ethnically-diverse South London, United Kingdom	ECLINICALMEDICINE			English	Article						Race; Ethnicity; Equity; Discrimination; Maternity care; Obstetrics; Midwifery; Children's health; Neonatal care; Paediatrics; Qualitative research; Interviews; Grounded theory; The NHS; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Pandemic; Health services research	COVID-19	Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought racial and ethnic inequity into sharp focus, as Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic people were reported to have greater clinical vulnerability. During the pandemic, priority was given to ongoing, reconfigured maternity and children's healthcare. This study aimed to understand the intersection between race and ethnicity, and healthcare provision amongst maternity and children's healthcare professionals, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods A qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews (N = 53) was undertaken with maternity (n = 29; August-November 2020) and children's (n = 24; June-July 2021) healthcare professionals from an NHS Trust in ethnically-diverse South London, UK. Data pertinent to ethnicity and race were subject to Grounded Theory Analysis, whereby data was subjected to iterative coding and interpretive analysis. Using this methodology, data are compared between transcripts to generate lower and higher order codes, before super-categories are formed, which are finally worked into themes. The inter-relationship between these themes is interpreted as a final theory. Findings Grounded Theory Analysis led to the theory: An 'Imperfect Mosaic', comprising four themes: (1) 'A System Set in Plaster'; (2) 'The Marginalised Majority'; (3) 'Self-Discharging Responsibility for Change-Making'; and (4) 'Slow Progress, Not No Progress'. The NHS was observed to be brittle, lacking plasticity to deliver change at pace. Overt racism based on skin colour has been replaced by micro-aggressions between in-groups and out-groups, defined not just by ethnicity, but by other social determinants. Contemporaneously, responsibility for health, wellbeing, and psychological safety in the workplace is discharged to, and accepted by, the individual. Interpretation Our findings suggest three practicable solutions: (1) Representation of marginalised groups at all NHS levels; (2) Engagement in cultural humility which extends to other social factors; and (3) Collective action at system and individual levels, including prioritising equity over simplistic notions of equality.

INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL ISSUE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON RESEARCH WITH AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE POPULATIONS	AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH			English	Article							PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; STATES	The COVID-19 pandemic forced health research programs across the world to close or pause, threatening the progress of basic science, clinical and social science research, and research careers. Impacts of the pandemic on research occurring with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples, which is often conducted using community-based and -engaged approaches, offer an opportunity to understand how community-research partnerships shaped decision-making and facilitated adaptations to study design, recruitment, data collection, program implementation, and analyses. The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted AI/AN peoples, exacerbating many of the health and social inequities already being examined in community-based and -engaged research projects. The nine articles in this special issue share insights from research focused on a variety of topics from food security to diabetes prevention and parenting skills training. In the face of the pandemic, the research teams drew on experience and skills garnered by engaging the perspectives and wisdom of community partners and rooted in the principles of community-based participatory research to respond to shifting research priorities, new processes for remote consent and data collection, and increased needs for clear communication, connection, and support. Lessons from these research teams challenge us to think about how we can carry forward beneficial adaptations to best serve community needs, especially as the pandemic continues and the potential for similar global crises increases.

Ideological assumptions of Chile's international migrant healthcare policy: A critical discourse analysis	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Public policy; critical discourse analysis; interculturality; neoliberalism; social determinants of health	STRUCTURAL RACISM; RIGHTS; POWER; VULNERABILITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; IMMIGRATION; INEQUITIES; POLITICS	In the current historical moment of rewriting the Chilean Constitution, there are new hopes for producing a different socio-legal, political-economic and public health order. The Chilean case holds important implications for global health practitioners, researchers and policy-makers because it clearly shows both the impacts of neoliberal processes on a worldwide scale and neoliberal policy responses. This article contributes to the field of global health policy critical analysis by offering scrutiny of Chile's international migrant healthcare policy from the perspective of its ideological assumptions. We apply Fairclough's analytical perspective to the Chilean migrant healthcare policy, identifying its components, argumentative premises and ideological assumptions that contribute to the reproduction of the processes of social determination. It allows us to identify bias mobilisation, exclusion, and subordinate inclusion processes that systematically lead to the omission of structural processes in the social determination of migrants' healthcare, contributing to their reproduction. We conclude by problematising the place of academia in said reproduction to the extent that the concepts and premises they use remain in the ideological territory of exclusion of the structural defined by the policy, disconnecting reflection and action in the health field from collective demands.

While these policies harm all groups of immigrants, structural conditions (e.g., lack of documentation status, race, ethnicity, country of origin, and other social and legal determinants) shape how they are experienced. To address the widespread traumatic harm inflicted by racist and xenophobic policies, a group of leaders from eight Divisions of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Latinx Psychological Association (NLPA) launched an Interdivisional Immigration Project (IIP). Method: The IIP served to develop a model for collaborative advocacy, bringing together mental health providers (i.e., psychologists, social workers), allied professionals, and immigration activists from community organizations across the country. This model was developed over the course of 1 year, coinciding with the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the amplified movement for racial justice. Results: This article describes the key components of the IIP collaborative advocacy model: (a) structuring leadership in a democratic and egalitarian manner, (b) centering and uplifting immigrant voices, (c) forming teams across five U.S. regions, (d) facilitating critical dialogues grounded in liberatory practices, (e) centering trauma and empowerment, and (f) developing advocacy strategies. The IIP collaborative advocacy model is informing advocacy to protect immigrants from harm. Discussion: This model may be used as the basis for ongoing humane immigration policy activism that centers the voices of community activists, and that pushes psychologists and allied professionals to use their positionality to support community-based efforts.

J	Cheon, BK; Lee, LL				Cheon, Bobby K.; Lee, Li Ling			Subjective socioeconomic disadvantage is indirectly associated with food portion selection through perceived disruption of personal resources during a nationwide COVID-19 stay-at-home order	APPETITE			English	Article						COVID-19; Lockdown; Subjective socioeconomic status; Social inequality; Portion size selection; Eating behavior	SOCIAL-STATUS; CONSUMPTION; INEQUALITY; INCREASES; POVERTY; HEALTH	In addition to its public health implications, the global COVID-19 pandemic has also produced significant disruptions to individuals' socioeconomic resources and opportunities. Prior research has suggested that low subjective socioeconomic status (SSES) may stimulate appetite and motivate increased energy intake. Here, we tested whether individuals experiencing lower levels of SSES (SSES disadvantage) during a nationwide stay-athome order for COVID-19 exhibited preferences for larger food portion sizes through perceived disruptions to personal financial and material resources. Data was collected near the conclusion of a nationwide partial lockdown (Singapore's "Circuit-Breaker" from April to June 2020). Participants (N = 295) completed an online survey involving a measure of SSES, the Coronavirus Impacts Questionnaire, and a food portion selection task where participants estimated the portion size they prefer to consume for a range of common foods. SSES disadvantage was associated with selection of smaller average portion sizes. Yet, a significant indirect effect of coronavirus impact was observed in this relationship, such that participants experiencing greater SSES disadvantage selected larger portion sizes through the effect of greater perceived impacts of COVID-19 to one's financial/material resources (controlling for one's actual level of income). These findings further support the idea that perceived deprivation and insecurity of important resources (financial, social, material) may influence intentions to consume greater amounts of energy. Consequently, systematic societal disruptions to such resources may reinforce and perpetuate potentially obesogenic eating behaviors of populations that are especially vulnerable to such shocks (i.e., people experiencing SSES disadvantage).

J	Lee-Cheong, S; Amanullah, S; Jardine, M				Lee-Cheong, Stephen; Amanullah, Shabbir; Jardine, Mackenzie			New assistive technologies in dementia and mild cognitive impairment care: A PubMed review	ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Dementia; Mild cognitive impairment; Assistive technology; Aging-in-place; Management; Ethics	PEOPLE; SUPPORT; SYSTEM	Introduction: Dementia is characterized by global cognitive dysfunction, which can cause difficulties in performing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), leaving people with dementia (PwD) who do not have the proper support extremely vulnerable. Dementia management should involve preventative methods, including during the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Lay-caregivers are found to have poorer health in all three domains of the biopsychosocial model, as a result of the burden of care. New assistive technologies (ATs) have been designed to help care for PwD. ATs aim to be more affordable and widely available than human workers, achieving greater health equity and quality of life for all. Methods: To identify relevant articles, a literature search using PubMed was undertaken by one independent reviewer: S.L.C. The keywords of "dementia", "technology", and "management" were used, with no date of publication limitations, which revealed 571 results. Results: 44 articles were included in this review. Articles regarding new technologies to diagnose dementia or MCI were not included. ATs aim to help facilitate aging-in-place, reduce medical costs, and rates of caregiver burnout, by helping maintain patient functioning. Discussion: Legal issues in the form of workplace safety laws, data privacy laws and regulations, and health care ethics are major barriers to implementation that need to be resolved. The hope is that artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be able to advance what they are able to perceive and help uncover new knowledge and management options for dementia and MCI.

J	Smithers, D; Waitzkin, H				Smithers, Daniel; Waitzkin, Howard			Universal health coverage as hegemonic health policy in low- and middle-income countries: A mixed-methods analysis	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Health policy; Global health policy; Universal health coverage; National health insurance; National health program	MANAGED CARE; DECLARATION; POLITICS	Universal health coverage (UHC) has become an influential global health policy. This study asked whether and to what extent UHC became a "hegemonic" health policy. The article consists of three parts: a historical timeline of UHC's rise, a bibliometric analysis of UHC in the literature, and a qualitative thematic analysis of how UHC is defined and the thematic content of those definitions. The roots of UHC can be traced to policies enacted by international financial institutions (IFIs) such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the latter half of the twentieth century. These policies caused the debt of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to rise precipitously and led the same IFIs and other institutions like the World Health Organization to become involved in the development and restructuring of health systems. UHC was presented as the leading method for financing development of health systems. As the bibliometric analysis shows, UHC has come to predominate in the literature around health system reforms. The thematic analysis based on a random selection of papers obtained in the bibliometric component of the study shows that often the term is not defined or only poorly defined. There is wide variation in the definitions, with many papers mentioning concepts such as quality, access, and equity without further clarification. Usually, papers define UHC to include tiering of benefits, with discussions of financing that focus on preventing "catastrophic [individual] expenditures" rather than discussing universal budgeting of a national health care system or national health insurance. We conclude that UHC has become hegemonic within global health policy, to the exclusion of discussions about other approaches to the transformation of health systems that are not predominately based on insurance coverage such as Health Care for All system, a system which provides equal services for the entire population.

New York Neurotrauma Consortium Inc	Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Neurotrauma: Research Priorities in the New York Metropolitan Area Through a Global Neurosurgery Paradigm	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Review						Neurotrauma; New York Metropolitan Area; Structural racism; Healthcare disparities; Justice; Underrepresented minorities; Global neurosurgery	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; LENGTH-OF-STAY; REHABILITATION ADMISSION; CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS; SURGERY; PATIENT; MILD; TIME; CARE; MINORITIES	The New York Neurotrauma Consortium (NYNC) is a nascent multidisciplinary research and advocacy organization based in the New York Metropolitan Area (NYMA). It aims to advance health equity and optimize outcomes for traumatic brain and spine injury patients. Given the extensive racial, ethnic, and socio-economic diversity of the NYMA, global health frameworks aimed at eliminating disparities in neurotrauma may provide a relevant and useful model for the informing research agendas of consortia like the NYNC. In this review, we present a comparative analysis of key health disparities in traumatic brain injury (TBI) that persists in the NYMA as well as in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Examples include (a) inequitable access to quality care due to frag-mentation of healthcare systems, (b) barriers to effective prehospital care for TBI, and (c) socioeconomic challenges faced by patients and their families during the subacute and chronic postinjury phases of TBI care. This review presents strategies to address each area of health disparity based on previous studies conducted in both LMIC and high-income country settings. Increased awareness of healthcare disparities, education of healthcare professionals, effective policy advocacy for systemic changes, and fostering racial diversity of the trauma care workforce can guide the development of trauma care systems in the NYMA that are free of racial and related healthcare disparities.

A sample of 481 original, English-language tweets containing the hashtag #DomesticAbuse or #DomesticViolence posted across five consecutive weekdays from March 22 to March 27, 2020-during which many places were enacting lockdown mandates-was examined using thematic content analyses. Overall, Twitter users commented on potential increased rates of IPV, while adding details about abuse tactics that could be employed by perpetrators during the pandemic. Additionally, Twitter users disclosed personal experiences of IPV victimization. Four themes were identified, including (1) type of domestic violence (i.e. whether the violence was COVID-specific or general domestic violence), (2) commentary about IPV (i.e. general reflections, decentralizing and centralizing survivorhood), (3) perpetrator tactic (i.e. abuse tactic used by the perpetrator), and (4) institutions responsible (i.e. institutions responsible for providing services to survivors). Overall, the commentary on Twitter reflected an effort to raise awareness and share informational aid for potential victims/survivors of IPV. Data highlight the potential of social media networks in conveniently facilitating the sharing and spreading of useful resources to other users. Future research should examine whether resources shared via Twitter reach individuals who need them and empower individuals to garner support.

The collaborative development through multidisciplinary and advocate consensus of an accessible notice of rights for people with intellectual disabilities in police custody	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Intellectual disability; Accessible information; Police; Notice of rights; United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities	EASY-READ; PREVALENCE; PRISONERS	Background People with intellectual disabilities are over-represented in the criminal justice system. The United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) enshrines a right to equal access to justice for persons with disabilities (Article 13, UNCRPD). Accessible information is a key aspect of exercising this right. Yet, many jurisdictions, including Ireland, are yet to develop accessible information for disabled people who may be arrested. Aims This paper describes the collaborative development through multidisciplinary and advocate consensus of an accessible (Easy -to- Read) Notice of Rights (ERNR) for people with intellectual disabilities in police custody in Ireland. Methods Guidelines developed by Ireland's representative organisation for people with intellectual disabilities and examples of international practice were used to develop a draft ERNR by the primary researcher in partnership with an expert from a representative organisation for people with intellectual disabilities. The ERNR was developed thereafter through two focus groups with a view to achieving consensus with a focus on accessibility, accuracy and layout. This included a multidisciplinary focus group with participants from a representative organisation for people with intellectual disabilities, psychology, speech and language therapy, the police force, public health, forensic psychiatry, mental health, law and, subsequently, a focus group of people with lived experience of intellectual disability. Results Progressive development of the ERNR resulted in incremental improvements in textual accuracy as well as the inclusion of more accessible language and imagery. Originality/value This is the first attempt at developing an easy-to-read document relating to the legal rights of suspects in police custody in Ireland and, accordingly, this procedural innovation promises to assist, not just persons with intellectual disabilities, but also those with limited literacy at the point of arrest. The methodology used in the preparation of the document, employing a focus group to achieve consensus with participation from both multiple disciplines and persons with an intellectual disability, is in harmony with the ethos of the UNCPRD. This methodology may usefully be employed by other member states that have ratified the Convention but have yet to develop accessible version of the legal rights and entitlements that extend to arrested persons under their domestic law.

J	Aluh, DO; Onu, JU; Caldas-de-Almeida, JM				Aluh, Deborah Oyine; Onu, Justus Uchenna; Caldas-de-Almeida, Jose Miguel			Nigeria's mental health and substance abuse bill 2019: Analysis of its compliance with the United Nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Mental health legislation; Nigeria; UNCRPD; Coercion; Human rights	PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES; SUBSTITUTE DECISION-MAKING; UN CONVENTION; ARTICLE 12; CAPACITY; CARE; PREFERENCES; WILL; LAWS	Countries are struggling with reconciling their national mental health legislation with the CRPD approach, which stresses equality as the focal point of legislation, policies, and practices that affect people with disabilities. Several failed attempts have been made over the last two decades to update Nigeria's obsolete mental health legislation. The most recent attempt is the Mental Health and Substance abuse Bill 2019, which aims to protect the rights of people with mental health needs. It addresses many areas neglected by previous bills, such as non-discrimination of people with mental and substance use problems in the exercise of their civil, political, economic, social, full employment, religious, educational, and cultural rights. It categorically prohibits the use of seclusion in the treatment of people with mental health problems, makes provision for service users to be members of the Mental health review tribunal and allows for the protection of privacy and confidentiality of information about people with mental health problems. While keeping to most of WHO's recommendations for mental health legislation, the bill diverges from the CRPD's recommendations by allowing forced admission and treatment based on mental capacity, substitute decision-making by legal representatives or closest relatives, and non-prohibition of coercive practices. The bill does not make provisions for advance directives and is silent on informed consent to participate in research. Despite the bill's deficiencies, it would be a significant step forward for the country, whose current mental health legislation is the Lunacy Act of 1958. Although the CRPD has left it unclear how countries, especially low resource countries, should go about creating a workable legal framework, it is clear that all countries are expected to join the current global effort to eliminate, or at least reduce to the barest minimum, the use of coercion in mental health care. We expect that future revisions of this bill will examine its limitations in light of Nigeria's socio-cultural context.

J	Toolan, N; Marcus, H; Hanna, EG; Wannous, C				Toolan, Narayan; Marcus, Hannah; Hanna, Elizabeth G.; Wannous, Chadia			Legal implications of the climate-health crisis: A case study analysis of the role of public health in climate litigation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LAW; CAUSATION; IMPACTS	Background Strong scientific evidence affirms that climate change is now a public health emergency. Increasingly, climate litigation brought against governments and corporations utilizes international human rights, environmental and climate laws and policies to seek accountability for climate-destructive and health-harming actions. The health impacts of climate change make litigation an important means of pursuing justice and strategically challenging legal systems. Yet there is scant documentation in the literature of the role that public health has played in climate litigation and the legal weight public health narratives are given in such contexts. Therefore, we assessed to what extent courts of law have used public health harm in legal adjudication and sought to provide practical recommendations to address barriers to positioning legal arguments in public health-centric frames. Methods We reviewed legal databases to identify all publicly reported, documented, cases of climate litigation filed in any country or jurisdiction between 1990 and September 2020. For the 1641 cases identified, we quantified the frequency of cases where health concerns were explicitly or implicitly raised. Findings Case numbers are trending upwards, notably in high income countries. Resolution remains pending in over half of cases as the majority were initiated in the past three years. Cases were primarily based in climate and human rights law and brought by a wide range of groups and individuals predominantly against governments. About half of the decided cases found in favour for the plaintiffs. Based on this, we selected the 65 cases that were directly linked to public health. We found economic forces and pricing of health risks play a key role, as courts are challenged by litigants to adjudicate on the responsibility for health impacts. Conclusions While courts of law are receptive to public health science, significant legal reform is needed to enhance leveraging of public health evidence in legal judgements of climate litigation cases. The integration of a public health mandate into a new eco-centric legal paradigm will optimize its potential to promote human well-being-the core objective underpinning both international law, human rights, and public health. Existing legal doctrines and practices can be enhanced to increase the weight of public health arguments in climate legal action and consequently ensure legal rulings in climate litigation prioritize, protect and promote public health.

Climate adaptation actions also have significant synergies and tradeoffs with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 5 on gender equality. Questions are increasingly being raised about the gendered and climate justice implications of different adaptation options. This paper investigates if reported climate change adaptation actions are contributing to advancing the goal of gender equality (SDG 5) or not. It focuses on linkages between individual targets of SDG 5 and climate change adaptation actions for nine major sectors where transformative climate actions are envisaged. The assessment is based on evidence of adaptation actions documented in 319 relevant research publications published during 2014-2020. Positive links to nine targets under SDG 5 are found in adaptation actions that are consciously designed to advance gender equality. However, in four sectors-ocean and coastal ecosystems; mountain ecosystems; poverty, livelihood, sustainable development; and industrial system transitions, we find more negative links than positive links. For adaptation actions to have positive impacts on gender equality, gender-focused targets must be intentionally brought in at the prioritisation, designing, planning, and implementation stages. An SDG 5+ approach, which takes into consideration intersectionality and gender aspects beyond women alone, can help adaptation actions move towards meeting gender equality and other climate justice goals. This reflexive approach is especially critical now, as we approach the mid-point in the timeline for achieving the SDGs.

Paradoxically, their uptake of primary cardiovascular prevention is relatively low. New strategies are needed to tackle this public health problem. Aims of this study were to assess the uptake (as well as its determinants) and effectiveness of a primary cardiovascular prevention program for communities devised to facilitate access of disadvantaged and inclusion of ethnic minorities in addition to providing a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary personalized care. Methods and results: Single center, hospital-based, open study. All the residents in an underserved multiethnic urban community aged 40-65 years (n = 1646, 43.6% immigrants) were proactively invited by post mail to participate in a cardiovascular prevention program and different approaches were adopted to promote accessibility and inclusiveness. Program uptake was 23% and individual features independently associated with program uptake were status of immigrant (OR [CI 95%]: 3.6 [2.6-5.1]), higher educational level (3.6 [2.8-4.7]), and female gender (1.6 [1.2-2.1]). Retention was 82% at 6 months and 69% at 12 months. A predefined outcome of global cardiovascular risk improvement at 12 months in subjects with glycaemia >126 mg/dl, LDL-C >115 mg/dl, systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmHg or BMI >28 at baseline was reached in 35%, 33%, 37% and 7% of the patients, respectively. 20% of smokers quitted and significant favorable changes were reported in diet quality, anxiety, depression and physical activity. Conclusion: Access inequalities to effective prevention may be counteracted, but increasing global uptake requires further upstream sensitization and awareness actions. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Methods: Data were extracted from the GBD 2019 study. A series of comparative and descriptive analyses of the disease burden between women and men in countries with different socioeconomic development (SDI) status were performed. The slope index of inequality (SII), relative index of inequality (RII), and concentration index (CI) were calculated to measure the socioeconomic-related cross-national health inequity between 1990 and 2019. Results: The global health burden caused by COPD increased by 25.7% in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) from 59.2 million years in 1990 to 74.4 million years in 2019. Global age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) associated with COPD decreased by 40.0%, from 1537.7 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 926.1 per 100,000 population in 2019. The highest sex-specific DALY number was at age 70-74 in male and female, and female is lower than male. However, after controlling for population size, the burden of COPD is more concentrated in the population living in low SDI countries, relative health inequality indicators (RII and CI) supported this conclusion. Conclusion: The health inequalities caused by the disparity of socioeconomic status are increasing, and the increasing concentration of wealth worldwide is likely to aggravate health inequalities associated with COPD.

Simultaneously Developing Interventions for Low-/Middle-Income and High-Income Settings: Considerations and Opportunities	GERONTOLOGIST			English	Article						Health equity; Implementation science; International collaborations; Research translation; Teams; interdisciplinary; multidisciplinary	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DEMENTIA; IMPLEMENTATION; COUNTRIES; RESOURCE; REACH	Most older adults reside in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but most research dollars spent on interventions to improve the lives of older adults are awarded to researchers in high-income countries (HICs). One approach to improve the implementation of evidence-based innovations for older adults in LMICs is designing interventions that are relevant to LMICs and HICs simultaneously. We propose that researchers in HICs could partner with stakeholders in an LMIC throughout the intervention design process to better position their intervention for the implementation in that LMIC. We provide an example study from an adaptation of the Resources for Enhancing Caregiver Health II in Vietnam, which did not use this strategy but may have benefited from this strategy. We then turn to several considerations that are important for researchers to contemplate when incorporating this strategy. Finally, we explore incentives for creating interventions that are relevant to both HICs and LMICs for funders, intervention designers, and intervention receivers. Although this is not the only strategy to bring interventions to LMICs, it may represent another tool in researchers' toolboxes to help expedite the implementation of efficacious interventions in LMICs.

The frequent usage of courtesy seats by passengers who are not vulnerable individuals is an issue pertaining to public transportation. It is important to encourage the travelers to yield seats in the presence of vulnerable individuals because the latter might get seriously injured by falling if they stay on a moving vehicle. This study explores the influence of incentives and situational factors affecting individuals' decisions to yield seats to vulnerable people. Through an online questionnaire survey, 404 valid responses were obtained. The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with repeated measures was used to identify the influential factors affecting the self-reported decisions of yielding seats to vulnerable individuals. The results indicate that the situational factors (health, crowd, vulnerable passenger type, standing time after yielding seats), incentive types, and incentive amounts are significant factors affecting the decisions to yield seats. The study's findings also indicate that travelers are more sensitive to people with disabilities and pregnant women than to elderly people and children. The practical implications, including campaigning, education interventions, and incentive-based mechanism, were suggested to encourage travelers to yield seats to vulnerable individuals.

Adolescent and young adult kidney transplant recipients have the highest rate of graft loss amongst transplanted patients. It is largely accepted this is due to psychosocial and behavioural difficulties, which impact adherence to prescribed therapies. This phenomenon is not isolated to a particular healthcare system having been observed in multiple countries across different continents. It is a global issue of concern. We sought to review the psychosocial needs of these patients, and the interventions designed to meet these needs. Methods A scoping review was conducted based on Arksey and O'Malley's six-stage framework. Eligibility criteria included primary studies of any type that investigated the psychosocial needs of adolescent and/or young adult renal transplant recipients or studies which examined interventions designed to address these needs. Search strategies were developed and conducted on PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were critically reviewed using a descriptive-analytical narrative method. Results Thirty-nine studies met our inclusion criteria, 30 of which related to psychosocial needs, and the remainder examined psychosocial interventions. Four main themes were derived from our analysis of psychosocial needs literature, as follows: the need for (1) emotional support, (2) acceptance, (3) direction, (4) equality in healthcare. 2 main themes emerged from analysis of psychosocial intervention literature, namely: psychosocial (1) capability, (2) assessment. Despite the evidence that graft health is strongly associated with psychosocial wellbeing, findings revealed a significant lack of literature investigating how best to meet psychosocial needs. Trends were observed amongst intervention studies, namely interventions of novel and non-evidenced based design, with the aim of improving medication adherence through organisational strategies and education. However, literature regarding psychosocial needs showed non-adherence to therapies was not simply a result of disorganisation or lack of understanding, but rather, was founded on a recipient's idiosyncratic relationship with their prescribed therapies e.g., psychological, social or financial reasons for non-adherence. Conclusions Future research should be directed at investigating the efficacy of evidence-based interventions that empower the individual patient to overcome their specific barrier to an optimal relationship with their therapies.

J	Zuo, K				Zuo, Kun			Understanding Motivation, Career Planning, and Socio-Cultural Adaptation Difficulties as Determinants of Higher Education Institution Choice Decision by International Students in the Post-pandemic Era	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						career planning; cultural adoption; higher education; personality development; innovative learning behavior	SELF-EFFICACY; TEACHERS; CULTURE; PERSPECTIVE; CHALLENGES; DIVERSITY; ADOPTION; ONLINE; ROLES; WELL	The world is facing an unprecedented health crisis with the spread of COVID-19 across different corners of the globe. This pandemic has raised more significant concerns about international students' learning environment, personality development, and career planning, particularly in high-ranked institutes in China. Now the question concerning this dilemma is, would the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affect students' education and the country culture where they are bound to seek information and the subject education? Therefore, this study examines the impact of innovative learning environment, career planning, and socio-cultural adaptation-related difficulties faced by international students as determinants of higher education institution choice decisions made by international students in the post-pandemic era. This quantitative study examined international students in high-ranked universities across China. The data from 260 students were collected through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using the AMOS technique. Moreover, it has been observed that the current global health crisis has intensified social inequalities across different international higher education systems. Countries fail to maintain the scale of the innovative international learning environment. The results further indicated that international students are more considerate of innovative learning environments, cultural adoption, career planning, and personality development, specifically after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has drastically affected the global higher education system. Unusually, more than half of the participants wanted to maintain the option of overall distance education after the pandemic. However, apart from this argument, it is appropriate to demand significant changes in post-pandemic education adapted to the post-digital era and to satisfy the concerns and expectations of the students.

Though globally gaining more attention, GSW has been slow to develop in the Canadian social work curriculum and professional training. This deficit jeopardizes integrating environmental and climate justice and sustainability in social work research and practice in Canada. In response to this pedagogical inadequacy, this article employs a critical reflection approach to examine two authors' two-academic-year teaching-learning and supervision-training experiences of GSW-specific in-class and field education in a Master of Social Work program. The content analysis illustrates three essential components for GSW-specific teaching and training, namely adaptability, interdisciplinarity, and engageability. These components enhance the prospective social workers' micro-, mezzo-, and macro-level practices to better support individuals, families, and communities affected by extreme events and promote their health and well-being in disaster and non-disaster scenarios. These GSW-specific pedagogies shed light on the fact that integrading climate change, disasters, and diverse crises in pedagogical innovations should be encouraged beyond the social work profession. A multidisciplinary multi-stakeholder engagement approach would comprehensively investigate and evaluate the essential components and evidence-based strategies that better serve inhabitants and promote resilience and sustainability.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact/influence of scientific publications, researchers, and institutions conducting research on milk fluoridation; to explore the international and inter-institutional collaboration and illustrate scientific output trends; and to pinpoint research hotspots in milk fluoridation research. This bibliometric analysis of original research articles on milk fluoridation includes all of the original articles published in peer-reviewed journals systematically extracted from the SCOPUS database. In total, 108 articles were included in this study, with a total of 11,789 citations. A majority (67.6%) of these articles were in the subject area of 'dentistry', 22.2% externally funded, 14.8% published in the journal, Caries Research, 7.4% authored/co-authored by Twetman S, 6.5% by authors from Universidad de Chile, and the UK had the highest output (24.1%). The network visualizations showed that those countries with current/past histories of implemented milk fluoridation programs were interconnected on the network visualization map, and they were predominantly the hotspots for original research on milk fluoridation.

With the current enormous global burden of dental caries in children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, there is an urgent need for greater and more equitable funding of milk fluoridation research globally.

We used individual-level demographic and health survey data from 52 low- and middle-income countries to examine the relationship between women's social independence (measured by the Survey-based Women's emPowERment (SWPER) Global Index) and childhood immunization. The primary outcome was receipt of three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP3) among children aged 12-35 months; we secondarily examined failure to receive any doses of DTP-containing vaccines. We summarized immunization coverage indicators by social independence tertile and estimated crude and adjusted summary measures of absolute and relative inequality. We conducted all analyses at the country level using individual data; median results across the 52 examined countries are also presented. In crude comparisons, median DTP3 coverage was 12.3 (95% CI 7.9; 16.3) percentage points higher among children of women with the highest social independence compared with children of women with the lowest. Thirty countries (58%) had a difference in coverage between those with the highest and lowest social independence of at least 10 percentage points. In adjusted models, the median coverage was 7.4 (95% CI 5.0; 9.1) percentage points higher among children of women with the highest social independence. Most countries (41, 79%) had statistically significant relative inequality in DTP3 coverage by social independence. The findings suggest that greater social independence for women was associated with better childhood immunization outcomes, adding evidence in support of gender-transformative strategies to reduce childhood immunization inequities.

Using a novel dataset, we did a cross-national systematic analysis of all data sources available for government expenditures on health, HIV, COVID-19 and debt servicing in selected developing countries. We found an inadequate multilateral response with the ensuing gaps allowing both pandemics to thrive. The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the Common Framework only covered countries with a third of the global population of people living with HIV. Rising and unsustainable debt levels are limiting the capacity of governments to protect the health of their populations. Government spending is already falling in response to high debt payments. Specifically, debt servicing is crowding out lifesaving investments. In 2020, for every USD 5 available, USD 4 was spent on debt servicing. Only USD 1 was invested in health. This is a binding constraint on countries' efforts to control COVID-19. Even with a gargantuan effort to increase health expenditure, the outlook for health financing remains negative. Fiscal consolidation, with a heavy emphasis on expenditure cuts, is expected to take place across 139 countries in the coming years. These findings suggest that fiscal policymakers should be concerned about the crowding-out and constraining effects of public debt. To this end, pragmatic recommendations are made to treat and cancel debt as a critical policy lever to accelerate the end of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics in developing countries as a key condition to addressing the growing inequalities and to ensure debt can be a benefit, not a burden.

Effect of imbalanced sampling and missing data on associations between gender norms and risk of adolescent HIV	ECLINICALMEDICINE			English	Article						Gender; Bias; Gender norms; Demographic and health surveys; HIV; Global health; Gender data; Data quality	HEALTH	Background Despite strides towards gender equality, inequalities persist or remain unstudied, due potentially to data gaps. Although mapped, the effects of key data gaps remain unknown. This study provides a framework to measure effects of gender-and age-imbalanced and missing covariate data on gender-health research. The framework is demon-strated using a previously studied pathway for effects of pre-marital sex norms among adults on adolescent HIV risk. Methods After identifying gender-age-imbalanced Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) datasets, we resampled responses and restricted covariate data from a relatively complete, balanced dataset derived from the 2007 Zambian DHS to replicate imbalanced gender-age sampling and covariate missingness. Differences in model outcomes due to sampling were measured using tests for interaction. Missing covariate effects were measured by comparing fully-adjusted and reduced model fitness. Findings We simulated data from 25 DHS surveys across 20 countries from 2005-2014 on four sex-stratified models for pathways of adult attitude-behaviour discordance regarding pre-marital sex and adolescent risk of HIV. On aver-age, across gender-age-imbalanced surveys, males comprised 29.6% of responses compared to 45.3% in the gender-balanced dataset. Gender-age-imbalanced sampling significantly affected regression coefficients in 40% of model -scenarios (N = 40 of 100) and biased relative-risk estimates away from gender-age-balanced sampling outcomes in 46% (N = 46) of model-scenarios. Model fitness was robust to covariate removal with minor effects on male HIV models. No consistent trends were observed between sampling distribution and risk of biased outcomes. Interpretation Gender-health model outcomes may be affected by sampling gender-age-imbalanced data and less-so by missing covariates. Although occasionally attenuated, the effect magnitude of gender-age-imbalanced sampling is variable and may mask true associations, thus misinforming policy dialogue. We recommend future surveys improve balanced gender-age sampling to promote research reliability. Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Mosquito Habitat Mapper encourages individuals to participate in locating and removing mosquito breeding habitats from use. An easy-to-use graphic interface enables users to report and describe mosquito breeding habitats, places with standing water where immature mosquitoes grow and develop. Citizen scientists are asked to determine if they see immature mosquitoes and if they wish to count and identify any mosquito larvae they see. In the last task, the user is asked to dump out or cover the standing water source, eliminating its use as a breeding habitat. In this way, the GLOBE Observer mobile app also supports the actions of individuals protecting their communities from mosquito-borne disease. In addition, all data reported by citizen scientists are publicly available. Scientists are accessing this data for a variety of research uses, including the development of automated techniques to recognize larvae and mosquito breeding sites from digital images. Since 2017, more than 32,000 Mosquito Habitat Mapper observations have been submitted by citizen scientists in 84 countries. The GLOBE Program's GLOBE Observer Mosquito Habitat Mapper is a no-cost citizen scientist data collection tool compatible with Android and iOS devices. Available in 14 languages and 126 countries, it supports mosquito vector surveillance, mitigation, and education by interested individuals and as part of participatory community surveillance programs. For low-resource communities where mosquito control services are inadequate, the Mosquito Habitat Mapper supports local health action, empowerment, and environmental justice. The tangible benefits to human health supported by the Mosquito Habitat Mapper have encouraged its wide adoption, with more than 32,000 observations submitted from 84 countries. The Mosquito Habitat Mapper surveillance and data collection tool is complemented by an open database, a map visualization interface, data processing and analysis tools, and a supporting education and outreach campaign. The mobile app tool and associated research and education assets can be rapidly deployed in the event of a pandemic or local disease outbreak, contributing to global readiness and resilience in the face of mosquito-borne disease. Here, we describe the app, the Mosquito Habitat Mapper information system, examples of Mosquito Habitat Mapper deployment in scientific research, and the outreach campaign that supports volunteer training and STEM education of students worldwide.

In this context, farm worksites proved to be particularly prone to COVID-19 outbreaks. To apprehend this trend, we engaged an expanded and transnational employment strain framework that identified the employment demands and resources understood from a transnational perspective, as well as the immigration, labour, and public health policies and practices contributing to and/or buffering employment demands during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied mixed methods to analyze administrative data, immigration, labour, and public health policy, as well as qualitative interviews with thirty migrant farmworkers employed in Ontario and Quebec. We concluded that the deleterious outcomes of the pandemic for this group were rooted in the deplorable pre-pandemic conditions they endured. Consequently, the band-aid solutions adopted by federal and provincial governments to address these conditions before and during the pandemic were limited in their efficacy because they failed to account for the transnational employment strains among precarious status workers labouring on temporary employer-tied work permits. Such findings underscore the need for transformative policies to better support health equity among migrant farmworkers in Canada.

Methods The data from this study were collected through perinatal interviews and at the 48-month follow-up from the 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study. The main outcome was the maternal perception of children's oral health, dichotomized into positive (good/very good) and negative (fair/bad/very bad). The secondary outcome was untreated dental caries (absence and presence, according to the ICDAS index - International Caries Detection and Assessment System). For the statistical analysis, the absolute inequality index (Slope Index of Inequality - SII) and the relative concentration index (Concentration Index - CIX) were used. Analyses were stratified by maternal educational level, family income and wealth index. Results The prevalence of outcomes was 19.4% (95% CI 18.2; 20.7) for the negative maternal perception of children's oral health and 15.6% (95% CI 14.4; 16.8) for untreated dental caries. Socioeconomics inequalities were observed in negative maternal perception of children's oral health in both absolute and relative terms. A SII of -16.6 (95% CI -20.8; -12.5) was observed for family income, with higher prevalence in poor families. A higher prevalence of the negative maternal perception of children's oral health was observed in mothers without any educational level or a few years of study (CIX -21.1 [95% CI -24.5; -17.7]). Conclusions This study demonstrates socioeconomics disparities in the maternal perception of children's oral health and in the prevalence of untreated caries in children. A higher concentration of negative maternal perception of children's oral health was identified among the most socioeconomically vulnerable individuals. The findings reinforce the presence of socioeconomic inequalities in subjective measures about children's oral health.

J	Renteria, E; Zueras, P				Renteria, Elisenda; Zueras, Pilar			Macro-level factors explaining inequalities in expected years lived free of and with chronic conditions across Spanish regions and over time (2006-2019)	SSM-POPULATION HEALTH			English	Article						Healthy life expectancy; Chronic conditions; Health expenditures; Regional differences; Spain	FREE LIFE EXPECTANCY; HEALTH-CARE; EXPENDITURES; INDICATORS; COUNTRIES; MORTALITY; TRENDS; SPAIN; AGE	Life expectancy has long been associated with macro-level factors, including health expenditures, but little research has focused on the relationship with morbidity measures. This paper examines the relationship between the expected years lived free of and with chronic conditions (YLFCC and YLCC) at age 50 and macroeconomic and social factors including, for the first time, several indicators of public health expenditure. We calculate YLFCC and YLCC for Spanish regions using the Sullivan method over a long period of time (2006-2019). Spain is a good case study due to two reasons. First, its national health system is decentralized among regional administrations since 2002. Second, the financial crisis of 2008 led to public health cuts in 2010-2014 that each region handled differently. We use fixed-effects models to assess the relationship between changes in macro-level regional indicators (socioeconomic factors, healthcare resources, health behavior and public health expenditures) with YLFCC and YLCC across regions and over time. Results show that socioeconomic levels, public health expenditure, healthcare resources and health behaviors are associated with years lived free of and with chronic conditions when analyzing them independently. However, in the global model including all these dimensions only public health expenditure is associated with both YLFCC and YLCC for men and women, showing that a higher level of expenditures is correlated with more YLFCC and less YLCC. Therefore, regional authorities need to pay special attention to the level of investments on health services, as they are clearly associated with a better quality of living of the middle age and older population.

Previous research has shown that lack of support for various forms of unpaid care work and work-family conflicts have negative impacts on caregivers' mental health, especially among female caregivers. COVID-19 containment measures may exacerbate existing gender inequalities both in terms of unpaid care work and adverse mental health outcomes. This scoping review protocol describes the systematic approach to review published literature from March 2020 onwards to identify empirical studies and grey literature on the mental health impact of COVID-19 containment measures on subgroups of unpaid caregivers at the intersection of gender and other categories of social difference (eg, ethnicity, age, class) in Europe. Methods and analysis This scoping review is informed and guided by Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. We will search the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, Social Sciences Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts as well as Applied Social Sciences Index & Abstracts (ASSIA) and hand-search reference lists of selected articles to identify relevant peer-reviewed studies. We will conduct a grey literature search using Google Scholar and targeted hand-search on known international and European websites and include reports, working papers, policy briefs and book chapters that meet the inclusion criteria. Studies that report gender-segregated findings for mental health outcomes associated with unpaid care work in the context of COVID-19 containment measures in Europe will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full texts for inclusion, and extract general information, study characteristics and relevant findings. Results will be synthesized narratively. Ethics and dissemination This study is a review of published literature; ethics approval is not warranted. The findings of this study will inform public health research and policy. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						tourist behaviour; tourism; COVID-19	BRAND EQUITY; CRISIS; RISK; DISASTER; SPREAD; STAY	Nearly 20 years after the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic, we are facing another COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism behaviour of international students in Poland. We paid attention to the overall impact of the pandemic on life, travel, choice of tourist destination, tourism activity, ecotourism preference, and health and safety issues. We formulated two research questions: What areas of international student tourism behaviour were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic? What differences in travel behaviour occurred between international students from Europe and Asia? Participants were recruited from universities located in Warsaw between June and September 2020. A total of 806 questionnaires were collected, 87 of which were eliminated due to non-response. The research sample consisted of 719 people. Six factors were identified in the survey results: tourism inclination, impact on tourist destination, hygiene and accommodation, impact on life, impact on tourism, and mode of tourism. Impact on life and impact on tourism were attributed to the general impact dimension; tourism inclination and mode of tourism can be summarized as attitude and preference. Food and accommodation were assigned to hygiene and safety dimensions. In almost all aspects, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's lives was greater for Asian respondents. Asian respondents were more likely to say that they would avoid COVID-19-affected areas when choosing tourist destinations in the future, and avoid travelling to crowded large cities after COVID-19 ended. European survey participants' responses were more moderate.

According to international human rights law, everyone is entitled to an adequate standard of living, which includes adequate housing. Adequate housing, including access to water and sanitation, plays a critical role in the prevention and management of neglected tropical diseases, which affect over 1 billion people worldwide. Inadequate housing conditions represent a risk factor for many of them, e.g., Chagas disease that affects 6-8 million people worldwide, visceral leishmaniasis that kills 20,000-30,000 people/year, lymphatic filariasis which threatens 859 million people worldwide or dengue that has increased 8-10 fold over the last two decades. Vector control strategies for the above-mentioned diseases have shown their effectiveness and should include systematic and repetitive in-house spraying and individual protection (e.g., impregnated nets), as well as better-quality construction material and techniques and better sanitation infrastructures and practices. Access to adequate housing is a basic human right. The violation of the right to adequate housing may affect the enjoyment of other human rights. Access to adequate housing can strengthen (and facilitate access to) other basic human rights, such as the rights to work, health, security, and education.	[Chastonay, Anouk H.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan (GAP) for antimicrobial resistance identified five key objectives that aim to ensure the continued treatment and prevention of infectious diseases with the use of antibiotics. Countries signatory to the WHO GAP are expected to develop their own national action plans (NAPs) based on the global model. How low-income countries are able to achieve the GAP objectives is not well understood. This paper analyzes the progress of two West African countries in achieving the GAP targets, Benin and Burkina Faso, countries among the lowest bracket in the World Development Index. We present qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussions with local policy-makers, nurses, doctors, animal breeders, veterinarians, and laboratory researchers, supported by participant observations and surveys within rural communities. The analysis is organized according to the five WHO GAP objectives to show the countries' challenges in fulfilling them. The analysis shows that there are shortcomings in all of the WHO GAP areas in the two countries, making it a compounded and multifactorial problem-a stacking of lacks. In such contexts, calibrating a society toward AMR resilience/prevention requires overall development and attention to interdependencies. Active local research and policy communities with international, sustained financial support are essential for achieving the targets. IMPORTANCE The burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is unequally distributed across the globe. Low-income countries face a more severe AMR situation and have fewer means to solve the problem. This paper brings out the voices of local experts, policy-makers, and members of the community in Benin and Burkina Faso across human health, animal health, and food production sectors, where the majority of antibiotic use is concentrated. We describe the difficulties that they face in implementing global action plans, targets set by the World Health Organization, for securing antibiotics and preventing the spread of antimicrobial resistance. This paper argues that the various deficits in implementation are stacked, multisectoral, and compounded. We highlight the role of active local scientists and policy-maker networks in setting priorities to address the AMR problem; however, their activities need technical and financial support from international partners.

In this study, we estimated the technical efficiency of local public health programs for the prevention of unintentional childhood injury and explored its contribution to national trend changes and regional health disparities in Japan. Efficiency scores were estimated based on the Cobb-Douglas and translog production functions using a true fixed effects model in a stochastic frontier analysis to account for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity across prefectures. Using public data sources, we compiled panel data from 2001 to 2017 for all 47 prefectures in Japan. We treated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as the output, coverage rates of public health programs as inputs, and caregivers' capacity and environmental factors as constraints. To investigate the contribution of efficiency to trend changes and disparities in output, we calculated the predicted DALYs with several measures of inefficiency scores (2001 average, yearly average, and prefecture-year-specific estimates). In the translog model, mean efficiency increased from 0.62 in 2001 to 0.85 in 2017. The efficiency gaps among prefectures narrowed until 2007 and then remained constant until 2017. Holding inefficiency score constant, inputs and constraints contributed to improvements in average DALYs and widened regional gaps. Improved efficiency over the years further contributed to improvements in average DALYs. Efficiency improvement in low-output regions and stagnated improvement in high-output regions offset the trend of widening regional health disparities. Similar results were obtained with the Cobb-Douglas model. Our results demonstrated that assessing the inputs, constraints, output, and technical efficiency of public health programs could provide policy leverage relevant to region-specific conditions and performance to achieve health promotion and equity.

Most of these patients suffer from severe symptoms, reduced quality of life and increased numbers of hospitalisations. Outpatient palliative care can help to reduce hospitalisation rate by up to 50%. Due to the complex medical conditions and prognostic uncertainty of the course of CNMD, early interprofessional care planning among general practitioners who provide general palliative care and specialist palliative home care (SPHC) teams seems mandatory. The KOPAL study (a concept for strenghtening interprofessional collaboration for patients with palliative care needs) will test the effectiveness of a SPHC nurse-patient consultation followed by an interprofessional telephone case conference. Methods and analysis Multicentre two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial KOPAL with usual care as control arm. The study is located in Northern Germany and aims to recruit 616 patients in 56 GP practices (because of pandemic reasons reduced to 191 participants). Randomisation will take place on GP practice level immediately after inclusion (intervention group/control group). Allocation concealment is carried out on confirmation of participation. Patients diagnosed with CHF (New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification 3-4), COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage classification 3-4, group D) or dementia GDS stage 4 or above). Primary outcome is a reduced hospital admission within 48 weeks after baseline, secondary outcomes include symptom burden, quality of life and health costs. The primary analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Intervention will be evaluated after the observation period using qualitative methods. Ethics and dissemination The responsible ethics committees of the cooperating centres approved the study. All steps of data collection, quality assurance and data analysis will continuously be monitored. The concept of KOPAL could serve as a blueprint for other regions and meet the challenges of geographical equity in end-of-life care.

Improving consumer financial capability has been perceived as an approach to reducing world poverty and inequality. However, considering the development stages of countries, the best stage for promoting financial capability remains understudied. This study attempts to answer an important question: At what stage of economic development is financial capability promotion the most beneficial, with the highest returns measured in terms of quality of life? This study examines the association between consumer financial capability and quality of life at the international level and draws implications for policymakers for developing consumer financial capability. The data for this study originate from four diverse sources provided by the World Bank and United Nations. The final dataset includes data from 137 countries. Financial capability is measured using an index that combines financial knowledge and financial behavior. Quality of life is measured by the Human Development Index (HDI) and Life Evaluations provided by the World Happiness Report. The HDI comprises the components of life expectancy, expected number of years of schooling, number of mean years of schooling, and per-capita gross national income. Life evaluations are based on country averages for life assessments based on a ladder image. The results show that financial capability and quality of life are strongly correlated. However, the relationships are non-linear, and development and financial capability seem to be much more strongly linked in highly developed countries.

J	Shaikh, R; Saikia, N				Shaikh, Rufi; Saikia, Nandita			Socioeconomic inequalities in tobacco cessation among Indians above 15 years of age from 2009 to 2017: evidence from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS)	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Tobacco; Cessation; Quit; India; GATS; Socioeconomic	SMOKING-CESSATION; QUITTING SMOKING; SMOKELESS TOBACCO; CONTROL POLICY; PREVALENCE; COUNTRIES; POSITION; WOMEN	Background Tobacco is strongly associated with socioeconomic status (SES), however evidence on differences in tobacco cessation by socio-economic attributes remains fragmented, especially in developing countries. The present study aims to estimate socioeconomic inequalities in tobacco cessation among Indian men and women above 15 years of age. Methods Two rounds of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (2009-2010 and 2016-2017), India was used to estimate the association between socioeconomic indicators (wealth index and educational attainment) with tobacco cessation using a multinomial modeling approach. Results After adjusting for SES and demographic variables, we found significantly lower odds in tobacco cessation rates among respondents of GATS-2 (2016-2017) compared to GATS-1 (2009-2010). Additionally, huge regional variations in smoking and smokeless tobacco cessation rates were observed. Population belonging to the low wealth-asset score had higher odds of cessation compared to the high asset index. While greater educational attainment was seen to have a positive effect on cessation, the results were insignificant. Individuals belonging to the northeastern geographic region were seen to have the lowest odds of cessation. Though awareness about the health hazards of tobacco increased, cessation declined for both men and women. Quitting smokeless tobacco among men and women was observed to be lower than smoking. Conclusion This study is the first to provide national-level evidence on the association between tobacco cessation and socioeconomic attributes among Indians above 15 years of age. Findings suggest the need to scale up tobacco cessation services separately for men and women, and also for smoking and smokeless tobacco forms.

Previous studies have analysed the associations with family-level variables, such as a presence of domestic abuse, parental mental health problems, and substance misuse in the parental household. Other studies have looked at multiple area-deprivation as a predictor of childhood adversity, but there is a dearth of research which disentangle the associations between the rates of children in care and different forms of deprivation. This paper sheds light the statistical associations between different area-deprivation domains and the rates of infants and older children involved in care proceedings in local authorities in Wales, UK, between 2014 and 2019. Data on family court proceedings in Wales from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass Cymru), held within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, was linked to information on area-deprivation and incidence rates were computed. Employment deprivation, income, educational and health deprivation are associated with increased incidence rates. Environmental factors such as the physical, housing and access to services domain were not found to be statistically related to the risk of care proceedings. The paper advances knowledge about the wider policy context regarding how to improve the social wellbeing of children in local communities.

These causes are commonly called 'the social determinants of health'. Social inequalities are also impacting climate change and vice-versa, which, is causing profound negative impacts on planetary health. Achieving greater sustainability for human and planetary health demands that the health sector assumes a greater leadership role in addressing social inequalities. This requires equipping health and social care workers to better understand how the social determinants of health impact patients and communities. Integration of the social determinants of health into education and training will prepare the workforce to adjust clinical practice, define appropriate public health programmes and leverage cross-sector policies and mechanisms being put in place to address climate change. Educators should guide health and social workforce learners using competency-based approaches to explore critical pathways of social determinants of health, and what measurements and interventions may apply according to the structural and intermediary determinants of health and health equity. Key institutional and instructional reforms by decision-makers are also needed to ensure that the progressive integration and strengthening of education and training on the social determinants of health is delivered equitably, including by ensuring the leadership and participation of marginalized and minority groups. Training on the social determinants of health should apply broadly to three categories of health and social workforce learners, namely, those acting on global or national policies; those working in districts and communities; and those providing clinical services to individual families and patients.

The World Health Organization's Global Age-Friendly Cities movement has identified the need to develop communities that optimise health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age. Ensuring that age-friendly urban environments create the conditions for active ageing requires cities and communities to support older adults' rights to access and move around the city ('appropriation') and for them to be actively involved in the transformation ('making and remaking') of the city. These opportunities raise important questions: What are older adults' everyday experiences in exercising their rights to the city? What are the challenges and opportunities in supporting a rights to the city approach? How can the delivery of age-friendly cities support rights to the city for older adults? This paper aims to respond to these questions by examining the lived experiences of older adults across three cities and nine neighbourhoods in the United Kingdom. Drawing on 104 semi-structured interviews with older adults between the ages of 51 and 94, the discussion centres on the themes of: right to use urban space; respect and visibility; and the right to participate in planning and decision-making. These themes are illustrated as areas in which older adults' rights to access and shape urban environments need to be addressed, along with recommendations for age-friendly cities that support a rights-based approach.

Implementation of Canada's youth justice minimum age of 12: implications for children in Canada and globally	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Minimum age; Minimum age of criminal responsibility (MACR); Youth justice; Canada; Racial justice; Health equity		Youth justice minimum age thresholds vary widely and are garnering increased global attention. In 1984, legislation in Canada excluded all children under age 12 from its youth justice system, yet few studies have examined implementation of the statute. We interviewed 22 experts across Canada to understand how the law functions and to guide responses in Canada and other nations. We used an inductive, thematic analysis process. Experts reported that excluding children under 12 from Canada's youth justice system has been effective in eliminating juvenile legal processing for children under 12, and promoting responses that identify and address the root causes of children's disruptive behavior outside of the legal system. Experts noted that addressing key gaps in funding and community service provision can reduce service variation by geography, race or ethnicity, socio-economic status, and ability or disability status and can enhance youths' success. Canada's experience suggests that for optimal implementation, minimum age laws should be coupled with robust funding and sufficient service provision to achieve racial justice and health equity.

It is also a problem of inequity in medicines development, as pregnancy is a protected characteristic. The current regulatory requirements for drugs in pregnancy are being analyzed by a number of agencies worldwide. There has been considerable investment in developing expertise in pregnancy clinical trials (for the pregnant person and the fetus) such as the Obstetric-Fetal Pharmacology Research Centers funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Progress has also been made in how to define and grade clinical trial safety in pregnant women, the fetus, and neonate. Innovative methods to model human pregnancy physiology and pharmacology using computer simulations are also gaining interest. Novel ways to assess fetal well-being and placental function using magnetic resonance imaging, computerized cardiotocography, serum circulating fetoplacental proteins, and mRNA may permit better assessment of the safety and efficacy of interventions in the mother and fetus. The core outcomes in women's and newborn health initiative is facilitating the consistent reporting of data from pregnancy trials. Electronic medical records integrated with pharmacy services should improve the strength of pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacovigilance studies. Incentives such as investigational plans and orphan disease designation have been taken up for obstetric, fetal, and neonatal diseases. This review describes the progress that is being made to better understand the extent of the problem and to develop applicable solutions.

San Diego, California and Tijuana, Baja California are an interconnected region with one of the busiest international borders in the world and hundreds of thousands bi-directional crossings each day. As the sister cities witnessed the rising case numbers early in the pandemic, it became essential and urgent to implement a formal structure to facilitate cross-border COVID-19 communication, coordination, and collaboration. The present article describes how the development of a Collaborative Binational Strategy led to coordinated outreach and initiatives that addressed access and equity in the transborder region. Through examples, the article illustrates how regional leaders in San Diego and Tijuana harnessed existing transborder partnerships to collaboratively build infrastructure and communication pathways to exchange data, guidance, troubleshoot shared challenges, build capacity, and establish cross-border testing and vaccine opportunities. The challenges, lessons learned, and best practices may inform other multi-level, interdisciplinary, and cross-border jurisdictions on how to support a transborder community during a pandemic or other health emergency.

Big Data in Global Health	ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						big data; health services research; global health; epidemiology		While much has been written about the role of ???big data??? in health services research and epidemiology, there has been less exploration of the imperative of data sovereignty on informing the ethics of health services research and global health more broadly, especially in the context of decoloniality in an era of ???big data.??? In this viewpoint, epidemiologist and health services researcher Qato offers a brief exploration of some questions that may drive this effort: is ???decolonizing??? health data necessary?

Reciprocal innovation: A new approach to equitable and mutually beneficial global health partnerships	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Reciprocal innovation; global learning; global health; mutual benefit; global local		Global health researchers often discount mutual learning and benefit to address shared health challenges across high and low- and middle-income settings. Drawing from a 30-year partnership called AMPATH that started between Indiana University in the US and Moi University in Kenya, we describe an innovative approach and program for mutual learning and benefit coined 'reciprocal innovation.' Reciprocal innovation harnesses a bidirectional, co-constituted, and iterative exchange of ideas, resources, and innovations to address shared health challenges across diverse global settings. The success of AMPATH in Kenya, particularly in HIV/AIDS and community health, resulted in several innovations being 'brought back' to the US. To promote the bidirectional flow of learning and innovations, the Indiana CTSI reciprocal innovation program hosts annual meetings of multinational researchers and practitioners to identify shared health challenges, supports pilot grants for projects with reciprocal exchange and benefit, and produces educational and training materials for investigators. The transformative power of global health to address systemic health inequities embraces equitable and reciprocal partnerships with mutual benefit across countries and communities of academics, practitioners, and policymakers. Leveraging a long-standing partnership, the Indiana CTSI has built a reciprocal innovation program with promise to redefine global health for shared wellbeing at a global scale.

Methods We used data (n = 1712) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Racial/ethnic segregation was assessed using Getis-Ord (Gi*) z-scores based on American Community Survey Census tract data (higher Gi* = greater spatial clustering of participant's race/ethnicity). Global cognition and processing speed were assessed twice, 6 years apart. Adjusted multilevel linear regression tested associations between Gi* z-scores and cognition. Effect modification by race/ethnicity, income, education, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and neighborhood social support was tested. Results Participants were on average 67 years old; 43% were White, 11% Chinese, 29% African American/Black, 17% Hispanic; 40% had high neighborhood segregation (Gi* > 1.96). African American/Black participants with greater neighborhood segregation had greater processing speed decline in stratified analyses, but no interactions were significant. Discussion Segregation was associated with greater processing speed declines among African American/Black participants. Additional follow-ups and comprehensive cognitive batteries may further elucidate these findings. Highlights A study of neighborhood racial/ethnic segregation and change in cognition. Study was based on a racially and geographically diverse, population-based cohort of older adults. Racial/ethnic segregation (clustering) was measured by the Getis-ord (Gi*) statistic. We saw faster processing speed decline among Black individuals in segregated neighborhoods.

A co-designed cross-sectional mixed-methods survey was distributed to primary caregivers of children with cancer globally between April and May 2021 via several media. Caregivers were asked to rate the importance of vaccine-related questions and the median scores were ranked. Principal Component Analysis was conducted to identify underlying dimensions of caregiver concerns by World Bank income groups. Content analysis of free-text responses was conducted and triangulated with the quantitative findings. 627 caregivers from 22 countries responded to the survey with 5.3% (n = 67) responses from low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC). 184 caregivers (29%) provided free-text responses. Side effects and vaccine safety were caregivers' primary concerns in all countries. Questions related to logistics were of concern for caregivers in LMIC. A small minority of caregivers (n = 17) did not consider the survey questions important; free-text analysis identified these parents as vaccine hesitant, some of them quoting safety and side effects as main reasons for hesitancy. Healthcare providers and other community organizations globally need to provide tailored information about vaccine safety and effectiveness in pediatric oncology settings. Importantly, continued efforts are imperative to reduce global inequities in logistical access to vaccines, particularly in LMIC.

Identifying Farming Strategies Associated With Achieving Global Agricultural Sustainability	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						agriculture; input-intensive; genetically modified crops; organic agriculture; social-ecological systems; Sustainable Development Goals	SYSTEMS	Sustainable agroecosystems provide adequate food while supporting environmental and human wellbeing and are a key part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Some strategies to promote sustainability include reducing inputs, substituting conventional crops with genetically modified (GM) alternatives, and using organic production. Here, we leveraged global databases covering 121 countries to determine which farming strategies-the amount of inputs per area (fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation), GM crops, and percent agriculture in organic production-are most correlated with 12 sustainability metrics recognized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Using quantile regression, we found that countries with higher Human Development Indices (HDI) (including education, income, and lifespan), higher-income equality, lower food insecurity, and higher cereal yields had the most organic production and inputs. However, input-intensive strategies were associated with greater agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, countries with more GM crops were last on track to meeting the SDG of reduced inequalities. Using a longitudinal analysis spanning 2004-2018, we found that countries were generally decreasing inputs and increasing their share of agriculture in organic production. Also, in disentangling correlation vs. causation, we hypothesize that a country's development is more likely to drive changes in agricultural strategies than vice versa. Altogether, our correlative analyses suggest that countries with greater progress toward the SDGs of no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education, decent work, economic growth, and reduced inequalities had the highest production of organic agriculture and, to a lesser extent, intensive use of inputs.

In Eastern African countries, there exists an incongruence between readiness-economically, structurally, politically, and culturally-to create a conducive environment for healthy aging, which implies public health as well as ethical concerns. The aim of this scoping review was to explore existing evidence addressing the various ethical issues in connection with elder care in the region of Eastern Africa. Methods: We searched six databases (Africa-Wide Information, AgeLine, CINHAL, MEDLINE, APA PsycInfo, and SocINDEX) to identify peer-reviewed journal articles that could meet some eligibility criteria such as being a peer-reviewed journal article written in English, having been published in any year until July 2020, and focusing on ethical issues in the care of older people aged 60 years and older from Eastern Africa. We also searched for additional evidence in the references of included papers and web-based platforms. We included 24 journal articles and analyzed them using the inductive content analysis approach. Results: The included articles represent seven (38.9%) of the 18 countries in the Eastern African region. The articles covered six ethical concerns: lack of government attention to older persons (n = 14, 58.3%), inaccessibility of health care services (n = 13, 54.2%), loneliness and isolation (n = 11, 45.8%), gender inequalities in old age (n = 9, 37.5%), mistreatment and victimization (n = 8, 33.3%), and medical errors (n = 2, 8.3%). Conclusion: This scoping review summarized ethical issues arising in relation to providing care for older persons in the Eastern African context. In light of the rapid increase in the number of older persons in this region, it is critical for governments and responsible bodies to implement and accelerate efforts promptly to generate more evidence to inform programs and policies that improve the health and wellbeing of older persons. Further research is needed to inform global health efforts that aim at improving the lives of older persons, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

Disability inclusion in medical education: Towards a quality improvement approach	MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article							COMPETENCES; STUDENTS	The Issue The shift to a more diverse workforce that includes physicians with disabilities has gained considerable international traction. Indeed, disability inclusion is experiencing a renaissance in medical education. However, the philosophy of disability inclusion must be adjusted from one where disabled trainees are viewed as problematic and having to 'overcome' disability to one where institutions anticipate and welcome disabled trainees as a normative part of a diverse community. Observations Most trainees with disabilities will enter an unregulated, uninformed system leaving them vulnerable to under-accommodation, systems barriers and lack of informed support. Further, the perception of the super human good doctor creates disincentives for candidates to disclose their disability, creating structural barriers that the system needs to address. A less often discussed contributor to health care inequities is the inadequate training of health professional educators on disability rights and disability competencies. Indeed, the lack of education, coupled with minimal exposure to disability outside of the hierarchical patient-provider relationship, perpetuates to stereotypes and biases that impact clinical care. Approach Disability inclusion has not been reviewed through the lens of quality improvement. To close this gap, we examine the state of the science through the lens of disability inclusion and offer considerations for a quality improvement approach in medical education that addresses the global revised trilogy of World Federation for Medical Education standards of quality improvement at all three levels of education, training and practice. Conclusion We propose a vision of systems-based disability-inclusive, accessible and equitable medical education using 9 of Deming's 14 points as applicable to medical education.

The article argues that the category of group vulnerability should not be abandoned, being an opportunity for resistance, visibility, and a place for dissent: vulnerable groups can both function as a sounding board for claims and make demands for recognition, resetting the political agenda and the topics of public debate, and allow the level of collective needs to emerge from the level of individual interests, thereby guaranteeing a fairer distribution of resources. For this purpose, the article provides two definitions of group vulnerability that avoid both the risks of essentialism and of labelling outcomes. The article also analyses the political value of vulnerable groups, highlighting that it is conceivable as an enabling condition, a source of political agency and mobilisation.

J	Bryant, A				Bryant, April			Transcendent pluralism: A middle-range theory of nonviolent social transformation through human and ecological dignity: Analysis and evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING KNOWLEDGE			English	Article						human devaluation; human dignity; middle-range theory; social transformation; transcendent pluralism		Background Issues such as group bias, poverty, disempowerment, and violence contribute to poor health outcomes among at-risk populations. In all countries, there exist disparities among health status with worse health outcomes in individuals categorized as having less access to resources. Systemic forces perpetuate health inequities among at-risk populations furthering the divide between those in resource-rich environments and those afflicted by a lack of resources. The social devaluing of individuals and their environment contributes to this ongoing global suffering. Method In this article, I critically appraised the theory of transcendent pluralism: a middle-range theory of nonviolent social transformation through human and ecological dignity based on the criteria outlined by Fawcett. Conclusion The concepts identified in this theory offer nursing the tools to facilitate social change. Despite the theory lacking significant real-world nursing practice application, it has the potential to bridge nursing's ability to influence social change through research and practice.

Understanding how to govern AMR amidst evolving climatic changes is critical. Scenario planning offers a suitable approach. By envisioning alternative futures, stakeholders more effectively can identify consequences, anticipate problems, and better determine how to intervene. This study explored future worlds and actions that may successfully address AMR in a changing climate in a high-income country, using Sweden as the case. MethodsWe conducted online scenario-building workshops and interviews with eight experts who explored: (1) how promising interventions (taxation of antimicrobials at point of sale, and infection prevention measures) could each combat AMR in 2050 in Sweden given our changing climate; and (2) actions to take starting in 2030 to ensure success in 2050. Transcripts were thematically analyzed to produce a narrative of participant validated alternative futures. ResultsRecognizing AMR to be a global problem requiring global solutions, participants looked beyond Sweden to construct three alternative futures: (1) "Tax Burn Out" revealed taxation of antimicrobials as a low-impact intervention that creates inequities and thus would fail to address AMR without other interventions, such as infection prevention measures. (2) "Addressing the Basics" identified infection prevention measures as highly impactful at containing AMR in 2050 because they would contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which would be essential to tackling inequities underpinning AMR and climate change, and help to stabilize climate-induced mass migration and conflicts; and (3) "Siloed Nations" described a movement toward nationalism and protectionism that would derail the "Addressing the Basics" scenario, threatening health and wellbeing of all. Several urgent actions were identified to combat AMR long-term regardless which future un-folds, such as global collaboration, and a holistic approach where AMR and climate change are addressed as interlinked issues. ConclusionOur participatory scenario planning approach enabled participants from different sectors to create shared future visions and identify urgent actions to take that hinge on global collaboration, addressing AMR and climate change together, and achieving the SDGs to combat AMR under a changing climate.

Methods The ICDAS (International Caries Detection and Assessment System) was recorded at school on 6,825 children (52.8% females). Caries frequency and severity was expressed as a proportion, recording the most severe ICDAS score observed. Socioeconomic status (SES) was estimated by mean a standardized self-submitted questionnaire filled-in by parents. The Slope Index of Inequality (SII) based on regression of the mid-point value of caries experiences score for each SES group was calculated and a social gradient was generated, children were stratified into four social gradient levels based on the number of worst options. Multivariate regression models (Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial logistic and logistic regression) were used to elucidate the associations between all explanatory variables and caries prevalence. Results Overall, 54.4% (95%CI 46.7-58.3%) of the children were caries-free; caries prevalence was statistically significant higher in children with non-European background compared to European children (72.6% vs 41.6% p < 0.01) and to the area of living (p = 0.03). A statistically significant trend was observed for ICDAS 5/6 score and the worst social/behavioral level (Z = 5.24, p < 0.01). Children in the highest household income group had lower levels of caries. In multivariate analysis, Immigrant status, the highest parents' occupational and educational level, only one kid in the family, living in the North-Western Italian area and a high household income, were statistically significant associated (p = 0.01) to caries prevalence. The social gradient was statistically significant associated (p < 0.01) to the different caries levels and experience in children with European background. Conclusions Data show how caries in preschool children is an unsolved public health problem especially in those with a non-European background.

The present study aimed at extending previous research on life satisfaction by examining its antecedents for men and women in five countries (e.g., Italy, Poland, Romania, the UK, and Iran), with different levels of gender equality, according to the Global Gender Gap Index. Besides traditional variables (i.e., age, self-esteem and income), we also investigated the role of ambivalent sexism and gender identification. Participants were 2561 adults (54% female). Results showed the key role of self-esteem for both men and women and across countries. Gender identification was positively associated with life satisfaction, with the only exception of the more gender egalitarian country, i.e., the UK. Furthermore, in the less egalitarian countries, i.e., Italy and Iran, life satisfaction is also positively related to benevolent stereotypes toward men. Taken together, findings underline the interdependence between personal and contextual dimensions in sustaining life satisfaction, and the role of gender as a significant variable in terms of both the existence of different patterns for men and women and the effects of gender stereotypes across cultures.

However, CS without medical indications might cause complications for mothers and babies, which is a global health problem. Identifying spatiotemporal variations of CS rates in each geographical area could provide helpful information to understand the status of using CS services. Methods This cross-sectional study explored spatiotemporal patterns of CS in northeast Iran from 2016 to 2020. Space-time scan statistics and spatial interaction analysis were conducted using geographical information systems to visualize and explore patterns of CS services. Results The temporal analysis identified 2017 and 2018 as the statistically significant high clustered times in terms of CS rate. Five purely spatial clusters were identified that were distributed heterogeneously in the study region and included 14 counties. The spatiotemporal analysis identified four clusters that included 13 counties as high-rate areas in different periods. According to spatial interaction analysis, there was a solid spatial concentration of hospital facilities in the political center of the study area. Moreover, a high degree of inequity was observed in spatial accessibility to CS hospitals in the study area. Conclusions CS Spatiotemporal clusters in the study area reveal that CS use in different counties among women of childbearing age is significantly different in terms of location and time. This difference might be studied in future research to identify any overutilization of CS or lack of appropriate CS in clustered counties, as both put women at risk. Hospital capacity and distance from population centers to hospitals might play an essential role in CS rate variations and spatial interactions among people and CS facilities. As a result, some healthcare strategies, e.g., building new hospitals and empowering the existing local hospitals to perform CS in areas out of service, might be developed to decline spatial inequity.

We focus on the use of the potential years of life lost for a database that includes information from 33 OECD countries and covers the period 1990-2017. The methodology proposed by Phillips and Sul (2007) allows us to reject the existence of a single pattern of behaviour between countries for both males and females, suggesting the existence of severe health outcome inequalities. This methodology estimates the existence of four convergence clubs whose composition slightly varies when comparing the male and female cases. Some socioeconomic factors are found to be very important in explaining the forces that may drive the creation of these convergence clubs. In particular, the evolution of the economy and health policies are pivotal to understanding the creation of these estimated convergence clubs. Additionally, our results offer evidence in favor of the importance of environmental policies to explain these health outcome differences.

J	Humphreys, K; Enqvist, J				Humphreys, Kristina; Enqvist, Johan			Voicing resilience through subjective well-being: community perspectives on responding to water stressors and COVID-19	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						community-level adaptation; COVID-19; global South; social-ecological resilience; subjective well-being; transformative capacity; water justice	URBAN; GENDER; SUSTAINABILITY; CHALLENGES; ADAPTATION; INSECURITY; SYSTEMS; ACCESS	Interactions among social inequalities, environmental stressors, and shocks are illustrated through communities??? subjective experiences of water-related challenges and responses to crises. This situation is perhaps most visible in the COVID-19 pandemic???s impact on marginalized communities where climate change and systemic inequities are already threatening access to water and sanitation. It is critical to integrate dimensions related to well-being into research about vulnerable communities??? capacities and strategies for coping and adapting to such crises. Here, we investigate water-related risks to health and well-being using a subjectivity lens, a particularly useful tool for understanding community-level resilience to lesser-known stressors and crisis impacts. To inform this study, we used households??? self-reported water issues in Cape Town, South Africa???s low-income areas from before the pandemic, in addition to community responses during the pandemic. The findings show how inadequate access to water and sanitation affects people???s health and well-being, both directly by exposure to wastewater and impaired hygiene, and indirectly by creating stress and social conflict, and undermining subsistence gardening and medical self-care. However, our study also illustrates how grassroots-led responses to the COVID-19 crisis address these vulnerabilities and identify priorities for managing water to support well-being. The results demonstrate two ways that subjective perceptions of well-being can help to promote resilience: first, by identifying stressors that undermine community well-being and adaptive capacity; and second, by voicing community experiences that can help to guide crisis responses and initiatives critical for adapting to social-ecological shocks. The results have important implications for enabling transformative change that aligns efforts to address issues linked to poverty and inequality with those seeking to respond to environmental emergencies.

Visions for development and management of urban green and blue infrastructure: a citizen's perspective	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						compact green city; citizen participation; land use change; planning; urban green spaces	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; HUMAN HEALTH; BIODIVERSITY; CITIES; ECOLOGY; SPACE; PARKS; CHALLENGES; BENEFITS	Ongoing urbanization leads to problems such as densification, loss of biodiversity, and social injustice in cities. For increasing urban populations, green???blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities. Considering specific suggestions and GBI deficits that bother citizens on a local level, offers the opportunity to improve the social and ecological resilience of GBI.

Achieving Global Vaccine Equity: The Case for an International Pandemic Treaty	YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Health equity; Allocation; Vaccines; Ethics	SOLIDARITY	This paper presents an ethical argument in support of an international Pandemic Treaty. It argues that an international Pandemic Treaty is the best way to mark progress on global vaccine equity and broader issues of global pandemic preparedness and response which came to light during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Section I evaluates principles of multilateral charity, national security, and international diplomacy standardly invoked in debates about global vaccine allocation and argues that these approaches fall short. Section II explicates notions of solidarity, duties to the least well-off, and mutual aid as ethical values more fitting for an era of emerging infectious diseases. Section III relates the discussion to an international Pandemic Treaty and presents legal, pragmatic, and ethical reasons to support it. The paper concludes that in an interconnected world, fair sharing of vaccines between nations is morally mandatory.

Participatory research with a rural Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation: lessons learned using the CONSIDER statement	RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH			English	Article						Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander; chronic disease; ethics; group model building; health services; Indigenous; Oceanic ancestry group; participatory action; research rural health services	PEOPLES; ENGAGEMENT	Context: In Australia, Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs) are geographically proximal to where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People reside and are valued for providing holistic and culturally safe primary health care. Partnering with ACCHOs in research is appropriate for redressing health inequities experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, which includes a high burden of chronic disease. Historically, some approaches to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research have been unethical. Greater accountability in the research process, transparency in reporting, and use of culturally appropriate research methodologies are key recommendations to improving the ethical integrity of research. The need for strengthening the reporting of health research involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People and Indigenous peoples globally led to the development of the CONSollDated critERia for strengthening the reporting of health research involving Indigenous peoples (CONSIDER statement), which is a synthesis of international ethical guidelines. This project report uses the CONSIDER statement to critically reflect on participatory research undertaken in partnership with an ACCHO in the rural context and to identify lessons of value for future research. Issue: By using the CONSIDER statement as a tool for critical reflection, it was identified that processes used to establish a research partnership with an ACCHO were key to setting the research agenda, including identifying ethical issues, the needs of local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and expectations from the research. The participation of Aboriginal community members throughout the entire research process was not only methodologically important but was also ethically appropriate. Research activities in this project included opportunities for Aboriginal community members to directly share their perspectives and experiences and develop local solutions to issues affecting them. Outcomes included evidence to support future funding applications, community-derived priorities that assisted with government reporting, and locally identified methods for addressing chronic disease management. Key to this was building the research capacity and capability of local Aboriginal community members, which also reflected the ethical principles of reciprocity and equity. This also provided opportunities for non-Indigenous researchers to learn from local Aboriginal community members and develop skills in culturally appropriate research. Lessons learned: Using the CONSIDER statement was beneficial in enabling researchers to critically reflect on a participatory research project undertaken in partnership with a rural ACCHO. Researchers identified that participatory approaches can be used to generate research of relevance to local Aboriginal community members and their ACCHOs, and to support health service reporting, and future funding applications. Research timelines and activities needed to be flexible and adaptable, to allow for staff turnover and unforeseen events of cultural significance. Similarly, it is important for researchers to be receptive to change and open to learning. Although research partnerships are established on trust and mutual respect, it is recommended that greater formal provisions are required to protect the intellectual property of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities involved in research. These lessons are likely to be transferrable to other settings and are of value to researchers seeking to partner with ACCHOs in research.

To benchmark global health governance for equity and solidarity, it becomes necessary to reflect on the current state of indices or assessment tools evaluating health governance across countries. This scoping review aims to review the existing multicountry indices and assessment tools applied globally with measurable indicators assessing health governance; summarise their differences and commonalities; identify the lessons learnt through analysis of their advantages and gaps; and evaluate the feasibility and necessity to establish a new index or consensus framework for assessing global health governance. Methods and analysis This scoping review protocol follows Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework, the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses methodology for scoping reviews. Key information sources will be bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection), grey literature and citation tracking. The time frame will be from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2021. Only indices or assessment tools that are globally applicable and provide measurable indicators of health governance will be eligible. A qualitative content analysis will follow the proposed data extraction form to explicate and compare each eligible index or assessment tool. An analysis based on a proposed preliminary evaluation framework will identify the advantages and gaps and summarise the lessons learnt. This scoping review will also discuss the feasibility and necessity of developing a new global health governance index or consensus framework to inform future research and practices. Ethics and dissemination This scoping review does not require ethics approval. Dissemination will include a peer-review article, policy briefs and conference presentations.

Several studies have shown that living in disadvantaged areas is associated with a higher frequency of stroke, worse severity at presentation, increased level of dependency and higher mortality rates. However, few studies have explored the association between an individual's socioeconomic characteristics and stroke care. Our study aimed to determine if living standards are associated with stroke unit access for patients admitted to hospital for acute ischaemic stroke. Methods Using the EDP-Sante French administrative database, all patients admitted to hospital for acute ischaemic stroke between 2014 and 2017 were selected. Acute ischaemic stroke corresponded to hospital stay with International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision codes I63 or I64 as the main diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify if standard of living was associated with likelihood of admission to a stroke unit. Results In all, 14,123 acute care episodes were identified, corresponding to 335,273 episodes in the general population when appropriately weighted. Of these, 52.9% were admitted to a stroke unit. Being in the first (i.e., poorest) living standard quartile was associated with lower likelihood of admission to a stroke unit compared with the fourth (i.e., wealthiest) quartile, and was associated with a higher likelihood of paralysis and language disorder, and death at 1 year. Conclusion A low living standard was associated with lower likelihood of admission to a stroke unit as well as a greater chance of paralysis and aphasia at the end of hospitalization and a higher possibility of death at 1 year after stroke. Greater access to stroke units for disadvantaged people should be promoted.

Additionally, to specifically investigate whether the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) have been considered in these AI developments or not. We conducted a scoping review of the literature, which covered publications from March 2020 to April 2021. Studies mentioning biases on AI algorithms developed for contact tracing and medical triage or risk prediction regarding COVID-19 were included. From 1054 identified articles, 20 studies were finally included. We propose a typology of biases identified in the literature based on bias, limitations and other ethical issues in both areas of analysis. Results on health disparities and SDOH were classified into five categories: racial disparities, biased data, socio-economic disparities, unequal accessibility and workforce, and information communication. SDOH needs to be considered in the clinical context, where they still seem underestimated. Epidemiological conditions depend on geographic location, so the use of local data in studies to develop international solutions may increase some biases. Gender bias was not specifically addressed in the articles included. The main biases are related to data collection and management. Ethical problems related to privacy, consent, and lack of regulation have been identified in contact tracing while some bias-related health inequalities have been highlighted. There is a need for further research focusing on SDOH and these specific AI apps.

Existing models of medical care are not tailored to the specific medical care needs of people with IDD. This study aims to provide an improved understanding of which aspects constitute medical care for people with IDD by exploring how international researchers and practitioners describe this care, using concept mapping. Methods Twenty-five experts (researchers and practitioners) on medical care for people with IDD from 17 countries submitted statements on medical care in their country in a brainstorming session, using an online concept mapping tool. Next, they sorted all collected statements and rated them on importance. Results Participants generated statements that reflect current medical and health care practice, their ideas on good practice, and aspirations for future medical and health care for people with IDD. Based on the sorting of all statements, a concept map was formed, covering 13 aspects that characterize medical and health care for people with IDD across nations. The 13 aspects varied minimally in importance ratings and were grouped into five overarching conceptual themes: (i) active patient role, (ii) provider role, (iii) context of care, (iv) consequences of care for people with IDD, and (v) quality of care. Conclusions The themes, clusters and statements identified through this explorative study provide additional content and context for the specific patient group of people with IDD to the dimensions of previous models of medical care.

AUSTRALIAN SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						Mental Health; Practice Research; Pedagogy; Curriculum Review; Future Of Mental Health Social Work Practice; Tertiary Education; Mental Health Social Workers; Academia; Australia	EDUCATION; AUSTRALIA; INVOLVEMENT; RECOVERY	The Australian social work course accreditation standards aim to ensure graduates have an understanding of the social, cultural, and political structures that influence psychosocial wellbeing. Unlike the previous standards, the current standards do not require the curricula to address specific knowledge and skills for working with people who live with severe mental distress or mental health conditions that might result in diagnoses such as schizophrenia, personality disorders, and bipolar disorder. Anticipating the revision of curricula resulting from these recent changes to the accreditation standards, four social work academics from across three Australian universities engaged in a peer review of mental health social work curricula. By exploring the purpose, emphasis, and challenges in curriculum design, this stage of the review aimed to identify the positioning of future curricula to prepare graduates who embrace the complex array of opportunities and demands of social work practice in this field. Our investigations confirmed diversity in mental health social work practice, revealing mental health social work curricula must meet multiple and evolving agendas. IMPLICATIONS International calls for transformative approaches to mental health present opportunities for enhanced recognition of the social justice orientation of social work. The absence of an accreditation requirement to address social work practice with people who live with severe mental distress or low prevalence mental health conditions might prove a regrettable gap in Australian Social Work Education Accreditation Standards 2021. Further collegial discussion and debate about the beneficial outcomes of mental health social work curricula are desirable.

The diverse human cultures, ecological communities, and biogeochemical cycles of this tenth of the planet depend on the persistence of frozen conditions. The complexity, immensity, and remoteness of permafrost ecosystems make it difficult to grasp how quickly things are changing and what can be done about it. Here, we summarize terrestrial and marine changes in the permafrost domain with an eye toward global policy. While many questions remain, we know that continued fossil fuel burning is incompatible with the continued existence of the permafrost domain as we know it. If we fail to protect permafrost ecosystems, the consequences for human rights, biosphere integrity, and global climate will be severe. The policy implications are clear: the faster we reduce human emissions and draw down atmospheric CO2, the more of the permafrost domain we can save. Emissions reduction targets must be strengthened and accompanied by support for local peoples to protect intact ecological communities and natural carbon sinks within the permafrost domain. Some proposed geoengineering interventions such as solar shading, surface albedo modification, and vegetation manipulations are unproven and may exacerbate environmental injustice without providing lasting protection. Conversely, astounding advances in renewable energy have reopened viable pathways to halve human greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and effectively stop them well before 2050. We call on leaders, corporations, researchers, and citizens everywhere to acknowledge the global importance of the permafrost domain and work towards climate restoration and empowerment of Indigenous and immigrant communities in these regions.

The Global Need for Easy and Valid Assessment Tools for Orofacial Pain	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						facial pain; temporomandibular joint disorders; patient outcome assessment; reproducibility of results; global health; health equity	DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; DISEASES	The World Health Organization recently adopted a historic resolution (WHA74.5) on the urgent need for global oral health improvement. This resolution is particularly relevant in the perspective of the high prevalence of untreated oral diseases. However, one important aspect has been mentioned only in passing, namely that poor oral health often leads to orofacial pain, which is the most common reason for emergency dental visits worldwide. Therefore, an evidence-based decision-making process on oral health should include data related to orofacial pain complaints. To that end, the availability of reliable and valid assessment tools of orofacial pain and related treatment outcomes is essential. INfORM (International Network for Orofacial Pain and Related Disorders Methodology) of the International Association for Dental Research has been one of the driving forces behind the development and implementation of comprehensive sets of tools for such assessments. However, as a prerequisite for the desired global implementation, reliable and valid tools that are also brief, easy to translate, and culturally adaptable need to be further developed and tested. Some of the groundwork to facilitate this process has already been carried out. In addition, a working group within INfORM has developed a short clinical assessment tool for orofacial pain diagnostics that is near completion and will soon be ready for dissemination. Ultimately, reliable and valid orofacial pain assessment is a necessary step toward the development and implementation of appropriate "best buy" interventions that address this major driver of need for oral health care worldwide.

European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology Advisory Committee in Radiation Oncology Practice consensus recommendations on patient selection and dose and fractionation for external beam radiotherapy in early breast cancer	LANCET ONCOLOGY			English	Review							TARGET VOLUME DELINEATION; CARCINOMA IN-SITU; CONSERVING SURGERY; INTRAOPERATIVE RADIOTHERAPY; UK STANDARDIZATION; REPORTED OUTCOMES; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; FEMALE BREAST; FAST-FORWARD; IRRADIATION	High-quality randomised clinical trials testing moderately fractionated breast radiotherapy have clearly shown that local control and survival is at least as effective as with 2 Gy daily fractions with similar or reduced normal tissue toxicity. Fewer treatment visits are welcomed by patients and their families, and reduced fractions produce substantial savings for health-care systems. Implementation of hypofractionation, however, has moved at a slow pace. The oncology community have now reached an inflection point created by new evidence from the FAST-Forward fivefraction randomised trial and catalysed by the need for the global radiation oncology community to unite during the COVID-19 pandemic and rapidly rethink hypofractionation implementation. The aim of this paper is to support equity of access for all patients to receive evidence-based breast external beam radiotherapy and to facilitate the translation of new evidence into routine daily practice. The results from this European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology Advisory Committee in Radiation Oncology Practice consensus state that moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy can be offered to any patient for whole breast, chest wall (with or without reconstruction), and nodal volumes. Ultrafractionation (five fractions) can also be offered for non-nodal breast or chest wall (without reconstruction) radiotherapy either as standard of care or within a randomised trial or prospective cohort. The consensus is timely; not only is it a pragmatic framework for radiation oncologists, but it provides a measured proposal for the path forward to influence policy makers and empower patients to ensure equity of access to evidence-based radiotherapy.

Numerous studies have documented the negative mental health consequences experienced by communities of color due to negative experiences with law enforcement (Muchow & Amuedo-Dorantes, 2020; Smith et al., 2019). The goal of this special issue of the Psychology of Violence is to spotlight and encourage research that informs the development of effective policies and practices to reduce systemic violence and improve relationships between the police and the communities they serve. Method: This special issue includes 10 articles. These studies use a variety of methods including cross-sectional quantitative surveys (n = 4), qualitative focus groups and interviews (n = 4), experiments (n = 1), and critical reviews (n = 1). Results: Several themes emerge from these studies: (a) there are high levels of fear and mistrust between communities of color and law enforcement; (b) some exemplary police officers have developed strategies to de-escalate conflict and rebuild community trust; (c) White Americans who believe there is systemic racial injustice are more likely to be supportive of Black Lives Matter protests; and (d) police violence against Black communities is a global concern. Discussion: There is much still to be learned regarding the long-term impact of fear and mistrust of the police on communities of color and how to mitigate these impacts through trauma-informed interventions. Programs and policies are needed to address the historic roots of systemic racism in law enforcement. Conclusion: There are opportunities to address the historic and contemporary issues that impact police and community relations and address systemic violence in policing. These articles present a call to action to advance social justice in policing and address the long term trauma that exists in communities disproportionately impacted by police violence.

This study, part of the DETERMIND (DETERMinants of quality of life, care and costs, and consequences of INequalities in people with Dementia and their carers) programme, investigates socioeconomic inequality and inequity in the utilisation of long-term care for older people with and without dementia in England. The data come from three waves of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA, Waves 6-8, N = 16,458). We find that older people with dementia have higher levels of care needs and a lower socioeconomic status than those without dementia. The distribution of formal and informal care is strongly pro-poor. When care needs are controlled for, there is no significant inequality of formal or informal care among people with dementia, nor of informal care among people without dementia, but there is a significant pro-rich distribution of formal care among people without dementia. Unmet care needs are significantly concentrated among poorer people, both with and without dementia. We argue that the long-term care system in England plays a constructive role in promoting socioeconomic equality of long-term care for people with dementia, but support for older people with lower financial means and substantial care needs remains insufficient. Increased government support for older people is needed to break the circle between care inequality and health inequality.

J	Chirwa, GC				Chirwa, Gowokani Chijere			Explaining socioeconomic inequality in cervical cancer screening uptake in Malawi	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Cervical cancer; Erreygers index; Inequality; Concentration index; Malawi	MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; GLOBAL BURDEN; PREVENTION; BARRIERS; KNOWLEDGE; WOMEN; FACILITATORS; PREVALENCE; PREDICTORS; CHALLENGES	Background Cervical cancer is a prevalent public health concern and is among the leading causes of death among women globally. Malawi has the second highest cervical cancer prevalence and burden in the world. Due to the cervical cancer burden, the Malawi government scaled up national cancer screening services in 2011, which are free for all women. This paper is the first study to examine the socioeconomic inequality in cervical cancer screening uptake using concentration indices, in Malawi. Furthermore, it decomposes the concentration index to examine how each factor contributes to the level of inequality in the uptake of cervical cancer screening. Methods The data used in this paper were obtained from the nationally representative Malawi Population HIV Impact Assessment (MPHIA) household survey, which was conducted in 2015. Concentration curves were constructed to explore whether there was any socioeconomic inequality in cervical cancer screening and, if so, its extent. This was complemented by concentration indices that were computed to quantify the magnitude of socioeconomic inequality. A decomposition analysis was then conducted to examine the factors that explained/were associated with greater socioeconomic inequality in cervical cancer screening. The methodology in this paper followed that of previous studies found in the literature and used the wealth index to measure socioeconomic status. Results The results showed that the concentration curves lay above the line of equality, implying a pro-rich inequality in cervical cancer screening services. Confirming the results from the concentration curves, the overall concentration index was positive and significant (0.142; %95 CI = 0.127, 0.156; p < 0.01). The magnitude was lower in rural areas (0.075; %95CI = 0.059, 0.090; p < 0.01) than in urban areas (0.195; %95CI = 0.162, 0.228 p < 0.001). After undertaking a decomposition of the concentration index, we found that age, education, rural or urban location, and wealth status account for more than 95% of the socioeconomic inequality in cervical cancer uptake. Conclusion Despite the national scale-up of free cancer care at the point of use, cervical cancer screening uptake in Malawi remains pro rich. There is a need to implement parallel demand-side approaches to encourage uptake among poorer groups. These may include self-testing and mobile screening centres, among others.

Infants who are untreated can experience severe malnutrition and extreme social stigma resulting in abandonment. Utilities are standardized measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) that inform health care resource allocation. However, CL/P utilities are missing from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). OBJECTIVE To elicit utilities for untreated and surgically treated children with CL/P with consideration for social determinants of health from patient-proxy and societal participants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used patient proxies and societal participants in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from July 1, 2019, to January 30, 2020. Eligible patient proxies were caregivers of children younger than 18 years with nonsyndromic CL/P who were untreated or received surgery. Proxies were necessary as most patients were 0 to 4 years old and cannot reliably self-report. Eligible societal participants were 18 years and older with no family history of CL/P. EXPOSURES Surgical treatment and social determinants of health. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participants measured utilities using the visual analog scale (VAS), time trade-off (TTO), and standard gamble (SG). RESULTS In this study, 312 patient proxies and 135 societal participants were recruited. Mean (SD) utilities for untreated CL/P ranged from 0.57 (0.23) to 0.70 (0.22) from patient proxies and from 0.35 (0.21) to 0.8 (0.23) from societal participants, depending on utility instrument and cleft type. Surgical treatment was associated with a better HRQOL from the patient-proxy perspective (VAS, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.26; TTO, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.25) from the societal perspective (VAS, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.16 to 026; TTO, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.22; SG, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.15). Social determinants of health that were associated with patient-proxy utilities were income above the national mean (VAS, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.17; TTO, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.20), and religion (Christian vs other: TTO, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.03). From the societal perspective, the association between treatment and utilities was smaller in females compared with males (TTO, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study suggest that CL/P disease severity and surgical impact in Ethiopia were undervalued by previous estimates from high-income countries and were associated with social determinants of health. Utility studies from participants from LMICs are feasible and necessary for representing HRQOL in LMICs and addressing health inequalities.

J	Dadhich, AP; Dadhich, PN; Goyal, R				Dadhich, Ankita Pran; Dadhich, Pran N.; Goyal, Rohit			Synthesis of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) spatial pattern in rural India: an integrated interpretation of WaSH practices	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Water-sanitation-hygiene; Spatial assessment; Defecation practices; WaSH index; SVMR models; GIS	INTERVENTIONS; DISEASES; HEALTH	Rural areas largely lack access to improved drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) facilities in India. This requires documentation of WaSH practices at the local level for better understanding and sustainable development. In this paper, a global positioning system (GPS)-based household survey was carried out in 67 villages of Phagi tehsil using individual questionnaires to evaluate the existing WaSH conditions spatially at the panchayat level. Three sub-indices were used for WaSH risk areas mapping and prediction with the integration of machine learning algorithms. Survey results indicate the improvement in the availability of toilet facilities; however, a gap was found between toilet ownership and its usage by villagers. Data show that only six panchayats have almost zero open defecation practices among the 32 panchayats of Phagi tehsil. The findings highlight that presence of toilets in house, water supply in toilets, and high literacy rate lead to an increase in toilet usage by the population. WaSH index scores indicate that panchayats like Mandawari, Mendwas, Chandma Kalan, and Rotwara have worst conditions and fall in the high-risk category. Moreover, support vector machine regression (SVMR) results reveal that WaSH scores are mainly affected by open defecation (r = 0.94), water supply in toilets (r = 0.92), and female members' participation in sanitation facilities decision-making (r = 0.53), followed by literacy rate (r = 0.33). Findings demonstrate the association between gender inequalities and WaSH conditions, and the potential of the WaSH index as a monitoring tool by local policymakers to shrink the WaSH gaps.

SESPAS Report 2022	GACETA SANITARIA			English	Review						Sex, Gender, Sex-differences, gender bias; COVID-19, Disease outbreaks analysis; Disease outbreak statistics and numerical		We failed to adequately launch a gender transformative response to COVID-19 pandemic, data by sex on a variety of indicators for most countries are hard to find. Some symptoms reported as common of COVID-19 infection, are more prominent in men, while others are more prominent in women, one cannot with certainty exclude that some of the differences observed could be due to gender bias in the management of cases in health services. The gender implications of the pandemic reach wide and far. Inequalities can be further aggravated as sex and gender intersect with other axes of inequality. The SAGER guidelines exemplify an effort to improve reporting of sex and gender dimensions and encouraging researchers to integrate these aspects in the research design. these observations and emerging evidence about the persistent gender-blind approach to COVID-19 is a wake-up call to change course. National Gender Equality Institutions can be central in ensuring gender matters are considered in government responses. COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to reverse the trend and take action to apply an intersectional feminist approach to global health that enables a just and equal world where everyone's health and wellbeing matter.

After achieving open defecation-free (ODF) status through efforts such as Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), communities (particularly vulnerable households) may revert to open defecation, especially when toilet collapse is common and durable toilets are unaffordable. Accordingly, there is increasing interest in pro-poor sanitation subsidies. OBJECTIVES: This study determined the impacts of a pro-poor sanitation subsidy program on sanitation conditions among the most vulnerable households and others in the community. METHODS: In 109 post-ODF communities in Northern Ghana, we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate a pro-poor subsidy program that identified the most vulnerable households through community consultation to receive vouchers for durable toilet substructures. We surveyed households to assess toilet coverage, quality, and use before and after the intervention and tracked program costs. RESULTS: Overall, sanitation conditions deteriorated substantially from baseline to endline (average of 21 months). In control communities (not receiving the pro-poor subsidy), open defecation increased from 25% (baseline) to 69% (endline). The subsidy intervention attenuated this deterioration (open defecation increased from 25% to only 54% in subsidy communities), with the greatest impacts among voucher-eligible households. Noneligible households in compounds with subsidized toilets also exhibited lower open defecation levels owing to in-compound sharing (common in this context). CLTS followed by the subsidy program would benefit more households than CLTS alone but would cost 21-37% more per household that no longer practiced open defecation or upgraded to a durable toilet. DISCUSSION: Sanitation declines, often due to toilet collapse, suggest a need for approaches beyond CLTS alone. This subsidy program attenuated declines, but durable toilets likely remained unaffordable for noneligible households. Targeting criteria more closely aligned with sanitation inequities, such as household heads who are female or did not complete primary education. may help to generate greater and more sustainable impacts in Northern Ghana and. potentially, other contexts facing toilet collapse and limited market access.

Ambient Air Pollution and Socioeconomic Status in China	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article							HUKOU SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENTAL INEQUALITY; EXPOSURE; PM2.5; POLLUTANTS; PARTICLES; EMISSIONS; MIGRATION; EQUALITY	BACKGROUND: Air pollution disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) are well documented for the United States, with most literature indicating an inverse relationship (i.e., higher concentrations for lower-SES populations). Few studies exist for China, a country accounting for 26% of global premature deaths from ambient air pollution. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to test the relationship between ambient air pollution exposures and SES in China. METHODS: We combined estimated year 2015 annual-average ambient levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter [PM <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)] with national demographic information. Pollution estimates were derived from a national empirical model for China at 1-km spatial resolution; demographic estimates were derived from national gridded gross national product (GDP) per capita at 1-km resolution, and (separately) a national representative sample of 21,095 individuals from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2015 cohort. Our use of global data on population density and cohort data on where people live helped avoid the spatial imprecision found in publicly available census data for China. We quantified air pollution disparities among individual's rural-to-urban migration status; SES factors (education, occupation, and income); and minority status. We compared results using three approaches to SES measurement: individual SES score, community-averaged SES score, and gridded GDP per capita. RESULTS: Ambient NO2 and PM2.5 levels were higher for higher-SES populations than for lower-SES population, higher for long-standing urban residents than for rural-to-urban migrant populations, and higher for the majority ethnic group (Han) than for the average across nine minority groups. For the three SES measurements (individual SES score, community-averaged SES score, gridded GDP per capita), a 1-interquartile range higher SES corresponded to higher concentrations of 6-9 mu g/m(3) NO2 and 3-6 mu g/m(3) PM2.5; average concentrations for the highest and lowest 20th percentile of SES differed by 41-89% for NO2 and 12-25% for PM2.5. This pattern held in rural and urban locations, across geographic regions, across a wide range of spatial resolution, and for modeled vs. measured pollution concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple analyses here reveal that in China, ambient NO2 and PM(2)(.5 )concentrations are higher for high-SES than for low-SES individuals; these results are robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. Our findings are consistent with the idea that in China's current industrialization and urbanization stage, economic development is correlated with both SES and air pollution. To our knowledge, our study provides the most comprehensive picture to date of ambient air pollution disparities in China; the results differ dramatically from results and from theories to explain conditions in the United States.

Quantifying the climate benefits of a virtual versus an in-person format for an international conference	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Climate change; Planetary health; Environmental health; Global health; Public health; Academic conferences; Virtual conferences; Accessibility	CARBON FOOTPRINT; AIR-TRAVEL; HEALTH	Background Academic institutions across the globe routinely sponsor large conferences. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many conferences have used all- or partially virtual formats. The conversion of the 2021 Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH) conference, originally planned in-person for Houston, TX USA to an all-virtual format provided an opportunity to quantify the climate-related impacts of in-person versus virtual conferences. Methods From the 2021 CUGH conference registration data, we determined each registrant's distance from Houston. Using widely available, open-source formulas, we calculated the carbon footprint of each registrant's round-trip drive or flight had they traveled to Houston. We assumed that registrants traveling more than 300 miles would have flown, with the remainder traveling by automobile. Results Of 1909 registrants, 1447 would have traveled less than 4000 miles, and 389 would have traveled more than 10,000 miles round trip. Total travel-related carbon emissions were estimated at 2436 metric tons of CO2, equivalent to the conservation of 2994 acres of forest for a year. Conclusions Organizations can now readily quantify the climate cost of annual conferences. CUGH's annual international conference, when held in-person, contributes significantly to carbon emissions. With its focus on promoting global health equity, CUGH may play a lead role in understanding the pros and cons for planetary health of in-person versus virtual conferences. CUGH and other organizations could routinely measure and publish the climate costs of their annual conferences.

However, these efforts would be in vain if not properly communicated, especially to financial institutions and investors, as they are the fundamental and supportive stakeholders. Through non-financial disclosure, indeed, this greater transparency would translate into benefits, such as creditworthiness, lower risks and costs of capital. From these considerations, this study aims at verifying to what extent the implementation of sustainability strategies can affect the overall cost of capital, observed in its dual form: debt and equity. In particular, through panel data analyses, it tested how non-financial disclosure-measured by Bloomberg's disclosure scores-could influence the cost of capital of a sample of 73 international agricultural firms observed from 2015 to 2019. The results showed a significant and negative relationship, suggesting that a higher level of disclosure could be effective in lowering firms' financial burden. This study contributes to the literature on non-financial disclosure and cost of capital as it studies this phenomenon in a sector in which previous research is limited.

Fossil fuel combustion is the major source. Hypothesis Mapping air pollution's health impacts at the community level using publicly available data and open-source software will provide a replicable strategy for catalyzing pollution prevention. Methods Using EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis (BenMAP-CE) software and state data, we quantified the effects of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution on disease, death and children's cognitive function (IQ Loss) in each city and town in Massachusetts. To develop a first-order estimate of PM2.5 pollution's impact on child IQ, we derived a concentration-response coefficient through literature review. Findings The annual mean PM2.5 concentration in Massachusetts in 2019 was 6.3 mu g/M-3, a level below EPA's standard of 12 mu g/M-3 and above WHO's guideline of 5 mu g/M-3. In adults, PM2.5 pollution was responsible for an estimated 2780 (Confidence Interval [CI] 2726 - 2853) deaths: 1677 (CI, 1346 - 1926) from cardiovascular disease, 2185 (CI, 941-3409) from lung cancer, 200 (CI, 66-316) from stroke, and 343 (CI, 222-458) from chronic respiratory disease. In children, PM2.5 pollution was responsible for 308 (CI, 105-471) low-weight births, 15,386 (CJ, 5433-23,483) asthma cases, and a provisionally estimated loss of nearly 2 million Performance IQ points; IQ loss impairs children's school performance, reduces graduation rates and decreases lifetime earnings. Air-pollution-related disease, death and IQ loss were most severe in low-income, minority communities, but occurred in every city and town in Massachusetts regardless of location, demographics or median family income. Conclusion Disease, death and IQ loss occur at air pollution exposure levels below current EPA standards. Prevention of disease and premature death and preservation of children's cognitive function will require that EPA air quality standards be tightened. Enduring prevention will require government-incentivized transition to renewable energy coupled with phase-outs of subsidies and tax breaks for fossil fuels. Highly localized information on air pollution's impacts on health and on children's cognitive function has potential to catalyze pollution prevention.

Modeling global 80-80-80 blood pressure targets and cardiovascular outcomes	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; MORTALITY; RISK; PREVENTION; PROGRESS; TRENDS	As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) present major challenges for health systems. In this study, we analyzed the effects of better population blood pressure control in the context of a proposed 80-80-80 target: 80% of individuals with hypertension are screened and aware of their diagnosis; 80% of those who are aware are prescribed treatment; and 80% of those on treatment have achieved guideline-specified blood pressure targets. We developed a population CVD model using country-level evidence on CVD rates, blood pressure levels and hypertension intervention coverage. Under realistic implementation conditions, most countries could achieve 80-80-80 targets by 2040, reducing all-cause mortality by 4-7% (76-130 million deaths averted over 2022-2050) and slowing the rise in CVD expected from population growth and aging (110-200 million cases averted). Although populous middle-income countries would account for most of the reduced CVD cases and deaths, low-income countries would experience the largest reductions in disease rates. A new modeling study demonstrates that most countries could achieve 80-80-80 hypertension targets by 2040, promoting increased global equality for cardiovascular diseases with the greatest mortality benefits being seen in low-income countries.

Six years after the LCoGS, a scoping review was conducted to see how the term 'global surgery' is characterized by the literature and how it relates to LCoGS and its domains. Methods PubMed was searched for publications between January 2015 and February 2021 that used the term 'global surgery' in the title, abstract, or key words or cited the LCoGS. Variables extracted included LCoGS domains, authorship metrics, geographic scope, and clinical specialty. Results The search captured 938 articles that qualified for data extraction. Nearly 80% of first and last authors had high-income country affiliations. Africa was the most frequently investigated region, though many countries within the region were under-represented. The World Journal of Surgery was the most frequent journal, publishing 13.9% of all articles. General surgery, pediatric surgery, and neurosurgery were the most represented specialties. Of the LCoGS domains, healthcare delivery and management were the most studied, while economics and financing were the least studied. Conclusion A lack of consensus on the definition of global surgery remains. Additional research is needed in economics and financing, while obstetrics and trauma are under-represented in literature using the term 'global surgery'. Efforts in academic global surgery must give a voice to those carrying the global surgery agenda forward on the frontlines. Focusing on research capacity-building and encouraging contribution by local partners will lead to a stronger, more cohesive global surgery community.

However, most gender equity measures, such as Pulerwitz' (2000) Sexual Relationship Power Scale (SRPS), are developed and validated in the Global North and then applied in Global South settings without investigation of context applicability or validity. This study examines the SRPS' validity evidence, comprehensiveness, and contemporary relevance for young South African women and men. Methods Between 2019 and 2021, 38 cognitive interviews (CIs) were conducted among previous participants of a South African youth cohort study 'AYAZAZI' (2015-2017) to explore youth's perceptions of the SRPS. The SRPS measures women's perceptions of their partner's controlling behaviours, and men's perceptions of their own controlling behaviours. Using CIs, participants responded to a 13-item adaptation of the SRPS for use among South African youth (strongly agree-strongly disagree), and then were asked to think-aloud their reasoning for responses, their understanding and perceived relevance of each item, and made overall suggestions for scale adaptations. An item appraisal coding process was applied, whereby Cognitive Coding assessed the types of cognitive problems youth had with understanding the items, and Question Feature Coding assessed which item features caused problems for participant understandings. Finally, youth recommendations for scale adaptations were summarized. Results Overall, 21 women and 17 men aged 21-30 participated in CIs in Durban and Soweto, South Africa. Cognitive Coding revealed 1. Comprehension issues, and 2. Judgements related to items' applicability to lived experiences and identities (e.g., being unmarried). Question Feature Coding revealed items' 1. Lack of clarity or vagueness in wording and 2. Logical problems in assumptions leading to multiple interpretations (e.g., item 'my partner always need to know where I am' interpreted as both controlling and caring behaviour). Multiple, overlapping issues revealed how many items failed to "fit" within the present-day living realities of South African youth. Youth recommended several item adaptations and additions, including strength-based items, to existing measures of gender equity and relationship power. Conclusion Given identified issues, several adaptations including revising items to be more inclusive, contemporary, context specific, relational, and strength-based are needed to validly measure gender equity and power dynamics within the relationships of South African youth.

However, the potential impact of spatial accessibility to urban parks on older adults' mental health was under-researched, particularly in regard to various spatial scales and transport modes. Using linear mixed models, this study assessed the association between spatial accessibility to urban parks and two typical mental health issues of older adults (i.e. depression and anxiety) based on a mental health survey among 1,231 older adults in Beijing, China. Spatial accessibility of each community to parks via walking and public transport modes at local, regional, and global scales was calculated based on travel time by application programming interface of online map. Results show that the spatial accessibility of urban parks at all three scales and with different transport modes had a significant impact on older adults' anxiety; accessibility at the regional scale had the greatest impact. Older adults' depression was affected primarily by regional park accessibility in walking mode. Findings have important practical implications for spatial-accessibility improvements to urban parks and for constructing age-friendly urban spaces.

Two independent investigators searched three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS) up to August 2021 to identify longitudinal studies on inequalities in progress of MCC. Grey literature was searched using Open Grey and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria were retrospective and prospective longitudinal studies; adult population; assessed socioeconomic inequalities in progress of MCC. Quality of included studies and risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for longitudinal studies. Nine longitudinal studies reporting socioeconomic inequalities in progress of MCC were included. Two of the studies had poor quality. Studies varied in terms of follow-up time, sample size, included chronic conditions and socioeconomic indicators. Due to high heterogeneity meta-analysis was not possible. The studies showed positive association between lower education (five studies), lower income and wealth (two studies), area deprivation (one study), lower job categories (two studies) and belonging to ethnic minority (two study) and progress of MCC. The review demonstrated socioeconomic inequality in progress of multiple chronic conditions. The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021229564).

Media coverage in early 2020 emphasized the "unprecedented" nature of the pandemic, and some even predicted that the virus could be a global "equalizer." Ensuing debates over how the pandemic should be handled have often hinged on oppositions between protecting health and healthcare systems versus saving livelihoods and the economy, a dichotomy that we argue is false. Drawing on 482 interviews conducted in Germany, Italy, Ireland, Austria, German-speaking Switzerland and the UK over two points in a 6-month period as part of the 'Solidarity in times of Pandemics Research Consortium' (SolPan), we illustrate the ways that oppositions posed between saving lives or saving livelihoods fail to capture the entangled, long-standing nature of structural inequalities that have been revealed through the pandemic. Health-and wealth-related inequalities intersect to produce the "second pandemic," a term used by a research participant to explain the other forms of devastation that run in parallel with virus. Our findings thus complicate such dichotomies through a qualitative understanding of the pandemic as a lived experience. The pandemic emerges as a critical juncture which, in exacerbating these existing structural inequalities, also poses an opportunity to work to better resolve them.

Are Indigenous research principles incorporated into maternal health research? A scoping review of the global literature	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Review						Scoping review; Maternal health; Indigenous health; Health inequity; Indigenous research principles	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; DISEASE; WOMEN; PREGNANCY; COMMUNITY; PEOPLES; MORTALITY; CANADA; COLONIALISM	Background: Indigenous women world-wide are diverse and heterogenous, yet many have similar experiences of colonization, land dispossession, and discrimination. These experiences along with inequitable access to, and quality of, maternal healthcare increase adverse maternal health outcomes. To improve health outcomes for Indigenous women, studies must be conducted with Indigenous involvement and reflect Indigenous research principles. Objectives/Aim: The aim of this review was to explore the range, extent, and nature of Indigenous maternal health research and to assess the reporting of Indigenous research principles in the global Indigenous maternal health literature. Methods: Following a systematic scoping review protocol, four scholarly electronic databases were searched. Articles were included if they reported empirical research published between 2000 and 2019 and had a focus on Indigenous maternal health. Descriptive data were extracted from relevant articles and descriptive analysis was conducted. Included articles were also assessed for reporting of Indigenous research principles, including Indigenous involvement, context of colonization, Indigenous conceptualizations of health, community benefits, knowledge dissemination to participants or communities, and policy or intervention recommendations. Results: Four-hundred and forty-one articles met the inclusion criteria. While studies were conducted in all continents except Antarctica, less than 3% of articles described research in low-income countries. The most researched topics were access to and quality of maternity care (25%), pregnancy outcome and/or complications (18%), and smoking, alcohol and/or drug use during pregnancy (14%). The most common study design was cross-sectional (49%), and the majority of articles used quantitative methods only (68%). Less than 2% of articles described or reported all Indigenous research principles, and 71% of articles did not report on Indigenous People's involvement. Conclusions: By summarizing the trends in published literature on Indigenous maternal health, we highlight the need for increased geographic representation of Indigenous women, expansion of research to include important but under-researched topics, and meaningful involvement of Indigenous Peoples.

How longevity of career is sustained, is unknown.Participants and setting: This idiographic study explored both positive and negative interpretations of frontline workers in the Philippines exposed to sex-cybercrimes against children.Methods: The protocols of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis guided data collection through semi-structured interviews, transcription, and analysis.Results: One superordinate theme: Irreconcilable destruction of innocence, mercy and justice, and the passionate self; highlights the integral struggle that emerged from these participants' roles in child protection. Their faith philosophy of compassion and forgiveness contrasted with the unfathomable corruption and exploitation they witnessed, and their role in removing child victims from perpetrator family members to serve justice. These internal conflicts necessitated a critical need to self-care against psychological vulnerability. Longevity of career emerged from a coexistence of traumatic distress and psychological growth allowing them to redefine their faith and confront the unfathomable with hope, self-valuing, and purpose. Conclusions: Justice and mercy were juxtaposed integral conflicts threatening the psychological wellbeing of these participants. Ineffective organisational support aggravated their traumatic distress as did the lethargy with which world governments' engage in effective controls against online crimes of child sexual exploitation which has meteorically risen as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic.

J	Anakwenze, O				Anakwenze, Obianujunwa			The cultural sensitivity continuum of mental health interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Review						Sub-Saharan Africa; Mental health intervention; Cultural sensitivity; Global mental health; Psychology; Cultural adaptation; Ecological validity model; Traditional medicine	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PSYCHOLOGY; COMMUNITY; MODEL; INDIGENIZATION; PSYCHOTHERAPY; CHALLENGES; DISORDERS; PROSPECTS	Although there is a small but growing literature examining mental health interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there are very few systematic reviews of mental health interventions in the region. Those that exist primarily examine interventions for specific ailments (e.g., substance use, trauma) or specific modes of treatment (e. g., traditional healers, interpersonal psychotherapy). No systematic review has sought to assess the extent to which interventions used in SSA reflect local cultural context. The current systematic review is unique in that it aims to: quantify the number of published studies examining distinct mental health interventions in SSA that reflect local culture; identify and characterize mental health interventions that can be considered indigenous; identify Western mental health interventions in SSA that have undergone cultural adaptation and characterize the nature and extent of those adaptations; and provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop mental health interventions for African populations. A total of 980 articles were identified across five databases from January 31st to February 1st, 2021, and 29 were included in the study. The Ecological Validity Model (EVM) was used to assess degree of cultural sensitivity of non-indigenous interventions within eight cultural dimensions. Findings indicate that few studies examine mental health interventions in SSA and much of this research is authored by Western rather than local researchers. The most common intervention approaches were cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy. Assessment with the EVM framework demonstrated that concepts and goals of treatment were the cultural dimensions that were most likely to lack culturally sensitive elements. Recommendations are provided regarding achieving cultural sensitivity and collaborations between indigenous practitioners and contemporary healthcare systems. This review is an important step in evaluating progress towards achieving global equity in access to suitable mental health care.

But there has not been enough discussion about the internal mechanism of the community-built environment that influences the health of older adults. The aim of our study was to explore the complex relationships among community-built environment, social participation, outdoor exercise, and health of older adults, as well as the differences among older adults in different income groups, particular attention was paid to the situation of low-income group. Methods This study used descriptive statistical analysis and structural equation Modeling (SEM) to make a group comparison among older adults in different income groups. The data of this study came from a sample survey in Shanghai, China. Results The study found that health difference exists among older adults in China: the lower the income, the worse the community-built environment, the worse the health. The community-built environment had an important impact on the health of older adults, especially the low-income older adults. And the community-built environment influenced the health of older adults through the intermediary role of outdoor exercise and social participation. Furthermore, the lower the income level of older adults, the stronger the direct effect of the community-built environment on their health; the higher the income level of older adults, the stronger the mediating effect of outdoor exercise and social participation on the impact of the community-built environment on their health. Conclusion Governments should pay more attention to the health and living conditions of low-income older adults and take proactive steps to help them. Community design and construction should pay more attention to the demands of low-income older adult groups, which will help to improve the health inequality of older adults, consequently enhancing older adults' overall health.

In 2021 the Medical Education Innovation and Research Centre at Imperial College London launched a Global Creative Competition as a platform for medical students to reflect on their experiences during the pandemic. Methods Six hundred forty-eight creative pieces with written reflections were submitted by medical students from 52 countries. 155 students from 28 countries consented for their entries to be included in this study. The reflections were analysed thematically and independently by three reviewers to explore how the pandemic impacted students' professional identity formation (PIF). Results The pandemic increased students' awareness of the social and global role of doctors in addressing health inequities. Students felt part of a wider healthcare community and showed greater appreciation towards person-centred care. Students also became more aware of their personal needs, priorities, and the importance of self-care. Discussion In agreement with Mezirow's theory of transformative learning (2003), the pandemic led students to re-examine pre-existing epistemic and sociocultural assumptions concerning the role of doctors and explore new perspectives of what it means to be a doctor. In accordance with Cheng's theory of coping flexibility (2021), students developed both emotion-focused coping strategies (e.g., arts engagement) and problem-solving strategies (e.g., volunteering), suggesting they were able to adjust psychologically and develop agency. However, students experienced tension between their sense of duty and sense of wellbeing, highlighting the need for medical educators to design into programmes formal support systems where medical students have the space and time they need to reflect on their emergent identities as a doctor. Conclusion Medical educators should encourage students to reflect on their identity formation while encountering disorientating dilemmas. The inclusion of arts and humanities within the medical curriculum is strongly recommended to provide an avenue for students to access and express complex emotions and experiences.

J	Huang, XR; Gong, PX; White, M				Huang, Xiaoran; Gong, Pixin; White, Marcus			Study on Spatial Distribution Equilibrium of Elderly Care Facilities in Downtown Shanghai	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						elderly care facilities; 2SFCA; spatial accessibility; autocorrelation analysis	LOCAL INDICATORS; HEALTH-CARE; OLDER-ADULTS; ACCESSIBILITY; ASSOCIATION; DISPARITIES; ACCESS; CHINA	With the growing challenge of aging populations around the world, the study of the care services for older adults is an essential initiative to accommodate the particular needs of the disadvantaged communities and promote social equity. Based on open-source data and the geographic information system (GIS), this paper quantifies and visualizes the imbalance in the spatial distribution of elderly care facilities in 14,578 neighborhoods in downtown (seven districts) Shanghai, China. Eight types of elderly care facilities were obtained from Shanghai elderly care service platform, divided into two categories according to their service scale. With the introduction of the improved Gaussian 2-step floating catchment area method, the accessibility of two category facilities was calculated. Through the global autocorrelation analysis, it is found that the accessibility of elderly care facilities has the characteristics of spatial agglomeration. Local autocorrelation analysis indicates the cold and hot spots in the accessibility agglomeration state of the two types of facilities, by which we summarized the characteristics of their spatial heterogeneity. It is found that for Category-I, there is a large range of hot spots in Huangpu District. For Category-II, the hot-spot and cold-spot areas show staggered distribution, and the two categories of hot spot distribution show a negative correlation. We conclude that the two categories are not evenly distributed in the urban area, which will lead to the low efficiency of resource allocation of elderly care facilities and have a negative impact on social fairness. This research offers a systematic method to study urban access to care services for older adults as well as a new perspective on improving social fairness.

Prevalence of overweight, obesity, and early adiposity rebound in nursery school children in southeastern France	ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE			English	Article						Body mass index; Excessive corpulence; Child; Preschool; Growth charts; Socioeconomic factors	BODY-MASS INDEX; CHILDHOOD OVERWEIGHT; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; HEALTH; AGE; ADULTHOOD; TRACKING; WEIGHT; RISK; LIFE	Background: The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and early adiposity rebound in nursery school children aged 3.5-4.5 years and to evaluate associations with deprivation. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Bouches-du-Rho<^>ne department in southeastern France. Data for all nursery school children aged 3.5-4.5 years were collected during systematic medical examinations. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was determined using French, International Obesity Task Force (IOTF), and World Health Organization reference values. A French ecological deprivation index was used to assess associations with deprivation. Results: Among 19,295 children included in the study, the prevalence of overweight (IOTF-25 < BMI < IOTF30) was 9.1% and the prevalence of obesity (BMI > IOTF-30) was 2.6%. Children attending nursery schools in the most disadvantaged areas were 4.3 times more likely to be affected by obesity than those from schools in the most advantaged areas (OR: 4.32; 95% CI: 2.98-6.25, p < 0.001), after adjusting for gender, age group, and school status. Early adiposity rebound was observed in 2131 of 9872 children (21.6%). Conclusion: Programs to prevent childhood overweight and obesity in France should be intensified and take account of major persistent social inequalities. Medical practitioners should learn to systematically assess BMI curve dynamics and early adiposity rebound. (c) 2022 French Society of Pediatrics. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

This variability is explained by several factors, including the governance of the epidemic. We aimed to identify the key attributes of governance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and gain lessons for an effective response to public health emergencies. Methods We employed a mixed-methods design. We mapped the attributes of governance from well-established governance frameworks. A negative binomial regression was conducted to identify the effect of the established governance measures on the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used publicly available data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in countries around the world. Document review was conducted to identify the key approaches and attributes of governance during the pre-vaccine era of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a thematic analysis to identify key attributes for effective governance. Results The established governance measures, including generation of intelligence, strategic direction, regulation, partnership, accountability, transparency, rule of law, control of corruption, responsiveness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, ethics, and inclusiveness, are necessary but not sufficient to effectively respond to and contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional attributes of national governance were identified: 1) agile, adaptive, and transformative governance; 2) collective (collaborative, inclusive, cooperative, accountable, and transparent) governance; 3) multi-level governance; 4) smart and ethical governance: sensible, pragmatic, evidence-based, political, learner, and ethical. Conclusions The current governance frameworks and their attributes are not adequate to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that countries need agile, adaptable, and transformational, collaborative, multi-level, smart and ethical governance to effectively respond to emerging and re-emerging public health threats. In addition, an effective response to public health emergencies depends not only on national governance but also on global governance. Hence, global health governance should be urgently renewed through a paradigm shift towards universal health coverage and health security to all populations and in all countries. This requires enhanced and consistent global health diplomacy based on knowledge, solidarity, and negotiation.

Rapid action from all scientific fields, including behavioral medicine, is needed to contribute to both mitigation of, and adaption to, climate change. Purpose This article aims to identify potential bi-directional associations between climate change impacts and health-related behaviors, as well as a set of key actions for the behavioral medicine community. Methods We synthesized the existing literature about (i) the impacts of rising temperatures, extreme weather events, air pollution, and rising sea level on individual behaviors (e.g., eating behaviors, physical activity, sleep, substance use, and preventive care) as well as the structural factors related to these behaviors (e.g., the food system); and (ii) the concurrent positive and negative roles that health-related behaviors can play in mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Results Based on this literature review, we propose a first conceptual model of climate change and health-related behavior feedback loops. Key actions are proposed, with particular consideration for health equity implications of future behavioral interventions. Actions to bridge the fields of behavioral medicine and climate sciences are also discussed. Conclusions We contend that climate change is among the most urgent issues facing all scientists and should become a central priority for the behavioral medicine community.

General practice is positioned as best suited to deliver weight management health care, yet, obesity rates remain high suggesting barriers are experienced within this space. The aim of this review is to synthesize general practitioner and client perspectives of weight management to identify barriers experienced in New Zealand general practice. Six databases were searched resulting in eight articles being included in this review. This interpretive synthesis was guided by principles of meta-ethnography and grounded theory. Four overarching themes were identified from client and general practitioner perspectives: stigma, communication, inadequate health care (system limitations for general practitioners and lack of tailored advice for clients), and sociocultural influences. These four barriers were found to be interdependent, influencing each other outside the general practice context, highlighting the intersectionality of weight management health-care barriers and further complicating effective weight management within general practice. Clients reported wanting tailored, non-stigmatized, effective weight management health care, yet, general practitioners reported being ill-equipped to provide this due to barriers both within and outside the limits of their practice. General practice requires more systemic support to deliver effective weight management including public health campaigns and indigenous health information to reduce health inequities. An appraisal of general practice being "best suited" to deliver effective weight management health care that is culturally appropriate is urgently required to improve obesity related health outcomes in New Zealand.

Stigma is a cultural phenomenon that is influenced by particular contexts and can differ by country and region. The majority of stigma research focuses on Europe or North America leading to a lack of culturally relevant stigma research instruments for the Latin American context. The present study describes and discusses the methodology for cross-culturally adapting four stigma measurement scales to the Chilean context. The cross-cultural adaptation process included nine phases: (1) preparation; (2) independent translations; (3) synthesis 1 with expert committee; (4) focus groups and interviews with researchers, PHC professionals, and PHC users; (5) synthesis 2 with expert committee; (6) independent back translations; (7) synthesis 3 with expert committee; (8) pilot with PHC professionals; and (9) final revisions. The adaptation process included an array of diverse voices from the PHC context, and met three adaptation objectives defined prior to beginning the process (Understandability, Relevance, and Acceptability and Answer Options). The resulting, culturally adapted questionnaire is being validated and implemented within PHC settings across Chile to provide in-depth insight into stigma among PHC professionals in the country. The authors hope it will be useful for future research on mental illness and substance use stigma in similar settings across Latin America.

How has the pandemic-induced psychological and mental distress contributed to declining political trust cross-nationally? Using a large-scale global survey comprising respondents from Africa, Americas, Asia, Middle East, and Europe, the present study addresses this question. Results from multilevel analysis show that across dozens of low- as well as high-income countries, pandemic distress experienced by individuals is negatively linked with political trust (public confidence in the government's capacity and transparency). Moreover, this relationship is conditional on alternative "performance measures" or contextual moderators: Human Development Index, Corruption Perceptions Index, and Fragile States Index. Specifically, the magnitude of the association between pandemic distress and political distrust increases in countries that are less economically developed, perceived to be more corrupt, and politically more fragile or vulnerable.

The emerging intersection between marine spatial planning and ocean accounting: A global review and case studies	MARINE POLICY			English	Review						Ecosystem-based management; System of Environmental-Economic Accounting; Socio-economic activities; Ocean governance	MANAGEMENT; COASTAL	Ocean planning and management is often tasked with balancing multiple policy priorities, such as the growth of ocean-related sectors, conserving ecosystem health and biodiversity, and considerations of equity and inclusivity. Over the last two decades, aligning and operationalising such priorities has increasingly been addressed through Marine Spatial Planning (MSP), which analyses and allocates human activities within the marine domain. In parallel, Ocean Accounting (OA) is an emergent framework that extends existing international accounting standards to better measure the contribution of the ocean to society and the economy. Both frameworks are `integrative', combining knowledge from multiple domains, to support decision-making towards ocean policy objectives. Here, we present the first analysis of the intersection between MSP and OA, to identify operational opportunities and barriers for co-development. We present a global review of OA- and MSP-related activities and perform a SWOT analysis of their implementation within five case countries (Australia, Canada, Portugal, South Africa, and Thailand). We identified 26 countries that have completed, or progressing, OA and MSP, of which only two countries demonstrated an overlap between frameworks. Within countries with completed MSP, there were no clear links between the policy use-cases of both frameworks (i.e., focus on the ocean economy or ecosystem conservation). In-depth analyses of five countries identified both opportunities and barriers through similar policy drivers, data sharing and shared implementing institutions. As high-level policy intent and investment drives the increasing use of both frameworks, an understanding of their co-development advances integrated and evidence-based ocean governance. [GRAPHICS] .

Enforcing health as a right depends, more than ever, on prioritizing both universality and equity. This article argues that this requires a new framework in both the legal field and the global health field, that of Global Health and Economic Law, which in this article is examined with a focus on the health care industry.

Science class as clinic: Why histories of segregated instruction matter for health equity reforms today	SCIENCE EDUCATION			English	Article						diversity; equity; health; historicizing; justice; research; science education	HIGH-SCHOOL BIOLOGY; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; STRUCTURAL RACISM; EDUCATION; CURRICULUM; STUDENTS; RACE; KNOWLEDGE; TEACHERS; POPULATIONS	Research has recommended centering health disparities to make science instruction relevant to students from minoritized racial and ethnic groups. While promoted as a recent innovation, the repurposing of science instruction to improve the health of demographic groups has a longer history traceable to segregated and colonial schooling. Using a historicizing approach, this study explores how certain U.S. science classrooms have become clinics of preventative care aimed at transforming groups into healthy citizens. Analysis identifies how U.S. science education studies have used psychological, sociological, and anthropological lenses to divide students into populations, classifying some as needing intervention to improve their minds (e.g., basic health knowledge), home lives (e.g., daily habits), and cultural beliefs (e.g., attitudes toward science and medicine). Through systematic analysis of U.S. science education journals and sources cited therein, I map shifts over three periods: the rise of urban, segregated, and colonial schooling (1901-45), postwar desegregation and international development (1946-89), and equity reforms (1990-2021). Despite declines in deficit language, analysis suggests the intervention space of the science-class-as-clinic still demarcates groups as not yet fully reasoning, self-regulating, or agentic, and as needing the applied relevance of preventative health. Paradoxically, efforts to redress disparities may reinsert older distinctions by positing groups as educationally and medically at-risk-implicitly locating inequities within students rather than the unjust systemic conditions they face. I conclude with implications for research and practice, highlighting approaches that do not treat educational and health inequities as problems to be fixed in the child, family, or community.

J	Zheng, CY; Feng, ZQ; Pearce, J				Zheng, Chunyu; Feng, Zhiqiang; Pearce, Jamie			A Cross-sectional Analysis of Socio-spatial Patterning of Tobacco Retail in Shanghai, China	NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH			English	Article							OUTLET DENSITY; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; HEALTH DISPARITIES; SMOKING; NEIGHBORHOOD; INEQUALITIES; CESSATION; CORPORATION	Introduction International evidence from high-income countries demonstrates that the availability of tobacco tends to be greater in more urban and more deprived neighborhoods. However, little is known about the socio-spatial disparities in other settings, including megacities in China. This study investigated the patterning of tobacco retailers across Shanghai by types of tobacco retailers, including the relationship with levels of urbanity and neighborhood deprivation. Aims and Methods Tobacco retailer data (n = 19 413) was extracted from a web-scraped Points-of-Interest database. For all communities (n = 5432) across Shanghai, neighborhood tobacco retail availability was calculated using population-weighted kernel density estimation and grouped by quintiles of neighborhood deprivation and a 3-level urban classification. Associations were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis tests and epsilon squared. Results Across Shanghai, tobacco retail availability decreased from more urbanized areas to less urbanized areas. There was a statistical difference (p < .001) in the availability of tobacco retail across quintiles of deprivation, with the highest availability in the less deprived neighborhoods, and the lowest availability in the most deprived neighborhoods. However, this trend was reversed in the urban center, where retail availability was greatest in the most deprived areas. Convenience stores were the most common type of tobacco retailer across the city, while tobacco-only outlets were most strongly associated with levels of neighborhood deprivation. Conclusions The results show an association between tobacco retail availability and neighborhood deprivation, which varied with levels of urbanity and types of tobacco retailers. These findings provide supportive evidence for further interventions that target reducing inequalities in exposure to tobacco retail. Implications This is the first study to examine the relationship between tobacco retail availability and neighborhood deprivation in the context of Chinese megacities. Using data from Shanghai, China, we found a significant non-linear association between tobacco retail availability and neighborhood deprivation across the city. It is plausible that the socio-spatial disparities in tobacco retail availability at the neighborhood level may be a key factor explaining differences in smoking behaviors between sociodemographic groups. The findings emphasize the need for greater efforts in regulating neighborhood-level tobacco retailing in China.

School-to-work and school-to-university transition and health inequalities among young adults: a scoping review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review						social medicine; public health; mental health	SELF-RATED HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; LIFE-COURSE; EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; ADOLESCENT HEALTH; SMOKING-BEHAVIOR; FOLLOW-UP; TRAJECTORIES; SYMPTOMS; DRINKING	Objectives The main objective was to systematically map evidence regarding the emergence of health inequalities in individuals aged 16-24 years during school-to-work and school-to-university transition (STWT). Second, we aimed to summarise the evidence on potential effects of contextual and compositional characteristics of specific institutional contexts entered during STWT on health and health behaviours. Design Scoping review. Study selection Relevant literature was systematically searched following the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. Ovid MEDLINE and Web of Science, and websites of the International Labour Organization and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health were searched, using a predetermined search strategy. Articles in English or German published between 1 January 2000 and 3 February 2020 were considered. Data extraction To collect the main information from the selected studies, a data extraction spreadsheet was created. Data were summarised and grouped into five health outcomes and five institutional contexts (school, vocational training, university, work, unemployment). Results A total of 678 articles were screened for inclusion. To be able to draw a picture of the development of various health outcomes over time, we focused on longitudinal studies. Forty-six prospective studies mapping health-related outcomes during STWT were identified. Higher family socioeconomic position (SEP) was associated with higher levels of health behaviour and lower levels of health-damaging behaviour, but there was also some evidence pointing in the opposite direction. Disadvantaged family SEP negatively impacted on mental health and predicted an adverse weight development. There was limited evidence for the outcomes physical/somatic symptoms and self-rated health. Meso-level characteristics of the institutional contexts identified were not systematically assessed, only individual-level factors resulting from an exposure to these contexts, rendering an analysis of effects of contextual and compositional characteristics on health and health behaviours impossible. Conclusions This scoping review demonstrated a wide range of health inequalities during STWT for various health outcomes. However, knowledge on the role of the core institutional contexts regarding the development of health inequalities is limited.

This information would allow a better comprehension of the actual state of the SDGS and a more efficient programming in future interventions. To achieve the objective of the study, a consensual and critical review was carried out using both primary sources, such as scientific articles, and secondary sources, such as bibliographic indexes, web pages and databases. The Sustainable Development Goals are a global call to action to end poverty, close the gender gap, protect the planet, and improve the lives of people around the world. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted 17 goals as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which sets out a plan to achieve the goals in 15 years. However, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has been a turning point in the achievement of these goals, due to all its consequences at the political, economic, and socio-cultural levels. This review can be used as a guide for future research and reviews in order to understand the status of each of the SDGs and what actions have been taken and proposed in the aftermath of the pandemic in recent years.

Long-term commuting times and air quality relationship to COVID-19 in Sao Paulo	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						COVID-19 deaths; Urban mobility; Socio-demographic differences; sao Paulo municipality	PERSONAL EXPOSURE; POLLUTION; MORTALITY; DISEASE; COHORT; TRENDS; BRAZIL	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is an unprecedented global health crisis and the effects may be related to environmental and socio-economic factors. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the first death occurred in March 2020 and since then the numbers have grown to 175 new deaths per day in April 2021, positioning the city as the epicenter of the number of cases and deaths in Brazil. Sao Paulo is one of the largest cities in the world with more than 12 million inhabitants, a fleet of about 8 million vehicles and frequent pollutant concentrations above recommended values. Social inequalities are evident in the municipality, similarly to other cities in the world. This paper focuses on transportation activities related to air pollution and associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases especially on people who developed comorbidities during their whole life. This study relates travel trip data to air quality analysis and expanded to COVID-19 disease. This work studied the relationship of deaths in Sao Paulo due to COVID-19 with demographic density, with family income, with the use of public transport and with atmospheric pollution for the period between March 17th, 2020 and April 29th, 2021. The main results showed that generally passenger kilometers traveled, commuting times and air quality related diseases increase with residential distance from the city center, and thus, with decreasing residential density. PM2.5 concentrations are positively correlated with COVID-19 deaths, regions with high urban densities have higher numbers of deaths and long-distance frequent trips can contribute to spread of the disease.

J	Doody, O; Hennessy, T; Bright, AM				Doody, Owen; Hennessy, Therese; Bright, Ann-Marie			The role and key activities of Clinical Nurse Specialists and Advanced Nurse Practitioners in supporting healthcare provision for people with intellectual disability: An integrative review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Review						Advanced Nurse Practitioner; Clinical Nurse Specialist; Health inequality; Intellectual Disability; Vulnerability	ADULTS; CHILD; POPULATION; MORTALITY	Background: People with intellectual disability have poorer health than the general population and experience difficulties accessing healthcare. In addition, attitude and stigmatisation by healthcare professionals can lead to poorer health outcomes for people with intellectual disability. This is often driven by the fact that many healthcare professionals lack the knowledge, skill or experience in supporting people with intellectual disability. As lead roles within the nursing profession Clinical Nurse Specialists and Advanced Nurse Practitioners have a key role in supporting person-centred care and health outcomes. However, little is known about the effects of these roles on care provision for people with intellectual disability. Objective: To identify the effect of Clinical Nurse Specialists and Advanced Nurse Practitioners on care provision for people with intellectual disability. Design: A systematic search of six academic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Medline and Academic Search Complete) relevant to nursing and health care was performed. Setting(s): Nursing care environment. Participants: Clinical Nurse Specialists and Advanced Nurse Practitioners providing care to people with intellectual disability. Methods: A pre-defined systematic search of six academic databases was conducted and two reviewers screened each study against the inclusion criteria. Additional hand searching of the reference lists (backward chaining) and citations (forward chaining) of papers that met the inclusion criteria was conducted. The methodological details of each paper were extracted and assessed for quality and rigour utilizing the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and the AACODS checklist for appraising grey literature. Thematic analysis was undertaken (Braun and Clarke, 2006) and the review is reported in line with PRISMA guidelines (Page et al. 2021). Results: All papers included in this review were from Ireland and spanned an eighteen-year period. Seven papers met the inclusion criteria: quantitative (n = 2), qualitative (n = 2), mixed methods (n = 2) and grey literature (n = 1). Thematic analysis enabled the development of three themes; maintaining core nursing skills; the maintenance of professional competence and providing a quality service. Conclusions: It is evident from the findings of this review that intellectual disability nursing in Ireland is actively engaged in research and professional development. Intellectual disability nursing in Ireland positively contributes to the individual, family and community and the international body of evidence that supports individualised care provision for persons with intellectual disability.

J	Guzmán, CAF				Guzman, Carlos A. Faerron			Complexity in Global Health- Bridging Theory and Practice	ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						Complex systems; globalization; systems thinking; transdisciplinarity; interconnection	EDUCATION; SCIENCE	Increasingly, health reflects an integrated outcome of a growing globalized system. Economic, political, cultural, environmental, and other global processes profoundly influence how we understand and approach health challenges. As these occur in a webbed, dynamic, and interdependent fashion, health can be viewed as a complex issue. Drawing from this understanding, in this viewpoint, I assert applying complexity theory to produce a definition of the field of global health. Complexity theory tenets such as non linearity, transdisciplinarity, open-system analysis, and global-local phenomenology can provide a theoretical basis for a substantive understanding of global health phenomena and a richer instrumental approach to global health challenges. Harmonization between complexity theory and global health may provide the foundation to close the health equity gap put forth by the global health agenda.	[Guzman, Carlos A.

Stigma is a fundamental cause of health inequities because it simultaneously limits access to resources, contributes to systemic vulnerability and generates chronic stress. Anti-trans stigma occurs across multiple socioecological levels, resulting in multiple possible definitions and measurements of trans stigma. Understanding how trans stigma has been measured in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is critical to health promotion efforts for trans communities. Accordingly, this scoping review will identify and examine how anti-trans stigma has been measured in existing LMIC-specific research to inform best practices for measurement of anti-trans stigma that includes consideration of local context. Methods and analysis This is the protocol for a scoping review of anti-trans stigma in LMICs. We will search (from January 2001 to December 2021) PubMed, WHO Global Medicus and EBSCO. Study selection will conform to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews Checklist. Original studies in English, Spanish, Arabic or Russian will be included. Reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data. Data analysis will involve quantitative and qualitative methods. A narrative summary of findings will be conducted. Ethics and dissemination As a scoping review (no direct interaction with participants), this study is exempt from human subjects oversight. Understanding context-specific ways to measure anti-trans stigma is urgently needed to support trans health globally. The planned scoping review will help to address this gap. Results of the review will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and likely in other media such as conferences, seminars and symposia.

However, there are few studies based on the latest global data to show changes in the disease burden due to DUDs, specifically investigating associations between the country-level socio-economic factors and the burden of DUDs. Methods: Data of DUDs were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 database to explore the trends of the disease burden due to DUDs from 1990 to 2019. Univariate linear regression and stepwise multiple linear regression analysis were performed to analyze the correlations between burden due to DUDs and country-level socio-economic factors. Results: Globally, the number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by DUDs approximately increased by 2.6% yearly from 1990 to 2019, though the age-standardized DALY rate has not changed significantly in the past 30 years. The age-standardized DALY rate of opioid use disorders showed an upward trend during the past 30 years and was highest among 5 types of DUDs in 2019. Inequality-adjusted human development index (beta = 15.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.9-18.9, P < 0.001) was identified as the key risk factor associated with square-root transformed age-standardized DALY rate of DUDs. Conclusions: Global burden due to DUDs has increased significantly over the past 30 years. More effective tar -geted public health policies should be formulated to manage the public health challenge of DUDs, especially in developed countries and territories.

Associations between food and housing insecurity with HIV-related stigma in cohort of women living with HIV in Canada	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY			English	Article						food insecurity; housing insecurity; poverty; stigma; HIV stigma; women living with HIV	CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; CHRONIC ILLNESS; SOCIAL SUPPORT; DRUG-USE; HEALTH; POVERTY; HIV/AIDS; HOMELESSNESS; DISABILITY; DEPRESSION	Introduction Women living with HIV across global contexts are disproportionately impacted by food insecurity and housing insecurity. Food and housing insecurity are resource insecurities associated with poorer health outcomes among people living with HIV. Poverty, a deeply stigmatized phenomenon, is a contributing factor towards food and housing insecurity. HIV-related stigma-the devaluation, mistreatment and constrained access to power and opportunities experienced by people living with HIV-intersects with structural inequities. Few studies, however, have examined food and housing insecurity as drivers of HIV-related stigma. This study aimed to estimate the associations between food and housing insecurity with HIV-related stigma among women living with HIV in Canada. Methods This prospective cohort study of women living with HIV (>= 16 years old) in three provinces in Canada involved three waves of surveys collected at 18-month intervals between 2013 and 2018. To understand associations between food and housing security and HIV-related stigma, we conducted linear mixed effects regression models. We adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics associated with HIV-related stigma. Results and discussion Among participants (n = 1422), more than one-third (n = 509; 36%) reported baseline food insecurity and approximately one-tenth (n = 152, 11%) housing insecurity. Mean HIV-related stigma scores were consistent across waves 1 (mean [M] = 57.2, standard deviation [SD] = 20.0, N = 1401) and 2 (M = 57.4, SD = 19.0, N = 1227) but lower at wave 3 (M = 52.8, SD = 18.7, N = 918). On average, across time, food insecure participants reported HIV-related stigma scores that were 8.6 points higher (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.4, 10.8) compared with food secure individuals. Similarly, participants reporting insecure housing at wave 1 tended to experience greater HIV-related stigma (6.2 points, 95% CI: 2.7, 9.6) over time compared to stably housed participants. There was an interaction between time and housing insecurity, whereby baseline housing insecurity was no longer associated with higher HIV-related stigma at the third wave. Conclusions Among women living with HIV in Canada, experiencing food and housing insecurity was associated with consistently higher levels of HIV-related stigma. In addition to the urgent need to tackle food and housing insecurity among people living with HIV to optimize wellbeing, getting to the heart of HIV-related stigma requires identifying and dismantling resource insecurity-related stigma drivers.

Exploring the Potential Relationship Between Global Greenness and DALY Loss Due to Depressive Disorders	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						country-level; DALY loss; depressive disorders; global analysis; greenness	MENTAL-HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; RESIDENTIAL GREENNESS; NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; SPACE; GREENSPACE; EXPERIENCE; VEGETATION; LESSONS	ObjectivePrior studies have shown that greenness can reduce the burden of depressive disorders. However, most were focused on local-scale analyses while limited evaluated globally. We aimed to investigate the association between greenness and the burden of depressive disorders using data from 183 countries worldwide. MethodsWe used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate greenness. Country-level disability-adjusted life year (DALY) loss due to depressive disorders was used to represent depressive disorder burdens. A generalized linear mixed model was applied to assess the relationship between greenness and depressive disorders after controlling for covariates. Stratified analyses were conducted to determine the effects of greenness across several socio-demographic levels. ResultsThe findings showed a significant negative association between greenness and the health burden of depressive disorders with a coefficient of -0.196 (95% CI: -0.356, -0.035) in the DALY changes per interquartile unit increment of NDVI. The stratified analyses suggested beneficial effects of greenness on depressive disorders across sex, various age groups especially for those aged <49 years, with low-income and/or those living in highly urbanized countries. ConclusionsOur study noted that greenness exposure was significant negative association with the burden of depressive disorders. The findings should be viewed as recommendations for relevant authorities in supporting environmental greenness enhancement to reduce the mental burdens.

It remains unclear how mental disorders develop into adulthood in these populations. The aim was to present the rates of mental disorders in adolescence and adulthood in child welfare and juvenile justice samples and to examine their mental health trajectories from adolescence into adulthood. Methods Seventy adolescents in shared residential care, placed by child welfare (n = 52, mean age = 15 years) or juvenile justice (n = 18, mean age = 17 years) authorities, were followed up into adulthood (child welfare: mean age = 25 years; juvenile justice: mean age = 27 years). Mental disorders were assessed based on the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision diagnoses at baseline and at follow-up. Epidemiological information on mental disorders was presented for each group. Bivariate correlations and structural equation modeling for the relationship of mental disorders were performed. Results In the total sample, prevalence rates of 73% and 86% for any mental disorder were found in adolescence (child welfare: 70%; juvenile justice: 83%) and adulthood (child welfare: 83%; juvenile justice: 94%) respectively. General psychopathology was found to be stable from adolescence into adulthood in both samples. Conclusions Our findings showed high prevalence rates and a high stability of general psychopathology into adulthood among child welfare and juvenile justice adolescents in Swiss residential care. Therefore, continuity of mental health care and well-prepared transitions into adulthood for such individuals is highly warranted.

Practical Interests in SDGs and the Voluntary National Reviews	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Review							GENDER EQUALITY; MOBILIZATION	This study examines country's voluntary national reviews (VNRs) to assess global commitment to gender equality in the era of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While the SDGs promise realisation of gender equality, progress data indicate that gender equality will not be achieved in the next century, let alone by the SDGs target date of 2030. This study posits two explanations for slow progress on gender equality: (i) countries selectively pursue gender equality, as evidenced by our finding that country VNRs demonstrated commitment to achieving only 31% of extant gender equality gaps;and (ii) countries are more committed to achieving gender equality on 'practical' dimensions (i.e., relating to basic needs, such as maternal health and education) than 'strategic' dimensions which seek to challenge unequal power relations and women's subordinate position within society (e.g., income, land, political power). Whether via refinements to the SDG/VNR process, or through well-established gender platforms such as the World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Index and Equal Measures 2030 SDG Gender Index, gender equality advocates must push for pursuit of the entirety of the holistic gender equality agenda as hard-fought for and agreed by the seminal Beijing Platform for Action. Without greater attention to strategic dimensions, women will be stuck in a vicious cycle of 'empowerment without power' and gender equality will elude women for yet another century.

Our objective was to investigate this health disparity by analyzing the relationship between potential social determinants of health (SDOH), COVID-19, and chronic disease in the spatial context of San Diego County, California. Methods We identified potential SDOH from a Pearson correlation analysis between socioeconomic variables and COVID-19 case rates during 5 pandemic stages, from March 31, 2020, to April 3, 2021. We used ridge regression to model chronic disease hospitalization and death rates by using the selected socioeconomic variables. Through the lens of COVID-19 and chronic disease, we identified vulnerable communities by using spatial methods, including Global Moran I spatial autocorrelation, local bivariate relationship analysis, and geographically weighted regression. Results In the Pearson correlation analysis, we identified 26 socioeconomic variables as potential SDOH because of their significance (P <= .05) in relation to COVID-19 case rates. Of the analyzed chronic disease rates, ridge regression most accurately modeled rates of diabetes age-adjusted death (R-2 = 0.903) and age-adjusted hospitalization for hypertensive disease (hypertension, hypertensive heart disease, hypertensive chronic kidney disease, and hypertensive encephalopathy) (R-2 = 0.952). COVID-19 and chronic disease rates exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation (0.304 <= I <= 0.561, 3.092 <= Z <= 6.548, 0.001 <= P <= .002), thereby justifying spatial models to highlight communities that are vulnerable to COVID-19. Conclusion Novel spatial analysis methods reveal relationships between SDOH, COVID-19, and chronic disease that are intuitive and easily communicated to public health decision makers and practitioners. Observable disparity patterns between urban and rural areas and between affluent and low-income communities establish the need for spatially differentiated COVID-19 response approaches to achieve health equity.

The environmental impact of its exponential growth means extreme mining, hazardous labour practices including child labour, and exposure burden to inorganic and organic hazardous chemicals for the environment and current and future human generations. Globally, processes such as in-country reduce, reuse and recycle have so far received less attention than outer-circle strategies like the uncontrolled dumping of e-waste in countries that are unprotected by regulatory frameworks. Here, in the absence of in-frastructures for sound hazardous e-waste management, the crude recycling, open burning and dumping into landfills of e-waste severely expose people, animal and the environment. Along with economic, political, social, and cultural solutions to the e-waste global problem, the scientific approach based on risk analysis encompassing risk assessment, risk management and risk communication can foster a technical support to resist transgenera-tional e-waste exposure and health inequalities. This paper presents the latest public health strategies based on the use of integrated human and animal biomonitoring and appropriate biomarkers to assess and manage the risk of e-waste embracing the One Health approach. Advantages and challenges of integrated biomonitoring are described, along with ad-hoc biomarkers of exposure, effect and susceptibility with special focus on metals and metalloids. Indeed, the safe and sustainable management of novel technologies will benefit of the integration and coordination of human and animal biomonitoring.

Using data from the German Family Panel, we compared three dimensions of mental health (i.e., self-reported stress, exhaustion, and loneliness) one year before the pandemic and in spring 2020. First, two-parent families emerged as a vulnerable group, as the levels of stress and exhaustion they reported during the pandemic converged with those experienced by single parents. Second, a gender gap emerged during this global health crisis, with women, and particularly mothers, reporting significantly worse mental health compared to men in the same family type. Our findings underline the substantive value of studying mental health inequality from a multidimensional perspective and over time. Based on these findings, we urge policy makers to consider more seriously the disproportionate burdens that families, and women in particular, have been carrying due to the pandemic both directly and indirectly.

J	Daigle, M; Duffy, DN; Castañeda, DL				Daigle, Megan; Duffy, Deirdre N.; Lopez Castaneda, Diana			Abortion access and Colombia's legacy of civil war: between reproductive violence and reproductive governance	INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article						post-conflict peace building; abortion politics; global health; gender; international security	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE; SECURITY; PEACE; RIGHTS; WOMEN	Colombia now has the most progressive legal framework for abortion in Latin America, but intense backlash persists. This is shaped by machismo, natalism, religion and histories of violence. In particular, the article explores how legacies of conflict continue to produce barriers to safe abortion care. In 2022, Colombia decriminalized abortion, making it ostensibly a site of progressive abortion politics. Within hours, however, the ruling was met with intense, high-level backlash that positioned abortion as a threat to the Colombian family and gestured to gendered conflict harms past and present. Colombia's legal framework on abortion has emerged largely due to campaigning that unfolded during periods of intense political violence and insecurity, in a setting where conflict and (post-)conflict exist on a continuum. Combined, this points to the significance of (post-)conflict politics to understanding abortion politics, and vice versa, in the Colombian space. Here, we use interview data gathered in 2018 to argue that the two should be understood in tandem-and, indeed, that one cannot be properly understood without the other, shaped as they both are by a militant conservative nationalism inflected by religion, machismo and natalism, and by the material legacies of conflict. Decriminalization should therefore be understood as part of resurgent conservative reproductive governance, and abortion politics itself as an agonistic space of contestation rather than straightforwardly progressive. Beyond Colombia, it is also indicative of the rich insights on gender justice in conflict spaces that can be drawn from analysing abortion politics.

While some continue to believe medicine is apolitical and grounded purely in science, history and research reveal that medicine is inseparable from underlying systems, laws, and policies. Obesity is a useful case study. Weight loss trials have shown the immense difficulty in achieving and sustaining weight loss without addressing overlying systems. Barriers are double for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) with obesity, who must contend with multiple layers of oppressive systems. Increasingly, illness is not a matter of bad luck, but is a function of oppressive structures. COVID-19 likely originates in a deteriorating environment, we have an increasing global burden of disease from oppressive sales of food, sugar, alcohol, guns, nicotine, and other harmful products, and social inequality and resource hoarding are at a peak. Medicine can and must participate in redefining these systems. In doing so, it must center the experiences of BIPOC and push change that alleviates power disparities.

Development and Validation of the Trust in My Doctor, Trust in Doctors in General, and Trust in the Health Care Team Scales	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Trust; Mistrust; Health care; Doctors; Scale development; Scale validation; Health equity; United States	MEDICAL MISTRUST; SYSTEM DISTRUST; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; RACIAL-DIFFERENCES; FIT INDEXES; TUSKEGEE; DISCRIMINATION; RELIABILITY	Rationale: Historic and present-day racism and inequity in the United States (U.S.) have resulted in diminished trust in health care among many populations. A key barrier to improving trust in health care is a dearth of wellvalidated measures appropriate for diverse populations. Indeed, systematic reviews indicate a need to develop and test updated trust measures that are multidimensional and inclusive of relevant domains (e.g., fairness). Objective: We developed three trust measures: the Trust in My Doctor (T-MD), Trust in Doctors in General (TDiG), and Trust in the Health Care Team (T-HCT) scales. Methods: After developing an initial item pool, expert reviewers (n = 6) provided feedback on the face validity of each scale. We conducted cognitive interviews (n = 21) with a convenience sample of adults to ensure items were interpreted as intended. In 2020, we administered an online survey to a convenience sample of U.S. adults recruited through the Qualtrics Panel (n = 801) to assess scale reliability and validity. Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated acceptable model fit for second order latent factor models for each scale (root mean square error of approximation: <0.07, comparative fit index: >= 0.98, and standardized root mean square residual: <= 0.03). The T-MD contained 25 items and six subscales: communication competency, fidelity, systems trust, confidentiality, fairness, and global trust. The T-DiG and T-HCT each contained 29 items and seven subscales (the same subscales in the T-MD plus an additional subscale related to stigma-based discrimination). Each scale was strongly correlated with existing trust measures and perceived racism in health care and was significantly associated with delayed health care seeking and receipt of a routine health exam. Conclusions: The multidimensional T-MD, T-DiG, and T-HCT scales have sound psychometric properties and may be useful for researchers evaluating trust-related interventions or conducting studies where trust is an important construct or main outcome.

J	Meier, LJ				Meier, Lukas J.			Systemising triage: COVID-19 guidelines and their underlying theories of distributive justice	MEDICINE HEALTH CARE AND PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						COVID-19; Corona; Triage; Prioritisation; Guidelines; Distributive justice	QUALITY-OF-LIFE	The COVID-19 pandemic has been overwhelming public health-care systems around the world. With demand exceeding the availability of medical resources in several regions, hospitals have been forced to invoke triage. To ensure that this difficult task proceeds in a fair and organised manner, governments scrambled experts to draft triage guidelines under enormous time pressure. Although there are similarities between the documents, they vary considerably in how much weight their respective authors place on the different criteria that they propose. Since most of the recommendations do not come with ethical justifications, analysing them requires that one traces back these criteria to their underlying theories of distributive justice. In the literature, COVID-19 triage has been portrayed as a value conflict solely between utilitarian and egalitarian elements. While these two accounts are indeed the main antipodes, I shall show that in fact all four classic theories of distributive justice are involved: utilitarianism, egalitarianism, libertarianism, and communitarianism. Detecting these in the documents and classifying the suggested criteria accordingly enables one to understand the balancing between the different approaches to distributive justice-which is crucial for both managing the current pandemic and in preparation for the next global health crisis.

J	Jefferson, AM				Jefferson, Andrew M.			Prison reform and torture prevention under 'compromised circumstances'	CRIMINOLOGY & CRIMINAL JUSTICE			English	Article						Compromised circumstances; dominant assumptions; global south; prison reform; torture prevention		In this article, drawing on two decades studying prisons and prison reform practices in (mostly) southern countries undergoing transition, I examine the challenges facing anti-torture professionals and prison reformers working in the global south and critically interrogate the assumptions of dominant models of reform. Rights and health-based entry points to the prevention of torture and inhumane treatment and prison reform are argued to be necessary but insufficient. I propose the concept 'compromised circumstances' to counter the structural biases that diminish and erase ordinary everyday experience. The 'compromised circumstances' of countries torn by conflict, inequality, poverty and mundane violence call for innovative interventions based on reflexive social scientific description and analysis. The inevitable sense of dizziness and uncertainty such circumstances induce must be embraced not denied. A dynamic, organic and relational entry point to reform is required.

We have created four secondary indices from six primary indices in order to assess the care quality parameters. We conducted a principal component analysis on incidence, prevalence, mortality, Years of Life Lost (YLLs), Years Lived with Disability (YLDs), and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) to create an index presented by quality-of-care index (QCI) to compare different countries. ResultsThe global QCI scores of respiratory infection, enteric infection, leukemia, foreign body aspiration, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, dermatitis, road injury, and neonatal disorders have improved remarkably. These causes showed equal distribution of qualified care for both sexes. The global trend of QCI score for mental health showed a steady pattern during the same time and disparities favoring females was evident. The quality of care for these causes was notably higher in developed areas. ConclusionsThe global QCI revealed a universal growth in major causes of death and morbidity in <20y during 28 years. Quality of care is an associate of the level of country's development. Despite effective interventions, inequities still remain. Implementation of policies to invest in quality improvement and inequality elimination is needed.

We examine how income losses during the Great Recession were associated with children's educational performance in Ireland, one of the countries most severely affected by the global financial crisis. Using longitudinal data from a nationally representative child cohort study, collected before and after the recession at ages 9 and 13 years, we estimate panel models to examine the impact of income changes on standardized tests. We explore both objective and subjective measures of recession impact, and investigate non-linearities and effect heterogeneity using quantile regression. While income is strongly associated with educational performance overall, there is little evidence of a short-run negative impact of income shocks during the Great Recession on children's test scores.

The link between armed conflict and drug markets is well established but how conflict impacts on the health and social determinants of people who use drugs is less clear. The aim was to investigate health outcomes and associated factors among people who use illicit drugs in Afghanistan, Colombia and Myanmar. Methods We conducted a systematic review searching Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Global Health databases using terms relating to Afghanistan, Colombia and Myanmar; illicit drug use (all modes of drug administration); health and influencing factors. Quality assessment was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale and papers were analysed narratively. Results 35 studies were included in Afghanistan (n = 15), Colombia (n = 9) and Myanmar (n = 11). Health outcomes focused predominantly on HIV, Hepatitis C (HCV), Hepatitis B and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with one study looking at human rights violations (defined as maltreatment, abuse and gender inequality). Drug use was predominantly injection of heroin, often alongside use of amphetamines (Myanmar), cocaine and cocaine-based derivatives (Colombia). Only one study measured the effect of a period of conflict suggesting this was linked to increased reporting of symptoms of STIs and sharing of needles/syringes among people who inject drugs. Findings show high levels of external and internal migration, alongside low-income and unemployment across the samples. External displacement was linked to injecting drugs and reduced access to needle/syringe programmes in Afghanistan, while initiation into injecting abroad was associated with increased risk of HCV infection. Few studies focused on gender-based differences or recruited women. Living in more impoverished rural areas was associated with increased risk of HIV infection. Conclusions More research is needed to understand the impact of armed-conflict and drug production on the health of people who use drugs. The immediate scale-up of harm reduction services in these countries is imperative to minimize transmission of HIV/HCV and address harms associated with amphetamine use and other linked health and social care needs that people who use drugs may face.

Spit Sci Working GrP	Moderating Role of Healthcare Disruptions on Friend and Family Pandemic-Related Negative Life Events Predicting Latines' Anxiety and Alcohol Use Over Time	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION			English	Article						COVID-19 pandemic; Negative life events; Alcohol use; Anxiety; Healthcare disruptions; Latine	MENTAL-HEALTH; MARIJUANA USE	The Latine community has experienced a disproportionate amount of pandemic-related negative life events during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study, therefore, adopted a contextual and environmental lens to understand the moderating role of healthcare disruptions on friend and family pandemic-related negative life events (e.g., PRNLE) predicting anxiety and alcohol use over time. The current study was part of a more extensive longitudinal study on students' genetic and environmental experiences. Findings indicated that among Latines who experienced more significant healthcare disruptions, increased family PRNLE predicted greater alcohol use but not anxiety over time. Additionally, friend PRNLE did not significantly predict alcohol or anxiety with high or low healthcare disruptions present. Our findings suggest that Latines may rely on the family to navigate their concerns and mitigate the PRNLE when experiencing healthcare disruptions. Therefore, clinical and policy implications are discussed to reduce alcohol-related inequalities during the ongoing global pandemic.

While economic relief programmes are considered essential during a regional or global health crisis, there is no clear consensus in the literature about their health and non-health benefits and their impact on promoting equity. Thus, our objective is to map the current state of the literature with respect to the types of individual-level economic relief programmes implemented during infectious disease outbreaks and the impact of these programmes on the effectiveness of public health measures, individual and population health, non-health benefits and equity. Methods and analysis Our scoping review is guided by the updated Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework. Eligible studies will be identified in eight electronic databases and grey literature using text words and subject headings of the different pandemic and epidemic infectious diseases that have occurred, and economic relief programmes. Title and abstract screening and full-text screening will be conducted independently by two trained study reviewers. Data will be extracted using a pretested data extraction form. The charting of the key findings will follow a thematic narrative approach. Our review findings will provide in-depth knowledge on whether and how benefits associated with pandemic/epidemic individual-level economic relief programmes differ across social determinants of health factors. This information is critical for decision-makers as they seek to understand the role of pandemic/epidemic economic mitigation strategies to mitigate the health impact and reduce inequity gap.

Lifecourse socioeconomic position and cohort differences in health expectancy in Australia: a longitudinal cohort study	LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							FREE LIFE EXPECTANCY; MENTAL-HEALTH; OLD; AGE; INEQUALITIES; INDICATORS; MODELS	Background There is a need to know how changes in health expectancy differ for population subgroups globally. The aim of this study was to estimate 10-year trends in health expectancies by individual markers of socioeconomic position from three points over the lifecourse, evaluating how compression and expansion of morbidity have varied within a national population. Methods We analysed data from two cohorts of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. The cohorts were followed annually from 2001 to 2007 (n=4720; baseline age range 50-100 years) and 2011 to 2017 (n=6632; baseline age range 50-99 years). Health expectancies were estimated at age 65 years for four outcomes reflecting activity limitations, disability, perceived health, and mental health. Cohort differences were compared by gender, age left school, occupational prestige, and housing tenure. Findings Women with low socioeconomic position were the only group with no improvements in life expectancy across the two cohorts. Among men with low education and all women gains in life expectancy comprised entirely of years lived with global activity limitations. Compression of years lived with severe-disability, poor self-rated health, and poor mental health was most consistently observed for men and women with high education and home ownership. Occupational prestige did not greatly differentiate cohort differences in health expectancies. Interpretation Over the past two decades in Australia, social disparities in health expectancies have at least been maintained, and have increased for some outcomes. Equitable gains in health expectancies should be a major public health goal, and will help support sustainable health and social care systems. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Background: Global health experiences for nursing students are proliferating rapidly across university settings while at the same time decreasing the average time spent in the host country engaged with local communities. Global health experiences are an area where students can experience ethics as it is applied across varied contexts including resource limited international settings. As nursing education expands its global programming, exploring the ethical implications of designing, implementing and evaluating GHEs becomes pivotal to build respectful, sustainable relationships with global partners and best prepare nursing students for ethical professional practice in an interconnected world. Design: We conducted an integrative review to examine ethical considerations in development of ethical global health experiences that benefit, rather than harm, host communities and participating nursing student guests. Methods: The search included articles published in English language, peer-reviewed journals between 1998 and 2021 that discussed ethics in the context of nursing students traveling internationally for global health experiences. Eighteen articles met criteria for review. Results: Overall, findings demonstrate relatively little research specific to ethical engagement in global health experiences. The articles in this integrative review discussed a range of ethical attributes including reciprocity or collaboration, respect, sustainability or commitment, justice and openness. Recommendations based on research and non-research articles are provided. Conclusions: Ethical comportment in global health experiences requires careful planning, implementation and evaluation to assure an equitable and sustainable partnership between host community, faculty and nursing student guests.

J	Tchoukou, JA				Tchoukou, Julie Ada			Mothering Practices and Human Rights Abuses of Girls in Marginalized Contexts: Examining the Moral Culpability of Women who Abuse Children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW POLICY AND THE FAMILY			English	Article							HAUSA; CRITIQUE	The form of gender-based violence (GBV) analysed in this article relates to 'harmful traditional practices' (HTPs) detrimental to the health and well-being of girls. In response to calls to action from the international community, many states are enacting laws and regulations against HTPs. Scholars argue that criminal justice reform is a vital component of efforts to reduce HTPs. While this article supports establishing mechanisms to address violence against girls, I question whether criminalization is a suitable strategy. HTPs, although classified as GBV, have distinctive features. Their prevalence hinges on ideas surrounding ethnicity and/or religion in addition to the fact that women work directly and indirectly to sustain these violent practices. The developing contemporary understanding of HTPs within and without legal systems, to the degree that it focuses on perpetrators of abuse, ignores the role of women in the production and reproduction of HTPs. Criminalization of HTPs will have a disproportionate effect on mothers. This article seeks to question and understand the dilemma of determining the 'moral culpability' or responsibility of mothers who support and participate in violence against girls. Using postmodern feminism, I argue that a genuine commitment to protecting children requires an approach that accounts for the growing significance of culture, not only in defining action but also providing cultural components that play a role in the decisions of mothers.

Most people affected by PD live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and experience large inequalities in access to neurological care and essential medicines. This Special Communication describes 6 actions steps that are urgently needed to address global disparities in PD. OBSERVATIONS The adoption by the 73rd World Health Assembly (WHA) of resolution 73.10 to develop an intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders in consultation with member states was the stimulus to coordinate efforts and leverage momentum to advance the agenda of neurological conditions, such as PD. In April 2021, the Brain Health Unit at the World Health Organization convened a multidisciplinary, sex-balanced, international consultation workshop, which identified 6 workable avenues for action within the domains of disease burden; advocacy and awareness; prevention and risk reduction; diagnosis, treatment, and care; caregiver support; and research. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The dramatic increase of PD cases in many world regions and the potential costs of PD-associated treatment will need to be addressed to prevent possible health service strain. Across the board, governments, multilateral agencies, donors, public health organizations, and health care professionals constitute potential stakeholders who are urged to make this a priority.

Findings show significant differences in MNEs' approaches to the SDGs. DMNEs prioritise education, health and poverty, whereas CMNEs emphasise poverty, education and cities in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Conversely, inequality, hunger, consumption and production, oceans and peace, justice and strong institutions are poorly addressed. Most importantly, while contributing to sustainability, they foster inequalities among developing countries by over-focusing on China and India, against the pledge of Leaving No One Behind.

J	Esteban, ML				Esteban, Mari-Luz			Women's houses in the Basque country: political, cultural and bodily laboratories of feminism	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Women's houses; Basque country; space; feminism; institutionalization	ANTHROPOLOGY	This article analyzes the key characteristics of the Women's Houses in the Basque Country and how they are run. These municipal centres are promoted by the feminist movement in close collaboration with local institutions and are part of the long international feminist tradition of creating spaces specifically for women. The Houses run a diverse range of programmes and offer legal, employment and sexual health counselling services and other targeted support for precarious groups. The central point of this article is that these spaces are laboratories in which activity related to politics, training and support services influences the recomposition of the political subjectivities of the people who participate in them. Another key and distinctive aspect is the particular interrelationships found in the Houses between the institutionalist rationale coming out of the politics of equality and the rupturist rationale of movements like the feminist movement. Furthermore, different groups of feminist women (members of associations or institutions, professionals and researchers) co-exist in the Houses, which contributes to the horizontality of the relationships. Nevertheless, these aspects are not free of tensions, a point that will also be analysed here.

J	Bangay, C				Bangay, Colin			Education, anthropogenic environmental change, and sustainable development: A rudimentary framework and reflections on proposed causal pathways for positive change in low- and lower-middle income countries	DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						climate; demography; education; environment; system	TEMPERATURE	Motivation The article seeks to support policy-makers in considering the role of education in response to the climate-environment emergency. It argues for a holistic framing of education's response, incorporating both climate and environment. While recognizing the imperative of global action, it emphasizes the need for national/local education systems approaches that reflect the distinct and localized challenges and responsibilities pertinent to high-income countries (HICs) and low- and lower-middle income counties (L&LMICs). Purpose After presenting an overview of climate-environmental issues and education the article offers a rudimentary framework categorizing education responses to anthropogenic environmental change (AEC). Methods and approach The article brings together findings from education, demography, disaster risk reduction (DRR), and environmental studies. Findings The key findings are: (1) that education provision in L&LMICs is already being affected by environmental change; (2) the causal links between education and positive environmental impacts are weakly evidenced; (3) the bulk of literature is preoccupied with global climate change and CO2 emissions to the detriment of localized environmental considerations; and (4) that education should be viewed more as a "force multiplier"-alongside areas such as health, reproductive rights, social justice, and livelihoods. Policy implications The article argues that to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.7-whereby education systems of all nations equip students for sustainable development-there is a need for a more geographically specific understanding of the drivers of both climate change and environmental degradation. Differentiated education reform responses are required which reflect both responsibility for carbon emissions and vulnerability to climate and environmental impacts. In HICs this would suggest a greater focus on mitigation (reduction of carbon emissions) and in L&LMICs on adaptation (responding to AEC).

Impacts of COVID-19 on trans and non-binary people in Canada: a qualitative analysis of responses to a national survey	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Transgender; Non-binary; COVID-19 impacts; Qualitative research; Thematic analysis; Canada		Background Emerging international evidence indicates the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated socioeconomic and health challenges faced by transgender (trans) and non-binary populations globally. This qualitative study is among the first to characterize impacts of the pandemic on these groups in Canada. Methods Drawing on data from the Trans PULSE Canada survey (N = 820), we used thematic analysis to examine the free-form responses of 697 participants to one open-ended question on impacts of the pandemic. We first organized responses into descriptive themes, and then used this preliminary analytical process to construct more refined, higher order themes that provided a rich account of the pandemic's impacts. Results Our results are organized into five themes that highlight the pandemic's impacts on trans and non-binary populations in Canada. These include: (1) reduced access to both gender-affirming and other healthcare, (2) heightened financial, employment, and housing precarity, (3) strained social networks in an era of physical distancing and virtual communication, (4) an intensification of safety concerns, and (5) changes in experiences of gender affirmation. Conclusion Our findings highlight the pandemic's systemic impacts on the lives of trans and non-binary people in domains such as healthcare, employment, and housing, and on the social networks of these groups, many of which reflect an exacerbation of pre-existing inequities. Based on our analysis, we recommend that public health researchers, policymakers, and practitioners attend to the structural impacts of the pandemic on these groups as primary sites of inquiry and intervention.

In response to limited quantitative evidence documenting the temporal relationship between new greenspaces and gentrification across entire cities, let alone across various international contexts, we employ a spatially weighted Bayesian model to test the green gentrification hypothesis across 28 cities in 9 countries in North America and Europe. Here we show a strong positive and relevant relationship for at least one decade between greening in the 1990s-2000s and gentrification that occurred between 2000-2016 in 17 of the 28 cities. Our results also determine whether greening plays a "lead", "integrated", or "subsidiary" role in explaining gentrification. The relationship between new greenspaces and gentrification is an important one for urbanization. Here the authors show a positive relationship for at least one decade between greening in the 1990s-2000s and gentrification that occurred between 2000-2016 in 17 of 28 studied cities in North America and Europe.

J	Middlemiss, L				Middlemiss, Lucie			Who is vulnerable to energy poverty in the Global North, and what is their experience?	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						energy poverty; energy transition; fuel poverty; just transition	FUEL POVERTY; LIVED EXPERIENCE; OLDER-PEOPLE; COPING STRATEGIES; COLD HOMES; HEALTH; IMPROVEMENTS; ENGLAND; JUSTICE; MORTALITY	Energy poverty is a fast rising government agenda in the Global North, and is subject to a substantial academic literature. Energy poverty is experienced when people do not have adequate access to energy services (light, heat, warmth, and cooling) to live a decent life. Plans to transition to a low-carbon economy in the Global North have raised concerns about the impacts of environmental policy on more vulnerable citizens. A just transition is highly risky for energy poor households, who enter into the transition at a disadvantage. Understanding this starting point is critical in ensuring the energy poor are able to participate in a just transition, and are not subject to further disadvantage. Here, using a realist evaluation approach, I summarize the empirical literature on the experience of energy poverty in the Global North, in doing so characterizing who tends to be vulnerable to this problem, and painting a picture of their life experience. I show how energy poverty links to poverty, and how people from commonly disadvantaged social categories (disabled people, single parents, and people from ethnic minorities) are more likely to experience energy poverty. I describe the homes of people experiencing energy poverty, and their coping practices, as well as outlining the effects of energy poverty on health, social life, and home finances. In conclusion, I point to the weaknesses and gaps in the current literature, and suggest some important avenues of research for the future. This includes bringing energy poverty evidence into more extensive conversation with a just transitions agenda.

Leveraging Algorithms to Improve Decision-Making Workflows for Genomic Data Access and Management	BIOPRESERVATION AND BIOBANKING			English	Article						automated decision system; data access committee; ethics; genomics; health	INTERNATIONAL CODE; COMMITTEE MEMBERS; OVERSIGHT; HEALTH	Studies on the ethics of automating clinical or research decision making using artificial intelligence and other algorithmic tools abound. Less attention has been paid, however, to the scope for, and ethics of, automating decision making within regulatory apparatuses governing the access, use, and exchange of data involving humans for research. In this article, we map how the binary logic flows and real-time capabilities of automated decision support (ADS) systems may be leveraged to accelerate one rate-limiting step in scientific discovery: data access management. We contend that improved auditability, consistency, and efficiency of the data access request process using ADS systems have the potential to yield fairer outcomes in requests for data largely sourced from biospecimens and biobanked samples. This procedural justice rationale reinforces a broader set of participant and data subject rights that data access committees (DACs) indirectly protect. DACs protect the rights of citizens to benefit from science by bringing researchers closer to the data they need to advance that science. DACs also protect the informational dignities of individuals and communities by ensuring the data being accessed are used in ways consistent with participant values. We discuss the development of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health Data Use Ontology standard as a test case of ADS for genomic data access management specifically, and we synthesize relevant ethical, legal, and social challenges to its implementation in practice. We conclude with an agenda of future research needed to thoughtfully advance strategies for computational governance that endeavor to instill public trust in, and maximize the scientific value of, health-related human data across data types, environments, and user communities.

The Need for Sustainability, Equity, and International Exchange: Perspectives of Early Career Environmental Psychologists on the Future of Conferences	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						scientific conferences; early career researcher (ECR); travel-intensive conferences; academic travel; equitable academia; accessibility; inclusivity; sustainable academia	TRAVEL	At the 2019 and 2021 International Conference on Environmental Psychology, discussions were held on the future of conferences in light of the enormous greenhouse gas emissions and inequities associated with conference travel. In this manuscript, we provide an early career researcher (ECR) perspective on this discussion. We argue that travel-intensive conference practices damage both the environment and our credibility as a discipline, conflict with the intrinsic values and motivations of our discipline, and are inequitable. As such, they must change. This change can be achieved by moving toward virtual and hybrid conferences, which can reduce researchers' carbon footprints and promote equity, if employed carefully and with informal exchange as a priority. By acting collectively and with the support of institutional change, we can adapt conference travel norms in our field. To investigate whether our arguments correspond to views in the wider community of ECRs within environmental psychology, we conducted a community case study. By leveraging our professional networks and directly contacting researchers in countries underrepresented in those networks, we recruited 117 ECRs in 32 countries for an online survey in February 2022. The surveyed ECRs supported a change in conference travel practices, including flying less, and perceived the number of researchers wanting to reduce their travel emissions to be growing. Thirteen percent of respondents had even considered leaving academia due to travel requirements. Concerning alternative conference formats, a mixed picture emerged. Overall, participants had slightly negative evaluations of virtual conferences, but expected them to improve within the next 5 years. However, ECRs with health issues, facing visa challenges, on low funding, living in remote areas, with caretaking obligations or facing travel restrictions due to COVID-19 expected a switch toward virtual or hybrid conferences to positively affect their groups. Participants were divided about their ability to build professional relationships in virtual settings, but believed that maintaining relationships virtually is possible. We conclude by arguing that the concerns of ECRs in environmental psychology about current and alternative conference practices must be taken seriously. We call on our community to work on collective solutions and less travel-intensive conference designs using participatory methods.

J	Lee, SS; Lim, Y				Lee, Sangsoo; Lim, Youngshin			The gendered playing field: Family socioeconomic status and national gender inequality in adolescents? out-of-school physical activity	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Adolescents; Physical activity; Gender; Family SES; Multilevel negative binomial regression	IN-SCHOOL; ROLE-ORIENTATION; CHILDREN; CONTEXT; HEALTH; YOUTH; ACHIEVEMENT; DISPARITIES; KNOWLEDGE; IDEOLOGY	Research has shown that both gender and family socioeconomic status (SES) are important determinants of adolescents' physical activity (PA). This study expands our current knowledge by exploring the moderating role of family SES on gender differences in adolescents' out-of-school PA. We also examine whether this moderating effect varies across countries with different levels of gender inequality. Based on existing empirical studies and theoretical framework, it is hypothesized that 1) gender differences in out-of-school PA would be smaller among adolescents from higher SES families due to them being more likely to share egalitarian gender norms, and 2) this SES gradient in gender differences in adolescents' out-of-school PA would be more salient in countries with lower levels of gender inequality. A total of 316,657 15-year-old adolescents in 50 countries from the 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey were analyzed. Our multilevel negative binomial regression models show that the gender gap in out-of-school PA is mitigated among families with higher SES, but this moderating role of family SES is less noticeable in countries with higher levels of national gender inequality. Our findings suggest the importance of egalitarian gender culture at both individual and macro-level in understanding gender disparities in adolescents' PA.

In this article, we build a multi-space measure of deprivation by introducing urban mobilities derived from location footprints of nearly three million mobile phone users. Traditionally, experiences of deprivation have been estimated through a lens fixed to residential spaces, which overlooks the likelihood individuals experience deprivation beyond that implied by where they live. By quantifying how exposure to deprivation varies by human movement patterns across three English cities, we construct a Dynamic Index of Multiple Deprivation (D-IMD). Analysis of this measure high-lights how deprivation exposure converges to a more homogenous middle ground, which implies the deprivation gap lessens as individuals across the socio-economic spectrum coalesce in spaces that exhibit similar environ -mental conditions. Using a hypothetical example, our D-IMD measure identifies 185 neighbourhoods that would enter England's eligibility criteria for funding opportunity intended to alleviate socio-economic inequality and hardship. These practical implications are extensible to international contexts that mobilise deprivation indices in similar ways to English institutions.

Towards equity in mental health among children of migrants: Cross-cultural proposals	BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE			English	Review						Equity; Mental health; Migrants children; Transcultural psychiatry	IMMIGRANTS	Summary The issue of health equity and the effects of social and cultural disparities on mental health have been raised primarily in the United States and other English-speaking countries. This review of the international literature asks these questions about child and adolescent mental health in France and other countries throughout the world. Migrant children (first and second generation) are particularly vulnerable, with poorer mental health and more frequent psychological disorders than native children with parents born in France (and so on throughout world). They experience real disparities in mental health, linked first to the effects of their parents' or their own life paths on their health, but also to more difficult access to the child psychiatric care system due to language problems, representations of their needs, and the discriminations and racism that aggravate their psychological distress. These discriminations are not limited to the health field but are found throughout society and health field. After analyzing the effects of migration and discrimination on children's mental health, we draw on examples of programs throughout the world and transcultural research in France for proposals to increase protective factors for these children and adolescents and their families.

American Academy of Nursing Expert Panel consensus statement on the impact of COVID-19 on the US economy, education, and environment	NURSING OUTLOOK			English	Article							HEALTH	The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted countries around the globe with an escalation of health-related suffering, loss of life, disrupted education, and ongoing economic hardship. The United States economy, educational system, and environment have been strained and will require a renewed focus on public policies to address the environmental impact of the pandemic, advance equity, and leverage technology to benefit all communities. This manuscript summarizes the key issues that require timely policy responses and engagement from nursing. Although the global community is facing similar hardships, this manuscript will focus on the American Academy of Nursing's Policy Priorities for 2021 to 2022 to provide direction for policy engagement and nursing action to aid in the US recovery.

Trade, uneven development and people in motion: Used territories and the initial spread of COVID-19 in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean	SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES			English	Article						Delinking; Free trade; Pandemic spread; Relational geographies; Equity in health	CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS; STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; INFANT-MORTALITY; 1ST LAW; HEALTH; GROWTH; AMERICA; WORLD; DIVERSIFICATION	Mesoamerica and the Caribbean form a region comprised by middle-and low-income countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic differently. Here, we ask whether the spread of COVID-19, measured using early epidemic growth rates (r), reproduction numbers (Rt), accumulated cases, and deaths, is influenced by how the 'used territories' across the regions have been differently shaped by uneven development, human movement and trade differences. Using an econometric approach, we found that trade openness increased cases and deaths, while the number of international cities connected at main airports increased r, cases and deaths. Similarly, increases in concentration of imports, a sign of uneven development, coincided with increases in early epidemic growth and deaths. These results suggest that countries whose used territory was defined by a less uneven development were less likely to show exacerbated COVID-19 patterns of transmission. Health outcomes were worst in more trade dependent countries, even after controlling for the impact of transmission prevention and mitigation policies, highlighting how structural effects of economic integration in used territories were associated with the initial COVID-19 spread in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean.

However, most existing studies used a static assessment of air pollution exposure (mostly using the residential address) and do not account for activity space when modelling exposure to air pollution. The aim of this study is to understand how exposure to air pollution impacts metabolic disorders biomarkers, how this effect differs according to ethnicity, and for the first time compare these findings with two methods of exposure assessment: dynamic and static measures. Methods: Among the Community of Mine study, a cross-sectional study conducted in San Diego County, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) were assessed. Exposure to air pollution (PM2.5, NO2, traffic) was calculated using static measures around the home, and dynamic measures of mobility derived from Global Positioning Systems (GPS) traces using kernel density estimators to account for exposure variability across space and time. Associations of air pollution with metabolic disorders were quantified using generalized estimating equation models to account for the clustered nature of the data. Results: Among 552 participants (mean age 58.7 years, 42% Hispanic/Latino), Hispanics/Latinos had a higher exposure to PM2.5 compared to non-Hispanics using static measures. In contrast, Hispanics/Latinos had less exposure to PM2.5 using dynamic measures. For all participants, higher dynamic exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 was associated with increased insulin resistance and cholesterol levels, and increased risk of obesity, dyslipidemia and MetS (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07-1.28; RR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.12-1.30, respectively). The association between dynamic PM2.5 exposure and MetS differed by Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Conclusion: These results highlight the importance of considering people's daily mobility in assessing the impact of air pollution on health.

J	Yan, WB; Nie, P				Yan, Weibo; Nie, Peng			Child education-induced migration and its impact on the economic behaviors of migrated households in China	APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article						Education-Induced migration; son preference; economic behaviours; Hukou	LEFT-BEHIND CHILDREN; INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; CONSEQUENCES; PARENTS; HEALTH; WOMEN	Using the 2011-2013 China Migrants Dynamic Survey, this paper utilizes the quarter of the year in which a child was born as an instrumental variable to measure child education shock and explores its impact on migrated households. We only find significant education-induced migration among boys, which we attribute to son preference in China. Due to child education-induced migration, the per capita household consumption increases by 56.7%, the savings rate decreases by 40.3%, and remittances sent home decline by about 1.3 monthly household incomes, however, there are no effects on income, food consumption, and house rent. After exploring the mechanisms underlying child education-induced migration, we find that children migrate with their parents are less likely to pursue a better education in urban areas. Because of the closure and consolidation of rural primary schools, children are forced to migrate due to their education needs. The accessibility of primary schools in urban areas is also responsible for migration decisions regarding children. This paper facilitates understanding of how Hukou influences gender inequality in China. We also provide evidence to show that the segregation of the education system through Hukou is a possible explanation for the low consumption rate of migrants.

However, in the shadow of recent sociopolitical movements such as Black Lives Matter and Me Too, raised awareness of mental health concerns and an ongoing global pandemic, there are calls for a reimagined perspective of PYD through a social justice worldview. The purpose of the current article is to posit how coach education programs and coach development systems can inclusively meet the diverse needs of coaches, youth athletes, and society alike. Specifically, two questions guided the development of this article: 1) Why should coach education and coach development integrate social justice life skills? and 2) How may social justice life skills be integrated into coach education and coach development? Ultimately, as researchers and coach developers, we must not only be advocates for social justice in youth sports, but critically engaged activists who progress youth - and societal - development forward.

Relationship between achieving Sustainable Development Goals and promoting optimal care and prevention of birth defects globally	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH			English	Review						birth defects; care; congenital anomalies; surveillance; prevention; sustainable development goals	UPDATED SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; CONGENITAL-ANOMALIES; PRECONCEPTION HEALTH; UNDER-5 MORTALITY; NATIONAL CAUSES; CLEFT-LIP; CHILDREN; SERVICES; EXPOSURE	Birth defects affect eight million newborns annually worldwide. About 8% of global under-5 mortality is attributable to birth defects. The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set 17 global goals for human growth and development to be achieved by 2030 using multi-sectorial approaches. The third goal (SDG-3) focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being; achieving SDG-3 improves birth defects care and prevention. However, we aimed to show how achieving other SDGs also influence optimal care and prevention of birth defects. SDGs focused on poverty reduction, access to nutritious food, universal health coverage, equitable education, gender equality, environment, inclusivity through infrastructure innovation, and strengthening social justice is crucial to addressing social determinants of health for individuals and families affected by birth defects. Understanding birth defects in the context of several relevant SDGs will allow practitioners, researchers, and policymakers to leverage the momentum generated by SDGs and make a case for commitment and allocation of funding and resources for advancing birth defects surveillance, care, and prevention. SDGs are built on principles of equity and social justice and we urge policy-makers to approach birth defects using various SDGs as a catalyst. The synergy between several SDGs helps to optimize birth defect outcomes and prevention. Our effort to present a more comprehensive look at various SDGs and their relationship with birth defects is parallel to several other health advocacy groups conducting a similar mapping exercise, thus bringing to the forefront millions of lives that are impacted by birth defects worldwide.

Methods: We used two rounds of the Global Early Adolescent Study (GEAS) collected in Shanghai in 2018 and 2020. We analyzed data from 621 adolescents, comparing boys' and girls' concerns about COVID-19 and examining trends in general health and mental health by sex between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Changes in health indicators over time were assessed using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models.Results: Adolescent girls reported more health concerns (52.0% vs. 42.7%) and educational con-cerns (61.0% vs. 46.3%) than boys, whereas boys expressed more worries about the economic consequences of COVID-19 (32.9% vs. 25.4%). Changes in health-related outcomes during the pandemic compared to the prepandemic era differed by sex and varied by COVID-related expe-riences. Boys reported improved overall health (OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.00, 2.35) in the COVID-19 period relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. Such improvements were only observed among boys who reported no family economic hardships (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.58). We found no significant change for girls (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.55), regardless of COVID-19 economic impacts. In contrast, girls reported increased anxiety (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.45), especially among those who were concerned about their academic performance (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.97). Boys experienced no such increase (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.54), regardless of their education concerns.Discussion: Adolescents' COVID-19 experiences are highly gendered and result in increased health inequalities, with greater mental health implications for girls.(c) 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Structural violence: An evolutionary concept analysis	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Review						concept analysis; health inequity; literature review; nursing; structural determinants of health; structural violence	HEALTH DISPARITIES; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; EQUITY; DETERMINANTS; INEQUITIES; WOMEN	Aims To enhance conceptual clarity and interdisciplinary understanding of structural violence, and to illuminate its implications for contemporary social justice and health equity research, by: (1) synthesizing scholarly literature pertaining to structural violence and health; (2) defining its key attributes, antecedents, consequences and characteristics; (3) contextually situating this phenomenon over time and across disciplines. Design A comprehensive review of scholarly health literature pertaining to 'structural violence' or its surrogate term 'structural determinants of health' was guided by a Research and Education Librarian. Data Sources In November 2019 and again in April 2021, CINAHL, Embase, Global Health, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles that described structural violence in the context of health. Of the 238 unique records identified, 32 articles were selected for inclusion and comprise the review sample. Review Methods Using Beth Rodgers' evolutionary concept analysis method, articles were comparatively analysed to identify key attributes, antecedents and consequences associated with the concept's use in health research. Results The five interrelated attributes characterizing structural violence are: power, marginality, oppression, adversity and trauma. Hegemonic social, cultural, economic and political systems serve as antecedents, whilst the consequences of structural violence can be broadly classified as health inequity, injustice and indignity, and social disorganization. Conclusion This analysis contributes to conceptual clarity and mutual understanding of the usage, application and significance of structural violence across health disciplines and provides a strong foundation for continued concept development and operationalization. Further research is needed to substantiate the relationship between structural violence and health inequity.

We build on these social experiments to suggest that sharing in housing and neighborhoods can lead to better mental health and wellbeing. The capabilities approach, popularized by philosophers Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, provides a theoretical perspective for integrating sharing options into housing and neighborhood design, regulation, and investment. We offer a framework delineating dimensions of sharing that has the potential to encourage more sharing and shift planning emphasis from housing as an outcome to one that promotes sharing.

Identifying these calls for decolonisation of global health as both promising but limited, we argue that global health needs to engage in deeper critical reassessment of its ontological foundations in Western thought and that Indigenous ontologies have an important role to play in deconstructing and reimagining global health. We identify four Western ontological assumptions that are particularly relevant to global health and demonstrate how Indigenous ontologies assist in thinking outside of and beyond these assumptions, offering a path toward a reconstructed Indigenized imagining of global health.

This vulnerability has been put to the test once again with the appearance of Omicron as another variant of concern. Although great efforts have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines, they need to be made available globally at an affordable price to all governments and distributed equitably to maximize immediate and long-term efforts to contain the virus and advance global public health. Potential sources of unfair allocation of COVID-19 vaccines are not hard to find. The COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX) has so far shipped over 406 million COVID-19 vaccines to 144 eligible participants. From that batches, about 115 million doses (28%) were allocated to 49 African countries. If proactive measures are not undertaken, Nigeria, pointed here as a case study, and Sub-Saharan Africa countries may not be self-reliant for COVID-19 vaccines. This report raises a discussion on the difficulties in accessing vaccines and diagnostics in sub-Saharan Africa, compared to high- and middle-income countries. Now more than ever, it is crucial to note that there is no overcoming a pandemic without coordinated action for actions that go beyond borders. The coordinated effort to raise vaccination rates in the African continent is not a humanitarian action aimed exclusively at Africa, but more than that, it is an effort for the benefit of global public health.

We critique intellectual property (IP) law under the 1994 WTO TRIPS Agreement, and specifically, the role that IP has played in enabling the inequities of production, distribution and pricing in the COVID-19 vaccine context. Given the failure of international response mechanisms, including COVAX and C-TAP, to address vaccine inequity, we argue the TRIPS waiver proposal should be viewed as offering a necessary and proportionate legal measure for clearing IP barriers that cannot be achieved by existing TRIPS flexibilities. Finally, we reflect on the waiver debate in the wider context of TRIPS and the need to boost global pandemic preparedness.

Individuals with low socioeconomic position seem to be at a higher risk for sustaining a medical adverse event and premature death. This time series analysis aimed to assess educational gradients behind adverse event deaths in the US over the period 2010-2019. MethodsPublicly available mortality and census data were retrieved from official sources. The data included age, sex, educational attainment, and underlying cause of death. Adverse event deaths were identified by ICD-10 codes Y40-Y84 and Y88. Four education categories were created in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Education 2011 coding scheme [No high school or General Educational Development (GED); High school or GED; Some college; Bachelor's degeree or higher]. To capture also highly educated individuals, the analysis was delimited to >= 30-year-olds. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AMRs) were compared between education categories by means of mortality plots and linear mixed models. ResultsA total of 25,897,334 certified deaths occurred among >= 30-year-olds during the study period. The underlying cause of death was an adverse event in a rarity of cases (0.12%, n = 31,997). Individuals with Bachelor's degeree or higher had the lowest adverse event AMRs (6.1-12.4 per million per year), followed by the Some college category (9.6-18.6), the High school or GED category (17.1-35.4), and finally the No high school or GED category (20.0-36.0). AMRs showed a gradual increase as education level decreased (p <= 0.001 against those with Bachelor's degeree or higher). Moreover, the temporal increase in adverse event AMRs was more pronounced among individuals with low than high education; the contrasts between categories were greatest toward the end of the study period. ConclusionThe findings of this study suggest that the widening socioeconomic gradients in mortality extend also to fatal adverse events. Future studies should aim to analyze whether access to care, severity of the condition at presentation, quality of care, and social determinants of health may drive the gradients.

As with any emerging disease, pharmaceutical interventions required time, emphasizing the initial and continuing need for non-pharmaceutical interventions. We highlight the role of anthropological and historical perspectives to inform approaches to non-pharmaceutical interventions for future preparedness. The National Academy of Medicine, a not-for-profit, non-governmental US-based medical watchdog organization, published a key document early in the COVID-19 pandemic which points to inadequate quarantine and containment infrastructure as a significant obstacle to an effective pandemic response. In considering how to implement effective quarantine policies and infrastructure, we argue that it is essential to take a longitudinal approach to assess interventions that have been effective in past pandemics while simultaneously addressing and eliminating the negative socio-historical legacies of ineffective quarantine practices. Our overview reinforces the need for social equity and compassion when implementing containment.

Upstream interventions to promote oral health and reduce socioeconomic oral health inequalities: a scoping review protocol	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						public health; health policy; protocols & guidelines	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; DISEASES; CARIES; LIFE	Introduction Improving oral health and reducing oral health inequalities is an important global health priority. 'Upstream interventions' are a vital part of the collective effort to reduce oral disease burdens, however it is a rather nebulous term. Furthermore, there is little evidence on the effectiveness, impact and sustainability of upstream interventions that have focused on oral health and wider public health measures that impact on oral health. The aim of this scoping review is to systematically map and synthesise evidence on the effectiveness, impact and sustainability of upstream interventions on population oral health and reducing socioeconomic oral health inequalities. Methods and analysis This scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. A detailed search strategy will be used to conduct a comprehensive search of electronic databases: Scopus, Embase and MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL, ASSIA and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. A search of grey literature will also be completed to identify relevant dissertations, governmental reports and evaluations of implemented policies. Identification and extraction of data will be performed by two pairs of reviewers. Oversight and feedback will be provided by an independent expert advisory group. Ethics and dissemination This study will review published and available grey literature and does not require an ethics review. The scoping review protocol has been registered with the Open Science Framework. The final report will be circulated and disseminated through publication and feed into the work of the ongoing Lancet Commission on Oral Health. Due to the policy relevance of this work, discussions will take place with key stakeholders regarding the implications of the findings for future policy development.

J	Schobin, J				Schobin, Janosch			Loneliness and Emancipation: A Multilevel Analysis of the Connection between Gender Inequality, Loneliness, and Social Isolation in the ISSP 2017	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						gender inequality; loneliness; couples; multilevel analysis	RELATIONSHIP QUALITY; OLDER-ADULTS; HEALTH; NETWORKS; IMPUTATION; MORTALITY; COUNTRIES; EQUALITY; DISTRESS; DIVORCE	The present article analyzes the connection between, on the one hand, gender equality and, on the other hand, loneliness and social isolation. It hypothesizes that modern relational institutions that support gender equality, such as no-fault divorce laws, reduce loneliness in close relationships. This hypothesis is put to the test through a multilevel analysis of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2017. The analysis reveals that the data agree, to a large extent, with the theoretical arguments. The prevalence of loneliness is higher in countries with higher levels of gender inequality (as measured by the Gender Inequality Index (GII)). This can be attributed to a moderation effect; at lower levels of gender inequality, partnerships provide better protection from loneliness. These results are robust to controls for demographic composition, level of health, educational attainment, income poverty, and interview mode. Last, the analyses show that the threat of emotional isolation is more widespread in countries with low gender inequality. These findings, however, are only significant before controlling for demographic composition, level of health, educational attainment, income poverty, and interview mode, and they require further analysis. The concluding section relates these findings to the popular tendency to argue that modern society has created a "loneliness epidemic" and discusses policy implications.

Gender Norms and Gender Equality in Full-Time Employment and Health: A 97-Country Analysis of the World Values Survey	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						gender equality; gender norms; women empowerment; full-time employment; self-reported health (SRH)	WOMEN; UNEMPLOYMENT; FAMILY; PAY; DISCRIMINATION; INEQUALITY; PERCEPTION; EDUCATION; MANAGERS; FEMINISM	BackgroundAlmost nowhere in the world do women participate as much as men in the labor force. Despite differences in countries' economic, social and cultural contexts, gender norms-unwritten rules of acceptable actions for men and women-have been found to affect women's labor participation across contexts. Gender norms include those regulating who takes care of children, who is expected to earn more, and in which sectors men and women should work. Importantly, norms affect access to labor markets at times of scarcity: when there's only work for one, gender norms can dictate whether a woman or man gets the job. Advocates of equal labor force participation point to evidence that employment can contribute to people's health and well-being; yet the evidence is mixed and contradictory, and mostly comes from high-income countries. In restrictive normative contexts in which women are assigned the role of family caretaker, full time employment (FTE) might be particularly burdensome. At the same time, the literature lacks a cross-country analysis of how gender norms affect women's FTE and their health when employed full time, despite qualitative research providing clear evidence of the influence of gender norms on labor participation. AimsIn this paper we examine: (1) how gender norms affect women's access to FTE across 97 countries; (2) associations between FTE and women's self-reported health self-rated (SRH) across different normative contexts (i.e., countries where it is common vs. uncommon for women to stay home); and (3) how women's FTE and gender norms changed over time in four countries. DataWe used time-series data from the World Values Survey and European Values Survey conducted in over 100 countries between 1981 and 2014. Both surveys attempt to capture norms, beliefs and values in addition to sociodemographic information among a nationally representative adult population in each country. The sample for the cross-sectional analyses (aims 1 and 2) included 97 countries and 131,132 respondents. The sample for aim 3 included data from Argentina, Egypt, Finland and Japan. VariablesOur outcome of interest was pro-equality norms in the context of access to the labor market for women. Respondents were asked "if jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women do?". Response options included no, neither or yes. We created a binary variable to represent pro-equality norms. We included employment status and SRH as exposures of interest. AnalysisWe used individual-level data to generate on-average and sex-stratified estimates of the outcome and exposures for each country, at each time point. We estimated the percentage of all respondents, of women, and of men who held pro-equality norms (believe that men should not have more right to a job than women), the percentage who were employed full time, and the average level of SRH. To measure gender inequality in FTE, we also estimated the absolute difference in FTE between women and men for each country at each time point. First, we conducted descriptive, cross-sectional ecological analyses using one survey per country from wave 5 or 6 (whichever was most recent) to examine associations between pro-equality norms and employment status as a proxy for associations between norms and the context of employment in each country. We also examined associations between pro-equality norms and SRH. We then specified adjusted logistic regression models with controls for age, sex and education to examine associations between pro-equality norms and employment status. To examine if the relationship between FTE and SRH varied by normative context, we grouped countries in quartiles of pro-equality norms. Finally, we conducted descriptive ecological analyses of the relationship between pro-equality norms and employment status over time in four countries. ResultsObjective 1: Gender norms intersect with socio-cultural contexts in determining women's FTE. While in some countries gender norms aligned positively with women's access to employment (i.e., more equal norms matched more equality in FTE), in Eastern Europe and South America we observed a mismatch. In Eastern Europe we found strong norms against equal access but small sex differences in FTE. In South America, we observed a stark difference in FTE favoring men, despite positive gender norms promoting women's paid employment. Objective 2: We found the association between SRH and FTE to vary across normative contexts. For instance, while in Scandinavian countries it was protective to be a woman in FTE and harmful not to work full-time, we found the opposite effect in Middle Eastern countries. Objective 3: We found a general tendency to move toward greater equality in norms and FTE over time everywhere in the world. However, political and economic events can generate variations over time and setbacks in progress toward equality.We specifically looked at 4 countries: Argentina, Egypt, Finland and Japan and assessed the effects of economic, political and national legislative changes on FTE over time. ImplicationsThis paper contributes to the conversation on tensions between universal justice and contextual factors affecting one's health. To achieve purposeful and global universal health and justice, policy makers and global health practitioners must design effective, context-relevant interventions that are deeply and transparently informed by the values they embody. As we strive to achieve global gender equality, its meanings and purposes will vary across contexts in ways that demand people-led conversations and interventions.

The city council of Barcelona carried out an intervention to reduce EP among social services users. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of the intervention perceived by participants and to identify typologies of social vulnerability that could affect these effects. A qualitative methodology was used within a grounded theory framework with a critical theory approach. Twenty-one interviews and 11 discussion groups were conducted among 89 participants in the intervention. Six typologies of social vulnerability were defined: single mothers, older people, migrants, tenants, people living in dwellings in poor conditions and people with chronic health problems. The results show that the overall effects of the program included economic savings, improved thermal comfort, increased perception of social support, enhanced knowledge of energy efficiency and rights to basic supplies, and greater energy security. These factors improved well-being and reduced stress and anxiety related to not being able to use energy supplies. The effects of the intervention might vary according to housing conditions, the perceived priority of social problems and the type of social vulnerability among participants. Importantly, a single individual could experience different axes of social inequality simultaneously. A typologies approach to interventions can provide a deeper understanding for the design of equitable policies to reduce EP.

J	Sperkova, K; Anderson, P; Llopis, EJ				Sperkova, Kristina; Anderson, Peter; Llopis, Eva Jane			Alcohol policy measures are an ignored catalyst for achievement of the sustainable development goals	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background By adopting Agenda 2030, governments agreed to review and report on their approach and action for achievement of sustainable development goals annually through the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development. Health and well-being are at the heart of the United Nations Agenda 2030. Given the social and economic harm that can be done by alcohol, reducing the consumption of alcohol is a pre-requisite to achieve the sustainable development goals. We explored how selected European countries have considered alcohol-related harm as an obstacle to achievement of SDGs and the extent to which they view alcohol policy as a solution to the achievement of sustainable development by analysing their voluntary national reviews (VNRs) submitted to the HLPF between years 2016 and 2020. Methods We developed our own framework with 260 questions reflecting three dimensions of alcohol-harm considerations: indication, action, and evaluation. We analysed 36 VNRs of 32 European countries by first assessing them against the 260 questions to find out how they report on alcohol harm and whether they, in their action, refer to evidence-based, cost-effective alcohol policy solutions. Afterwards we used content analysis to assess the extent to which the countries addressed alcohol related harm, whether they refer to alcohol harm within SDG 3 (good health and well-being) or look beyond the health goal and consider alcohol harm having impact on goals other than the Goal 3. Findings Nine countries (28.1%) did not mention alcohol in their report. Only eight countries (25%) mentioned one or more of the alcohol policy best buys among the actions they are taking to reduce alcohol related harm and only three (9.3%) explicitly elaborated on their impact on goals other than goal 3. Only five countries referred to the agreed indicator 3.5.2 measuring alcohol per capita consumption in the adult population. Many of the remaining countries used a range of terminology rather than alcohol per capita consumption, including "excessive use of alcohol", "heavy use", "too much alcohol ", "harmful alcohol consumption", "use among young people". Interpretation Alcohol use is, for example, associated with violence (SDG 5 and 16), it contributes to inequalities (SDG 5 and 10), it hinders economic growth (SDG 8), disrupts sustainable consumption (SDG 12) and it adversely impacts environment (SDG 13 and 14). The findings of this study show that these effects are not considered in the design of measures to achieve these goals. Moreover, inaccurate language related to alcohol harm indicates a gap in understanding of extend of alcohol burden and the consequences for sustainable development. So does the choice of ineffective measures to reduce alcohol consumption. Education programs and awareness raising campaigns focusing on individual lifestyle are neither in line with WHO Global Strategy to reduce the harm caused by alcohol that all selected countries adopted in 2010, nor do they reflect the seriousness of the problems related to alcohol use. Effective alcohol policy measures, so called three best buys, are missing from the transformative action that the Agenda 2030 calls for and governments committed to.

Public acceptability of COVID-19 control measures in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia: A cross-sectional survey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Infectious diseases; Epidemics; Vaccination; Quarantine; COVID-19	HEALTH; TRUST	Background: Several countries have implemented control measures to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread, including digital contact tracing, digital monitoring of quarantined individuals, and testing of travelers. These raise ethical issues around privacy, personal freedoms, and equity. However, little is known regarding public acceptability of these measures. Methods: In December 2020, we conducted a survey among 3635 respondents in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia to understand public perceptions on the acceptability of COVID-19 control measures. Findings: Hong Kong respondents were much less supportive of digital contact tracing and monitoring devices than those in Malaysia and Singapore. Around three-quarters of Hong Kong respondents perceived digital contact tracing as an unreasonable restriction of individual freedom; < 20% trusted that there were adequate local provisions preventing these data being used for other purposes. This was the opposite in Singapore, where nearly 3/4 of respondents agreed that there were adequate data protection rules locally. In contrast, only a minority of Hong Kong respondents viewed mandatory testing and vaccination for travelers as unreasonable infringements of privacy or freedom. Less than 2/3 of respondents in all territories were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19, with a quarter of respondents undecided. However, support for differential travel restrictions for vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals was high in all settings. Interpretation: Our findings highlight the importance of sociopolitical context in public perception of public health measures and emphasize the need to continually monitor public attitudes toward such measures to inform implementation and communication strategies.

The World Bank and other leading global health actors champion mixed health systems-in which government and privately-financed market delivery coexist-as a sustainable model for UHC. Yet, little is known about what these public-private arrangements mean for women, a crucial partaker of UHC in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Using a critical feminist approach, this study explores how women negotiate access to public and private healthcare services within Sri Lanka's state-dominant mixed health system. Data were generated through focus group discussions and interviews with women residents of an urban division in Kandy, a city seeing rapid private healthcare expansion in central Sri Lanka. Notwithstanding policies of universality guiding public sector delivery, out-of-pocket payments burden socially and economically disadvantaged women. They use private services to fill gaps in the public system, and consult dual practitioners privately, to pave way for better (public) care. By contrast, wealthier women opt for private outpatient care, but capitalize on the dual practitioners to obtain priority access to oversubscribed services at public hospitals. Most women, regardless of social location, combine public with private, albeit to varying degrees, to save on household expenses. Relying on women's invisible care work, these public-private "hybrid " routes of access within Sri Lanka's poorly regulated mixed health system, reinforce social inequalities and individualize the responsibility for healthcare. The article throws light on the messiness of access within mixed systems and demands closer scrutiny of calls for private sector engagement in the quest for UHC in LMICs.

Financial barriers could compound to poor transitional care into adulthood, when forgoing mental health treatment may have long-term consequences on health and development. We evaluate the impact of increasing deductibles on mental health care use by young adults, and the heterogeneous effects for vulnerable groups. Methods: We use individual administrative records for 1,541,210 individuals between 17 and 19 years of age, living in the Netherlands. We implement a difference-in-discontinuity design that exploits an increase in the deductible of about 180 euros, between 2009 and 2014, and the deductible exemption for those below 18 years old. Finally, we study subgroup effects by household income, level of mental health care expenditure and medication use for mental disorders. Results: Our results show that increasing deductibles reduced the probability of mental health care use at the transition to adulthood by 13.6% for females (13.6%, CI 95%: 22.1%, 5.2%), and by 5.3% for males (5.3%, CI 95%: 11.8%, 1.2%). The reduction was larger among females in the lowest (18.9%, CI 95%: 35.4%, 2.3%) and second lowest (21.3%, CI 95%: -36.7%, 5.9%) income quartiles. Additionally, we find increased treatment cessation in high deductible years to happen across all levels of mental health care need. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that cost-sharing is compounding to existing disruptions in care at the tran-sition between children/adolescent and adult services. The larger reductions in mental health care use among low-income females uncover the role of the deductible increase in widening mental health care inequalities. Increased treatment cessation even among high-intensity users suggests potential long-term consequences for individuals, the health system, and society.

J	Mills, A; Levin, L				Mills, Arden; Levin, Liran			Inequities in periodontal disease prevalence, prevention, and management	QUINTESSENCE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						accessibility; barriers to care; health care systems; oral disease; treatment; wellbeing	EMERGENCY-ROOM VISITS; DENTAL-CARE; ORAL-HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; RISK INDICATORS; NATIONAL-HEALTH; IMPACT; INEQUALITIES; NUTRITION; ADULTS	Periodontal disease is highly prevalent and contributes to the global burden of chronic diseases. Inherent and institutional inequities contribute to the prevalence of periodontal disease by facilitating barriers to accessing dental care and maintaining good oral health. The aim of this paper is to review the inequities experienced in the dental field in relation to periodontal disease. Barriers to dental care are experienced in many countries globcian availability, and oral health literacy. These barriers influence the frequency of dental visits, oral hygiene, and risk behaviors of individuals which impact an individual's oral health status. Most often, postponed or improper dental care leads to worsened dental conditions that are more costly and detrimental to one's wellbeing. These dental conditions, like periodontitis, fall back on the health care system for treatment through emergency department resource use and comorbidities that can develop or be worsened as a result. To reduce the global burden of chronic disease and the costs of treatments for preventable conditions, and increase oral health, corrective actions are required. Such actions may include the use of teledentistry, greater oral health education, emergency departments staffing dental practitioners, subsidies for rural or remote dental practitioners, and policy changes for universal coverage of basic dental needs.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus represented a global challenge demanding immediate response to an unprecedented health crisis. Various voices drew attention to the intensity of the crisis in countries with greater inequalities, where the pandemic converged with other social emergencies. We documented the experiences of health personnel who faced the pandemic at the primary care level while simultaneously maintaining the functioning of other areas of medical care. Our results derived from a qualitative study comprising 103 participants from five states of Mexico. We aimed to show through inferential analysis their perspective on what we call 'the resilience of local health systems'. We observed three stages of experience during the crisis: (a) Preparation (official guidelines received to organize care, training and planning of epidemiological surveillance); (b) Adaptation (performance of community-based prevention activities, infrastructure modifications, telehealth); and (c) Learning (participatory governance with city councils, business sector and organized population). The study suggests that the local health systems analysed benefited from the initiatives of health personnel that in some cases positively exceeded their duties. In terms of the resilience analysis, they were able to handle the impact of the crisis and cope with it. Their transformative capacity came from the strategies implemented to adapt health services by managing institutional resources. Their experience represents a lesson on the strengthening of the essential functions of health systems and shows a way to address successfully the increasingly complex health challenges of the present and future times.

In 2014, the Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice formed a task force to focus on the issue. After completing two comprehensive reviews and consultations with experts in the field, the task force identified the need for a coherent framework, which conceptualized the primary prevention of child trafficking, which includes children vulnerable to being trafficked and becoming traffickers. This article describes the process undertaken to develop the primary prevention framework, an innovative, aspirational plan for communities to be absent of trafficking. It describes the framework in detail, including the theories that underlie it and the principles that guide it. The framework's flexibility is evident in its application to such worldwide challenges as racism, inequities, and a pandemic. Although the full consequences of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children are not yet known, this article describes certain trends, which have been identified and discusses critical lessons for applying a dynamic framework, as global disruptors will continue. The article ends with examples of how the framework could be implemented by all stakeholders in the community, to address the primary prevention of child trafficking in both the physical and the virtual world. Public Policy Relevance Statement Child trafficking is one of the most egregious violations of children's rights and well-being. Although it is difficult to estimate the number of children involved, its pervasiveness is indisputable. The development of this primary prevention framework offers a comprehensive way to utilize community strengths and resources to prevent child trafficking in all its forms.

A fundamental principle of agroecology is the responsible governance of land. Yet land-as a concept, resource, and territory-is heavily contested through processes of colonization, enclosure, commodification, and financialization. The governance of land and natural resources is also intimately tied to questions of power and privilege-Who governs land? Who benefits, and who is excluded? These questions presuppose an ontological understanding of land that can also be contested: What is land, what purpose(s) does it serve, and for whom? In this article, we review key concepts at the intersection of land governance and agroecology. We take a case study approach to highlight how tensions around ontologies of land mediate agroecological futures in 2 settler-colonial contexts: Brazil and Canada. We then explore how land governance for agroecology might be experienced and understood across different land governance institutions- including relational and community commons, private property regimes, and new forms of hybrid land relations that challenge land privatization. We discuss how these land regimes influence people, landscapes, and agroecological outcomes and conclude with a consideration of the access, equity, and justice implications of different land governance approaches for sustainable food systems.

J	Smith, S; Jiang, JJ; Normand, C; O'Neill, C				Smith, Samantha; Jiang, Jing Jing; Normand, Charles; O'Neill, Ciaran			The price of private dental services: results from a national representative survey of Ireland	IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Dentists; Dental examination; Dental practices; Inequalities; Ireland; Oral health; Price; Survey		Introduction Dental services in Ireland are delivered in a mixed public-private system but the majority of dental care is paid for out-of-pocket by individuals. Ireland is not unusual in the global context where public subsidisation for oral healthcare is limited in many countries. This is despite the fact that oral health plays an important role in well-being and despite international evidence on the negative impact of user fees on utilisation of beneficial healthcare. However, there has been little up- to-date assessment of the prices faced by individuals for a range of non-acute care services in Ireland, including dental care. This paper presents an up-to-date assessment of private dental prices in Ireland for a range of preventive, primary, and complex services based on a nationally representative survey. Methods The total sample size for the desk-based survey was 103, accounting for 6% of private dentists in Ireland, weighted to reflect the geographic distribution of dentists. Dentists were selected at random from the publicly available list of dentists participating in the Dental Treatment Benefit Scheme. The adult price of 10 different services covering core preventive, primary, and complex procedures were identified from public websites for the selected dental practices. Results Results showed that in addition to there being an uneven supply of dentists across the country, dental prices also vary with some notable variations by region and type of service. In particular, dental practices located in border counties, and those in rural areas typically show lower mean prices relative to non-border counties and urban areas. These factors need to be considered when planning how to reduce inequalities in access to oral health services in Ireland.

J	Murakami, K; Itsubo, N; Kuriyama, K				Murakami, Kayo; Itsubo, Norihiro; Kuriyama, Koichi			Explaining the diverse values assigned to environmental benefits across countries	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							HEALTH DAMAGE FACTORS; SATISFACTION; INCOME; GROWTH; COSTS	One of the key obstacles to building public consensus regarding environmental problems is the fact that environmental benefits are valued differently by different individuals and across different regions. Lack of public consensus has fractured international and domestic agreements, preventing effective system implementation. However, where does the disparity come from? Here, we provide evidence that can help to understand such diversity by analysing large-scale survey data collected across G20 countries. Combining lifecycle impact assessment and economic valuation techniques, our analysis shows that people's perceptions of environmental benefits are in fact diverse, but are determined by a few social indicators such as life expectancy, income and gender equality, as well as individual conditions such as relative income and subjective well-being. As these social- and individual-level conditions improve, people shift priorities and place more emphasis on less tangible environmental benefits (biodiversity conservation) rather than relatively tangible (health-related) ones. Focusing on such determinants and addressing the problems of inequality and well-being are critical to building public consensus and tackling global environmental issues practically. Our findings can illuminate a feasible step to global consensus and a sustainable society. Why environmental benefits are valued differently across individuals and regions is not well understood. Using large-scale survey data collected across G20 countries, this study finds that a few social indicators explain the diversity in people's perceptions of environmental benefits.

Pregnant Women, HIV, and Clinical Research to Prevent Perinatal Transmission in the 1990s	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY			English	Article						clinical research ethics; HIV; medicine; pregnancy; women; global health	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; GLOBAL HEALTH; TRIALS; AIDS; ETHICS; POLICY; INTERVENTIONS; RETHINKING; ZIDOVUDINE; EQUALITY	In 1994, American and French AIDS research showed that the drug AZT reduced the risk of HIV transmission from a pregnant HIV-positive woman to her fetus (perinatal transmission). Hailed as a breakthrough, the AIDS Clinical Trial Group protocol 076 (ACTG 076) soon became the standard of care in the US But ACTG 076 was too expensive for low-income countries where perinatal transmission rates were high; to find a more affordable prevention, the US principally funded studies in several low-income countries. Controversy over whether the short course of AZT studies was ethical, given their different standards of care and use of a placebo, erupted in 1997. These studies remain well known within the global health biomedical literature as illustrating differences between sending and receiving countries. But while rarely invoked within this literature, these two sets of studies have similarities that challenge this hierarchal division: both involved pregnant women as objects of clinical research instead of subjects of clinical care, reflective of the all-too-common focus in global health on disease containment rather than on health care, and both illustrate the ways the focus within global health has been on a solitary biomedical intervention rather than on discrimination, inequality, and poverty within and among countries.

BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						health systems evaluation; medical demography; public health; descriptive study		Objective The 2016 Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 projected a global shortage of 18 million health workers by 2030. This article provides an assessment of the health workforce stock in 2020 and presents a revised estimate of the projected shortage by 2030. Methods Latest data reported through WHO's National Health Workforce Accounts (NHWA) were extracted to assess health workforce stock for 2020. Using a stock and flow model, projections were computed for the year 2030. The global health workforce shortage estimation was revised. Results In 2020, the global workforce stock was 29.1 million nurses, 12.7 million medical doctors, 3.7 million pharmacists, 2.5 million dentists, 2.2 million midwives and 14.9 million additional occupations, tallying to 65.1 million health workers. It was not equitably distributed with a 6.5-fold difference in density between high-income and low-income countries. The projected health workforce size by 2030 is 84 million health workers. This represents an average growth of 29% from 2020 to 2030 which is faster than the population growth rate (9.7%). This reassessment presents a revised global health workforce shortage of 15 million health workers in 2020 decreasing to 10 million health workers by 2030 (a 33% decrease globally). WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean regions' shortages are projected to decrease by only 7% and 15%, respectively. Conclusions The latest NHWA data show progress in the increasing size of the health workforce globally as more jobs are and will continue to be created in the health economy. It however masks considerable inequities, particularly in WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean regions, and alarmingly among the 47 countries on the WHO Support and Safeguards List. Progress should be acknowledged with caution considering the immeasurable impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health workers globally.

Authorship representation in global emergency medicine: a bibliometric analysis from 2016 to 2020	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						other study design; health policies and all other topics	HEALTH RESEARCH; POLICIES; EQUITY; STATE	Introduction High-income country (HIC) authors are disproportionately represented in authorship bylines compared with those affiliated with low and middle-income countries (LMICs) in global health research. An assessment of authorship representation in the global emergency medicine (GEM) literature is lacking but may inform equitable academic collaborations in this relatively new field. Methods We conducted a bibliometric analysis of original research articles reporting studies conducted in LMICs from the annual GEM Literature Review from 2016 to 2020. Data extracted included study topic, journal, study country(s) and region, country income classification, author order, country(s) of authors' affiliations and funding sources. We compared the proportion of authors affiliated with each income bracket using X-2 analysis. We conducted logistic regression to identify factors associated with first or last authorship affiliated with the study country. Results There were 14 113 authors in 1751 articles. Nearly half (45.5%) of the articles reported work conducted in lower middle-income countries (MICs), 23.6% in upper MICs, 22.5% in low-income countries (LICs). Authors affiliated with HICs were most represented (40.7%); 26.4% were affiliated with lower MICs, 17.4% with upper MICs, 10.3% with LICs and 5.1% with mixed affiliations. Among single-country studies, those without any local authors (8.7%) were most common among those conducted in LICs (14.4%). Only 31.0% of first authors and 21.3% of last authors were affiliated with LIC study countries. Studies in upper MICs (adjusted OR (aOR) 3.6, 95% CI 2.46 to 5.26) and those funded by the study country (aOR 2.94, 95% CI 2.05 to 4.20) had greater odds of having a local first author. Conclusions There were significant disparities in authorship representation. Authors affiliated with HICs more commonly occupied the most prominent authorship positions. Recognising and addressing power imbalances in international, collaborative emergency medicine (EM) research is warranted. Innovative methods are needed to increase funding opportunities and other support for EM researchers in LMICs, particularly in LICs.

J	Zhao, HB; Yue, L; Jia, ZT; Su, LL				Zhao, Hongbo; Yue, Li; Jia, Zeting; Su, Lingling			Spatial Inequalities and Influencing Factors of Self-Rated Health and Perceived Environmental Hazards in a Metropolis: A Case Study of Zhengzhou City, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						spatial inequality; self-rated health; perceived environmental hazard; geographical context; Zhengzhou City	AIR-POLLUTION; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; INCOME INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; JUSTICE; RISK; DEPRIVATION; DISEASE; CANCER; PM2.5	Research on environmental pollution and public health has aroused increasing concern from international scholars; particularly, environmental hazards are among the important issues in China, focusing public attention on significant health risks. However, there are few studies concentrated on how perceived environmental hazards are characterized by spatial variation and on the impact of these risks on residents' health. Based on a large-scale survey of Zhengzhou City in 2020, we investigated how the self-rated health of residents and the environmental hazards perceived by them were spatially inequal at a fine (subdistrict) scale in Zhengzhou City, China, and examined the relationship among self-rated health, environmental hazards, and geographical context. The Getis-Ord Gi* method was applied to explore the spatially dependent contextual (neighborhood) effect on environmental health inequality, and the ordered multivariate logistic regression method was used to examine the correlative factors with environmental hazards, geographical context, and health inequality. The results reveal that self-rated health and environmental hazards were disproportionately distributed across the whole city and that these distributions showed certain spatial cluster characteristics. The hot spot clusters of self-rated health had favorable environmental quality where the hot spot clusters of environmental hazards were located and vice versa. In addition, health inequality was evident and was related to gender, income level, educational attainment, and housing area of residents, and the inequalities of environmental hazards existed with respect to income and housing area. Meanwhile, environmental risk inequalities associated with the social vulnerability of residents (the poor and those with low educational attainment) were obvious, with those residents experiencing a disproportionately high exposure to environmental hazards and reporting bad health conditions. The role of the geographical context (subdistrict location feature) also helps to explain the spatial distribution of health and environmental inequalities. Residents with better exposure to green coverage generally reported higher levels of self-rated health condition. In addition, the geographical location of the subdistrict also had a significant impact on the difference in residents' self-rated health status. The purpose of this study is to provide reference for policy makers to optimize the spatial pattern of urban public services and improve public health and environmental quality at a fine scale.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between SES and injury severity for acute hospitalizations in a nationwide population-based cohort. Methods: We conducted a registry-based cohort study of all individuals aged 25-64 years residing in Norway by 1st of January 2008. This cohort was followed from 2008 through 2014 using inpatient regis-trations for acute hospitalizations due to all-cause injuries. We derived two measures of severity: threat-to-life using the International Classification of Disease-based Injury Severity Score (ICISS), and threat of disability using long-term disability weights from the Injury-VIBES project. Robust Poisson regression models, with adjustment for age, sex, marital status, immigrant status, municipality population size and healthcare region of residence, were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) by SES measured as an index of education, income, and occupation. Results: We identified 177,663 individuals (7% of the population) hospitalized with at least one acute injury in the observation period. Two percent ( n = 4,186) had injuries categorized with high threat-to-life, while one quarter ( n = 43,530) had injuries with high threat of disability. The overall adjusted IRR of hospitalization among people with low compared to high SES was 1.57 (95% CI 1.55, 1.60). Comparing low to high SES, injuries with low threat-to-life were associated with an IRR of 1.56 (95% CI 1.54, 1.59), while injuries with high threat-to-life had an IRR of 2.25 (95% CI 2.03, 2.51). Comparing low to high SES, injuries with low, medium, and high threat of disability were associated with IRRs of respectively, 1.15 (95% CI 1.11, 1.19), 1.70 (95% CI 1.66, 1.73) and 1.99 (95% CI 1.92, 2.07). Discussion: We observed an inverse gradient between SES and injury morbidity, with the steepest gra-dient for the most severe injuries. This suggests a need for targeted preventive measures to reduce the magnitude and burden of severe injuries for patients with low socioeconomic status. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Intervention trials for adults with bipolar disorder in low-income and lower-middle-income countries: A systematic review	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Review						Bipolar disorder; Global mental health; Low-income countries; Lower-middle-income countries; Intervention trials; Low-resource setting	DOUBLE-BLIND; ACUTE MANIA; HERBAL MEDICINE; MENTAL-HEALTH; LITHIUM; PLACEBO; PSYCHOEDUCATION; HALOPERIDOL; RISPERIDONE; EFFICACY	Background: The treatment gap for bipolar disorder is aggravated by economic inequality. Around half of the world's population live in a low-or lower-middle-income country, where research on treatment is scarce. Hence, this review aims to determine the number and types of intervention studies conducted on adults with bipolar disorder in low-income and lower-middle-income countries and analyze the effect of these interventions on symptom severity, medical adherence, and quality of life. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in June and November 2021 using eight databases. Controlled intervention trials on adults with bipolar disorder on data from low-income and lower-middle-income countries at time of publication were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials or The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions assessment tool. Results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. These were divided into four subtypes based on the intervention; pharmacotherapy (=12), psychosocial (=7), electroconvulsive therapy (=1), and traditional medicine (=1). Three studies were from low-income countries. A high risk of bias characterized the studies; only four studies reported the procedures used for randomization. Most studies, however, identified a beneficial effect on symptom severity, and in addition, medical adherence could be improved with psychosocial interventions. Limitations: Heterogeneity across studies prevented any meaningful pooling of data to meta-analyses. Conclusion: Data for treatment interventions contextualized to the local setting for bipolar disorder remains sparse, particularly from low-resource settings. Further studies are urgently needed to target the treatment gap for bipolar disorder.	[Arnbjerg, C.

The path forward: Highlighting social justice pearls in public health campaigns and initiatives to deliver equitable healthy living medicine	PROGRESS IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES			English	Review						Socially just healthcare; Social determinants of health; Health equity; Public health; Health literacy; Healthy living medicine	BODY-MASS INDEX; HEAD-START; LITERACY	The prevalence of unhealthy living behaviors is largely driven by environments that support them and has become a key concern at global, national, and individual (patient) levels. Healthy Living Medicine offers a compelling path forward to move people towards healthy living behaviors and better health outcomes when complemented by socially just and equitable public campaigns and initiatives. Some of the concepts that are critical for these campaigns and initiatives that will be discussed in this manuscript include the social determinants of health, the communication loop, health literacy, and implicit bias and discrimination. Considering what is practical and achievable, examples of actionable, socially-just strategies will be described to inform and encourage health professionals and other stakeholders to prioritize healthy living and reverse the poor health trajectory among our most vulnerable populations.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Social justice equity in healthy living medicine- An international perspective	PROGRESS IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES			English	Review						Social justice; Population health; Healthy living; Lifestyle behaviours	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY RESEARCH; LIFE-STYLE PROGRAM; SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION; INCOME INEQUALITY; TOBACCO CONTROL; PUBLIC-HEALTH; DOUBLE BURDEN; NUTRITION; OBESITY; INTERVENTIONS	Irrespective of geographical location, disadvantaged people are disproportionately affected by unnecessary disease and suffering caused by inequalities in health. Although equal access to opportunities for healthy living medicine regardless of legal, political, economic, or other circumstances should be a basic human right, it is increasingly improbable for scores of people, particularly in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, to acquire this. In recent times, global initiatives have attempted to make 'healthy lifestyles' more equitable by pledging to be relevant to all economies, promoting prosperity, environmental protection, climate change interventions, and purposeful action to meet the needs of vulnerable populations, including women and children. Yet there remains much to be done to address and reduce the substantial international health equity gaps. Reducing disparities that disproportionately affect the lower end of social strata must entail collaborative and systemic action from important stakeholders across the whole system, an approach that translates theory and research into practice. Ideally, realist approaches that appreciate the importance of the context of problems and assume nothing works everywhere or for everyone, should be prioritised over linear/simple and non-scalable intervention strategies.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The burden of pancreatic cancer in Brazil and its states was analyzed and compared with that from the USA and China. Methods: This is a descriptive study of the incidence and mortality estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study, from 2000 to 2019. The Brazilian states presenting the highest and lowest socio-demographic index (SDI) were selected from each of the five regions. The SDI consists of the per capita income, education, and fertility rate of each population. Results: A significant increase was found in age-standardized incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer in all three countries, with differences in magnitude and annual increases. In Brazil, this incidence rose from 5.33 [95% Uncertainty Interval (UI): 5.06- 5.51] to 6.16 (95% UI: 5.68- 6.53) per 100,000 inhabitants. China and the Brazilian states with the lowest SDI, such as Para and Maranhao, showed lower incidence and mortality rates, although presenting the highest annual increases. No difference was found between the sexes. A higher mortality rate was observed for those individuals of 70+ years, which was three to four times higher than those aged 50 to 69 years. Conclusions: The increasing burden of pancreatic cancer in the studied countries, and the higher estimates for the elderly in a fast-aging country such as Brazil, indicates that more resources and health policies will be necessary. The greatest increase in the states with lower SDI reflects inequalities in the access to diagnosis and registries of this cancer.

Social, demographic, environmental, geographic, and historical influences affect hearing health, but these factors are often unmeasured within traditional biological, clinical, and epidemiological studies of hearing health. With increasing recognition of hearing health over the life course as a public health priority, there is also a growing understanding of existing hearing health inequities at the individual, community, national, and global levels. To make progress in addressing these inequities, public health disciplines, such as social epidemiology, can provide valuable frameworks. With a focus on integrating the biological and functional with social and structural factors influencing health, social epidemiology provides key concepts and approaches for filling existing research and practice gaps. In this review, we introduce the discipline of social epidemiology and its associated concepts to inspire greater cross-disciplinary collaboration for the ultimate goal of advancing hearing health equity.

Community-based participatory research (CBPR) as well as human-centered design are approaches that center partnership between community members and academic researchers. Together, academic-community research teams iteratively study community priorities, collaboratively develop ethical study designs, and co-create innovations that are accessible and meaningful to the community partners while advancing science. The foundation of the CBPR approach is reliant on its core principles of equity, coleaming, shared power in decision-making, reciprocity, and mutual benefit. While the CBPR approach has been used extensively in public health and other areas of healthcare research, the approach is relatively new to audiology, otolaryngology, and hearing health research. The purpose of the present article is to advance an understanding of the CBPR approach, along with principles from human-centered design, in the context of research aimed to advance equity and access in hearing healthcare. Design: The literature is reviewed to provide an introduction for auditory scientists to the CBPR approach and human-centered design, including discussion of the underlying principles of CBPR and where it fits along a community-engaged continuum, theoretical and evaluation frameworks, as well as applications within auditory research. Results: Recent applications of CBPR have been framed broadly within the theoretical positions of the socioecological model for a systems-level approach to community-engaged research and the Health Services Utilization model within health services and disparities research using CBPR. Utilizing human-centered design strategies can work in tandem with a CBPR approach to engage a wide range of people in the research process and move toward the development of innovative yet feasible solutions. Conclusions: Leveraging the principles of CBPR is an intricate and dynamic process, may not be a fit for some topics, some researchers' skillsets, and may be beyond some projects' resources. When implemented skillfully and authentically, CBPR can be of benefit by elevating and empowering community voices and cultural perspectives historically marginalized in society and underrepresented within research. With a focus on health equity, this review of CBPR in the study of hearing healthcare emphasizes how this approach to research can help to advance inclusion, diversity, and access to innovation.

This commentary analyses the complex nexus of multi-dimensional impacts of the pandemic on people, prosperity, planet, partnership and peace. From our analysis, we generate a causal loop diagram explaining these complex pathways and proposed policy recommendations. Main text: Health systems, health and wellbeing of people are directly affected by the pandemic, while impacts on prosperity, education, food security and environment are indirect consequences from pandemic containment, notably social measures, business and school closures and international travel restrictions. The magnitude of impacts is determined by the level of prior vulnerability and inequity in the society, and the effectiveness and timeliness of comprehensive pandemic responses. Conclusions: To exit the acute phase of the pandemic, equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines by all countries and continued high coverage of face masks and hand hygiene are critical entry points. During recovery, governments should strengthen preparedness based on the One Health approach, rebuild resilient health systems and an equitable society, ensure universal health coverage and social protection mechanisms for all. Governments should review progress and challenges from the pandemic and sustain a commitment to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

Background: Physical activity's significant role in overall health is known to be influenced by the surrounding environment, such as one's neighborhood, prompting this study of physical activity and its relationship with individual-level and neighborhood-level factors within the pandemic timeline. Methods: A statewide online survey assessed adults' self-reported weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) comparing a typical week immediately prior to the pandemic and during the pandemic (prewidespread vaccination) using negative binomial models. Results: Overall, MVPA decreased during the pandemic, though the decrease was driven largely by the reduction in MVPA outside one's neighborhood. In contrast, MVPA done within one's neighborhood increased over time. This change in MVPA done within one's neighborhood was not uniform across several characteristics including income level favoring those with the highest income (p < .05) and race/ethnicity favoring those self-reporting as non-Hispanic White (p < .05). While several factors, including higher Walk Scores, were associated with higher levels of MVPA without evidence of change over time, evidence of a differential effect over time was seen for other key indicators of social and structural determinants of health including income and race/ethnicity. Conclusions: This study can add to the existing literature surrounding not only COVID-19 but also neighborhood built environmental research seeking to identify factors associated with changes in MVPA, a known indicator of overall health and health-related outcomes.

Most research examining race and income inequities discount their interactions in shaping dietary intakes. An intersectional approach is needed to identify interconnected sources of social inequities and to more precisely locate dietary inequities. Objectives: We examined whether racial identity and perceived income adequacy independently and jointly shape dietary quality, defined using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2015, among a large sample of adults in Canada. Methods: Cross-sectional data from 2540 adults (>= 18 years of age) in Canada who participated in the 2019 International Food Policy Study were analyzed. Multivariable linear regression models were executed to test the independent associations and interactions between racial identity and perceived income adequacy with HEI-2015 scores. Models were constructed to examine HEI-2015 total and component scores, adjusting for age, gender, and education. Results: Perceived income adequacy, but not racial identity, was independently associated with HEI-2015 total scores. The interaction between racial identity and perceived income adequacy was significantly associated with HEI-2015 scores. Compared to the reference group (individuals identifying as White and reporting income adequacy), those identifying as Black and reporting income adequacy were associated with lower HEI-2015 scores (beta, -730; 95% CI, -13.07 to -1.54) and those identifying as Black and reporting income inadequacy were associated with lower HEI-2015 scores (beta, -6.37; 95% CI, -12.13 to -0.60). Individuals who identified as indigenous and reported neither income adequacy nor inadequacy had lower HEI-2015 scores (beta, -8.50; 95% CI, -13.82 to -3.18) compared to the reference group. Conclusions: Findings suggest that racial identity and perceived income adequacy jointly shape dietary quality. Inequities in dietary quality may be missed when intersecting racial identities and socioeconomic positions are not explicitly investigated. To support healthier dietary patterns, strategies must reduce socioeconomic barriers that impose dietary constraints on some racialized groups.

(2) Methods: Citation network analysis was employed to gauge the online visibility of governmental health institutions across regions. A bipartite exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) procedure was conducted to measure network dynamics. (3) Results: COVID-19 response agencies in Europe had the highest web impact, whereas health agencies in North America had the lowest. Various stakeholders, such as businesses, non-profit organizations, governments, and educational institutions played a key role in sharing the COVID-19 response by agencies' information given on their websites. Income inequality and GDP per capita were associated with the high online visibility of governmental health agencies. Other factors, such as population size, an aging population, death rate, and case percentage, did not contribute to the agencies' online visibility, suggesting that demographic characteristics and health status are not predictors of sharing government resources. (4) Conclusions: A combination of citation network analysis and ERGM helps reveal information flow dynamics and understand the socioeconomic consequences of sharing the government's COVID-19 information during the pandemic.

J	Chang, K; Lee, WL; Ying, YH				Chang, Koyin; Lee, Wen-Li; Ying, Yung-Hsiang			The Impact of Cost-Containment Schemes on Outpatient Services for Schoolchildren with Refractive Errors in Taiwan-A Population-Based Study	CHILDREN-BASEL			English	Article						myopia; global budgeting; health inequity; demand elasticity	QUALITY-OF-CARE; VISUAL IMPAIRMENT; HEALTH-INSURANCE; LOW-VISION; PREVALENCE; BLINDNESS; MYOPIA	Objectives: Extant research on cost-sharing finds no impact on health care utilization when the amount is insubstantial. This research investigates the effects on nonacute outpatient services for schoolchildren with refractive errors in Taiwan and discusses the potential harm caused by cost sharing and relevant cost containment policies. Methods: Longitudinal claims data from the National Health Insurance database are employed. District demographic information is also used for aggregate-level analyses. Interventional modeling is conducted on pooled individual-level data with a Poisson model and negative binomial models. Generalized least square modeling is performed on aggregate district-level data to elucidate the impacts of cost sharing and the reimbursement rate with controls for patient and institutional characteristics, district socioeconomic factors, and competitiveness among institutions. Results: The findings of this study show that cost sharing does not significantly affect children's utilization of outpatient services in the patient-level analyses. However, it significantly decreases the service volume based on the results of district aggregate analyses. There are potentially marginal patients in society, and they are more likely to be girls in poorer families, whose chances of seeking medical care significantly decrease when cost sharing increases. Conclusions: The gap in health inequity can be widened when stringent cost-containment policies are implemented. The offset effect caused by delayed care may also result in higher health care expenditures later. Cost sharing for children should be separately and prudently designed to better protect them from deprivations caused by changes in health policies.

In particular, there appears to be an association between unemployment and alcohol-attributable deaths. However, risk estimates presented in a previous review were based on only two studies. Thus, we estimated updated sex-stratified alcohol-attributable mortality risks for unemployed compared with employed individuals. A systematic literature search was conducted in August 2020 using the following databases: Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The relative risk (RR) of dying from an alcohol-attributable cause of death for unemployed compared with employed individuals was summarized using sex-stratified random-effects DerSimonian-Laird meta-analyses. A total of 10 studies were identified, comprising about 14.4 million women and 19.0 million men, among whom there were about 3147 and 17,815 alcohol-attributable deaths, respectively. The pooled RRs were 3.64 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.04-6.66) and 4.93 (95% CI 3.45-7.05) for women and men, respectively. The findings of our quantitative synthesis provide evidence that being unemployed is associated with an over three-fold higher risk of alcohol-attributable mortality compared with being employed. Consequently, a global public health strategy connecting brief interventions and specialized care with social services assisting those currently unemployed is needed.

This results in challenges to both synthesizing key knowledge domains of the field. This study aims to uncover the global research status and trends in EHI research, and to derive a conceptual framework for the underlying mechanisms of EHI. In total, 12,320 EHI publications were compiled from the Web of Science core collection from 1970 to 2020. Scientometric analysis was adopted to characterize the research activity, distribution, focus, and trends. Content analysis was conducted for the highlight work identified from network analysis. Keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis were applied to identify the knowledge domain and develop the EHI framework. The results show that there has been a steady increase in numbers of EHI publications, active journals, and involved disciplines, countries, and institutions since the 2000s, with marked differences between countries in the number of published articles and active institutions. In the recent decade, environment-related disciplines have gained importance in addition to social and health sciences. This study proposes a framework to conceptualize the multi-facetted issues in EHI research referring to existing key concepts.

We take stock of this literature, bringing together the various streams of research in which informal street vending is integral to how cities work, particularly in the context of what is considered as the global South. The review of the related literature in this paper is structured into eight key themes, including (1) gender, (2) typology/types, (3) spatiality of street vending and public space design, (4) health and well-being, (5) individual/collective agency, (6) policy environment, (7) use of technology, and (8) links to other forms of informality. The paper concludes by outlining certain research themes that are in the process of development, identifying some understudied areas, reflecting on existing gaps, and pointing to future research directions to enable further engagement with those aspects of informal street vending research that have remained underexplored.

J	Kato, KYM; Delgado, NG; Romano, JO				Martins Kato, Karina Yoshie; Delgado, Nelson Giordano; Romano, Jorge Osvaldo			Territorial Approach and Rural Development Challenges: Governance, State and Territorial Markets	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						territorial development; Brazil; public policies; sustainability		The way we produce food is at the heart of some of the current main global challenges. We are witnessing increasing social inequalities and the accentuation of hunger around the world, especially in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. At the same time, malnutrition and effects of climate change are endangering both the health of people and nature, putting life and the planet itself at risk. In general, specialists agree that the solutions to the current crisis involve the transformation of hegemonic food production chains (globalized and industrialized) and the strengthening of more territorialized food systems. The present paper reflects on how the territorial approach (extensively promoted by the State in Latin America countries in the 21st century) can be collaboratively used to create territorial food markets that are more autonomous, sustainable, and connected with nature and territorial resources. Our hypothesis is that territorial development reinforces more sustainable food systems that increase the resilience of territories facing the current challenges of rural development. The methodology involves a thematic and selective literature review, the analysis of secondary indicators, and conducting online interviews. Our analysis focused on Latin America, one of the most advanced areas in territorial development policies. We situated our research in the Borborema Territory (Paraiba, Brazil), which is a significant case study for understanding the dynamics of territorialization (and deterritorialization) of agroecological production systems that are geared towards family farming. It is also, in our opinion, a concrete case that suggests how territorialized and more localized food systems show greater resilience in the face of adversity, which can be observed in the territorial actors' ability to react to deterritorialization drivers that are emphasised in periods of crisis. Our main findings suggest that territorial development, by placing territory, resources, and territorial actors and institutions at the core of rural development strategies, reinforces territorialized food systems centred in small circuits of production-consumption. These alternative food systems not only contribute to social and environmental sustainability but enhance territorial development by expanding opportunities for territorial actors by diversifying the territorial economy and creating more crisis-resilient territories.

It still does. The complex interactions between living things and their environments mediate the character of both. Today, this is apparent in the global impacts humans have made on ecosystems, with resultant reciprocal impacts on human health. This paper is concerned with that reciprocity, which may be considered as a link between ecosystems and human populations. We will distinguish an ecosystem approach to human health-or ecohealth-from One Health and planetary health perspectives. We will also propose a conceptual framework that can be used to distinguish human settlements as Ecohealth Villages. Broadly defined, an Ecohealth Village is a settlement that recognizes the interactions between healthy ecosystems and the health of people who live, work, learn, and play in it. The key principles of an Ecohealth Villages are as follows: community ownership, ecological restoration, sustainability, social and gender equity, integrated perspectives, and traditional practices and knowledge. Together, they support a holistic, ecosystem approach to health in human settlements, as demonstrated in case studies from Mexico and Aotearoa New Zealand.

First, we now better understand that global health concerns cannot be tackled and solved individually and verify that the dream for universal health care is far from being fulfilled. Besides, biomedical technologies and medical devices, despite their transformative potential, cannot always reach those urgently needing them, due to centralized production, supply chain issues, intellectual property restrictions, and lack of raw materials and resources close to the point of care, which calls for a renovation of the biomedical industry aimed at sustainability and equity. To make matters worse, unethical behaviors of governments, companies, and citizens, from which the ongoing pandemic has provided plenty of examples, also endanger the already challenging progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including "Goal 3" on "Good Health and Well Being."

Arguments have been made to expand ACE scales to include indicators of racism and structural inequalities. In this paper, we use nationally representative data to examine the relationships between latent groups of an expanded adversity scale and a broad range of child health outcomes. Data were obtained from a merger of the 2017 and 2018 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) and analyzed in 2021 (n = 52,129). Adversities were defined as violent victimization, violence exposure, a range of parental problems, racial discrimination, food insecurity, and unkempt housing. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to uncover emergent groups of adversities, and logistic regression was used to assess group relationship to global and diagnosed measures of health. Four groups emerged: high all (3.6%), material and food hardship (11.9%), parental problems (10.3%), and low all (74.2%). Results showed the high all groups at greater odds of almost all outcomes. Compared to low all group, high all had particularly higher odds of any special (OR = 2.29) or complex (OR = 2.53) healthcare need, frequent severe headaches (OR = 2.07), and depression (OR = 3.4) or anxiety (OR = 2.11). Our analysis noted separation of experiences based on additional items related to structural inequalities: food insecurity, poverty, and unkempt housing. However, augmenting existing ACE scales with these indicators may be unnecessary as children most at-risk for poor health were a very small group (1 in 28) that experienced multiple forms of violence and parental problems.

Conditions associated with poor oral health involve all organ systems and many major disease categories including infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, cancer, and mental health. Outcomes are also associated with health equity. Medical education organizations including the Association of American Medical Colleges and National Academy of Medicine recommend that oral health be part of medical education. However, oral health is not traditionally included in many medical school, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner curricula. Several challenges explain this exclusion including lack of time, expertise, and prioritization; we therefore provide suggestions for integrating oral health education into the health professions school curriculum. These recommendations offer guidance for enhancing the oral health curriculum across institutions. We include key organizational and foundational steps, strategies to link oral health with existing content, and approaches to achieve curricular sustainability.

However, PCC evolved in a few high-income countries and there are limited data exploring this concept across the vast majority of countries which are low- and middle-income. This study aimed to appraise and adapt a PCC model across three serious physical conditions in three middle-income countries and generate an evidence-based framework and recommendations for globally relevant PCC. Methods Cross-national, cross-sectional qualitative study. In depth, semistructured interviews conducted with: advanced cancer patients in Jordan (n=50), their caregivers (n=20) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) (n=20); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in South Africa (n=22), their caregivers (n=19) and HCPs (n=22); heart failure patients in Thailand (n=14), their caregivers (n=10) and HCPs (n=12). Data were analysed using framework analysis. Santana et al's PCC model (2018) and Giusti et al's systematic review (2020) were used to construct an a priori coding frame for deductive analysis, with additional inductive coding for coding that did not fit the frame. Results The findings both reveal specific practical actions that contribute towards delivering PCC and highlight new cross-national domains of person-centredness: interdependency and collectivism; bringing care into the home and community; equity and non-discrimination; addressing health and illness within the context of limited resources; and workforce well-being. Conclusion The data suggest that PCC requires particular structural features of the healthcare system to be in place, such as professional education in PCC values and partnerships with community-based workers. These structures may better enable PCC processes, including tailored information sharing and providing genuine opportunities for patients to do the things that matter to them, such as making informed care decisions and sustaining social relationships. PCC must also accommodate a collectivist perspective and support the well-being of the workforce.

Nonadherence to ART is one of the HIV care problem in Liberia despite the availability of free ART. Psychosocial factors, i.e., perceived stigma and social support likely contributed to nonadherence to ART. We investigated associations among clinical factors, psychosocial factors, and nonadherence to ART. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 185 PLWH, age >= 18 years receiving ART in Ganta, Nimba county, Liberia at least 3 months. The structured questionnaire was used to collect data from April to May 2020. Associated factors of nonadherence to ART were identified using multivariable binary logistic regression, and the p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of 185 respondents, 62.2% showed nonadherence to ART. Females reported higher nonadherence compared with males (64.4% vs. 56.6%). Multivariable binary logistic regression revealed strong experiences of stigma (PORadj = 2.392, p-value = 0.018), poor information support (PORadj = 2.102, p-value = 0.026) increased prevalence of ART nonadherence among Liberian PLWH. Conclusions The healthcare providers may apply interventions to reduce perceived stigma and to enhance continuous information provision in addition to support from health care providers and family members. An intensive monitoring of ART side effects is needed to be strengthened in particular among newly started ART patients.

Neutrality, conflict, and structural determinants of health in a Jerusalem emergency department	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Conflict; Culture; Depoliticization; Emergency department; Healthcare professionals; Inequality; Israel; Palestine; Medical neutrality; Structural competency; Structural determinants	GLOBAL HEALTH; COMPETENCE; JEWISH; ARAB; DEPOLITICIZATION; ISRAEL; WOMEN	Background Medical neutrality is a normative arrangement that differentiates a zone of medical treatment disconnected from the field of politics. While medical neutrality aims to ensure impartial healthcare for all and to shield the healthcare personnel from political demands, it can also divert attention away from conflicts and their effects on health inequity. This article analyzes how healthcare professionals understand and negotiate the depoliticized space of the emergency department (ED) through their views on neutrality. It also examines how medical staff use depoliticized concepts of culture to account for differences in the health status of patients from disadvantaged groups. These questions are examined in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Methods Twenty-four in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare personnel in a Jerusalem hospital's ED. All but one of the participants were Jewish. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and Grounded Theory. Results The ED staff endorsed the perspective of medical neutrality as a nondiscriminatory approach to care. At the same time, some medical staff recognized the limits of medical neutrality in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and negotiated and challenged this concept. While participants identified unique health risks for Arab patients, they usually did not associate these risks with the effects of conflict and instead explained them in depoliticized terms of cultural and behavioral differences. Culture served as a non-controversial way of acknowledging and managing problems that have their roots in politics. Conclusions The normative demand for neutrality works to exclude discussion of the conflict from clinical spaces. The normative exclusion of politics is a vital but under-appreciated aspect of how political conflict operates as a structural determinant of health. Healthcare personnel, especially in the ED, should be trained in structural competency. This training may challenge the neglect of issues that need to be solved at the political level and enhance health equity, social justice, and solidarity.

Community Health Agents Advancing Women's Empowerment: A Qualitative Data Analysis	JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article						Women's empowerment; Community health agents; Qualitative; Community health; Global health	WORKERS; CARE	Community health agents (CHAs) play a critical role in primary healthcare delivery and health promotion in low-resource settings. Though there is substantial evidence of the benefits of CHAs in achieving targeted community health outcomes, there is limited research into the impact of empowerment experienced by CHAs themselves. This study examined how working as a CHA impacts the lives and self-perceptions of women in Peru volunteering with Catholic Medical Mission Board's (CMMB) markedly successful robust CHA model. We conducted six focus group discussions (FGDs) of 53 CHAs who implement CMMB programming in Trujillo and Huancayo, Peru. The FGDs were designed to explore themes related to empowerment, changes in women's lives, and perceptions of themselves. We identified four major themes related to women's empowerment: achievements, agency, meaningfulness, and resources. The most common empowerment theme was achievements, expressed through subthemes of changes in family behavior, self worth, education, health and nutrition, and rights and politics. The second most common empowerment theme was agency, with subthemes related to increases in using their voice, confidence, decision making, and participation. CHAs also reported experiencing empowerment through enhanced meaningfulness. CMMB's CHA model is an example of how well-structured community programs can facilitate women's empowerment. Providing meaningful community leadership opportunities can have far-reaching effects on women's perceptions of themselves as valuable, capable, and empowered leaders. This work deepens our understanding of how to practically improve community health through empowering women to catalyze gender equality in communities with disproportionate barriers and limited opportunities burdening them.

We aimed to examine the suicide trends over the last 20 years in 20 countries that still criminalize attempted suicide, and to compare the suicide rates of these 20 countries against the global average suicide rate and to a comparison sample of 20 countries that do not criminalize suicide, matched according to region and majority religion. Methods: Age-standardized suicide rates were extracted from the WHO Global Health Estimates, available for the period 2000-2019. Population data were extracted from the World Bank. We analyzed only countries which criminalize attempted suicide under its criminal justice system. Countries were further categorized according to their membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and countries in Africa. Countries from the same region and with the same majority religion were chosen as a matching group. Joinpoint analysis was used to compare the trends of the two groups with the global average. Results: Based on the 2019 WHO Global Health Estimates data, there is a large range in the suicide rates of the countries that criminalize attempted suicide, from 2.5 (Brunei) to 40.9 (Guyana) per 100,000 population. The mean suicide rate was 8.3 (Standard Deviation =10.6). Out of the 20 countries, seven have suicide rates higher than the global average, covering a total population of about 387.3 million. Of these seven countries, five are in the African region. The other thirteen countries have suicide rates between 2.5 to 8.2. Mean scores of the countries which criminalized attempted suicide was lower than the global average and 20 comparison countries over the 20 years, but average annual percentage in the decrease of suicide was greater for countries in which attempted suicide was not criminalized. Conclusions: Based on our review, there was no substantial evidence here to indicate that countries which criminalized attempted suicide had consistently lower suicide rates compared to the global average. There is a need to acknowledge that the currently available evidence is inadequate to definitively claim that criminalizing suicide is beneficial or harmful for the reduction of suicide rate for the entire populations. Future studies should continue to evaluate the unique effects of decriminalizing attempted suicide while controlling for other key associated factors.

Cost-effectiveness of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination in Low- and Middle-Income Countries	JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						COVID-19; COVAX; health equity; vaccination; low and middle-income countries; cost-effectiveness	UNITED-STATES; COVID-19; STRATEGIES; AFRICA; IMPACT	With circulating Omicron-like variants, increasing vaccination rates for COVID-19 to 30% or 45% of the population in each low- and middle-income country would have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $1040 and $3050, respectively, per year of life saved. Background Despite the advent of safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines, pervasive inequities in global vaccination persist. Methods We projected health benefits and donor costs of delivering vaccines for up to 60% of the population in 91 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We modeled a highly contagious (R-e at model start, 1.7), low-virulence (infection fatality ratio [IFR], 0.32%) "Omicron-like" variant and a similarly contagious "severe" variant (IFR, 0.59%) over 360 days, accounting for country-specific age structure and healthcare capacity. Costs included vaccination startup (US$630 million) and per-person procurement and delivery (US$12.46/person vaccinated). Results In the Omicron-like scenario, increasing current vaccination coverage to achieve at least 15% in each of the 91 LMICs would prevent 11 million new infections and 120 000 deaths, at a cost of US$0.95 billion, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$670/year of life saved (YLS). Increases in vaccination coverage to 60% would additionally prevent up to 68 million infections and 160 000 deaths, with ICERs <US$8000/YLS. ICERs were <US$4000/YLS under the more severe variant scenario and generally robust to assumptions about vaccine effectiveness, uptake, and costs. Conclusions Funding expanded COVID-19 vaccine delivery in LMICs would save hundreds of thousands of lives, be similarly or more cost-effective than other donor-funded global aid programs, and improve health equity.

Since 1947, India has in principle provided free medical maternal health care to all pregnant and childbearing women. Although rates of maternal and neonatal deaths have fallen since the 1990s, major inequalities remain. Some Indian States have very high rates of interventions, (e.g., cesarean section), while others have intervention and care rates that are too low. Disrespectful treatment of women in labor and lack of evidence-based practice have also been reported. The World Health Organization and others have strongly recommended that professional midwives (trained in a woman-centered philosophy and to international standards) have a key role for reducing mortality and morbidity, minimizing unnecessary interventions in pregnancy and labor, and improving maternal care quality in low- and medium-income countries. This paper provides a community case-report of the first professional midwifery programme in India designed to international standards, implemented in 2011 in Hyderabad. We describe the design and implementation in the programme's first eleven years, as a basis for further scale-up and testing in India, and in other low- or medium-income countries. The ultimate aim is to improve maternal care quality, choice and outcomes in India and in similar socio-economic and cultural settings.

Based on the WHO Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) and cross-country panel data, this paper investigates the effect of Internet access on health inequality across different income groups. The results indicate that access to the Internet significantly improves the average health condition and alleviates health inequality. In addition, employing cross-country data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, this paper further examines the social and economic determinants of access to healthcare. Specifically, it is found that Internet access significantly facilitates healthcare access and mitigates the negative impact of income inequality on healthcare access. Considered together, these findings shed light on the importance of the Internet in reducing health inequality and improving healthcare access.

(2) Methods: We utilized case reports from 12 male offenders selected from a federal jurisdiction in the central United States who were in the 99th percentile on a composite indicator of psychopathology to advance a qualitative study of the p Factor. (3) Results: Clients experienced frequent and often pathological traumatic experiences and exhibited exceedingly early onset of conduct problems usually during the preschool period. Their criminal careers were overwhelmingly versatile and contained numerous offense types, had extensive justice system contacts, and exhibited remarkable deficits in global functioning. Most clients spent the majority of their life in local, state, or federal confinement. Consistent with the theory, clients experienced a generalized psychopathology disposition that had undercurrents of externalizing, internalizing, psychotic, paraphilic, and homicidal features. (4) Conclusions: A qualitative understanding of the p Factor and its contribution to offending behaviors among correctional clients complements the statistical approach to developmental psychopathology.

J	van de Ruit, C; Breckenridge, A				van de Ruit, Catherine; Breckenridge, Alexandra			South African community health workers' pursuit of occupational security	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article						care work; community health worker; gender; global health; HIV; AIDS; South Africa	CARE; PROFESSIONS; GENDER; LABOR; HIERARCHIES; SOCIOLOGY; ECONOMY; LOVE; HIV	Community health workers (CHWs) are central to the global health response to crises like the AIDS epidemic. Yet community health work remains undervalued and undercompensated worldwide owing in large part to the gendered and racialized contexts of care work. This paper investigates the possibility of occupational security for CHWs by comparing two cases from South Africa's response to AIDS. The first draws on ethnographic research (2007-2009) in rural KwaZulu-Natal province and documents the fraught formation of a union representing CHWs. The second examines legal action in the Free State province for a group of CHWs known as the Bophelo House 94, who were arrested and criminally charged in June 2014 after protesting their sudden dismissal by the government. This case comparison finds that collective action has thus far had limited effects on CHWs' position as a nascent occupation. The South African Ministry of Health has obstructed CHW professionalization, and non-state actors' involvement has been a mixture of benefit and impediment: some social justice agencies have facilitated CHW advocacy, while many AIDS service organizations have cooperated with the state and exacerbated the precarity of CHWs' working conditions. However, the consolidation of CHW work roles-owing to advances in AIDS prevention and treatment-holds promise for future CHW collective organization.

China's population aged 60 or older exceeded 264 million. representing 25% of the global population in that age-group. Older adults in China experienced periods of dramatic political and social unrest in early life, as well as economic transformations leading to drastic improvements in living standards during adulthood and older age. However, the implications of life course socioeconomic status (SES) trajectories for healthy longevity in later life have not been systematically studied in China. We utilize data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) to comprehensively investigate how early-life conditions and adult SES combine to influence healthy longevity in later life. We find that both childhood and adulthood SES are associated with late-life health. The largest disparities in life expectancy (LE) and disability-free LE are found between those with persistently low SES throughout life and those with consistently high SES. At age 45, the gap in total LE between the most advantaged and least advantaged groups is six years for men and five years for women. Despite China's major policy changes prioritizing equity in income and health care in recent decades, our findings suggest that dramatic health inequalities among older adults remain. Our findings extend the literature on the effect of socioeconomic patterns across the life course on gradients in later-life health and highlight continuing disparities in healthy longevity among older adults in China.

Australia is a key stakeholder in the global clinical trials sphere and managed to maintain high clinical trial activity during the COVID pandemic. Despite these successes, there is paucity of understanding about what influences clinical trial participation in Australia. In the international context, systematic reviews have highlighted that sociodemographic barriers, access to health care, clinical trial inclusion criteria, and attitudes of physicians and patients are factors which influence oncology trial participation. Exploring the factors in Australian health services which influence trial participation is now of significant importance. The lack of clear evidence directly highlights a need to assess the factors that influence oncology trial participation in Australia. We call for review of existing data to identify future directions in Australia which will potentially give deeper insights for the international clinical trial community.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The RAIS Device for Global Surgery: Using a Participatory Design Approach to Navigate the Translational Pathway to Clinical Use	IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Surgery; Stakeholders; Medical services; Medical devices; Instruments; Prototypes; Performance evaluation; global health; medical device design; participatory design; frugal engineering; surgical technology	HEALTH; TECHNOLOGY	Background: Over 5 billion people worldwide have no access to surgery worldwide, typically in low-resource settings, despite it being a primary life-saving treatment. Gas Insufflation-Less Laparoscopic Surgery (GILLS) can address this inequity, by improving current GILLS instrumentation to modern surgical standards. Objective: to develop and translate a new Retractor for Abdominal Insufflation-less Surgery (RAIS) into clinical use and thus provide a context-appropriate system to advance GILLS surgery. Methods: A collaborative multidisciplinary team from the UK and India was formed, embedding local clinical stakeholders and an industry partner in defining user and contextual needs. System development was based on a phased roadmap for 'surgical device design in low resource settings' and embedded participatory and frugal design principles in an iterative process supported by traditional medical device design methodologies. Each phase of development was evaluated by the stakeholder team through interactive workshops using cadaveric surgical simulations. A Commercialisation phase undertook Design to Manufacture and regulatory approval activities. Clinical validation was then conducted with rural surgeons performing GILLS procedures using the RAIS system. Semi-structured questionnaires and interviews were used to evaluate device performance. Results: A set of user needs and contextual requirements were defined and formalised. System development occurred across five iterations. Stakeholder participation was instrumental in converging on a design which met user requirements. A commercial RAIS system was then produced by an industry partner under Indian regulatory approval. This was successfully used in clinical validation to conduct 12 surgical procedures at two locations in rural India. Surgical feedback showed that the RAIS system provided a valuable and usable surgical instrument which was appropriate for use in low-resource contexts. Conclusions: Using a context-specific development approach with close engagement of stakeholders was crucial to develop the RAIS system for low-resource regions. The outcome is translation from global health need into a fully realized commercial instrument which can be used by surgeons in low-resource regions across India.	[Webb, M. Marriott; Culmer, P.

J	Drydakis, N				Drydakis, Nick			The perceived social rejection of sexual minorities: Substance use and unprotected sexual intercourse	DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW			English	Article						cannabis; drinking; minority stress; sexual orientation; smoking	ALCOHOL-USE; PROTECTIVE FACTORS; TRANSGENDER YOUTH; ECONOMIC-CRISIS; USE DISORDERS; YOUNG-PEOPLE; BISEXUAL MEN; TOBACCO USE; GAY; HEALTH	Introduction This study presents associations between the perceived social rejection of sexual minorities and tobacco, alcohol and cannabis consumption and unprotected sexual intercourse in the capital of Greece, Athens. This is the first Greek study to evaluate the concept of the minority stress theory on sexual minorities' substance use and unprotected sexual intercourse. In addition, this is among the first international studies to examine whether periods of adverse economic conditions are associated with sexual minorities' substance use and unprotected sexual intercourse. Methods Two-panel datasets covering the periods 2013-2014 and 2018-2019 were used to determine the perceived social rejection, that is, whether sexual minorities have been rejected by friends, treated unfairly in educational and/or workplace environments, treated negatively in social situations and received poor health and public services due to their sexuality. Results The estimates indicate that perceived social rejection is associated with the increased consumption of tobacco (by 9.1%, P < 0.01), alcohol (by 7.1%, P < 0.01) and cannabis (by 12.5%, P < 0.01), as well as unprotected sexual intercourse (by 6.5%, P < 0.01). In the first three cases, the magnitude of the associations is stronger for men than women and there is increased cannabis consumption during periods of deteriorated economic conditions (by 5.5%, P < 0.01). Discussion and Conclusions In the European Union, reducing stigma, substance use, risky sexual behaviours and health inequalities for sexual minorities is a goal of public health. If minority stress is correlated with substance use and risky sexual behaviours leading to detrimental physical/mental health outcomes then prevention and support interventions should be designed.

J	Murray, KE; Musumeci, CJ; Cassidy, E				Murray, Kate E.; Musumeci, Chantelle J.; Cassidy, Elija			Crossing the digital divide: A content analysis of mainstream Australian mental health websites for languages other than English	HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY			English	Article						Australia; diversity issues; health inequalities; language; mental health; mental health services; translation	INTERNET	Growth in e-mental health services in the past decade has been significant, corresponding with rising rates of mental health concerns and amplified by social isolation strategies imposed by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Governments, mental health services and practitioners have identified this as a significant area for investment and highlight its capacity for widespread reach, prevention and early intervention. At a time of growth and investment, it is critical to evaluate the extent to which online mental health platforms are effective in reaching the diverse populations they aim to serve. The current study used content analysis to evaluate 33 Australian mental health websites receiving government funding for the availability of translated materials and resources for culturally and linguistically diverse people. The websites analysed covered a range of mental health topics and overall had limited translated materials available. Only four websites (12.12%) provided a translation tool and none of the interactive tools offered, such as web chat services, were available in languages other than English. From a total of 1100 subsections across all websites, eight subsections (0.73%) were specifically targeting populations identifying as culturally and linguistically diverse. Strategic reconsideration and investment are required to enhance the capacity of current mental health platforms to engage and support the mental health needs of the diverse communities they intend to serve. The research and its findings can provide a basis for research and reflection within other health and social services as online platforms proliferate.

We examined barriers to careseeking and health care utilization for obstetric and immediate neonatal care in Chiapas, a state with one of the largest indigenous populations and poorest health indicators in Mexico. We conducted 74 in-depth interviews with recently delivered women, their male partners, and traditional birth attendants, and 27 interviews with health facility and hospital staff in rural Chiapas. Interviews were conducted and recorded in Tzeltal and Ch'ol; data were transcribed, coded and analyzed in Spanish using thematic analysis techniques. Barriers to utilization of facility delivery that were reported in order of frequency were: (1) economic and geographic barriers; (2) traditions incompatible with facility policies; (3) fear or previous experience of mistreatment or abuse; (4) perceived poor quality care at facilities; (5) language and political barriers. Commonly reported barriers included distance, cost, lack of vehicles, and poor perceived quality of care, as well as linguistic barriers, lack of space, and fears of surgery or mistreatment. Some women reported obstetric violence and rights violations, including two cases of possible forced sterilizations, an unauthorized transfer of a newborn to another facility without consent or accompaniment of a guardian, and one failure to discharge a newborn because the family could not pay. Political conflict in the region contributed to additional barriers such as reduced trust in government facilities, and physical roadblocks during political activities. Improving geographic and economic access to obstetric and neonatal care can contribute to improved service utilization, but uptake of services can only be improved if quality of care, including communication and consent, are addressed. Historical and current relationships between various stakeholder and political groups should be considered when planning programs, which should be created as collaboratively as possible.

This leads to substantial pressure on health systems, a negative impact on economic development, and results in adverse physical and mental health outcomes. There are many economic reasons why reducing population obesity should be a priority, and global targets have been set with many governments pledging to reduce obesity levels by 2030. To achieve these targets, a 'system-wide' approach has been widely advocated in direct recognition of the wide-ranging complex interacting determinants of the disease. This system approach requires action at all levels, including at the local government level, to use all fiscal and non-fiscal levers to bring about local system change that promotes healthier population behaviours. Like many country contexts, in England, local resources for achieving this system change have been drastically reduced in recent years. Economic evaluation offers a formal explicit framework to support local decision making but, to date, there has been a disconnect between national guidance on cost-effectiveness and how that informs local action. A new Centre for Economics of Obesity has been purposively developed to work closely with local government to adapt methods to help achieve efficiency and equity gains. By working across six workstreams to begin with, this Centre will use economics to inform policy action on different but interrelated parts of the obesity system and act as a training hub for health economists working in obesity policy.

This model should support getting a comprehensive overview of factors representing country differences, understanding these differences and should support estimating cross-country transferability of policies and interventions in the context of Work Disability Prevention. Methods Based on NIT, a draft model was designed by means of (1) a literature review of empirical studies; (2) theoretical books and articles; (3) a focus group with six expert researchers. This draft model was (4) adapted in the context of academic education. Literature was searched on Web of Science and EBSCO host. Feedback on (use of) the model was received from the focus group, four different academic courses at 28 occasions and two international conferences. Results The cross-country comparison model for labor participation (CCC model for LP) of persons with chronic diseases is proposed consisting of five factors: (1) Legislation; (2) Norms & values in practice; (3) Culture; (4) Organization of WDP in practice; (5) Labor market characteristics. Within these factors and based on (in)direct empirical evidence, subfactors are distinguished. The feedback received led to renaming (sub) factors, improved visual representation and a tool for estimating transferability. Conclusions The CCC model for LP of persons with chronic diseases allows for a comprehensive understanding of country differences and cross-country transferability of policies and interventions. The CCC model can be used for other populations when population-specific subfactors are included.

J	Thornton, I; Wilson, P; Gandhi, G				Thornton, Ian; Wilson, Paul; Gandhi, Gian			"No Regrets" Purchasing in a pandemic: making the most of advance purchase agreements	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Pandemic preparedness and response; Public health emergency response; Health product purchasing; Vaccine equity; R&D incentives; COVID-19; Vaccine; Therapeutics; Diagnostics; PPE; Medical countermeasures	LESSONS	"No regrets" buying - using Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs) - has characterized the response to recent pandemics such as Avian flu, Zika Virus, and now COVID-19. APAs are used to reduce demand uncertainty for product developers and manufacturers; to hedge against R&D and manufacturing risks; and to secure availability of products in the face of spiking demand. Evidence on the use of APAs to buy vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and personal protective equipment during recent pandemics illustrates how these contracts can achieve their intended objectives for buyers. But, transferring risk from suppliers to buyers - as APAs do - can have consequences, including overbuying and overpaying. Furthermore, the widespread use of APAs by high-income countries has contributed to the striking inequities that have characterized the Swine flu and COVID-19 responses, delaying access to vaccines and other supplies for low- and middle-income countries (L&MICs). We identify seven ways to address some of the risks and disadvantages of APAs, including adoption of a global framework governing how countries enter into APAs and share any resulting supplies; voluntary pooling through joint or coordinated APAs; a concessional-capital-backed facility to allow international buyers and L&MICs to place options on products as an alternative to full purchase commitments; greater collection and sharing of market information to help buyers place smarter APAs; support for a resale market; building in mechanisms for donation from the outset; and transitioning away from APAs as markets mature. While a binding global framework could in theory prevent the competitive buying and hoarding that have characterized country/state responses to pandemics, it will be very challenging to put in place. The other solutions, while less sweeping, can nonetheless mitigate both the inequities associated with the current uncoordinated use of APAs and also some of the risks to individual buyers. Analysis of recent experiences can provide useful lessons on APAs for the next pandemic. It will be important to keep in mind, however, that these contractual instruments work by transferring risk to the buyer, and that buyers must therefore accept the consequences. In the spirit of "no regrets" purchasing, having bought what hindsight suggests was too much is generally preferable to having bought not enough.

Development of effective messages to promote maternal immunization in Kenya	VACCINE			English	Article						Maternal immunization; Maternal and child health; Message framing; Vaccine(s); Mixed methods research; vaccine confidence; vaccine acceptance; vaccine equity; mixed methods studies; health equity; global vaccine; vaccine policy; vaccine access; provider-patient communication; health communication; persuasion theory; antenatal immunization; vaccine trust; normative assessment; elaboration likelihood model; vaccine campaigns; global vaccine confidence; pertussis immunization; influenza immunization	INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION; DECISION-MAKING; WOMEN; COMMUNICATION; VACCINATION; STRATEGIES; TAGLINE	Objectives: This study evaluated messages and communication approaches for maternal immunization uptake in Kenya. We identified persuasive communication aspects that would inform maternal immunization attitudes, intent, and vaccine uptake. Methods: We conducted a two-phased mixed methods study with pregnant women and their male partners in three regions of Kenya. Discussions were conducted in English and Swahili languages by trained focus group moderators. Baseline measures included a survey and discussions about potential messages and accompanying visuals. Follow-up focus groups with the same participants included a survey about previously discussed messages, visuals, and communication impressions. The second round of focus groups focused on message preferences developed from the first round, along with rank order discussion for final message selection. Following transcription of focus group discussions, we conducted analyses using NVivo software. Quantitative data analyses included frequencies, factor analyses, reliability assessment, regression modeling, and comparative assessment of rank order. Results: The sample (N = 118) included pregnant women (n = 91) and their partners (n = 27) from diverse Kenyan regions (Bondo/Lwak/Siaya, Mombasa, and Nairobi). A four-factor solution resulted from factor analyses that included subscales "positive ad attitudes " (n = 5 items, alpha = 0.82), "negative ad attitudes " (n = 4 items, alpha = 0.75), "ad indifference " (n = 2 items, alpha = 0.52), and "ad motivation " (n = 4 items, alpha = 0.71). Overall, the positive ad attitudes factor (beta = 0.61, p = 0.03) was the only significant component in the overall model examining message selections (chi(2)((6)) = 262.87, p = 0.17). Among the tested concepts, we found that source and situational cues had a strong influence on women's attitude formation and intention to obtain recommended maternal vaccinations. With self-acknowledged variations in knowledge, participants were particularly attuned to images of relatable women, providers, and depictions in realistic or actual Kenyan clinical settings. Conclusions: The results indicated that positive attitudes were shaped by incorporating highly relatable factors in messages. Implications for subsequent campaigns and research directions are discussed. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Pandemic inequity in a megacity: a multilevel analysis of individual, community and healthcare vulnerability risks for COVID-19 mortality in Jakarta, Indonesia	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						COVID-19; epidemiology; health systems; public health	INFLUENZA; BRAZIL	Introduction Worldwide, the 33 recognised megacities comprise approximately 7% of the global population, yet account for 20% COVID-19 deaths. The specific inequities and other factors within megacities that affect vulnerability to COVID-19 mortality remain poorly defined. We assessed individual, community-level and healthcare factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality in a megacity of Jakarta, Indonesia, during two epidemic waves spanning 2 March 2020 to 31 August 2021. Methods This retrospective cohort included residents of Jakarta, Indonesia, with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We extracted demographic, clinical, outcome (recovered or died), vaccine coverage data and disease prevalence from Jakarta Health Office surveillance records, and collected subdistrict level sociodemographics data from various official sources. We used multilevel logistic regression to examine individual, community and subdistrict-level healthcare factors and their associations with COVID-19 mortality. Results Of 705 503 cases with a definitive outcome by 31 August 2021, 694 706 (98.5%) recovered and 10 797 (1.5%) died. The median age was 36 years (IQR 24-50), 13.2% (93 459) were <18 years and 51.6% were female. The subdistrict level accounted for 1.5% of variance in mortality (p<0.0001). Mortality ranged from 0.9 to 1.8% by subdistrict. Individual-level factors associated with death were older age, male sex, comorbidities and age <5 years during the first wave (adjusted OR (aOR)) 1.56, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.35; reference: age 20-29 years). Community-level factors associated with death were poverty (aOR for the poorer quarter 1.35, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.55; reference: wealthiest quarter) and high population density (aOR for the highest density 1.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.58; reference: the lowest). Healthcare factor associated with death was low vaccine coverage (aOR for the lowest coverage 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.38; reference: the highest). Conclusion In addition to individual risk factors, living in areas with high poverty and density, and low healthcare performance further increase the vulnerability of communities to COVID-19-associated death in urban low-resource settings.

Full net price transparency (NPT) is believed by many to promote price competition and to increase equity by making pharmaceutical products accessible to all. Using agent-based simulations, we find that a full NPT system implemented across EU countries would not be viable. This while, acting as rational economic agents, a group of middle-and lower-income countries would not be willing to give up their confidential agreements with the pharmaceutical industry. Even partial NPT would delay access predominantly in middle to lower-income countries. Hence, we conclude that implementing net price transparency across Europe would be challenging to reach from a political perspective. Especially in lower-income countries there would remain a plea to be left free to negotiate confidential discounts with drug manufacturers. This while, counterintuitively, in those countries NPT will be seen to be unjust while violating Ramsey pricing and distributive justice principles. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Poor housing, unstable work conditions, caste, class, race and gender based inequities and low incomes have a profound effect on mental health and wellbeing. Such disparities are increasing between, among and within countries and are exacerbated by human rights violations, in institution and in society, stigma and discrimination. Social capital can mediate health outcomes, through trust and reciprocity, political participation, and by mental health service systems, which can be coercive or more open to demand of emancipation and freedom. Societal inequalities affect especially vulnerable groups, and Covid itself had a wider impact on the most socially vulnerable and marginalized populations, suffering for structural discrimination and violence. There are complex relations among these social processes and domains, and mental health inequalities and disparity. Participation and engagement of citizens and community organizations is now required in order to achieve a radical transformation in mental health. A Local and Global Action Plan has been launched recently, by a coalition of organizations representing people with lived experience of mental health care; who use services; family members, mental health professionals, policy makers and researchers, such as the International Mental Health Collaborating Network, the World Federation for Mental Health, the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, the Global Alliance of Mental Illness Advocacy Networks (GAMIAN), The Mental Health Resource Hub in Chennai, India, The Movement for Global Mental Health (MGMH) and others. The Action Plan addresses the need for fundamental change by focusing on social determinants and achieving equity in mental health care. Equally the need for the politics of wellbeing has to be embedded in a system that places mental health within development and social justice paradigm, enhancing core human capabilities and contrasting discriminatory practices. These targets are for people and organizations to adopt locally within their communities and services, and also to indicate possible innovative solutions to Politics. This global endeavor may represent an alternative to the global mental discourse inspired by the traditional biomedical model.

Limited evidence exists on migrants with disability. A comprehensive as-sessment is mandatory required to organize specific services within the community and reception centers. The present study explores needs of refugees and asylum seeker within a community-based inclusive development framework. Metbods. To interview migrants, in this study we used the Community-Based Rehabili-tation Indicators (CBR-Is) developed by the World Health Organization. Results. The sample consisted of 41 people with disability and 59 without disability. Sample was homogeneous for gender and age. Our findings reveal how migrants with disability experienced poor outcomes in each domain of CBR-Is, namely health, educa-tion, livelihood, social end empowerment. Conclusion. Differences between migrants with and without disabilities have some dis-tinctive features. However, both groups are influenced by the social determinants of health: in addition to health issues, challenges in social life, livelihood and empowerment also clearly emerge. Different stakeholders are invited to promote inclusive communi-ties, facilitating access to social and health services.

Gaps still exist in our understanding of context-specific risk factors and interventions that can be implemented to prevent acute malnutrition. We used data from the four rounds of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (2000-2016) to identify risk factors that have contributed to the change in weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) among children under 5 years of age. We performed a pooled linear regression analysis followed by a decomposition analysis to identify relevant risk factors and their relative contribution to the change in WHZ. Modest improvements in WHZ were seen between 2000 and 2016. The sharpest decrease in mean WHZ occurred from birth to 6 months of age. Perceived low weight at birth and recent diarrhoea predicted a decline in WHZ among children aged 0-5, 6-23 and 23-59 months. Less than 50% of the change in WHZ was accounted for by the change in risk factors included in our regression decomposition analysis. This finding highlights data gaps to identify context-specific wasting risk factors. The decline in the prevalence of recent diarrhoea (15% of the improvement), decline in low birth size (7%-9%), and an increase in wealth (15%-30%) were the main risk factors that accounted for the explained change in WHZ. Our findings emphasize the importance of interventions to reduce low birthweight, diarrhoea and interventions that address income inequities to prevent acute malnutrition.

J	Valdes, D; Alqazlan, L; Procter, R; Dale, J				Valdes, Daniela; Alqazlan, Lama; Procter, Rob; Dale, Jeremy			Global evidence on the rapid adoption of telemedicine in primary care during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review protocol	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Global Health; Pandemic response; Patient experience; Patient-clinician trust; Primary care; Telemedicine		Background: Before the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, primary care in most countries relied on face-to-face consultations, with relatively limited use of telemedicine. Lockdowns and social distancing measures during the early stages of the pandemic led to rapid, widely spread telemedicine adoption in healthcare settings. The rapid uptake that occurred following the onset of these pandemic-induced measures in countries such as the UK, Canada and New Zealand prompts questions around the drivers, extent and sustainability of this transformation in clinical practice at the global level, as the research in this area is still emerging. The purpose of this scoping review is to explore the global evidence surrounding the rapid adoption of telemedicine in primary care settings during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic through three lenses: patient experience, health inequalities and patient-clinician trust, with the purpose of identifying elements contributing to the sustainability of this innovation. Methods: A draft protocol was tested through an initial search on Ovid Medline, Web of Science and Google Scholar with additional searches on the Cochrane Database. This informed the final selection of terms which will be used to search Ovid, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PROSPERO, Cochrane Library and others, filtering for studies from the pandemic declaration onwards. Additional grey literature reports will be sourced through simplified searches on Google in widely spoken languages. Duplicates will be removed by screening titles. Abstracts and grey literature text extracts will be screened based on pre-set eligibility criteria by two researchers. Abstracts (and extracts in the case of grey literature) will be mapped against the domains of the Non-adoption, Abandonment, and challenges to Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework by two researchers. Data will be presented in table format. Discussion: This review will map the current literature to identify current gaps in evidence related to the adoption of telemedicine after the declaration of the pandemic in March 2020. The use of simplified searches in the several spoken languages in the world is aimed at capturing more immediate non-academic reflections and experiences on this major service change at a global level.

J	Javanparast, S; Anaf, J; Tieman, J				Javanparast, Sara; Anaf, Julia; Tieman, Jennifer			Equity consideration in palliative care policies, programs, and evaluation: an analysis of selected federal and South Australian documents	BMC PALLIATIVE CARE			English	Article						Palliative care; Public health approach; Policy; Equity; Australia	OF-LIFE CARE; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; HEALTH	Background Inequity in access to palliative care and symptom relief is one of the greatest disparities in global health care. A public health approach to palliative care is underpinned by the social view of health that puts an emphasis on equity, community engagement and empowerment, a supportive policy environment, and social determinants of health. Consideration of equity in policy is critical so that it can be translated into equitable services. However, the extent to which Australian palliative care policies incorporate equity, and their translation into actual actions have not been extensively examined. This exploratory study aimed to examine the extent to which Australian federal and South Australian palliative care policies and initiatives incorporate equity, and to identify evidence gaps and research priorities that can inform equity-oriented policies and practices. Methods We reviewed 25 federal and South Australian documents relating to palliative care published over the past five years. Documents were publicly available from the Australian Government Department of Health website. We used search filter 'Palliative care and end of life' in the Department's resource webpage to narrow down documents to those with palliative care and end of life in the document title and/or content. The initial list was discussed in the research team to ensure key documents are included. Supplementary to document review, we conducted five key informant interviews in South Australia. Interview participants were people from the policy sector, not-for-profit organisations, a funding body and a community advocacy group in South Australia who had knowledge and experience in palliative care policy, practice and research. Documents and interview transcripts were imported into the NVivo 12 software for coding. Content analysis looked at the frequencies of relevant terms, and then more detailed inductive and deductive thematic analysis was undertaken which was guided by an equity action framework. Results Overall, we found incremental steps forward over the past few years in considering equity in Australian palliative care policies. Key themes that emerged from the study were: identifying population groups experiencing poor access to palliative care, strategies to improve access including increased awareness of palliative care, flexible models of care, building workforce capacity, and the need for greater investment in palliative care research and evaluation. Strategies to address systemic barriers as well as social, political and cultural determinants of inequity was less evident in policy documents. There was little evidence of actions to engage and empower communities. Interviews provided insight on key areas of priority for future palliative care research. Conclusions Achieving the goal of equity in palliative care for all is complex and multifaceted. It requires strong commitment and actions at policy and government level but also in clinical practice, workforce planning and capacity building, community engagement and research investment to implement and evaluate public health approaches to palliative care.

JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						ethics- research	INCIDENTAL FINDINGS; CHALLENGES; DUTIES; DUTY	The article argues the thesis that institutions have a prima facie obligation to fund the feedback of individual findings in genomic research conducted on the African continent by drawing arguments from an underexplored Afro-communitarian view of distributive justice and rights of researchers to be aided. Whilst some studies have explored how institutions have a duty to support return as a form of ancillary care or additional foreseeable service in research by mostly appealing to dominant principles and theories in the Global North, this mostly normative study explores this question by appealing to underexplored African philosophy. This is a new way of thinking about institutional responsibility to fund feedback and responds to the call to decolonise health research in Africa. Further studies are required to study how this prima facie obligation will interact with social contexts and an institution's extant relationships to find an actual duty. The research community should also work out procedures, policies and governance structures to facilitate feedback. In our opinion, though the impacts of feeding back can inform how institutions think about their actual duty, these do not obliterate the binding duty to fund feedback.

Most of the babies homozygous for the sickle haemoglobin gene are born in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, progress has been made with early diagnosis through newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis, pneumococcal immunisation, transcranial Doppler (TCD) screening, hydroxyurea therapy and chronic blood transfusions with remarkably improved survival and quality of life of children with SCD. However, wide disparities in outcomes exist between high-income countries (HICs) where over 90% survive to adulthood, and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where less than half achieve that milestone. Even in HICs, racial inequities pose barriers to accessing specialised care and receiving treatment for acute pain episodes. Better understanding of SCD pathophysiology is being exploited to develop new disease-modifying drugs and gene therapy approaches to further improve outcomes. Bone marrow transplantation is established as a curative treatment for SCD, but it is largely unavailable in LMICs. To bridge the disparity and inequity gaps, innovative approaches are needed in LMICs. Validated and more affordable, easy-to-use point-of-care tests offer opportunities to link early diagnosis with immunisation programmes and healthcare encounters. Widespread use of hydroxyurea therapy-a relatively affordable and effective disease-modifying drug-in LMICs would help improve survival and quality of life. Integration of SCD treatment into primary care linked to district level/provincial hospitals that are supported with evidence-based guidelines will help extend needed interventions to many more patients living in LMICs. Systematic review of the management of sickle cell disease in low and middle income countries.

Principles and methods of global legal epidemiology	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article						methods; epidemiology; international health; policy; research design	PUBLIC-HEALTH LAW; FRAMEWORK CONVENTION; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; TOBACCO CONTROL; POLICY; IMPACT; REGRESSION; STATE	Although the theory and methods of legal epidemiology-the scientific study and deployment of law as a factor in the cause, distribution, and prevention of disease and injury in a population-have been well developed in the context of domestic law, the challenges posed by shifting the frame of analysis to the global legal space have not yet been fully explored. While legal epidemiology rests on the foundational principles that law acts as an intervention, that law can be an object of scientific study and that law has impacts that should be evaluated, its application to the global level requires the recognition that international laws, policies and norms can cause effects independently from their legal implementation within countries. The global legal space blurs distinctions between 'hard' and 'soft' law, often operating through pathways of global agenda setting, legal language, political pressures, social mobilisation and trade pressures to have direct impacts on people, places and products. Despite these complexities, international law has been overwhelmingly studied as operating solely through national policy change, with only one global quasi-experimental evaluation of an international law's impact on health published to date. To promote greater adoption of global legal epidemiology, we expand on an existing typology of public health law studies with examples of policymaking, mapping, implementation, intervention and mechanism studies. Global legal epidemiology holds great promise as a way to produce rigorous and impactful research on the international laws, policies and norms that shape our collective health, equity and well-being.

Spatial Resolved Surface Ozone with Urban and Rural Differentiation during 1990-2019: A Space-Time Bayesian Neural Network Downscaler	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						CMIP6; surface ozone; space-time Bayesian neural network; downscaling; environmental justice	SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; MODEL; MORTALITY; RESOLUTION; CHEMISTRY; IMPACT; PM2.5; DIOXIDE; SITES	Long-term exposure to ambient ozone (O3) canlead to a series of chronic diseases and associated prematuredeaths, and thus population-level environmental health studieshanker after the high-resolution surface O3concentration database.In response to this demand, we innovatively construct a space-time Bayesian neural network parametric regressor to fuse TOARhistorical observations, CMIP6 multimodel simulation ensemble,population distributions, land cover properties, and emissioninventories altogether and downscale to 10 kmx10 km spatialresolution with high methodological reliability (R2= 0.89-0.97,RMSE = 1.97-3.42 ppbV), fair prediction accuracy (R2= 0.69-0.77, RMSE = 5.63-7.97 ppbV), and commendable spatiotempo-ral extrapolation capabilities (R2= 0.62-0.76, RMSE = 5.38-11.7 ppbV). Based on our predictions in 8-h maximum daily averagemetric, the rural-site surface O3are 15.1 +/- 7.4 ppbV higher than urban globally averaged across 30 historical years during 1990-2019,with developing countries being of the most evident differences. The globe-wide urban surface O3are climbing by 1.9 +/- 2.3 ppbV perdecade, except for the decreasing trends in eastern United States. On the other hand, the global rural surface O3tend to be relativelystable, except for the rising tendencies in China and India. Using CMIP6 model simulations directly without urban-ruraldifferentiation will lead to underestimations of population O3exposure by 2.0 +/- 0.8 ppbV averaged over each historical year. Ouroriginal Bayesian neural network framework contributes to the deep-learning-driven environmental studies methodologically byproviding a brand-new feasible way to realize data fusion and downscaling, which maintains high interpretability by conforming tothe principles of spatial statistics without compromising the prediction accuracy. Moreover, the 30-year highly spatial resolvedmonthly surface O3database with multiple metricsfills in the literature gap for long-term surface O3exposure tracing.

This rise has coincided with the emergence of comorbidities in childhood-such as type II diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, sleep apnoea and hypertension-formerly only described in adulthood. This phenomenon suggests global social and economic trends are impacting on health supportive environments. Obesity prevention is complex and necessitates both long-term and systems approaches. Such an approach considers the determinants of health and how they interrelate to one another. Investment in the early years (from conception to about 5 years of age) is a key life stage to prevent obesity and establish lifelong healthy habits relating to nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep. In Australia, obesity prevention efforts are spread across national and state/territory health departments. It is not known from the literature how, with limited national oversight, state and territory health departments approach obesity prevention in the early years. MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study including policy mapping and interviews with senior officials from each Australian state/territory health department. A series of questions were developed from the literature to guide the policy mapping, drawing on the World Health Organisation Ending Childhood Obesity Report, and adapted to the state/territory context. The policy mapping was iterative. Prior to the interviews initial policy mapping was undertaken. During the interviews, these policies were discussed, and participants were asked to supply any additional policies of relevance to obesity prevention. The semi-structured interviews explored the approaches to obesity prevention taken in each jurisdiction and the barriers and enablers faced for policy implementation. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data, using NVivo software. ResultsState and territory approaches to obesity prevention are eclectic and while there are numerous similarities between jurisdictions, no two states are the same. The diversity of approaches between jurisdictions is influenced by the policy culture and unique social, geographic, and funding contexts in each jurisdiction. No Australian state/territory had policies against all the guiding questions. However, there are opportunities for sharing and collaborating within and between Australian jurisdictions to establish what works, where, and for whom, across Australia's complex policy landscape. ConclusionsEven within a single country, obesity prevention policy needs to be adaptable to local contexts. Opportunities for jurisdictions within and between countries to share, learn, and adapt their experiences should be supported and sustained funding provided.

Beyond its medical toll, COVID-19 has also exacerbated pre-existing social issues and created new inequalities. This has generated a series of ethical problems that will need to be carefully analyzed to avoid repeating similar mistakes in the context of other crises. Among those, we discuss here the bioethical implications of preserving individual freedom in the context of the early response to a pandemic and propose a global approach to the issue that could be applied in future health challenges.

The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated that despite being at increased risk of severe disease compared with the general population, pregnant women were left behind in the development and implementation of vaccination, resulting in conflicting communications and changing guidance about vaccine receipt in pregnancy. Based on the COVID-19 experience, the COVAX Maternal Immunization Working Group have identified three key factors and five broad focus topics for consideration when proactively planning for a disease X pandemic, including 10 criteria for evaluating pandemic vaccines for potential use in pregnant women. Prior to any disease X pandemic, collaboration and coordination are needed to close the pregnancy data gap which is currently a barrier to gender equity in health innovation, which will aid in allowing timely access to life-saving interventions including vaccines for pregnant women and their infants.

Recognising the urgency of this imperative, a wide range of global stakeholders - governments, civil society, academia, agri-food industry, business leaders and donors - convened at the September 2021 UN Food Systems Summit to coordinate numerous statements, commitments and declarations for action to transform food systems. As the dust settles, how will they be pieced together, how will governments and food corporations be held to account and by whom? New data, analytical methods and global coalitions have created an opportunity and a need for those working in food systems monitoring to scale up and connect their efforts in order to inform and strengthen accountability actions for food systems. To this end, we present - and encourage stakeholders to join or support - an Accountability Pact to catalyse an evidence-informed transformation of current food systems to promote human and ecological health and wellbeing, social equity and economic prosperity.

Inequalities in the region lead to barriers to the best use of diagnostic tests during the pandemic. There is a need for simplified guidelines that consider the region's limited health resources, international guidelines, medical literature, and local expertise. Methods: Using a modified Delphi method, 9 experts from Latin American countries developed a simplified algorithm for COVID-19 diagnosis on the basis of their answers to 24 questions related to diagnostic settings, and discussion of the literature and their experiences. Results: The algorithm considers 3 timeframes ( 7 days, 8-13 days, and 14 days) and presents diagnostic options for each. SARS-CoV-2 real- time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the test of choice from day 1 to 14 after symptom onset or close contact, although antigen testing may be used in specific circumstances, from day 5 to 7. Antibody assays may be used for confirmation, usually after day 14; however, if clinical suspicion is very high, but other tests are negative, these assays may be used as an adjunct to decision-making from day 8 to 13.

J	Schulte, K				Schulte, Kayla			'Real-time' air quality channels: A technology review of emerging environmental alert systems	BIG DATA & SOCIETY			English	Review						Air pollution; environmental data; digital traces; knowledge production; platforms; digital inequality	POLLUTION EXPOSURE; DIGITAL DIVIDE; BIG DATA; HEALTH; PARTICIPATION; COMMUNICATION; INEQUALITIES; MOBILE	Poor air quality is a pressing global challenge contributing to adverse health impacts around the world. In the past decade, there has been a rapid proliferation of air quality information delivered via sensors, apps, websites or other media channels in near real-time and at increasingly localized geographic scales. This paper explores the growing emphasis on self-monitoring and digital platforms to supply informational interventions for reducing pollution exposures and improving health outcomes at the individual level. It presents a technological case study that characterizes emerging air quality information communication mechanisms, or 'AQ channels', while drawing upon examples throughout the literature. The questions are posed: which air quality channels are 'freely' available to individuals in London, UK, and when and where are they accessed? Digital trace data and metadata associated with 54 air quality channels are synthesized narratively and graphically. Results reveal air quality channels derive air pollution estimates using common data sources, display disparate messaging, adopt variable geographic scales for reporting 'readings' and maintain psychosocial barriers to access and adoption of exposure-reducing behaviours. The results also point to a clear association between the publication of a high-profile news article about air pollution and increased air quality channel access. These findings illuminate a need for greater transparency around how air quality channels generate personalized air pollution exposure estimates and tailor messaging. The paper concludes by calling for air quality channel developers to exercise co-creative methods that can support sustainable, democratic data and knowledge production around air quality, while critically approaching disproportionate patterns of both pollution and information exposure.

J	Anderson, K				Anderson, Kym			Agriculture in a more uncertain global trade environment	AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						market uncertainly; policy uncertainty; re-purposing agricultural policies; trade barriers; trade specialization	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; FOOD; ECONOMY; PRICE	The global trade environment is more uncertain now than it has been for decades. In the short term, bilateral trade "wars" and the COVID-19 pandemic have added to longer-term uncertainties such as sporadic national policy responses to climate change, to the digital revolution, to up-scaled assertiveness and economic coercion by rapidly growing China, and to antiglobalization groups. The underlying concerns could be reduced through greater multilateral cooperation, but that has been in short supply in recent years, not least because of eroding support for globalization. This article re-examines the case for greater unilateral openness to agricultural trade in the wake of uneven economic growth and structural transformation as food systems respond to this increased uncertainty and to growing pressures for agriculture to become more sustainable and for food to be safer and more nutritious. The article concludes by pointing to better policy options than trade measures for achieving most national objectives-options that can simultaneously benefit the rest of the world in terms of easing natural resource and environmental stresses while supporting economic growth and reducing national and global poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and inequalities in income, wealth, and health.

J	Chiang, MC				Chiang, Mengchun			Strengthening Intersecting Identities of Diverse AAPIs Through and Post COVID-19: Guidelines for Psychological Practitioners	ASIAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) well-being; COVID-19 pandemic; practice guidelines; AAPIs identity development	AMERICAN COLLEGE-STUDENTS; MULTIPLE MEDIATION MODEL; ETHNIC-IDENTITY; ASIAN-AMERICANS; MENTAL-HEALTH; PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION; PACIFIC ISLANDERS; STRESS; IMMIGRANT; DISTRESS	This article offers guidelines for psychological practitioners on ways to best support the well-being of Asian American/Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) through the COVID-19 global pandemic. The article argues that strengthening the connection with their intersecting identities is essential to the well-being of diverse AAPIs, especially given three interconnected and added strains: anti-Asian rhetoric and ensuing violence, invisible and intensified structural inequalities, and exacerbated mental health disparity. To facilitate AAPIs ongoing development and connection with their intersecting identities, three complementary theoretical approaches are introduced as the foundation of practice guidelines offered. The approaches include a culturally affirming developmental approach that fosters growth and resilience consistent with AAPIs identities; a multicultural feminist approach that promotes, empowers, and advocates for AAPIs by acknowledging structural power differentials within multiple interlocking systems of oppression; and a social justice-oriented psychoanalytic approach that recognizes structural impacts and offers attentive listening to the voices of AAPIs whose experiences are otherwise unheard. To support AAPIs through and beyond the pandemic, psychological practitioners must familiarize themselves with identity development theories relevant to AAPIs, participate in social advocacy by acknowledging and affirming differences within and external to AAPI communities, and expand on one's ability to listen for the diverse experiences that are unspoken, unheard, or uncomfortable to digest embedded in the oppressive structure.

J	Ramadan, M; Tappis, H; Brieger, W				Ramadan, Marwa; Tappis, Hannah; Brieger, William			Primary Healthcare Quality in Conflict and Fragility: a subnational analysis of disparities using Population Health surveys	CONFLICT AND HEALTH			English	Article						Healthcare quality; Conflict; Disparities; Proxy indicators; Primary healthcare; Central Africa; Western Africa; Sub-national	EFFECTIVE COVERAGE; ARMED CONFLICT; CHILD; PROGRESS	Background Recent global reports highlighted the importance of addressing the quality of care in all settings including fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS), as a central strategy for the attainment of sustainable development goals and universal health coverage. Increased mortality burden in FCS reflects the inability to provide routine services of good quality. There is also paucity of research documenting the impact of conflict on the quality of care within fragile states including disparities in service delivery. This study addresses this measurement gap by examining disparities in the quality of primary healthcare services in four conflict-affected fragile states using proxy indicators. Methods A secondary analysis of publicly available data sources was performed in four conflict-affected fragile states: Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, and Nigeria. Two main databases were utilized: the Demographic Health Survey and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program for information on components of care and conflict events, respectively. Three equity measures were computed for each country: absolute difference, concentration index, and coefficients of mixed-effects logistic regression. Each computed measure was then compared according to the intensity of organized violence events at the neighborhood level. Results Overall, the four studied countries had poor quality of PHC services, with considerable subnational variation in the quality index. Poor quality of PHC services was not only limited to neighborhoods where medium or high intensity conflict was recorded but was also likely to be observed in neighborhoods with no or low intensity conflict. Both economic and educational disparities were observed in individual quality components in both categories of conflict intensity. Conclusion Each of the four conflict-affected countries had an overall poor quality of PHC services with both economic and educational disparities in the individual components of the quality index, regardless of conflict intensity. Multi-sectoral efforts are needed to improve the quality of care and disparities in these settings, without a limited focus on sub-national areas where medium or high intensity conflict is recorded.

J	Poirier, B; Sethi, S; Haag, D; Hedges, J; Jamieson, L				Poirier, Brianna; Sethi, Sneha; Haag, Dandara; Hedges, Joanne; Jamieson, Lisa			The impact of neoliberal generative mechanisms on Indigenous health: a critical realist scoping review	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Review						Neoliberalism; Indigenous health; Health equity; Globalisation; Indigenous peoples; Critical realism	MAORI HEALTH; ORAL-HEALTH; PEOPLES; DETERMINANTS; INEQUALITIES; EXPERIENCE; CONTEXT; EQUITY; FOOD	The pervasive nature and colonial foundations of neoliberalism has significant ramifications for Indigenous health, globally. Not only does neoliberalism undermine Indigenous collectivist values by emphasising personal autonomy, but the exploitation of natural resources has unique implications for Indigenous wellbeing. Therefore, this scoping review aims to synthesise evidence that articulates the impacts of neoliberalism on global Indigenous health inequities. Two reviewers searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest Central to identify records eligible for inclusion. The search was not restricted by geographic location or language. Using principles of qualitative meta-aggregation, generative mechanism summaries and illustrations were extracted from each of the included articles, synthesised into broader categories, then considered in the context of neoliberal ideologies. The systematic search identified 9952 unique records, of which 38 fully satisfied the inclusion criteria. Findings represented 23 Indigenous communities across 12 countries and considered the impacts of neoliberalism across 16 health outcomes. Eighty-eight generative mechanisms of neoliberalism and 12 generative mechanisms of resistance were extracted from the included articles and mapped against four core principles of neoliberalism: competitive and private markets, reduced public expenditure on infrastructure, personal autonomy, and deregulation that facilitates economic activity. Overwhelmingly, neoliberalism has manifest impacts, through various pathways, on poor health outcomes and experiences for Indigenous communities included in this review. Importantly, Indigenous communities continue to resist the impacts of neoliberalism through advocacy, reclamation of traditional practices, and opposition to industrial development. Consideration and investigation of neoliberal structures and ideologies must become common practice in health equity scholarship. Actors within neoliberal societies must resist dominant epistemological, ontological, and praxiological stances that reinforce the supremacy of colonial values and subalternation of Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing to begin effectively addressing Indigenous health inequities.

Governments around the world implemented unprecedented policies designed to slow the spread of the disease and assistance to cope with its impacts. Such policies, however, are short-term and debates have ensued about what broader policies are needed in the post-COVID-19 era to ensure societies are better prepared for future pandemics. Public opinion concerning COVID-19 and the post-COVID-19 era is diverse, and the patterns in opinion are not well documented. Here we synthesized the opinions of 3731 research scholars throughout the world based on a survey. The highest consensus among respondents concerned the need for improving public health infrastructure and delivering economic support, whereas agreement concerning ecological aspects was low. The survey revealed three dimensions of thinking about COVID-19. The first dimension relates to public health and has widespread support. The second dimension relates to science-led policy development focusing on social justice and environmental governance, covering components of both ecology and economy. The third dimension covers the role of nature conservation in reducing the risk of pandemics. Although opinions differed with age, country of citizenship, and level of education, there is strong agreement on the need for global health equity and science-led public policy.

Yet, in many low-income and middle-income countries, coverage of PNC remains low. Risk-stratified approaches can maximise limited resources by targeting mother-baby dyads meeting the evidence-based risk criteria which predict poor postnatal outcomes. Objectives To review evidence-based risk criteria for identification of at-risk mother-baby dyads, drawn from a literature review, and to identify key considerations for their use in a risk-stratified PNC approach. Design/setting/participants A virtual, semi-structured group discussion was conducted with maternal and newborn health experts on Zoom. Participants were identified through purposive sampling based on content and context expertise. Results Seventeen experts, (5 men and 12 women), drawn from policymakers, implementing agencies and academia participated and surfaced several key themes. The identified risk factors are well-known, necessitating accelerated efforts to address underlying drivers of risk. Risk-stratified PNC approaches complement broader UHC efforts by providing an equity lens to identify the most vulnerable mother-baby dyads. However, these should be layered on efforts to strengthen PNC service provision for all mothers and newborns. Risk factors should comprise context-relevant, operationalisable, clinical and non-clinical factors. Even with rising coverage of facility delivery, targeted postnatal home visits still complement facility-based PNC. Conclusion Risk-stratified PNC efforts must be considered within broader health systems strengthening efforts. Implementation research at the country level is needed to understand feasibility and practicality of clinical and non-clinical risk factors and identify unintended consequences.

A process tracing study	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Performance-based financing; Burkina Faso; Equity; Ultra-poor; Process tracing	HEALTH-CARE; IMPLEMENTATION; DETERMINANTS; SERVICES; PROGRAM; PBF	In recent years, performance-based financing (PBF) has attracted attention as a means of reforming provider payment mechanisms in low-and middle-income countries. Particularly in combination with demand-side interventions, PBF has been assumed to benefit also the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. However, impact evaluations have often found this not to be the case. In Burkina Faso, PBF was coupled with specific equity measures to enhance healthcare utilization among the ultra-poor, but failed to produce the expected effects. Our study used the process tracing methodology to unravel the reasons for the lack of impact produced by the equity measures. We relied on published evidence, secondary data analysis, and findings from a qualitative study to support or invalidate the hypothesized causal mechanism, that is the reconstructed theory of change of the equity measures. Our findings show how various contextual, design, and implementation challenges hindered the causal mechanism from unfolding as planned. These included issues with the identification and exemption of the ultra-poor on the demand side, and with financial issues and considerations on the supply side. In broader terms, our findings underline the difficulty in improving access to care for the ultra-poor, given the multifaceted and complex nature of barriers to care the most vulnerable face. From a methodological point of view, our study demonstrates the value and applicability of process tracing in complementing other forms of evaluation for complex interventions in global health.

In the last decade, researchers have proposed a number of asset-based measures that permit global comparisons of household wealth across populations in different countries and over time. Each of these measures relies on different assumptions and indicators, and little is known about the relative performance of these measures in assessing disparities. In this study, we assess four comparative, asset-based measures of wealth-the Absolute Wealth Estimate (AWE), the International Wealth Index (IWI), the Comparative Wealth Index (CWI), and the "Standard of Living " portion of the Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (MPI), along with a variable measuring television ownership-and compare how well each predicts health related variables such as women's BMI, children's height-for-age Z scores, and infant mortality at the household and survey level. Analyzing data from over 300 Demographic and Health surveys in 84 countries (n = 2,304,928 households), we found that AWE, IWI, CWI, MPI are all highly correlated (r = 0.7 to 0.9). However, IWI which is based on a common set of universally weighted indicators, typically best accounts for variation in all three health measures. We discuss the implications of these findings for choosing and interpreting these measures of wealth for different purposes.

Yet, experimentation with initiatives to support public participation at a local level is threatened by enduring global economic instability. A better understanding of how different participatory approaches might address the social determinants of health would support future prioritisation of actions and investment.We reviewed recent literature and theories on initiatives to increase peoples' influence in local decision-making and on social determinants of health. Our synthesis found little detail about the form and function of initiatives, but diverse factors deemed influential in achieving outcomes. Studies highlighted that pressure on resources undermines individual and community capacities to participate, and requires organisational leaders to think/act differently.Suggested priorities for local governance are: supporting capabilities and relationships between organisations and communities; creating safe and equitable spaces for interaction and knowledge-sharing; and changing institutional culture.

This scholarship coupled with practitioners' collective experiences and insights have resulted in the emergence of certain narratives that describe how unequal gender relationships to water are manifested and how they can be addressed. In this paper, we critically examine four of these water and gender narratives, myths, or realities: Are women solely responsible for water collection? Are women excluded from the global water workforce? Is technology is sufficient enough to solve water-related gender inequalities? Does participation in design and implementation of water services address gender inequalities? By reviewing existing evidence underlying these water and gender narratives that are prominent in much academic research and international programming, we show the nuances of water and gender relationships, and the discrepancies upon which these narratives are grounded. We draw on examples and research largely focusing on the Global South, but highlight a need for similar examination of these narratives in the Global North. Finally, we discuss remaining knowledge gaps and argue that these normative understandings overlook limited and potentially contradicting evidence on the intricacies of the relationship between gender and water.

Thus, analysis of trends of socio-economic, demographic, cultural and geographical inequities is imperative to provide a holistic explanation for differences in availability, quality and utilization of antenatal care. We, therefore, investigated the trends in inequalities in four or more antenatal care visits in Ghana, from 1998 to 2014. Methods We used the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software to analyse data from the 1998 to 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys. We disaggregated four or more antenatal care visits by four equality stratifiers: economic status, level of education, place of residence, and sub-national region. We measured inequality through summary measures: Difference, Population Attributable Risk (PAR), Ratio, and Population Attributable Fraction (PAF). A 95% uncertainty interval (UI) was constructed for point estimates to measure statistical significance. Results The Difference measure of 21.7% (95% UI; 15.2-28.2) and the PAF measure of 12.4% (95% UI 9.6-15.2) indicated significant absolute and relative economic-related disparities in four or more antenatal care visits favouring women in the highest wealth quintile. In the 2014 survey, the Difference measure of 13.1% (95% UI 8.2-19.1) and PAF of 6.5% (95% UI 4.2-8.7) indicate wide disparities in four or more antenatal care visits across education subgroups disfavouring non-educated women. The Difference measure of 9.3% (95% UI 5.8-12.9) and PAF of 5.8% (95% UI 4.7-6.8) suggest considerable relative and absolute urban-rural disparities in four or more antenatal care visits disfavouring rural women. The Difference measure of 20.6% (95% UI 8.8-32.2) and PAF of 7.1% (95% UI 2.9-11.4) in the 2014 survey show significant absolute and relative regional inequality in four or more antenatal care visits, with significantly higher coverage among regions like Ashanti, compared to the Northern region. Conclusions We found a disproportionately lower uptake of four or more antenatal care visits among women who were poor, uneducated and living in rural areas and the Northern region. There is a need for policymakers to design interventions that will enable disadvantaged subpopulations to benefit from four or more antenatal care visits to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 that aims to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to less than 70/100, 000 live births by 2030. Further studies are essential to understand the underlying factors for the inequalities in antenatal care visits.

J	Smith, DA; Tadesse, HA; Lulu, K; Santillán, D				Smith, Dustin Andrew; Tadesse, Heran Abebe; Lulu, Kidest; Santillan, Diana			Understanding barriers to men's support for family planning in rural Ethiopia-findings from the USAID Transform: Primary Health Care Project Gender Analysis	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Article						Ethiopia; Amhara; Tigray; Oromia; SNNPR; Male engagement; Family planning; Antenatal care; Primary health care; Gender equality	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH	Background Evidence suggests that supportive male engagement in health care services, including family planning, remains low in many countries, despite known benefits for female partners. In 2017-2018, the United States Agency for International Development Transform: Primary Health Care Project conducted a participatory gender analysis, collecting relevant data to better understand Ethiopian men's lack of support for the uptake of family planning services. Methods Qualitative data were collected through 96 unique participatory group discussions with community members via a semistructured discussion guide and participatory activity; data were disaggregated by sex, age, and marital status. In-depth interviews (91) conducted with service providers, health system managers, and health extension workers used semistructured guides. Discussants and interviewees were selected purposefully, drawn from 16 rural woredas in four project regions: Amhara; Oromia; Tigray; and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region. Data collectors took notes and transcribed audio recordings. The research team deductively and inductively coded transcripts to develop preliminary findings later validated by key technical project staff and stakeholders. Results Findings reinforce existing knowledge on the dominant role of men in health care-related decision making in rural Ethiopia, although such decision making is not always unilateral in practice. Barriers at the societal level impede men's support for family planning; these include norms, values, and beliefs around childbearing; religious beliefs rooted in scriptural narratives; and perceived adverse health impacts of family planning. Lack of efforts to engage men in health care facilities, as well as the perception that health care facilities do not meet men's needs, highlight systems-level barriers to men's use of family planning services. Conclusions Findings indicate several opportunities for stakeholders to increase men's support for family planning in rural Ethiopia, including systems-wide approaches to shape decision making, social and behavior change communication efforts, and additional research and assessment of men's experiences in accessing health care services. Plain language summary Evidence suggests that in instances where men participate when their partners access health care services, their partners experience positive health benefits. Regardless, men tend not to participate. During 2017-2018, the United States Agency for International Development Transform: Primary Health Care Project conducted research to identify gender-related issues that hinder the delivery of primary health care services in Ethiopia. The research team conducted 96 group discussions with male and female community members, as well as 91 in-depth interviews with health care service providers, health system managers, and health extension workers. Participants were specifically selected from 16 rural districts, or woredas, in four regions where the project is active. The researchers then categorized information in the resulting transcripts by common themes, and the data analysis team met to draw out the main findings. Later, a meeting was held with key project staff and stakeholders in Addis Ababa to verify the findings. Findings reinforce existing knowledge on the dominant role of men in health care-related decision making for households in rural Ethiopia, although women often play an important role as well. The research also identified widespread male opposition to family planning due to norms, desires, and societal perceptions around childbearing; religious beliefs; and concerns about the perceived health risks of family planning methods. Further, findings showed that the promotion of family planning methods and services do not explicitly target men, and men believe that current services do not respond to their needs. Respondents suggested opportunities for stakeholders to mitigate these barriers.

The package aims to guide practitioners to promote local action and enhance skills for CE. Setting and participants The packages were co-created with diverse teams from WHO, Social Innovation in Health Initiative, UNICEF, community practitioners, and other partners providing synergistic contributions and bridging existing silos. Methods The design process of the package was anchored on CE principles. Literature search was performed using standardised search terms through global and regional databases. Interviews with CE practitioners were also conducted. Results A total of 356 cases were found to fit the inclusion criteria and proceeded to data extraction and thematic analysis. Themes were organised according to rationale, key points and insights, facilitators of CE and barriers to CE. Principles and standards of CE in various contexts served as a foundation for the CE learning package. The package comprises four modules organised by major themes such as mobilising communities, strengthening health systems, CE in health emergencies and CE as a driver for health equity. Conclusion After pilot implementation, tools and resources were made available for training and continuous collection of novel CE lessons and experiences from diverse socio-geographical contexts.

Design This was a retrospective analysis of the survey that captured data on people's awareness, attitudes and behaviours as they relate to the COVID-19 policies. Setting Data from the International COVID-19 Awareness and Responses Evaluation survey collected between March 2020 and February 2021 from 175 countries. Participants Convenience sample around the world. Main outcome measures We examined the role of sex and gender-related factors in relation to non-adherence of protective health behaviours including: (1) hand washing; (2) mask wearing; and (3) physical distancing. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the factors associated with non-adherence to behaviours. Results Among 48 668 respondents (mean age: 43 years; 71% female), 98.3% adopted hand washing, 68.5% mask wearing and 76.9% physical distancing. Compared with males, females were more likely to adopt hand washing (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.71 to 2.28) and maintain physical distancing (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.34). However, in multivariable sex-stratified models, females in countries with higher Gender Inequality Indexes (GII) were less likely to report hand washing (adjusted OR (aOR)=0.47, 95% CI: 0.21 to 1.05). Females who reported being employed (aOR=0.22, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.48) and in countries with low/medium GIIs (aOR=0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.51) were less likely to report mask wearing. Females who reported being employed were less likely to report physical distancing (aOR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.49). Conclusion While females showed greater adherence to COVID-19 protective health behaviours, gender-related factors, including employment status and high country-wide gender inequality, were independently associated with non-adherence. These findings may inform public health and vaccination policies in current as well as future pandemics.

Design A secondary data analyses of Demographic and Health Surveys. Setting Six South Asian countries, Afghanistan (2015), Bangladesh (2014), India (2015-2016), Maldives (2016-2017), Nepal (2016) and Pakistan (2017-2018). Participants Women aged 15-49 years. Primary and secondary outcome measures mDFPS was defined as married women aged 15-49 years or their partners, who desired no child, no additional children or to postpone the next pregnancy and who are currently using any modern contraceptive method. We estimated weighted and age-standardised estimates of mDFPS. We calculated the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) as the measures of socioeconomic inequalities. Results A total of 782 639 women were surveyed. The response rate was 84.0% and above. The prevalence of mDFPS was below 50% in Maldives (22.8%, 95% CI 20.7 to 25.0), Pakistan (42.0%, 95% CI 39.9 to 44.0) and Afghanistan (39.1%, 95% CI 36.9 to 41.3), whereas Bangladesh had achieved 76% (75.8%, 95% CI 74.2 to 77.3). Both wealth and educational inequalities varied in magnitude and direction between the countries. Except in Nepal and Bangladesh, mDFPS wealth inequalities showed a trend of increasing mDFPS as we moved towards richer, and richest wealth quintiles that is, pro-poor (RII (0.5 to 0.9); SII (-4.9 to -23.0)). In India and Nepal, higher versus no education was in favour of no education (higher mDFPS among not educated women) (RII 1.1 and 1.4; SII 4.1 and 15.3, respectively) and reverse in other countries ((RII (0.4 to 0.8); SII (-10.5 to -30.3)). Afghanistan, Maldives and Pakistan fared badly in both educational and wealth inequalities among the countries. Conclusions South Asia region still has a long way ahead towards achieving universal access to mDFPS. Diverse patterns of socioeconomic inequalities between the countries call for national governments and international development agencies to target the population subgroups for improving the mDFPS coverage.

J	Weedon, G; Patchin, PM				Weedon, Gavin; Patchin, Paige Marie			The Paleolithic imagination:Nature, science, and race in Anthropocene fitness cultures	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE			English	Article						Anthropocene; Fitness; Health; Paleolithic; Race	TOUGH MUDDER; BIOPOLITICS; CLIMATE; BODIES	The widespread uptake of the Anthropocene concept over the past two decades has seen a concomitant rise in cultural forms that trade on nostalgia for Paleolithic life. Mud running, CrossFit, and the Paleo diet exemplify this trend, with the Paleolithic hunter-gatherer at the center of their popular prescriptions for healthy living. In this article, we identify these practices as embodying the anxieties of the Anthropocene as well as its historical and racial elisions. By focusing on the oblique and subtle racializations of Anthropocene health and fitness cultures, we contribute to understandings of the cultural significance of the human body in the Anthropocene and the relationship between the biopolitics of health and geological life, arguing that the body is a key site through which the tensions and inequalities of the Anthropocene are played out. And by unraveling how the Paleolithic imagination is rooted in a distinctly capitalist, Euro-American attitude to the body in nature, we show the Anthropocene to be defined by uneven distributions of health as self-optimization, and health as environmental risk. The Paleolithic imagination demonstrates the tangled politics of race, science, and nature in the twenty-first century, in which global ecological instability, the biopolitics of health, the shadows of colonialism, and consumer capitalism converge.

This study aims to document the impact of diversified vaccination strategies as a preventative and control measure for the health and safety of the wider population within a country. Methods: We selected five countries that have experienced the changes in migrant inflows to the most extreme among OECD countries in 2020: The United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and South Korea. We conducted an extensive qualitative documentary analysis focused on policies and interventions implemented in these countries since January 2020 till the end of September 2021. We also analyzed publicly available epidemiological data (released by the governments and other international organizations). Results: We find that achieving migrants' health and vaccination equity is not without challenges, and a failure to address those multiplicity of concerns may result in a vicious cycle for the vulnerable population at the fringes of our economy. Migrants continue to face extenuating circumstances with higher risks to their health and safety, when they are excluded or disadvantaged in vaccination policies. The more inclusive and proactive the governments are in consideration of diversity of migrant populations, the better they can manage the pandemic, which leads to overall societal benefit of ensuring public health. Conclusions: Equity-based policies can mitigate disparities in access to vaccination and healthcare, thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

This study aims to investigate the interplay between social determinants of health (SDOH) and postoperative complication rates, length of stay, revision surgery, and rates of postoperative readmission at 30 and 90 days in individuals electing to have single-level ACDF. METHODS Using MARINER30, a database that contains claims information from all payers, patients were identified who underwent single-level ACDF between 2010 and 2019. Identification of patients experiencing disparities in 1 of 6 categories of SDOH was completed using ICD-9 and ICD-10 (International Classifications of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions) codes. The population was propensity matched into 2 cohorts based on comorbidity status: those with SDOH versus those without. RESULTS A total of 10,030 patients were analyzed; there were 5015 (50.0%) in each cohort. The rates of any postoperative complication (12.0% vs 4.6%, p < 0.001); pseudarthrosis (3.4% vs 2.6%, p = 0.017); instrumentation removal (1.8% vs 1.2%, p = 0.033); length of stay (2.54 +/- 5.9 days vs 2.08 +/- 5.07 days, p < 0.001 [mean t SD]); and revision surgery (9.7% vs 4.2%, p < 0.001) were higher in the SDOH group compared to patients without SDOH, respectively. Patients with any SDOH had higher odds of perioperative complications (OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.43-3.33), pseudarthrosis (OR 1.3, 95% C11.06-1.68), revision surgery (OR 2.4, 95% CI 2.04-2.85), and instrumentation removal (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.04-2.00). CONCLUSIONS In patients who underwent single-level ACDF, there is an association between SDOH and higher complication rates, longer stay, increased need for instrumentation removal, and likelihood of revision surgery.

We investigated the microbial composition in several gastrointestinal (GI) compartments to evaluate the impact of genetics, delivery mode, diet, household sharing and aging on microbial similarity in monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Methods Fecal, biopsy and saliva samples were obtained from total 108 twins. DNA and/or RNA was extracted and the region V1-V2 of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Bray-Curtis similarity was used for further microbiome comparisons, Mann-Whitney test was applied to evaluate the significant differences between groups and Spearman test was applied to reveal potential correlations between data. Findings The global bacterial profiles were grouped into two clusters separating the upper and lower GI. The upper GI microbiome composition was strictly dependent on the Helicobacter pylori status. With a positivity rate of 55%, H. pylori completely colonized the stomach and separated infected twins from non-infected twins irrespective of zygosity status. Lower GI microbiome similarity between the twins was defined mainly by household-sharing and aging; whereas delivery mode and host genetics had no influence. There was a progredient decrease in the bacterial similarity with aging. Shared vs. non-shared phylotypes analysis showed that in both siblings the shared phylotypes progressively diminished with aging, while the non-shared phylotypes increased. Interpretation Our findings strongly highlight the aging and shared household as they key determinants in gut microbial similarity and drift in twins irrespective of their zygotic state.

IPSAC-Vietnam is a small Non-Governmental Organization that has been engaged in a 12-year multi-pronged partnership with several children's hospitals in Vietnam VN to enhance pediatric surgery capacity. We describe the health care, medical training and emergency system in VN as the background for IPSAC activities and development of Pediatric Acute Surgical Support (PASS) course. The course goal is to prepare health care personnel in the immediate management of neonatal/pediatric life-threatening surgical conditions and road injuries at their first point of entry into Vietnam hospitals. PASS is a horizontal outreach initiative that adopts an interprofessional, multidisciplinary, team-training, train-the-trainers, and outcome-based training approach. PASS can be used as a tool for sustainable horizontal capacity-building by champion leaders at the teaching children's hospitals and medical universities in developing countries, to strengthen training for pediatric surgical emergencies, to integrate pediatric and pediatric surgical care and to advocate for a comprehensive approach to emergency care of the critically ill child.				dql.thanh@gmail.com			VEF-2016-2017-To conduct a teaching program in Vietnam Cures Within Reach-REGRoW (Repurposing Grant for the Rest of the World)-Improving outcome for rare liver disease Biliary Atresia with a cancer drug in Vietnam	VEF-2016-2017-To conduct a teaching program in Vietnam Cures Within Reach-REGRoW (Repurposing Grant for the Rest of the World)-Improving outcome for rare liver disease Biliary Atresia with a cancer drug in Vietnam	VEF-2016-2017-To conduct a teaching program in Vietnam Cures Within Reach-REGRoW (Repurposing Grant for the Rest of the World)-Improving outcome for rare liver disease Biliary Atresia with a cancer drug in Vietnam.		32	3	3	0	3	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	2296-875X			FRONT SURG	Front.

Defining Power and Agency in Gender Relations in El Salvador: Consequences for Intimate Partner Violence and Women's Mental Health	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						violence against women; intimate partner violence; mental health; agency; power; Global South	DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; CREDIT PROGRAMS; SEXUAL VIOLENCE; EMPOWERMENT; RISK; PREVALENCE; COMMUNITY; TRANSFERS; IDEOLOGY; ROLES	Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects thousands of women around the world and is prevalent in the Global South. Unequal social structures perpetuate hierarchies and maintain women's vulnerability to violence. Difficulties women face in accessing education, economic resources, and employment diminish their power in intimate relationships, increasing the likelihood of IPV. These factors can also have a significant effect on women's mental health. However, some studies show that economic empowerment does not necessarily translate into greater agency for women if they cannot use the resources they earn to pursue whatever goals or values they regard as important in life. Agency is women's ability to identify their life goals and act upon them through critical evaluation (intrinsic agency) and autonomous decision-making (instrumental agency). In this article, we aim to analyze the relationship between women's power (educational and economic) and agency and their influence on intimate partner violence and on women's mental health in the context of El Salvador. Currently, El Salvador has one of the highest percentages of femicide worldwide. We used data from the first national survey on violence against women in El Salvador to determine empowerment indicators and investigated their influence on intimate partner violence and women's mental health. Results from a representative sample of 1,274 women aged between 15 and 64 years old and, using a structural equation modeling revealed that education was a protective factor against IPV, but economic power appeared to put women at greater risk of IPV. Education was positively related to both intrinsic and instrumental agency, but only instrumental agency was negatively associated with the likelihood of being a victim of IPV. Finally, both intrinsic and instrumental agencies were positively related to women's mental health. We discuss the importance of identifying specific factors related to women's power and agency to prevent IPV and mental health problems and to promote more gender equity in the Global South.

The present study strived to analyze and rank the performance of the medical sciences universities in improving the public health and primary healthcare. Methods: Data on 41 indicators on the output (16 indicators), outcome (16 indicators), and impact (9 indicators) levels were extracted from various data sources. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to calculate the weight for each of the indicators. The score range for each level of performance is between 0 and 1. A score of 1 indicates the highest and a score of 0 indicates the lowest level of performance. Finally, the UMSs were ranked by their scores. Results: The national mean performance scores of the UMSs on the output, outcome, impact, and the composite indicator levels were 0.756, 0.641, 0.561, and 0.563, respectively. The results show that the changes in performance scores at different levels of the results chain are remarkable. Conclusion: The national mean performance of the UMSs of Iran is not satisfactory. However, there is considerable dispersion in their performance. Designing effective interventions in proportion to the conditions of universities on different levels of the results chain, developing a robust information system, conducting continuous monitoring and evaluation of public health are recommended for balanced improvements in public health and primary healthcare indicators in the country.

While STEGH have the potential to be beneficial, a large proportion of these do not sustainably benefit the communities they intend to serve, may undermine local health systems, operate without appropriate licenses, go beyond their intended purposes, and may cause harm to patients. With heightened calls to ???decolonize??? global health, and to achieve ethical, sustainable, and practical engagements, there is a need to establish strong guiding principles for global health engagements. The Advocacy for Global Health Partnerships (AGHP), a multi-sectoral coalition, was established to reflect on and address the concerns relating to STEGH. Towards this end, AGHP created the Brocher Declaration to lay out six main principles that should guide ethical and appropriate STEGH practices. A variety of organizations have accepted the Declaration and are using it to provide guidance for effective implementation of appropriate global health efforts. The Declaration joins broader efforts to promote equity in global health and a critical reevaluation of volunteer-centric, charity-based missions. The current state of the world???s health demands a new model of collaboration ??? one that sparks deep discussions of shared innovation and builds ethical partnerships to address pressing issues in global health.

These regions, characterized by violence, civil unrest, and war, are often governed by corrupt administrations who are unwilling to provide their citizens with basic human rights. Individuals living in FCAS face health inequities; however, women are disproportionally affected and face additional barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive services, including antenatal care (ANC). This systematic review aims to identify the factors that impact ANC usage in the 37 countries or regions classified as FCAS in 2020 by The World Bank. Methods Using the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of five databases (SCOPUS, Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL) was conducted. Results were limited to human studies, written in English, and published between January 2002 and January 2022. Studies that identified factors affecting utilization of ANC or maternal health services were included for review and critically appraised using the National Institute of Health's Quality Assessment Tools. Findings were summarized using a narrative synthesis approach. Results The database search yielded 26,527 studies. After title, abstract and full-text review, and exclusion of duplicate articles, 121 studies remained. Twenty-eight of the 37 FCAS were represented in the included studies. The studies highlighted that women in FCAS' are still not meeting the World Health Organization's 2002 recommendation of four ANC visits during pregnancy, a recommendation which has since been increased to eight visits. The most cited factors impacting ANC were socioeconomic status, education, and poor quality of ANC. Despite all studies being conducted in conflict-affected regions, only nine studies explicitly identified conflict as a direct barrier to accessing ANC. Conclusion This review demonstrated that there is a paucity in the literature examining the direct and indirect impacts of conflict on ANC utilization. Specifically, research should be conducted in the nine FCAS that are not currently represented in the literature. To mitigate the barriers that prevent utilization of maternal health services identified in this review, policy makers, women utilizing ANC, and global organizations should attempt to collaborate to enact policy change at the local level.

They can bring about inequity in living conditions of children and, as a result, lead to differences in various dimensions of development including the social, psychological, cognitive and emotional aspects. We aimed to identify and analyze the social determinants of Early Childhood Development (ECD) in Iran and provide policy implications to improve this social context. Methods In a qualitative study, data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 40 experts from October 2017 to June 2018. Based on Leichter's (1979) framework and using the deductive approach, two independent researchers conducted the data analysis. We used MAXQDA.11 software for data management. Results We identified challenges related to ECD context in the form of 8 themes and 22 subthemes in 4 analytical categories relevant to the social determinants of ECD including: Structural factors (economic factors: 6 subthemes, political factors: 2 subthemes), Socio-cultural factors (the socio-cultural setting of society: 6 subthemes, the socio-cultural setting of family: 4 subthemes), Environmental or International factors (the role of international organizations: 1 subtheme, political sanctions: 1 subtheme), and Situational factors (genetic factors: 1 subtheme, the phenomenon of air pollution: 1 subtheme). We could identify 24 policy recommendations to improve the existing ECD context from the interviews and literature. Conclusion With regard to the challenges related to the social determinants of ECD, such as increasing social harms, decreasing social capital, lack of public awareness, increasing socio-economic inequities, economic instability, which can lead to the abuse and neglect of children or unfair differences in their growth and development, the following policy-making options are proposed: focusing on equity from early years in policies and programs, creating integration between policies and programs from different sectors, prioritizing children in the welfare umbrella, empowering families, raising community awareness, and expanding services and support for families, specially the deprived families subject to special subsidies.

J	Allel, K; Hajizadeh, M; Kiadaliri, A				Allel, Kasim; Hajizadeh, Mohammad; Kiadaliri, Ali			The gap in life expectancy and lifespan inequality between Iran and neighbour countries: the contributions of avoidable causes of death	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Life expectancy; Lifespan inequality; Avoidable causes of death; Iran; Turkey; Qatar; Kuwait	GLOBAL BURDEN; NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; HEALTH-CARE; MORTALITY; INJURIES; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; PREVENTION; DALYS	Background Healthcare system and intersectoral public health policies play a crucial role in improving population health and reducing health inequalities. This study aimed to quantify their impact, operationalized as avoidable deaths, on the gap in life expectancy (LE) and lifespan inequality (LI) between Iran and three neighbour countries viz., Turkey, Qatar, and Kuwait in 2015-2016. Methods Annual data on population and causes of deaths by age and sex for Iran and three neighbour countries were obtained from the World Health Organization mortality database for the period 2015-2016. A recently developed list by the OECD/Eurostat was used to identify avoidable causes of death (with an upper age limit of 75). The cross-country gaps in LE and LI (measured by standard deviation) were decomposed by age and cause of death using a continuous-change model. Results Iranian males and females had the second lowest and lowest LE, respectively, compared with their counterparts in the neighbour countries. On the other hand, the highest LIs in both sexes (by 2.3 to 4.5 years in males and 1.1 to 3.3 years in females) were observed in Iran. Avoidable causes contributed substantially to the LE and LI gap in both sexes with injuries and maternal/infant mortality represented the greatest contributions to the disadvantages in Iranian males and females, respectively. Conclusions Higher mortality rates in young Iranians led to a double burden of inequality -shorter LE and greater uncertainty at timing of death. Strengthening intersectoral public health policies and healthcare quality targeted at averting premature deaths, especially from injuries among younger people, can mitigate this double burden.

In pediatric transplants, female adult living donors are more common, while male recipients are more common in low- and middle-income settings. Objective Paediatric living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has gained popularity due to limited deceased donor organ supply. Some studies report inequalities in donor and recipient gender profiles, but data are sparse. We evaluated LDLT donor-recipient gender profiles, comparing country income categories and gender disparity level. Design We performed a systematic review, searching PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases for publications dated January 2006-September 2021. We included full-text English articles reporting gender in >= 40 universally sampled donor-recipient pairs. Search terms were permutations of 'liver transplant', 'living donor' and 'paediatric'. Countries were grouped as high/middle/low-income economies based on World Bank criteria and into groups based on deviation from gender parity in Gender Development Index (GDI) values (group 1 indicating closest to gender parity, group 5 indicating furthest). Proportions analysis with corresponding 95% CI were used for analysis of dichotomous variables, with significance when 95% CI did not cross 0.5. Data are reported as female proportion (%) and 95% CI. Results Of 12 525 studies identified, 14 retrospective studies (12 countries; 6152 recipients and 6138 donors) fulfilled study inclusion criteria. Male recipient preponderance was seen in lower middle-income countries (all were also GDI group 5) (39.3 (95% CI 34.7 to 44.0)) and female recipient preponderance in GDI groups 1 and 3. Female donor preponderance was seen overall (57.4% (95% CI 55.1 to 59.6)), in middle income countries and in three of four GDI groups represented. Conclusion There are significant imbalances in recipient-donor gender profiles in paediatric LDLT that are not well explained. The reasons for overall female donor preponderance across income tiers must be scrutinised.

This global scoping review examined the impact of the pandemic on community-based asylum seekers and undocumented migrants in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of peer-reviewed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest Central. We applied Katikireddi's framework of understanding and addressing inequalities to examine the differential impact of the pandemic across exposure, vulnerability to infection, disease consequences, social consequences, effectiveness of control measures, and adverse consequences of control measures. Results: We included 32 articles in the review. The analysis showed that asylum seekers and undocumented migrants experienced greater exposure to the COVID-19 virus and higher infection rates. They also experienced differential social consequences in the form of job loss and lost and/or reduced work hours. The effectiveness of pandemic response measures on asylum seekers and undocumented migrants was also affected by pre-pandemic social and economic marginalisation, exclusion from pandemic-induced policy measures, lack of appropriate pandemic communication, and variable trust in governments and authority. Pandemic control measures had greater adverse consequences on asylum seekers and undocumented migrants than the general population, with the majority of studies included in this review reporting worsened mental health and social isolation conditions and reduced access to health care. Conclusions: Asylum seekers and undocumented migrants experienced a disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the six thematic areas of comparison. Policies that reduce exposure and vulnerability to the infection, grant equitable access to health and social care, and build capacities and resilience, are critical to enable asylum seekers and undocumented migrants to cope with and recover from pre-pandemic and pandemic-induced inequalities.

J	Huang, H				Huang, Hao			Food Environment Inequalities and Moderating Effects of Obesity on Their Relationships with COVID-19 in Chicago	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						COVID-19; food environment; obesity; urban health inequality	RACIAL DISPARITIES; ACCESS; PROXIMITY; NUTRITION; SUBSIDIES; DENSITY; ONLINE; RISK	The COVID-19 outbreak has raised challenges for people with health problems. Obesity is a global issue related to COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) finds that obesity worsens COVID-19 outcomes. As body mass index increases, the COVID-19 death risk increases. Additionally, due to different restriction policies, the pandemic has transformed our food environment. Thus, it is important to develop an antivirus-enabled paradigm to decrease the COVID-19 spreading rate in neighborhoods with obesity concerns and design a sustainable and healthy food environment. It is found that both COVID-19 and obesity inequalities are associated with food environment inequalities, but few studies have examined the moderating effects of obesity and food environment on COVID-19. According to the Chicago Department of Public Health, more than 30% of the Chicago adult population is obese. Additionally, Chicago has 340,676 COVID-19 cases during the period between 1 March 2020 and 26 November 2021. This study uses regression models to examine the moderating effects of obesity and food environment on COVID-19 in Chicago. Besides food environment factors, green spaces and transportation access are considered. The results show COVID-19 is concentrated in areas with a high obesity rate and low food access. A 1 percent increase in obesity rate is associated with a 2.83 percent increase in COVID-19 death rate in a community. Additionally, the moderating effects of obesity on the association between food environment and COVID-19 are shown in the results.

A.; McCartney, Gerry			Trends in healthy life expectancy in the age of austerity	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article						HEALTH EXPECTANCY; Health inequalities; POLICY; AGING	ENGLAND; UK	Background Worrying changes in life expectancy trends have been observed recently in the UK, largely attributed to austerity policies introduced over the last decade. To incorporate changes to quality, rather than just length of, life, our aim was to describe trends in healthy life expectancy (HLE) for the relevant period. Methods In the absence of available long-term trends, we calculated new estimates of HLE for Scotland for the period 1995-2019, using standard HLE methodologies based on mortality and national survey data, and stratified by sex and socioeconomic deprivation. Results Overall, male and female HLE increased markedly between 1995 and 2009, but then decreased by approximately 2 years between 2011 and 2019. A decline was observed for the most and least deprived groups, but this was larger for those living in the 20% most deprived areas, where the decrease was 3.5 years. Conclusions Our findings are further evidence of changing levels of pre-pandemic population health in the UK. An increasing body of UK and international evidence have attributed these changes to UK Government austerity policies. There is an urgent need, therefore, to reverse cuts to social security and protect the income and health of the poorest across all of the UK.

J	Noh, E; Khang, YH				Noh, Eunjeong; Khang, Young-Ho			Occupational inequalities in mortality in Korea: an analysis using nationally representative mortality follow-up data from the late 2000s and after	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND HEALTH			English	Article						Health inequalities; Mortality; Occupations; Republic of Korea; Socioeconomic factors	EDUCATION; HEALTH	Many Korean and international studies have found higher mortality rates and poorer health conditions among manual workers than among non-manual workers. However, a recent study using unlinked data argued that since the economic crisis in Korea in the late 2000s, the mortality estimates of male Korean non-manual workers have been higher than those of manual workers. Our work using individually linked data from the late 2000s and after aimed to examine mortality inequality by occupational class. We analyzed Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data that were individually linked to cause-ofdeath data. Cox regression analysis was used to identify the hazard ratios for mortality by occupational class. Of 11,766 males aged between 35 and 64, 397 died between 2007 and 2018: 142 died from cancer, 68 from cardiovascular disease, 88 from external causes, and 99 from other causes. After controlling for age, the mortality estimates for manual workers were 1.85 times higher than those for upper non-manual workers (p < 0.05). We observed no evidence of reversed mortality inequality among occupational classes in Korea since the 2000s; this previously reported finding might have been due to numerator-denominator bias arising from the use of unlinked data.

Examining power dynamics in global health governance using topic modeling and network analysis of Twitter data	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						Health policy; international health services; public health; information technology; rationing		Objectives Despite increases in global health actors and funding levels, health inequities persist. We empirically tested whether global health governance (GHG) operates under the rational actor model (RAM) and characterised GHG power dynamics. Design We collected approximately 75 000 tweets of 20 key global health actors, between 2016 and 2020, using Twitter API. We generated priorities from tweets collected using topic modelling. Priorities from tweets were compared with stated priorities from content analyses of policy documents and with revealed priorities from network analyses of development assistance for health funding data. Comparing priorities derived from Twitter, policy documents and funding data, we can test whether GHG operates under RAM and characterise power dynamics in GHG. Participants 20 global health actors were identified based on a consensus of three peer-reviewed articles mapping global health networks. All tweets of each actor were collected in 3-month intervals from November 2016 to May 2020. Policy documents and developmental assistance for health (DAH) financial data for each actor were collected for the same period. Results We find all 20 actors and the global health system collectively fulfil the three conditions of RAM based on stated and revealed priorities. We also find compulsory and institutional power asymmetries in GHG. Funding organisations have compulsory power over channels of DAH and implementing institutions they directly fund. Funding organisations also have transitive influence over implementing institutions receiving DAH funding. Conclusions We find that there is a correlation between the priorities of large funders and the priorities of health actors. This correlation in conjunction with GHG operating under the RAM and the asymmetric power held by funders raises issues. GHG under the RAM grants large funders majority of the power to determine global health priorities and ultimately influencing outcomes while implementing organisations, especially those that work closest with populations, have little to limited influence in priority-setting.

To promote health equity for slum dwellers, requires an understanding of how their lived realities shape inequities especially for young children 0-4 years old (ie, under-fives) who tend to have a higher mortality compared with non-slum children. In these proposed studies, we aim to examine how key Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) factors at child and household levels combine to affect under-five health conditions, who live in slums in Bangladesh and Kenya through an intersectionality lens. Methods and analysis The protocol describes how we will analyse data from the Nairobi Cross-sectional Slum Survey (NCSS 2012) for Kenya and the Urban Health Survey (UHS 2013) for Bangladesh to explore how SDoH influence under-five health outcomes in slums within an intersectionality framework. The NCSS 2012 and UHS 2013 samples will consist of 2199 and 3173 under-fives, respectively. We will apply Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy approach. Some of SDoH characteristics to be considered will include those of children, head of household, mothers and social structure characteristics of household.

A prospective longitudinal qualitative study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						mental health; international health services; organisational development		Objectives Global health research collaborations between partners in high-income countries and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) aim to generate new evidence, strengthen research capacity, tackle health inequalities and improve outcomes. Previous evaluations of such programmes have identified areas for improvement but consisted only of retrospective experiences. We conducted the first prospective study to assess the initial expectations as well as the final experiences of participants of a global health research programme. Design, settings and participants This study adopted a prospective longitudinal qualitative study, 38 participants of a global mental health research programme with partners in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Uganda and the (UK). The interviewees included senior investigators, coordinators and researchers. Framework analysis was used to analyse the data. Outcome measures Participants were interviewed about their initial expectations at the inception of the research programme and their final experiences at the end. Results Many of the original expectations were later reported as met or even exceeded. They included experiences of communication, relationships, developed research expertise, further research opportunities and extending networks. However, other expectations were not met or only partially met, mainly on developing local leadership, strengthening institutional research capacity and opportunities for innovation and for mutual learning. Around equity of partnership and ownership of research the views of participants in the UK tended to be more critical than those of partners in LMICs. Conclusions The findings suggest that global health research programmes can achieve several of their aims, and that partners in LMICs feel equity has been established in the partnership despite the imbalance of the funding arrangement. Aims of global health research projects should have a realistic focus and be proportionate to the parameters of the funding arrangement. More resources and longer time scales may be required to address sustainable structural capacity and long-standing local leadership sufficiently.

Income inequality and the disease burden of COVID-19: Survival analysis of data from 74 countries	PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REPORTS			English	Article						Income inequality; Disease burden of COVID-19; Gini index; Country performance in pandemic response	HEALTH; MORTALITY; STATES	The COVID-19 pandemic presents a rare opportunity to assess national performance in responding to a historic crisis. It is not well understood how income inequality might be related to differential disease burden of COVID19 across countries. Using recent data merged from Our World in Data 2020, the World Bank, and the Global Burden of Disease, we examined the association between income inequality (the Gini index) and COVID-19 infection and death rates among 74 countries with available data. After adjusting for differences in population size, age structure, longevity, population density, GDP per capita, health care expenditures, educational attainment, direct democracy index, stringency of implemented measures, and testing intensity for COVID-19, results from Cox Proportional Hazards regressions revealed that countries with more unequal income distribution carried a higher burden of COVID-19 infections and deaths in 2020. On average, each percentage point increase in the Gini index was associated with an 9% increase in the hazard of having a higher COVID-19 infection rate in the sample (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.01, 1.18). The corresponding associated increase in the hazard of having a higher COVID-19 death rate was 14% (AOR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.06, 1.23). Countries with severe and persistent income inequality should develop national strategies to address this challenge to be better prepared for future pandemics.

These beliefs may play a central role in decision-making, and understanding them is crucial to improving screening rates and services. This review scopes international literature for gender-based qualitative factors influencing women's screening uptake. A systematic search of peer-reviewed English articles in PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL was conducted from inception until December 2019. Articles were included if they were about breast or cervical cancer screening, had mixed or qualitative methodology, and sampled women from the general population. 72 studies spanning 34 countries were analysed. Eight studies also included healthcare providers' views. Our narrative thematic analysis summarised primary themes extracted from each study into first-level subthemes, then synthesising second-level and third-level themes: (I) gender socialisation of women, (II) gender inequality in society, and (III) lack of empowerment to women in making screening decisions. Women tended to face sociocultural/role-based constraints, were expected to prioritise family, and keep bodily exposure to their husbands. Women showed low awareness and had fewer opportunities for health education compared to men. Male relations were often gatekeepers to financial resources needed to pay for screening tests. Screening risked community norms about women's or husbands' perceived embarrassing sexual behaviours. These findings suggest that interventions targeting unhelpful stigmatising beliefs about women's cancer screening must concurrently address community general norms, familial role-based beliefs, as well as at male relations who hold the purse-strings.

The Equity Tool for Valuing Global Health Partnerships	GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article							COLLABORATION; PERSPECTIVES; LESSONS; AFRICAN	Global health partnerships (GHPs) involve complex relationships between individuals and organizations, often joining partners from high-income and low- or middle-income countries around work that is carried out in the latter. Therefore, GHPs are situated in the context of global inequities and their underlying sociopolitical and historical causes, such as colonization. Equity is a core principle that should guide GHPs from start to end. How equity is embedded and nurtured throughout a partnership has remained a constant challenge. We have developed a user-friendly tool for valuing a GHP throughout its lifespan using an equity lens. The development of the EQT was informed by 5 distinct elements: a scoping review of scientific published peer-reviewed literature; an online survey and follow-up telephone interviews; workshops in Canada, Burkina Faso, and Vietnam; a critical interpretive synthesis; and a content validation exercise. Findings suggest GHPs generate experiences of equity or inequity yet provide little guidance on how to identify and respond to these experiences. The EQT can guide people involved in partnering to consider the equity implications of all their actions, from inception, through implementation and completion of a partnership. When used to guide reflective dialogue with a clear intention to advance equity in and through partnering, this tool offers a new approach to valuing global health partnerships. Global health practitioners, among others, can apply the EQT in their partnerships to learning together about how to cultivate equity in their unique contexts within what is becoming an increasingly diverse, vibrant, and responsive global health community.

Integration of planetary health in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education: protocol for a scoping review	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						Medical education; Planetary health; Planetary health education; Climate crisis		Introduction Despite climate change being recognised as the greatest health threat of the 21st century, current medical education curricula do not reflect the urgency of the climate crisis. Preparing for climate-related health repercussions requires educational institutions to disseminate planetary health knowledge in a systematic way. We sought to evaluate the extent of the literature on the inclusion of planetary health in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education to guide curricular development. Methods and analysis A scoping review is being undertaken with a search strategy developed with a health sciences librarian. The search strategy was run on the following databases from inception to 22 June 2021: Medline, Embase, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Health, Scopus. This scoping review is being conducted as per methodology that has been previously outlined. Studies that discuss the implementation of planetary health education within undergraduate and postgraduate medical education will be included, whether they discuss formal inclusion or supplemental courses. To supplement our database search, data from the Health and Environment Adaptive Task Force's National Report on Planetary Health Education, the Planetary Health Report Card and the Association for Medical Education in Europe Consensus Statement on Planetary Health and Education for Sustainable Healthcare will be included. As we anticipate varying methodologies, the data analysis will consist of both a quantitative and a qualitative component. Outcomes will be categorised within the domains of the Planetary Health Education Framework, which incorporates concepts of systems thinking, social justice and interconnection within nature as they apply to education for planetary health. Ethics and dissemination As no intervention or patient recruitment will be required, research ethics board approval is not applicable. We plan to disseminate our results via publication in a peer-reviewed journal or conference presentation.

However, the disease can be prevented through vaccination, screening, and early treatment. Recently, the World Health Organization released a strategy with the goal of eliminating cervical cancer through a combination of these three preventive strategies. In El Salvador, a screening program has been in place for some years, and vaccination is in its early stages. Here, we describe the Salvadoran experience and discuss successes to date and challenges for the future. We also provide recommendations that may be helpful for other countries working to meet the WHO elimination goals. Cervical cancer is preventable through vaccination, early detection, and the treatment of pre-cancerous lesions. However, global inequalities mean that the disease remains a leading cause of cancer death around the world, with over 80% of new cases and 90% of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In El Salvador, joint efforts between the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the non-profit organization Basic Health International (BHI) have been in place since 2008, with the goal of reducing the country's disease burden. While the World Health Organization's (WHO) call to action to eliminate cervical cancer provided worldwide momentum to implement new public health initiatives, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted ongoing programs and jeopardized plans for the future. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the progress that El Salvador has achieved in improving cervical cancer prevention, the impact of the pandemic on current strategies, and potential solutions that can help the country meet the WHO's strategic targets by 2030 to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer.

J	Niconchuk, JA; Newton, MW				Niconchuk, Jonathan A.; Newton, Mark W.			Global pediatric surgery and anesthesia inequities: how do we have a global effort?	CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Review						global anesthesia; global health equity; global surgery; health systems strengthening	OPPORTUNITIES; AFRICA; HEALTH	Purpose of review The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the inequities in access to healthcare while also revealing our global connectivity. These inequities are emblematic of decades of underinvestment in healthcare systems, education, and research in low-middle income countries (LMICs), especially in surgery and anesthesiology. Five billion people remain without access to safe surgery, and we must take appropriate action now. Recent findings The pediatric perioperative mortality in low-resourced settings may be as high as 100 times greater than in high-resourced settings, and a pediatric surgery workforce density benchmark of 4/1 million population could increase survivability to over 80%. Delay in treatment for congenital surgically correctable issues dramatically increases disability-adjusted life years. Appropriate academic partnerships which promote education are desired but the lack of authorship position priority for LMIC-based researchers must be addressed. Five perioperative benchmark indicators have been published including: geospatial access to care within 2 h of location; workforce/100,000 population; volume of surgery/100,000 population; perioperative mortality within 30 days of surgery or until discharged; and risks for catastrophic expenditure from surgical care. Research that determines ethical and acceptable partnership development between high- and low-resourced settings focusing on education and capacity building needs to be standardized and followed.

J	Barbieri, M				Barbieri, Magali			Socioeconomic Disparities Do Not Explain the US International Disadvantage in Mortality	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Demography; Health disparities; International comparison; Life expectancy; Socioeconomic status	UNITED-STATES; LIFE EXPECTANCY; EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; HEALTH; INCOME; AREA; DEPRIVATION; INEQUALITY; PATTERNS; TRENDS	Objectives The articles examines the contribution of internal socioeconomic disparities in mortality to the U.S. international disadvantage in life expectancy at birth. Methods Using individual death records from the U.S. national vital statistics system for years 1982-2019 and data for other countries from the Human Mortality Database, we compare age-specific death rates and life expectancy between counties classified into 10 socioeconomic categories and 20 high-income countries. We also calculate the number of years of life lost in each socioeconomic decile in relation to the comparison set. Results There is a clear and increasing socioeconomic gradient of mortality in the United States, but the growing divergence in internal mortality trends does not explain the rising gap between the country and its peers. In 2019, even American women in the most socioeconomically advantaged decile lived shorter lives, while only 10% of men in the most affluent decile fared better than their peers. The long-standing U.S. disadvantage in young adult mortality has been growing and the country's previous advantage in mortality at ages 75 years and older has virtually disappeared for all but for Americans in the most affluent counties. Discussion The similar age pattern of differences in mortality rates between each socioeconomic deciles and the comparison group suggests that the underlying factors might be the same. The role of external causes (including drug overdoses) for middle-aged adults and a slowing down in progress to control cardiovascular diseases at older ages at the national level are consistent with this pattern.

Causes of America's Lagging Life Expectancy: An International Comparative Perspective	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Age patterns; Causes of death; Demography; International comparisons; Mortality	UNITED-STATES; RACIAL SEGREGATION; HOMICIDE RATES; MORTALITY; TRENDS; AGE; DISADVANTAGE; SMOKING; DISEASE; INEQUALITIES	Objectives This study assesses how American life expectancy compares to other high-income countries and identifies key age groups and causes of death responsible for the U.S. life expectancy shortfall. Methods Data from the Human Mortality Database, World Health Organization Mortality Database, and vital statistics agencies for 18 high-income countries are used to examine trends in U.S. life expectancy gaps and how American age-specific death rates compare to other countries. Decomposition is used to estimate the contribution of 19 age groups and 16 causes to the U.S. life expectancy shortfall. Results In 2018, life expectancy for American men and women was 5.18 and 5.82 years lower than the world leaders and 3.60 and 3.48 years lower than the average of the comparison countries. Americans aged 25-29 experience death rates nearly 3 times higher than their counterparts. Together, injuries (drug overdose, firearm-related deaths, motor vehicle accidents, homicide), circulatory diseases, and mental disorders/nervous system diseases (including Alzheimer's disease) account for 86% and 67% of American men's and women's life expectancy shortfall, respectively. Discussion American life expectancy has fallen far behind its peer countries. The U.S.'s worsening mortality at the prime adult ages and eroding old-age mortality advantage drive its deteriorating performance in international comparisons.

We evaluate an Eco-DRR, an afforestation effort, Boca de Sapo (hereafter, BdS), in a marginalized community in peri-urban Lima where we perform household surveys and key informant interviews. To estimate the economic viability, we design a benefit-cost analysis (BCA) and include probabilistically estimated DRR benefits and place-based economic and non-market co-benefits representing stakeholder values. Accounting for income differences, we incorporate equity weights to estimate social welfare benefits. We then evaluate BdS impacts based on BCA results and stakeholder responses along broader sustainability dimensions, and benchmark the project's contribution to urban sustainability using two international frameworks. Household surveys revealed high concern for rockfall risk, and a double-bounded contingent valuation indicated an average household willingness to pay (WTP) of $3.44 +/- 0.49/month for BdS maintenance. The equity-weighted risk-based BCA using Monte Carlo simulations indicated BdS was unviable considering DRR benefits with a Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) of 0.06 +/- 0.08. BCR estimates increased to 1.18 +/- 0.42 with incremental integration of tangible property rights co-benefits, and to 1.70 +/- 0.59 with addition of WTP representing non-market co-benefits. Our findings demonstrate that inclusion of the multiple Eco-DRR place-based, socio-cultural, and ecological co-benefits with primary DRR benefits is critical as they generate substantial wellbeing impacts for communities. Adapting a sustainability lens revealed holistic Eco-DRR outcomes including access to public green spaces, social inclusion, stronger resource governance, and health and wellbeing benefits, highlighting areas for improvement and pathways for adaptive governance.

J	Anderson, K				Anderson, Kym			Trade-related food policies in a more volatile climate and trade environment*	FOOD POLICY			English	Article						Uncertain international trade environment; Virtues of liberal food trade; Re-purposing food policies	EVOLVING COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE; SPECIAL SAFEGUARD MECHANISM; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; EXPORT RESTRICTIONS; PRICE; POVERTY; CHINA; ECONOMICS	Providing affordable access to enough healthy and safe food for an ever-more-affluent and growing world population has become more challenging in the face of climate change, rising income inequality and a more uncertain global trade environment. Agriculture is expected to contribute more, but is under pressure in both high-income and developing countries to do so more sustainably and inclusively. This paper reviews the roles of food policy in this changing setting. It begins by revisiting the case for keeping food markets open to international trade, investment and technology transfer, and concludes that openness is even more important, especially for developing countries, as the climate becomes warmer and more volatile. It then summarizes trade-related food policy developments globally in the 50 years prior to the global financial crisis, and in the price-spike periods since then. The current situation is calling for more action - including from agriculture - to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss. The scope for re-purposing food policies to better meet these demands is then assessed. It proposes some alternatives to current measures that could better achieve national societal objectives while simultaneously benefitting the rest of the world in terms of easing natural resource and environmental stresses and reducing national and global poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, and inequalities in income, wealth and health. The review concludes by noting areas where further research could facilitate such transformations in food policies.

Current urban transport data collection methods do not account for the distinct behavioural and psychological experiences of the population. Therefore, little is known about the travel experience of vulnerable citizens that continue to rely on public transit and their concerns over risk, safety and other stressors that could negatively affect their health and well-being. We develop a machine learning approach to augment conventional transport data collection methods by curating a population segmented Twitter dataset representing the travel experiences of similar to 120,000 transit riders before and during the pandemic in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Results show a heightened increase in negative sentiments, differentiated by age, gender and ethnicity associated with public transit indicating signs of psychological stress among travellers during the first and second waves of COVID-19. Our results provide empirical evidence of existing inequalities and additional risks faced by citizens using public transit during the pandemic, and can help raise awareness of the differential risks faced by travellers. Our data collection methods can help inform more targeted social-distancing measures, public health announcements, and transit monitoring services during times of transport disruptions and closures.

Beyond Criminalisation: Abortion Law Reform in Aotearoa New Zealand	MEDICAL LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Abortion; Feticide; Gestational model; human rights; Reproductive justice	RIGHTS; DECRIMINALISATION; EXPERIENCES; BODY	With the enactment of the Abortion Legislation Act 2020, New Zealand radically transformed its approach to abortion. Abortion is no longer a crime, and is instead regulated under general health law, adopting a gestational model. Whilst some claim that reform was overdue, critics have described the new legislation as the 'world's most extreme abortion law'. This article investigates these claims through the lens of reproductive justice, a movement that emerged alongside the global campaign for recognition of reproductive rights. First, it outlines the tenets of reproductive justice, before critiquing New Zealand's previous law, and considering arguments for its modernisation. It then describes how a growing number of jurisdictions have decriminalised abortion, with increasing pressure on other countries, including England and Wales, to similarly undertake law reform. Finally, it examines the main provisions of New Zealand's law. It concludes that, to the extent that the new law enables access to timely, equitable, and publicly funded abortion services, it is consistent with the tenets of reproductive justice. By placing women at the centre of the law, it improves the welfare of women, but particularly marginalised women. However, it suggests that the current 20-week gestational test is arbitrary, with the originally proposed 22-week threshold preferable.

J	Ji, XB				Ji, Xianbai			How Global Summitry Evolves: The Complementary Multilateralism Perspective	CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS			English	Article							POLITICAL-ECONOMY; NETWORK ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRADE WAR; WORLD; G20; INSTITUTIONS; HEGEMONY; CHINA; AGENDA	The Group of Seven (G7) major Western industrial powers and the Group of Twenty (G20) systemically important economies have appeared in recent decades, their distinctly informal structures notwithstanding, as co-governors of world affairs. To address questions of global salience in regard to the nature of the two leadership fora's intricate interrelationship, the article constructs a "complementary multilateralism" theoretical framework to shed light on that important symbiotic bond. Unlike the multi-multilateralism, hierarchical multilateralism, and contested multilateralism perspectives, which also describe and characterise interinstitutional relationships within international regime complexity, the complementary multilateralism approach focuses on complementarity between multilateral institutional bodies. After defining complementary multilateralism, the article traces the historical evolution and devolution of the G7 to the G20 and then elaborates on the process of complementary multilateralism entailed between the two Gs. Employing such novel research techniques as quantitative textual analytics and social network analysis, the article empirically uncovers a pattern of spontaneous division of labour, evident in the G7 working primarily with the United Nations' organs to rein in non-economic aspects of global governance, and the G20 maintaining ties mainly with Bretton Woods institutions charged with international economic cooperation. Going forward, synergetic G7-G20 partnerships would be beneficial to producing favourable governance outcomes, in policy areas such as global health, tax justice, climate change, debt management, and the governance reform of the International Monetary Fund.

J	Mangrio, E; Zdravkovic, S; Strange, M				Mangrio, Elisabeth; Zdravkovic, Slobodan; Strange, Michael			Working With Refugees' Health During COVID-19-The Experience of Health- and Social Care Workers in Sweden	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						COVID-19; healthcare; health professionals; migrants; health literacy	MENTAL ILL-HEALTH	IntroductionIn Sweden, often seen as one of the most egalitarian countries, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed high levels of health inequality, especially harming people with a refugee background. This is also despite Sweden's image as a refugee-friendly country. In this context, the aim of this paper is to better understand how Swedish health- and social workers have reacted to the health- and social needs of refugees during the pandemic. The Swedish case is particularly interesting because, as seen in the paper, health- and social workers had the task of communicating health guidance to refugees who were sometimes more reliant on information from abroad where the consensus on COVID-19 restrictions ran contrary to the approach recommended by the Swedish public health authority. MethodThe study utilizes a qualitative content analysis of 13 in-depth interviews with health- and social workers in Sweden, active in the care of refugees within different kinds of health- and social care settings. ResultsThe analysis showed that healthcare services have remained open during the pandemic but with new precautions at reception areas impacting how refugees access healthcare. As discussed in the article, the shift to digital tools has particularly impacted refugees, worsening already existing barriers to healthcare services faced by those with refugee status. Public health recommendations were poorly designed to the needs of refugees whose living conditions often prevented them from self-isolation and social distancing. Furthermore, Sweden's initially non-restrictive approach to the pandemic instructed health- and social-workers to encourage refugees to take far fewer precautions (e.g., self-isolation, home-schooling, pregnant women to avoid virus hotspots) compared both with European neighbors and the international media typically used by refugees. When Sweden shifted toward a more restrictive approach, health- and social-workers had to revise their guidance in relation to the new recommendations around precautions. ConclusionRefugees have faced increased barriers to maintaining their health and wellbeing during the pandemic that exceed those experienced by the rest of the Swedish population. Refugees have, in general, taken precautions in regard to social distancing and followed recommendations but faced challenges with social distancing due to isolation and crowded living. Public health authorities have often failed to acknowledge that individuals use increasingly diverse sources of knowledge when trying to protect their health, and that not everyone has access to the knowledge needed to access healthcare and social systems. At the same time, there is a need to acknowledge that refugees are sometimes a source of expertise that was ignored by the Swedish health and social system during the pandemic. There is a need for urgent efforts to halt the worsening health conditions for this specific group, but also to counter knock-on societal effects and rising health inequity.

Over the past decades, actions to confront the phenomenon have advanced sig-nificantly in Brazil, particularly the growing out-put and the systematization of information on the topic. In this sense, Information Systems (IS) are important tools in the collection, processing/orga-nization and dissemination of official statistics on this type of violence, the objective of which is to as-sist in the planning and implementation of inter-sectoral public policies. It is noteworthy that these devices are characterized as a space for disputes of diverse interests. That is, they are not neutral instruments, but they bring with them a world-view that guides them. Thus, a critical analysis of information systems on violence against women is necessary, dealing with how they characterize the phenomenon, as well as feeding decisions and planning actions. Based on an integrative review, this paper aims to analyze how information sys-tems on violence against women are portrayed in national and international academic production.

J	Tomczak, P				Tomczak, Philippa			Highlighting "Risky Remands" Through Prisoner Death Investigations: People With Very Severe Mental Illness Transitioning From Police and Court Custody Into Prison on Remand	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						pre-trial detention; liaison and diversion; mental capacity; fitness to plead; prison oversight; death investigation; remand	HEALTH-CARE; SUICIDE	Prison suicide/self-inflicted death is an international public health crisis, harming stakeholders including bereaved families, prisoners, prison staff and death investigators. England and Wales' record prison suicide numbers in 2016 cost at least 400 pound million. Death rates are an indicator of prison safety, and unsafe prisons mean unsafe societies. I present four case studies of people with very severe mental illness who were remanded to prison from police and/or court custody and went on to take their own lives in prison. I use publicly available data from Ombudsman and Coronial death investigations in England and Wales, highlighting that these accessible sources could be more widely mobilized to reduce the substantial harms and costs of prisoner deaths. Case studies include three men (Lewis Francis, Jason Basalat and Dean Saunders) and one woman (Sarah Reed) who took their own lives between January 2016 and April 2017. All four people were clearly very mentally unwell at the time of their alleged offense and remand to prison. I develop the concept of "risky remands" to highlight that people with very severe mental illness being remanded to prison is a particularly problematic practice. I highlight the implications of people with very severe mental illness transitioning into prison in the first place, arguing that being remanded to prison is not an acceptable or safe pathway into healthcare. I illustrate that police custody suites and courts may lack awareness of mechanisms and/ or the practical ability to transfer ill detainees charged with a serious crime to mental health facilities for assessment and/ or treatment. My analysis amplifies and extends recent Criminal Justice Joint Inspection findings that it is unacceptable to use prisons as a "place of safety," and that the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and the Welsh Government must increase the supply of medium and high secure beds. Moreover, Ombudsman investigations did not engage with the remand transition, effectively legitimizing this risky practice for very ill people. As such, my analysis also counters the apparent "problem of implementation" in prison oversight, instead questioning what reviewers recommend, based on which evidence.

This study examined associations between life-course socioeconomic conditions, including social mobility, and cognitive performance assessed in terms of level and change, across multiple cognitive domains in two independent cohorts of older adults. Methods Data were from two Swiss population-based cohorts: CoLaus|PsyCoLaus (N = 1210, mean age 72 years) and Vivre/Leben/Vivere (N = 993, mean age 75 years). Verbal fluency, processing speed, cognitive flexibility, memory, and global cognitive performance were assessed at two time points, each spaced 6 years apart. Associations between socioeconomic conditions (father's occupation, parental education, own education, own occupation, household income, and social mobility) and cognitive performance were examined within each cohort, and using pooled data. Covariates included health behaviors, comorbidities, and depressive symptoms. Results Across cohorts, socioeconomic disadvantage predicted a lower level of performance across different cognitive domains, including processing speed, verbal fluency, and memory. Moreover, individuals who experienced life-course socioeconomic disadvantage performed worse than those who experienced upward social mobility. Associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and cognitive decline were less consistent. Conclusion Life-course socioeconomic conditions predict performance level across different cognitive domains, and, to a lesser extent, performance trajectories.

Before the onset of the coronavirus, awareness of health disparities across cities in the United States was questionable at best. As the world continues to grapple with the fallout of the pandemic and the response to it, several states and developed and developing countries created and implemented response efforts that were used as a guide, which social workers are most qualified to address but have not been a focus on a national nor international stage. This commentary focuses on two American states - Texas and Ohio as well as other global countries, and their responses that gained worldwide attention related to healthcare accessibility, service provision, and the role social workers should play moving forward and beyond the pandemic.

We mobilized a unique dataset, the Longitudinal and International Study of Adults (LISA) linked to income data from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), to investigate the relevance of intergenerational socioeconomic reproduction for inequalities in self-rated health in a national sample of Canadians aged 25 to 50. We found strong intergenerational elasticities implicating both parental education and parental family income in the acquisition of both personal education and personal family income. Parental education was not significantly associated with self-rated health. Parental family income was significantly associated with self-rated health among women only, partly explained by the socioeconomic status of the women themselves. These results suggest that intergenerational reproduction plays a small role in the generation of high levels of self-rated health among Canadian women but not among Canadian men.

Little research has examined the influence of CSA on the stability of depressive symptoms among repeat juvenile offenders. The present study tested a gendered model of the association between lifetime CSA victimization and depression for three time points: baseline juvenile assessment entry; second reentry; and third reentry. Further, covariate analyses were conducted to explore the impact of socio-demographics on CSA victimization and depression. Results indicate that CSA victimization was associated directly with baseline depression and indirectly with depression at second reentry for both male and female justice-involved youths. For white, male youth, there were significantly higher rates of depression over time, than other males. However, age, African American or Hispanic race/ethnicity, living situation, and urbanity were not significantly associated with CSA victimization at baseline or depression over time. These findings underscore the need for juvenile justice services that address exposure to childhood trauma and mental illness more effectively.

This study aims to investigate whether the source of knowledge influences the perception of that knowledge and the willingness to use it in francophone African health policy-making context. Methods The study followed a randomized experimental design in which participants were randomly assigned to one of seven policy briefs that were designed with the same scientific content but with different organizations presented as authors. Each organization was representative of financial, scientific or moral authority. For each type of authority, two organizations were proposed: one North American or European, and the other African. Results The initial models showed that there was no significant association between the type of authority or the location of the authoring organization and the two outcomes (perceived quality and reported instrumental use). Stratified analyses highlighted that policy briefs signed by the African donor organization (financial authority) were perceived to be of higher quality than policy briefs signed by the North American/European donor organization. For both perceived quality and reported instrumental use, these analyses found that policy briefs signed by the African university (scientific authority) were associated with lower scores than policy briefs signed by the North American/European university. Conclusions The results confirm the significant influence of sources on perceived global health knowledge and the intersectionality of sources of influence. This analysis allows us to learn more about organizations in global health leadership, and to reflect on the implications for knowledge translation practices.

Towards equitable scheduling of global health teleconferences: a spatial exploration of the world's population and health by time zone	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						medical ethics; telemedicine; epidemiology; international health services; occupational & industrial medicine; statistics & research methods		Objectives To examine the world's population, development, and health by condensed Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset to support a normative position on how to most defensibly schedule global health teleconferences with the primary goal of advancing equitable regard for participants by health condition. Design Spatial exploration examined through the lens of equitable regard for participants. Setting The Earth. Participants The global population. Main outcome measures Global population, countries, Human Development Index (HDI), and health measured in total and disease-specific disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100 000 per year by UTC offset. Strengths and weaknesses of scheduling teleconferences accordingly to alternative approaches. Results The UTC offset with the largest population of approximately 1 724 million persons occurred in UTC+5, largest country count of approximately 40 countries in UTC+1, and the lowest median HDI of 0.527 occurred in UTC0. The highest median total DALYs per 100 000 per year of 41 873 occurred in UTC+11, highest median HIV/AIDS DALYs per 100 000 per year of 941 in UTC0, and highest median typhoid and paratyphoid fevers DALYs per 100 000 per year of 279 occurred in UTC+5. Hypothetical teleconference scheduling scenarios generated temporal distances of up to 11 hours to UTC offsets representing the most countries and greatest number of DALYs per 100 000 per year. Teleconference scheduling based on egoism was considered to be problematic, and contractualism as unrealistically demanding. Utilitarianism resulted in the risk of systematically disadvantaging small, temporally remote groups. Egalitarianism offered equality, but prioritarianism offered the possibility of addressing health inequities. Conclusions Global health teleconferences may generate great temporal distances between participants compromising representative participation, as well as the well-being of attendees. Our spatial exploration of the world's population and health by UTC offset may be used to support a normative position on scheduling global health teleconferences that enhance progress towards health equity.

We conceptualised "last mile" adolescents as having two or more of the following factors of identity: refugee, Indigenous, 2SLGBTQIA+, out of school, rurally or remotely located, slum dwelling, incarcerated or previously incarcerated, HIV/AIDS infected, and living with a disability. We conducted a scoping review with an aim to synthesise evidence and identify research gaps in the literature pertaining to the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of last mile adolescents. We conducted searches in three databases (Embase, Global Health, and Medline). Fifty-four publications met our inclusion criteria. Our results revealed that the state of evidence on the SRHR of last mile adolescents is poor. Very few studies used qualitative and mixed-method inquiry. The number of studies carried out in North America, Europe, and Oceania were limited. We found insufficient disaggregated data with respect to SRHR-related knowledge, behaviour, and access to services. Adopting an intersectional lens is critical to uncover the multiplicative effects of last mile adolescents' factors of identity on their SRHR. National data systems should be strengthened to enable the collection of quality disaggregated data which can play a vital role in identifying SRHR inequities affecting last mile adolescents. Research priorities should be realigned to generate data globally on the SRHR of last mile adolescents whose lives are marked by intersecting vulnerabilities.

Equitable Distribution of Poor Quality of Care? Equity in Quality of Reproductive Health Services in Ethiopia	HEALTH SYSTEMS & REFORM			English	Article						ANC; equity; Ethiopia; FP; multidimensional poverty; quality		The Ethiopian health system faces persistent inequities in health-care utilization and outcomes, despite continued efforts to expand health service coverage. There is little evidence in the literature describing the status of equity in the quality of healthcare. This paper aims to understand the disparities in quality of antenatal care (ANC) and family planning (FP) among the poor and non-poor communities. We used the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to compute a Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), and the 2014 Service Provision Assessment (SPA) data to assess quality of ANC and FP services-defined as the level of adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) clinical and service guidelines. We merged the two datasets using geographical coordinates, and aggregated service users into facility catchment area clusters using a 2-km radius for urban and 10-km radius for rural facilities. We computed ANC and FP quality and MPI indices for each facility and assigned these to catchment areas. Using the international cutoff point for deprivation (MPI = 33.3%), we evaluated whether the quality of ANC and FP services varies by poor and non-poor catchment areas. We found that most of catchment areas (75.7%) were deprived. While the overall quality of ANC and FP services are low (33% and 34% respectively), we found little variation in the distribution of the quality of these services between poor and nonpoor areas, urban and rural settings, or regionally. The short-term focus needs to be on improving the overall quality of services rather than on its distribution.

J	Naranjo, NR				Ramirez Naranjo, Nelida			Practices and knowledge of socio-environmental organisations and movements in Maule, Chile and Antioquia, Colombia	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						environmental beliefs; environmental crisis; environmental justice; environmental values; socio-environmental organisations or movements; social work and climate change		This research investigates the practices, knowledge and beliefs that socio-environmental organisations and movements have developed and acquired relating to environmental justice. A literature review is presented first, followed by the methodology. The findings reveal the perceptions of the leaders of socio-environmental organisations and movements. Their remarks are structured into the following two categories: (i) the purposes of the socio-environmental organisations and movements and (ii) the beliefs that support their action. Finally, there is a discussion and the conclusions are presented. The conclusions indicate that socio-environmental organisations and movements are a collective social force against environmental inequality and that the information on the practices and knowledge of these organisations and movements illuminates new perspectives on environmental justice and should be integrated into social work education and practice. It is generally accepted that the effects of climate change are a significant threat to human ecosystems, culture and health, and to global economic development as a whole. In response to these environmental changes and the attendant human vulnerability, it is imperative that social workers can more consciously lead the planning and social advocacy efforts needed to meet this challenge. The poorest and most vulnerable communities generally suffer the worst effects of climate change, and it is, therefore, essential to understand the different experiences of socio-environmental organisations and movements in response to environmental justice issues. This article presents the results of a comparative exploratory research study on Chile and Colombia, focusing on the practices and knowledge of socio-environmental organisations and movements in the Maule Region, Chile and the Department of Antioquia, Colombia. The research uses qualitative methodology and considers the views of nine social actors and leaders, four in Chile and five in Colombia. The conclusions indicate that these socio-environmental organisations see their purpose as defending water and territory, they fulfil a local advocacy role and they raise awareness and provide education on issues through participation and collective action.

Health inequities in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest	CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE			English	Review						cardiac arrest; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; health inequalities; health inequities	BYSTANDER CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION; COMMUNITY SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; AMBULANCE RESPONSE; SURVIVAL; OUTCOMES; ASSOCIATION; DISPARITIES; PROVISION; RATES; CARE	Purpose of review Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a time-critical emergency in which a rapid response following the chain of survival is crucial to save life. Disparities in care can occur at each link in this pathway and hence produce health inequities. This review summarises the health inequities that exist for OHCA patients and suggests how they may be addressed. Recent findings There is international evidence that the incidence of OHCA is increased with increasing deprivation and in ethnic minorities. These groups have lower rates of bystander CPR and bystander-initiated defibrillation, which may be due to barriers in accessing cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, provision of public access defibrillators, and language barriers with emergency call handlers. There are also disparities in the ambulance response and in-hospital care following resuscitation. These disadvantaged communities have poorer survival following OHCA. OHCA disproportionately affects deprived communities and ethnic minorities. These groups experience disparities in care throughout the chain of survival and this appears to translate into poorer outcomes. Addressing these inequities will require coordinated action that engages with disadvantaged communities.

Realist evaluation in times of decolonising global health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						decolonisation; emancipation; global health; participatory action research; power; realist evaluation		Realist evaluation (RE) is a theory-driven evaluation approach inspired by scientific realism. It has become increasingly popular in the field of global health where it is often applied in low- and middle-income countries. This makes it timely to discuss RE's relationship to the emerging decolonisation of global health movement. In this short perspective, we argue that the principles and practices that underpin RE have great potential to contribute to the decolonisation endeavour. Both the focus on the inclusion of local stakeholders and the openness to the rival theories these stakeholders bring to the fore, are promising. However, in practice, we see that a lack of acknowledgement of power imbalances and different ontologies and an overreliance on Western-based theories thwart this potential. We therefore suggest that realist evaluations performed by external researchers, especially in the field of global health, should actively engage with issues of (power) inequities. This is not only the just thing to do, but will also contribute to a better understanding of the intervention and may facilitate the emancipation of the disenfranchised. One way of doing this is through the adoption of participatory (action) research methods, currently underused in realist evaluations. We finally give a short example of an evaluation that combines emancipatory and participatory practice development with a realist approach. The Afya-Tek project in Tanzania has an innovative bottom-up approach throughout the full evaluation cycle and shows the possible strength of the proposed combination to create better interventions, more empowered stakeholders, and more illuminating programme theories.

This results in worse health literacy and poorer mental and physical health compared to hearing populations. Various interventions aimed at improving health equity for d/Deaf people have been documented but not systematically analyzed. The purpose of this systematic review is to obtain a global overview of what we know about interventions aimed at improving health equity for d/Deaf people. Methods Medline Ovid SP, Embase, CINAHL EBSCO, PsycINFO Ovid SP, Central-Cochrane Library Wiley and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies on access to healthcare and health-related interventions for d/Deaf people following the PRISMA-equity guidelines. We focused on interventions aimed at achieving equitable care and equitable access to health information for d/Deaf people. Results Forty-six studies were identified and analyzed. Seven categories of interventions facing healthcare or health education inequities emerged: use of Sign Language (1), translation, validation and identification of clinical tools and scales (2), healthcare provider training program (3), development of adapted healthcare facilities (4), online interventions (5), education programs (6) and videos (7). Despite some methodological limitations or lack of data, these interventions seem relevant to improve equity of care and health education for d/Deaf people. Conclusion Interventions that promote healthcare equity, health education amongst d/Deaf patients and healthcare provider awareness of communication barriers and cultural sensitivity show promise in achieving more equitable care for d/Deaf patients. Meaningful engagement of d/Deaf individuals in the conceptualization, implementation and evaluation of health-related interventions is imperative.

Translating international health policies into lived realities: Maternal health, social support programs, and obstetric violence in highland Peru	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Obstetric violence; Birth; Medical anthropology; Peru; Qualitative research	MORTALITY; CONSEQUENCES; WOMEN; CARE	This article examines women's experiences of pregnancy and childbirth in highland Peru and illuminates how international maternal health policies can perpetuate and reinforce social inequalities through what is now increasingly termed obstetric violence, including coercion, neglect, and physical and verbal abuse. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with mothers, obstetricians, midwives, and social workers and community-based, participatory action research workshops. In recounting their experiences, women continually referenced confusion around medical interventions, issues of coercion, neglect, abuse, and punishment, and structural obligations to utilize biomedical services. Analyzing these experiences through the lens of obstetric violence allows for a contextualization of individual women's experiences of violence in the healthcare setting within the broader context of everyday assaults on economically disenfranchised, indigenous women's personhood. Although women have increasing access to biomedical care as a result of international maternal health policies, this research demonstrates that how this care is delivered also deserves scrutiny.

The timevarying conditional correlations between markets were higher during COVID-19 spread. Moreover, gold offers more diversification gains than oil does during the pandemic. Hedging is more expensive during a pandemic than before. Oil provides higher hedging effectiveness (HE) than gold for all sub-periods. HE was lower during the COVID-19 outbreak for both oil and gold. These findings have important implications for both equity investors and policymakers. (c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health-Workforce 2030, adopted in 2016, includes Health Labor Market Analysis (HLMA) as a tool for evidence based health workforce improvements. HLMA offers certain advantages over the traditional approach of workforce planning. In 2018, WHO supported a HLMA exercise in Chhattisgarh, one of the predominantly rural states of India. Methods The HLMA included a stakeholder consultation for identifying policy questions relevant to the context. The HLMA focused on state HRH at district-level and below. Mixed methods were used for data collection and analysis. Detailed district-wise data on HRH availability were collected from state's health department. Data were also collected on policies implemented on HRH during the 3 year period after the start of HLMA and changes in health workforce. Results The state had increased the production of doctors but vacancies persisted until 2018. The availability of doctors and other qualified health workers was uneven with severe shortages of private as well as public HRH in rural areas. In case of nurses, there was a substantial production of nurses, particularly from private schools, however there was a lack of trusted accreditation mechanism and vacancies in public sector persisted alongside unemployment among nurses. Based on the HLMA, pragmatic recommendations were decided and followed up. Over the past 3 years since the HLMA began an additional 4547 health workers including 1141 doctors have been absorbed by the public sector. The vacancies in most of the clinical cadres were brought below 20%. Conclusion The HLMA played an important role in identifying the key HRH gaps and clarifying the underlying issues. The HLMA and the pursuant recommendations were instrumental in development and implementation of appropriate policies to improve rural HRH in Chhattisgarh. This demonstrates important progress on key 2030 Global Strategy milestones of reducing inequalities in access to health workers and improving financing, retention and training of HRH.

However, there was very limited research in this area. Eight studies were included and the synthesis yielded seven global themes. The meta-ethnography produced a higher-order concept-the gendered reproduction of children's and young people's caring. The review shows that children and young people are relied on as a caring resource in the global North and South. We emphasise that gender equality in caring, particularly among adults, is necessary to enhance the lifechances of girls and young women.

In this study, the resource utilization in mental illness (RUMI) tool was developed and employed to evaluate resource utilization in patients with SMI. Materials and methods Data from 107 patients with SMI treated in four psychiatric outpatient clinics in Sweden were collected. The relationships between costs for physical and psychiatric care, social services, and the justice system, to self-reported health and quality of life, educational level, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), the Clinical Global Impressions scale score (CGI), and body mass index (BMI) were studied. Results Sixteen out of 107 patients accounted for 74% of the total costs. The mean and median cost for 6 months included in the survey for social services, family and social welfare and healthcare, psychiatric and physical treatment interventions, mean 8349 EUR, median 2599 EUR per patient (currency value for 2021). Education and psychosocial function (GAF) were both negatively correlated with costs for the social services (education, r=-0.207, p < 0.014; GAF, r=-0.258, p < 0.001). CGI was correlated with costs for physical and psychiatric healthcare (r = 0.161, p < 0.027), social services support (r = 0.245, p = 0.002) and total cost (r = 0.198, p = 0.007). BMI correlated with costs for psychiatric and physical health settings interventions (r = 0.155, p < 0.019) and for somatic and psychiatric medicines (r = 0.154, p < 0.019). Conclusion The RUMI scale was acceptable and enabled estimation of resource utilization in a comparable manner across different care settings. Such comparable data have potential to provide a basis for budgeting and resource allocation.

Predictors and prevalence of hazardous alcohol use in middle-late to late adulthood in Europe	AGING & MENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Hazardous alcohol use; older adults; middle-aged adults; Europe; alcohol; drug and alcohol abuse; cross-national; international studies; environmental factors; housing; rural-urban factors; epidemiology (mental health)	HEALTH-RISK APPRAISAL; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; SOCIAL-ISOLATION; BINGE DRINKING; OLDER-PEOPLE; CONSUMPTION; INEQUALITIES; ADOLESCENCE; RETIREMENT; PREVENTION	Objectives: Even low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption can have detrimental health consequences, especially in older adults (OA). Although many studies report an increase in the proportion of drinkers among OA, there are regional variations. Therefore, we examined alcohol consumption and the prevalence of hazardous alcohol use (HAU) among men and women aged 50+ years in four European regions and investigated predictors of HAU. Methods: We analyzed data of N = 35,042 participants of the European SHARE study. We investigated differences in alcohol consumption (units last week) according to gender, age and EU-region using ANOVAs. Furthermore, logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of income, education, marital status, history of a low-quality parent-child relationship and smoking on HAU, also stratified for gender and EU-region. HAU was operationalized as binge drinking or risky drinking (<12.5 units of 10 ml alcohol/week). Results: Overall, past week alcohol consumption was 5.0 units (+/- 7.8), prevalence of HAU was 25.4% within our sample of European adults aged 50+ years. Male gender, younger age and living in Western Europe were linked to both higher alcohol consumption and higher risks of HAU. Income, education, smoking, a low-quality parent-child relationship, living in Northern and especially Eastern Europe were positively associated with HAU. Stratified analyses revealed differences by region and gender. Conclusions: HAU was highly prevalent within this European sample of OA. Alcohol consumption and determinants of HAU differed between EU-regions, hinting to a necessity of risk-stratified population-level strategies to prevent HAU and subsequent alcohol use disorders.

Differential trends in US suicide rates, 1999-2020: Emerging racial and ethnic disparities	PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Suicide; Health disparities; Mortality; Equity; Minorities; Race; Ethnicity; Social vulnerability; United States	INVOLVED OVERDOSE DEATHS; UNITED-STATES	Suicide is an important cause of mortality in the United States. This study aimed to examine US suicide trends by race and ethnicity from 1999 to 2020. Publicly available de-identified data were extracted from the CDC's Wideranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. The International Classification of Diseases Codes, 10th Revision-X60-X84, U03, and Y87.0 were used to identify suicide decedents aged 10 years and above from 1999 to 2020. A Joinpoint regression model was fitted to estimate the annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change in suicide rate over the study period. From 1999 to 2020, a total of 838,560 persons died by suicide in the US. Recent mortality trends have declined by 3.8% per year (95% CI:-7.1,-0.5) among Non-Hispanic Whites from 2018 to 2020, but have increased among Non-Hispanic Blacks (APC = 6.1; 95% CI: 5.0, 7.3), Asians/Pacific Islanders (APC = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2, 1.9), American Indians/Alaska Natives (APC = 3.3; 95% CI: 3.0, 3.6), and Hispanics (APC = 3.8; 95% CI: 2.7, 5.0). Based on suicide mechanism, recent trends have increased by firearm (APC = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5, 2.0) and suffocation (APC = 3.8; 95% CI: 3.5, 4.1), decreased by drug poisoning (APC =-2.9; 95% CI:-3.9,-1.9), and stabilized by non-drug poisoning (APC = 0.6; 95% CI:-2.4, 3.7). Racial and ethnic disparities exist in suicide trends in the United States. Further research to identify individual and contextual factors for the differences may guide effective public health intervention efforts.

J	Chaudhary, N; Dutt, A				Chaudhary, Nabiha; Dutt, Anjali			Women as Agents of Change: Exploring Women Leaders' Resistance and Shaping of Gender Ideologies in Pakistan	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						women; workplace; family; gender ideology; Global South	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; ROLE STEREOTYPES; FAMILY-STRUCTURE; LAND OWNERSHIP; ROLE CONGRUITY; MIXED METHODS; ATTITUDES; EDUCATION; PARENTS; EMPLOYMENT	Despite a growing focus on processes to promote gender equity, women remain significantly underrepresented in leadership positions in the Global South. In the present study we focus on the role of familial experiences in shaping and contesting gender ideologies of Pakistani women in the workplace. We specifically examine the reciprocal ways in which women leaders and their family members shape each other's gender ideologies regarding the workplace. Data collected and analyzed for this study were semi-structured interviews with eight women in positions of leadership in Lahore, Pakistan, and interviews with one family members of each of the women leaders (thus 16 interviews total). Using thematic narrative analysis, we identified three thematic phases: learning gender expectations, resistance, and familial transformation. These phases reflect the progression of developing, resisting, and influencing individual and familial gender ideologies. We document the manifestation of these phases in three specific domains: education, marriage and motherhood, and the workplace. We then discuss how these findings contribute to understanding the experiences of women leaders and perceptions of their family members regarding women's role in the workplace. Findings from our research provide novel insights into the ways globalization and capitalism continue to shape the socio-cultural context for women leaders in the Global South.

Psychiatric and substance use disorders in a predominately low-income, black sample in early midlife	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Psychopathology; Substance use; Alcohol use; Black; Poverty	NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDER; SELF-REPORT; CARIBBEAN BLACKS; UNITED-STATES; HELP-SEEKING; HEALTH	Decades of research have documented elevated rates of psychopathology among individuals affected by poverty. However, many studies have relied on predominately White samples, and on brief symptom screening measures which may not fully capture the experiences of individuals of color (who are disproportionately affected by poverty in the United States.) The present study examines prevalence rates of probable major depressive dis-order, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder, and alcohol use disorder in a predominately Black sample that grew up in urban poverty, utilizing structured neuropsychiatric interview methods. Data are drawn from a subsample of the Chicago Longitudinal Study (CLS), which has fol-lowed a large cohort for over four decades. Outcomes were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsy-chiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) 7.0.2. Results indicate high probable rates of all measured outcomes, with notably high rates of substance use and alcohol use disorder compared to rates reported in previous national studies. Differences by sex and childhood neighborhood poverty, as well as significant comorbidity among psychiatric, substance and alcohol use disorders were also detected. Findings underscore an urgent need for community-based, culturally tailored prevention and intervention initiatives to support the mental health of individuals living in poverty. The high prevalence of psychiatric, substance and alcohol use disorders in this study likely reflect systematic inequities faced by low-income people of color in the United States. Future directions for research and practice are discussed.

We aimed to synthesise evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to reduce suicide and suicide-related behaviours among people in contact with the criminal justice system. Methods We searched Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and grey literature databases for articles published between 1 January 2000 and 1 June 2021. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020185989). Findings Thirty-eight studies (36 primary research articles, two grey literature reports) met our inclusion criteria, 23 of which were conducted in adult custodial settings in high-income, Western countries. Four studies were randomised controlled trials. Two-thirds of studies (n=26, 68%) were assessed as medium quality, 11 (29%) were assessed as high quality, and one (3%) was assessed as low quality. Most had considerable methodological limitations and very few interventions had been rigorously evaluated; as such, drawing robust conclusions about the efficacy of interventions was difficult. Interpretation More high-quality evidence from criminal justice settings other than adult prisons, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, should be considered a priority for future research.

We use a sample of 868 listed banks across 98 countries from 2002 to 2020, yielding a cross-country panel sample of 15,791 bank-year observations. We find that different components of bank tail risk (i.e. systematic and idiosyncratic) have increased during the health crisis but less so for stronger banks (i.e. more profitable, higher market valuation, lower stock volatility). The result implies that the pandemic results in a higher possibility of suffering extremely large losses in the stock prices of the global banking sector. However, banks with higher profitability and financial stability levels can better prepare themselves to tackle the crisis more effectively and hence are less likely to suffer extreme equity devaluations. Therefore, we contend that financial stability acts as a 'vaccine' for the bank tail risk in the shadow of the pandemic. We finally confine the results to some specific geographic settings; typically, they are more intensified in countries with more financial freedom, middle income-generating, and large banks.

However, in contrast to data on health or unemployment, data on education outcomes are not timely. Hence, we have extremely limited knowledge about pandemic-related learning losses at the national and cross-national levels. As it might take years to get suitable comparative data, this study uses the latest large-scale international achievement survey from before the pandemic, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2019, to answer two research questions. First, which European countries are most likely to have experienced higher learning loss among their children? Second, which European countries have most likely experienced the greatest increases in learning inequalities? Results based on 4th graders' school achievements indicate that educational inequalities between and within countries are likely to have augmented substantially throughout Europe. Some European countries are probably already facing an education crisis.

Good HSR may promote the use of health services and ultimately the health of patients. However, the HSR has not been measured as the main goal of the Epilepsy Management Project (EMP) in rural China. This study aims to evaluate the levels and distributions of the patient-perceived HSR of the EMP in rural China during the period of COVID-19 and identify its relevant factors so as to provide advice on the improvement of further strategies. Based on the key informant survey (KIS) of responsiveness from the World Health Organization proposal, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 420 epilepsy patients selected proportional randomly from seven rural areas in the Hunan province of China in 2021. Eight domains of patients-perceived HSR were assessed by face-to-face interview. The overall HSR scored at a fairly "good" level of 8.3 (8.3 out of a maximum of 10.0). During the COVID-19 period, the scores of responsiveness domains were highest at 8.66 to 8.93 in "confidentiality", "dignity" and "choice of providers", while lowest at 8.38 to 8.53 in "prompt attention", "social support" and "basic amenities". The representative responsiveness equality index (REI) was 0.732, indicating the moderately balanced distributions of responsiveness of the EMP in rural China. Female, old age, and low education were significantly related to the lower HSR scores of rural EMP (p < 0.05). The HSR of EMP in rural China was fairly good. However, measures to improve the patient-perceived HSR are still needed, especially including better service, higher social support, and more comfortable medical environments.

J	Siller, H; Aydin, N				Siller, Heidi; Aydin, Niluefer			Using an Intersectional Lens on Vulnerability and Resilience in Minority and/or Marginalized Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						COVID-19 pandemic; social inequality; resilience; vulnerability; intersectionality; narrative review	RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; HEALTH; RISK; COMPLEXITY; PRIVILEGE; TRAUMA; EPISTEMOLOGY; EXPERIENCES; INTEGRATION; KNOWLEDGE	Throughout the pandemic, the media and scholars have widely discussed increasing social inequality and thereby publicly pointed to often hidden and neglected forms of inequality. However, the "newly" arisen awareness has not yet been put into action to reduce this inequality. Dealing with social inequality implies exploring and confronting social privileges, which are often seen as the other side of inequality. These social constructs, inequality and privilege, are often discussed in light of vulnerability and resilience. This is particularly important in the context of the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to end the pandemic, as both constructs are discussed regarding access to healthcare, vaccination, and education and knowledge, misinformation, social resources, economic resources, and so forth. Minority and/or marginalized groups may be particularly vulnerable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, resilience factors in these groups may be neglected and underreported. This narrative review aims at illustrating the specific and intertwined aspects of resilience and vulnerability in minority and/or marginalized groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, we use an intersectional lens based on recommendations made by Moradi and Grzanka. A total of 48 articles were included in the narrative review. Most of them were commentaries focusing on social inequality, vulnerability, and/or resilience. Based on the dissection of articles at structural, systemic, and individual levels, we propose three hypothesis on vulnerability and resilience in minority and marginalized individuals and groups: (1) social inequality must be considered at a global level; inequality at a global level translates into a vulnerable context for an individual; (2) vulnerability is historically situated: vulnerability (experienced during the pandemic) is maintained and reinforced by history; (3) strength through collective (historical) hardship: vulnerability is not the opposite of resilience but may serve as an aspect of resilience. The conclusions drawn from this review show that we need to include diverse voices to advance concepts, such as vulnerability and resilience, in minority and marginalized groups. Additionally, these concepts are not necessarily in opposition to each other, but vulnerability should be understood as an integral part of resilience.

Various challenges highlighted by this pandemic include, but are not limited to, the need for global health cooperation and security, better crisis management, coordinated funding in public health emergencies, and access to measures related to prevention, treatment and control. This systematic review explores health, economic and social development issues in a COVID-19 pandemic context and aftermath. Accordingly, a methodology that focuses on identifying relevant literature with a focus on meta-analysis is used. A protocol with inclusion and exclusion criteria was developed, with articles from 15 December 2019 to 15 March 2022 included in the study. This was followed by a review and data analysis. The research results reveal that non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing, lockdown and quarantine have created long-term impacts on issues such as changes in production and consumption patterns, market crashes resulting in the closure of business operations, and the slowing down of the economy. COVID-19 has exposed huge health inequalities across most countries due to social stratification and unequal distribution of wealth and/or resources. People from lower socio-economic backgrounds lack access to essential healthcare services during this critical time for both COVID-19 and other non-COVID ailments. The review shows that there is minimal literature available with evidence and empirical backup; similarly, data/studies from all countries/regions are not available. We propose that there is a need to conduct empirical research employing a trans-disciplinary approach to develop the most effective and efficient strategies to combat the pandemic and its aftermath. There is a need to explore the social and ecological determinants of this contagious infection and develop strategies for the prevention and control of COVID-19 or similar infections in future.

We conducted a scoping review with a focus on measurement to assess the forms of measurement and study design utilized to explore the intersection of violence against women with disabilities, and to identify strengths and limitations in current approaches to measuring violence against women with disabilities. This scoping review is designed to inform current debates and discussions regarding how to generate evidence concerning violence against women with disabilities. Methods and results We conducted systematic searches of the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, PILOTS, ERIC, Social Work Abstracts, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Social Services Abstracts, ProQuest Criminal Justice, and Dissertations & Theses Global, and conducted structured searches of national statistics and surveys and grey literature available on-line. We identified 174 manuscripts or reports for inclusion. n = 113 manuscripts or reports utilized acts-specific measurement of violence. In terms of measurement of disability, we found that amongst the included manuscripts and reports, n = 75 utilized measures of functioning limitations (n = 20 of these were Washington Group questions), n = 15 utilized a single question approach and n = 67 defined participants in the research as having a disability based on a diagnosis or self-report of a health condition or impairment. Discussion This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of measurement of violence against women with disabilities and measurement of violence within disability-focused research. We identified several important gaps in the evidence, including lack of sex and disability disaggregation, limited evidence concerning adaptation of data collection methods to ensure accessibility of research activities for women with disabilities, and limited evidence concerning differential relationships between types of disability and violence exposure. This scoping review provides directions for sub-analyses of the included studies and further research to address gaps in evidence.

Widening of inequalities in COVID-19 years of life lost from 2020 to 2021: a Scottish Burden of Disease Study	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article						Health inequalities; COVID-19; PUBLIC HEALTH; MORTALITY	SCOTLAND; DALYS	Background Previous studies have highlighted the large extent of inequality in adverse COVID-19 health outcomes. Our aim was to monitor changes in overall, and inequalities in, COVID-19 years of life lost to premature mortality (YLL) in Scotland from 2020 and 2021. Methods Cause-specific COVID-19 mortality counts were derived at age group and area deprivation level using Scottish death registrations for 2020 and 2021. YLL was estimated by multiplying mortality counts by age-conditional life expectancy from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 reference life table. Various measures of absolute and relative inequality were estimated for triangulation purposes. Results There were marked inequalities in COVID-19 YLL by area deprivation in 2020, which were further exacerbated in 2021; confirmed across all measures of absolute and relative inequality. Half (51%) of COVID-19 YLL was attributable to inequalities in area deprivation in 2021, an increase from 41% in 2020. Conclusion Despite a highly impactful vaccination programme in preventing mortality, COVID-19 continues to represent a substantial area of fatal population health loss for which inequalities have widened. Tackling systemic inequalities with effective interventions is required to mitigate further unjust health loss in the Scottish population from COVID-19 and other causes of ill-health and mortality.

J	Du, MG; Zhao, SC				Du, Mengge; Zhao, Shichen			An Equity Evaluation on Accessibility of Primary Healthcare Facilities by Using V2SFCA Method: Taking Fukuoka City, Japan, as a Case Study	LAND			English	Article						primary healthcare facilities; V2SFCA; accessibility; variable catchments; spatial inequity	SPATIAL ACCESSIBILITY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ALLOCATION; ACCESS; DISPARITIES; INDICATORS; TRANSPORT; SERVICES	The primary healthcare facilities are among the most basic needs of the residents, huge in quantity and widespread. Their distributions are directly related to people's health, which affects the sustainable development of cities. The accessibility calculation of primary level healthcare facilities and the equity evaluation of accessibility from the perspective of medical service category and urban population is very important for the decision-making of layout and configuration but has been ignored for a long time. This study took the primary healthcare facilities of Fukuoka city in Japan as research objects; it first used the variable two-step floating catchment area (V2SFCA) method to calculate the healthcare catchment areas (HCAs) of medical service providers and the population catchment area (PCAs) of medical demand locations, and then obtained the accessibility to primary healthcare facilities. Finally, the spatial disparities of accessibility were evaluated from three aspects: overall space distribution by using Global and Local Moran's I, service quality, and the population to be served. The results showed that HCAs were from 500 m to 6400 m, PCAs ranged from 500 m to 3000 m, the use of variable catchments can improve the accuracy of accessibility assessment results; the accessibility of primary healthcare facilities was clustered and had significant spatial differences, which were high in urban center and low in suburban area; the obvious differences in the accessibility distribution characteristics of clinics in differential diagnosis and treatment departments led to different degrees of unsaturation in the types of medical services obtained by residents; although the elderly's demand for basic medical care was many times higher than that of other age groups, the accessibility in high-demand areas was generally low, and the situation in severely high-demand areas was more serious. This work puts forward a multi-dimensional realistic evaluation system for equality accessibility of primary healthcare facilities, providing the data support for the medical resources and facilities' allocation and the intensive land use.

This study aimed to inform the development of a resource use measurement (RUM) instrument and harmonized reference unit costs valid for multi-sectoral and multi-national cost assessments for mental health diseases as part of the European PECUNIA project. Methods An iterative, multi-methods approach was applied. Systematic literature reviews appended with national grey literature searches in six European countries were conducted to generate preliminary, literature-based, international, mental health-related service and resource use lists for all investigated sectors in 2018. As part of a multi-national expert survey, these lists were reviewed by 18 Austrian sector-specific experts regarding the clarity, relevance, comprehensiveness and availability in the Austrian context. Results Out of 295 items included in the preliminary, international, sector-specific lists (health and social care-201 items, criminal justice-35 items, education-39 items; patient, family and informal care-20 items), a total of 261 items and descriptions (88%) were considered clear by all experts. 42 items (14%) were considered not existing in Austria, and 111 items (38%) were prioritized regarding their relevance in the national context. Thirteen additional items (4%) were suggested to be added to accommodate for Austria-specific features of the individual sectors. Major typological difficulties based on item names were observed. Conclusions The identified country-specific variations and general typological bias and their potential contributions to service and resource use cost variations across countries and sectors call for further systematic investigation. Next, PECUNIA will develop internationally harmonized and comparable definitions of the listed items and their units of analysis based on a new conceptual multi-sectoral costing framework. The developed lists will require consolidation and further prioritization for the development of a patient-reported RUM instrument and consequent reference unit cost valuation.

JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article								Background The devastating health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a global response in the development of effective vaccines to fight the disease in an extraordinarily short time. Both the development and the production of these vaccines opened a path of hope, but the inequality in vaccine distribution raises great concerns about the possibility of effectively eradicating the virus. Methods It is particularly important to analyse the extent to which vaccines are equally distributed and investigate the possible effects of vaccine inequalities as well as its major drivers. For this purpose, this paper investigates the extent of equitable vaccine distribution using some well-known inequality measures and disentangles the main drivers of the share of vaccination. In addition, the paper analyses the relationship between the vaccination rate, the GDP growth, and the incidence of the coronavirus disease, with the aim of providing empirical evidence on existing relationships worldwide. Results Our findings show that the situation is more challenging in less developed countries, especially African countries, due to weak health systems and low rates of vaccination. Moreover, we find a positive relationship between the share of vaccinated individuals and GDP. Consequently, the poorest, least developed countries with a lower rate of vaccine uptake will experience lower GDP growth. Conclusions Vaccines and the vaccination process reveal the existing inequalities between countries and how they, in turn, impact the well-being of their citizens. People who live in less developed countries have a lower probability of being vaccinated, which translates into a greater probability of dying from COVID. Countries are seeing their economic future compromised by low vaccination levels, given the positive and significant relationship between the vaccination rate and GDP growth. In short, while some countries are trying to get back to some sort of normality, even with some pandemic protocols, the situation in less developed countries is more challenging due to weak health systems and low rates of vaccination. Consequently, the poorest, least developed countries with a lower rate of vaccine penetration will experience lower GDP growth, and the pandemic will have a greater effect on their economy due to low vaccination rates.

Racial Disparities in Climate Change-Related Health Effects in the United States	CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS			English	Review						Global warming; Environmental justice; Health disparities; Environmental racism; Health equity	EXTREME-HEAT; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; HURRICANE KATRINA; SAN-DIEGO; ASSOCIATION; VULNERABILITY; IMPACT; EVENTS; VISITS; EQUITY	Purpose of Review Climate change is causing warming over most parts of the USA and more extreme weather events. The health impacts of these changes are not experienced equally. We synthesize the recent evidence that climatic changes linked to global warming are having a disparate impact on the health of people of color, including children. Recent Findings Multiple studies of heat, extreme cold, hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires find evidence that people of color, including Black, Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander, and Asian communities are at higher risk of climate-related health impacts than Whites, although this is not always the case. Studies of adults have found evidence of racial disparities related to climatic changes with respect to mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular disease, mental health, and heat-related illness. Children are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change, and infants and children of color have experienced adverse perinatal outcomes, occupational heat stress, and increases in emergency department visits associated with extreme weather. The evidence strongly suggests climate change is an environmental injustice that is likely to exacerbate existing racial disparities across a broad range of health outcomes.

J	Arnaiz, BN				Nino Arnaiz, Borja			Should we open borders? Yes, but not in the name of global justice	ETHICS & GLOBAL POLITICS			English	Article						Open borders; global justice; freedom of movement; distributive justice; human mobility		Some proponents of global justice question that opening borders is an effective strategy to alleviate global poverty and reduce inequalities between countries. This article goes a step further and asks whether an open borders policy is compatible with the objectives of global distributive justice. The latter, it will be argued, entails the ordering of needs, the assignment of priorities and the preference or subordination of some interests over others. In other words, global justice requires the establishment of conditions and restrictions on mobility. On the contrary, open borders claim an unrestricted and unconditional (not unqualified) freedom of movement, limited only by public health considerations, serious threats to national security or democratic institutions, but not by an aspiration for maximizing global redistributive utility. The main point is that not only would freedom of movement be instrumentalized, losing its presumptive moral force, but ultimately open borders as a remedy of global justice are an oxymoron. The article concludes with an alternative defence of freedom of international movement.

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are important determinants of global cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. ARF is a multiorgan inflammatory disease that is triggered by GAS infection that activates the innate immune system. In susceptible hosts the response against GAS elicits autoimmune reactions targeting the heart, joints, brain, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. Repeated episodes of ARF-undetected, subclinical, or diagnosed-may progressively lead to RHD, unless prevented by periodic administration of penicillin. The recently modified Duckett Jones criteria with stratification by population risk remains relevant for the diagnosis of ARF and includes subclinical carditis detected by echocardiography as a major criterion. Chronic RHD is defined by valve regurgitation and/or stenosis that presents with complications such as arrhythmias, systemic embolism, infective endocarditis, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and death. RHD predominantly affects children, adolescents, and young adults in LMICs. National programs with compulsory notification of ARF/RHD are needed to highlight the role of GAS in the global burden of cardiovascular disease and to allow prioritisation of these diseases aimed at reducing health inequalities and to achieve universal health coverage.

IMF fairness: Calibrating the policies of the International Monetary Fund based on distributive justice	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Causal inference; Children; Health inequalities; International Monetary Fund; Policy studies; Social demography; Distributive justice; Algorithmic fairness; Public policy; Poverty; Governance; International organizations; Ethics	CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS; STRUCTURAL-ADJUSTMENT; INFANT-MORTALITY; PROGRAMS; EQUALITY; SCARCITY; POVERTY; IMPACT; DEPRIVATION; GOVERNANCE	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides financial assistance to its member countries in economic difficulties but at the same time requires these countries to reform public policies. In several contexts, these reforms have been at odds with population health and material living standards. While researchers have empirically analyzed the consequences of IMF reforms on health, no analysis has yet identified under what conditions tradeoffs between consequences for populations and economic outcomes would be fair and acceptable. Our article analyzes and identifies five principles to govern such tradeoffs and thus define IMF fairness. The article first reviews existing policy-evaluation studies, which on balance show that IMF policies, in their pursuit of macroeconomic improvement, frequently produce adverse effects on children's health and material living standards. Secondly, the article discusses four theories from distributive ethics-maximization, egalitarianism, prioritarianism, and sufficientarianism-to identify which is most compatible with the IMF's core mission of improving macroeconomic conditions, while at the same time balancing the consequences for population outcomes. Using a distributive justice analysis of IMF policies, we argue that sufficientarianism constitutes the most compatible theory. Thirdly, the article formalizes IMF fairness in the language of causal inference. It also supplies a framework for empirically measuring the extent to which IMF policies fulfill the criteria of IMF fairness, using observational data.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The community-based Mbereko+Men program in rural Zimbabwe engaged women and men in complementary activities to improve men's support for women and babies, coparents' equitable, informed health decision-making, and ultimately, maternal mental health and care-seeking for maternal and newborn health services. The study aimed to test the effectiveness of the Mbereko+Men program on maternal mental health at 0-6 months after childbirth. Methods We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled pragmatic trial using a two-arm parallel design with four clusters per arm. Data was data collected through cross-sectional surveys before and after the implementation of the intervention or standard care. Rural health facility catchments in Mutasa District, Zimbabwe, were randomised using a true random number sequence. Survey participants were women who had given birth within 0-6 months and their male coparents. The primary outcome was women's mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score. Secondary outcomes captured care-seeking, men's supportive behaviours, and gender dynamics in coparent relationships. Masking was not used. All clusters were included in the analysis. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12620001014943) in October 2020. Results Between April 13 and May 20, 2016, 457 women and 242 men participated in the pre-intervention survey; between October 19 and November 30, 2017, 433 women and 273 men participated in the post-intervention survey. Women's mean EPDS scores declined in both arms. The decline was 34% greater in the intervention arm (adjusted risk ratio = 0.66; 95% confidence interval = 0.48, 0.90, P = 0.008). Improvements in care-seeking, men's support, and coparents' relationships were detected. Conclusions A low-intensity gender-synchronised intervention engaged women and men to improve maternal mental health and care-seeking in a setting characterised by gender inequality and demand-side barriers to care.

This study was conducted in partnership with International Care Ministries (ICM), a Philippine-based non-governmental organization that runs the "Transform" poverty alleviation program. The main objective of this study was to describe the changes in COVID-19 KAPs among households expe-riencing extreme poverty in the Philippines over an 8-month period. Methods A KAP questionnaire was integrated into the household survey col-lected as part of ICM's regular monitoring and evaluation of "Transform". Data collection for the first survey was conducted between February 20 and March 13, 2020, and the second survey was conducted between November 12 and De-cember 12, 2020. Frequencies and proportions were calculated to describe the respondents' responses and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess if there were significant differences in KAP identification between the two time points. Results We observed a distinct increase across all KAP domains. Over 90% of study participants were able to correctly identify COVID-19 transmission modes and preventive measures, and an even higher percentage reported adopting these measures. However, the intention to seek care from public hospitals for COVID-19 symptoms dropped from 43.6% to 28.4%, while reports of self-treat-ment using stored medicines or antibiotics increased. Trust in community mem-bers and local health authorities was correlated with higher knowledge and prac-tice scores. Conclusions Our study results reflect the extraordinary speed of information dissemination and behaviour change globally over the course of the pandemic, but they also highlight the changes in KAP that show the additional challenges faced by populations experiencing poverty in the Philippines. Prioritization of reducing inequities in the implementation and adoption of the evolving public health measures will be integral as the pandemic continues.

Unlocking sociocultural and community factors for the global adoption of genomic medicine	ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES			English	Article						Sociocultural factors; Diagnosis; Equity; Genomic medicine; Genomic sequencing; Rare disease		Advances in genomic sequencing and genetic testing are increasingly transforming the diagnosis and treatment of diseases-specifically, rare diseases. However, the application and benefit of such technologies remain inequitable globally. There is a clear and urgent need to provide genomic sequencing to people across the global population, including people living in under-resourced areas and/or underrepresented populations. Financial considerations are the most obvious barriers to the adoption of genomic medicine, yet there are many other factors that are not so obvious, such as geography, language, communication, and culture. Herein, we use the lens of rare diseases and focus on firstly, selected socio-cultural factors, and in particular stigma; and secondly, empowering community factors such as education, advocacy and connectivity amongst people living with rare diseases globally. These are critical areas of need and opportunity if genomic medicine is to achieve equitable and global adoption in the patient best-interest across low- middle- and high-income country health systems. Furthermore, we touch on specific child health aspects and how they can point towards opportunities to build on specific infrastructures.

J	Taylor, B; Nunes, R				Taylor, Brigid; Nunes, Richard			Entitlement, Indeterminacy and Professional Discretion in Urban Planning: Problematising a Child's Right to Clean Air for Play in London	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						air quality; play space; planning; rights; children	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; LUNG-FUNCTION; POLLUTION; PARTICIPATION; POLLUTANTS; CITIES	The interaction between air quality and play space receives less focus in planning than it has in public health and environmental sciences research. In this paper, seven local planning authorities of inner London (UK) were sampled from the 10 boroughs with the worst air quality in parks. Greenwich, with significantly better air quality, was included for comparison. The selected authorities were validated against deprivation data, ensuring variance in socio-economic terms. Across this sample, 21 major residential planning applications were assessed, alongside a document analysis of planning policy documents for each authority. Lastly, five semi-structured interviews with different practitioners collectively provided multi-disciplinary perspectives on the planning processes across the sample. Despite the national government having conferred children a right to leisure space and a healthy environment via international conventions, the English planning system, as an institutional rights framework, is not consistently prioritising the delivery of children's play space nor delivering play space where the air quality has been robustly assessed. In other words, such rights have been subjugated to other priorities in limited urban space in London. Therefore, a discretionary planning system does not preclude individual human rights from becoming disadvantaged under democratically controlled decision-making processes.

In the context of public healthcare, nursing professionals play an important role. Objective The aim of this study was to determine awareness, information, and beliefs regarding gender violence in adolescents and identify their educational needs. Participants and Setting Data from a study conducted by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research and the Government Office for Gender Violence in 2013 are used. The sample contained 698 adolescents aged 15-19 years. Methods This is a secondary analysis of a data survey. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines are followed. Sociodemographic variables and seven topics of interest were analyzed: gender inequality, intimate relationships, definition of abuse, identification of abuse, awareness of cases of abuse in women, and informal and formal support networks. Results The results show that adolescents are well informed, are aware of informal and formal support networks, use the word "respect," identify abuse and consider it unacceptable, and believe media coverage is useful in giving visibility to gender violence. No significant differences were found in gender, social class, or education, and their idea of romantic love remains intact. Conclusions The researchers conclude that, in Spain, adolescents' awareness of gender violence is strongly influenced by environmental and cultural factors, because of the prevalence of gender and intimate partner violence in the country. Formal interventions such as health education provided by either nursing professionals in schools or the broader community can have a positive effect on adolescent health. Primary care nurses should use these findings to support the development of health promotion programs for young adults.

A questionnaire survey of members of national societies through EBCOG and EAPM was carried out in 2021. A total of 53 responses were received from 26 countries. Most countries reported that routine antenatal care is primarily delivered by medical staff, involving obstetric specialists or family doctors mostly in government-run facilities. Women from minority groups are able to access antenatal care easily in most countries. Less than 10% of women did not attend antenatal care throughout the pregnancy. Most booking for antenatal care takes place in the first trimester and the number of visits range from 6 to 10 depending on parity. Most countries provide routine ultrasound with 2-3 reported scans performed by specifically trained health care professionals. Facilities for prenatal screening/diagnosis of malformations in both low-and high-risk cases varied across Europe. While antenatal care is relatively standardized throughout Europe, important differences still exist in care delivery and accessibility to care. Antenatal preventive strategies appear to be variably available throughout Europe.

J	Corte-Real, A; Nunes, T; da Cunha, PR				Corte-Real, Ana; Nunes, Tiago; da Cunha, Paulo Rupino			Blockchain technology in migrant and refugee health - A scoping review	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Review						Professor; low transportation costs; economic pressures; demographic trends; environmental degrada-		Background The increase of forcibly displaced people worldwide is a challenge for health systems and their ability to provide access and equity in Health as a universal right. In the case of migrants and refugees, their journey exacerbates this challenge, as they go through diverse countries, camps, and humanitarian teams. Hence, the collection and analysis of health data are essential in providing quality care. The scientific community has been studying health digital technologies to answer health data consolidation, transparency, and global surveillance efficiency issues. Observing some empirical experiments with Blockchain in migrants and refugee health, we assessed the state-of-the-art by conducting a literature review. Methods Blockchain applications are still emerging, which means that peer-reviewed literature may still be scarce in life science databases. Therefore, to gather the most appropriate available evidence, we used a diverse and balanced set of databases that compile articles and journals from different fields. We used a multi-step scoping review to refine search keywords and analyse the literature. We included studies between 2008 and 2021 that reported value, utility, or use cases of Blockchain in support of migrant and refugee health. Results We identified a total of 69 articles, with 22 retained for full-text analysis and 8 of those being relevant. We employed Rayyan application to manage and evaluate the references by two researchers working independently. We identified two main uses of Blockchain technology to support migrant and refugee health: mitigate the lack of personal identification and make health records available. Blockchain also promotes data reliability in humanitarian aid, academic certificates, legal contracts, and financial transactions. Conclusions The availability of reliable information about individuals facilitates universal health coverage, improves cooperation between diaspora-related countries, and supports global health efficiency in line with the third goal of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda. Given its characteristics of decentralization, resilience, transparency, and auditability, Blockchain remains a promising avenue for future research in migrant and refugee health.

The community of practice (CoP) has been described as a method of facilitating much-needed connections and conversations on this topic and has been adapted over time to include virtual CoPs. We describe the development and evaluation of a global Clinical Lead Forum (CLF) using a CoP framework to structure informal continuing professional development (CPD) and enhance the capacity of health care professionals in low-and middle-income countries. Methods Baylor College of Medicine International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI) and its network of affiliated, independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) provide paediatric and maternal health care for vulnerable populations around the world. We established virtual sessions across the network to discuss clinical topics, which evolved based on the need to include a COVID-19 series. We collected demographic, participation, participant and facilitator assessments, as well as leadership notes from each session as part of an educational quality improvement study. We developed and evaluated the program using the Logic Model and used the Kirkpatrick Model to assess learning outcomes. Results A total of 299 unique participants engaged in sessions, representing a total of 10 disciplines. There were a total of 1295 participants who joined for the 11 sessions in the regular CLF series and the 23 sessions in the COVID-19 series. Survey responses were overall consistent with a value-added intervention. Conclusions The CLF, via both the regular sessions and the COVID-19 series, served as an impactful global health CoP for CPD. By focusing on creating a safe and inviting space, ensuring equity and inclusion, activating champions, fostering engagement, and promoting innovation and adaptability, this program decreased professional isolation, strengthened peer relationships, and enhanced the knowledge and practices of health care professionals. Our model may be scaled to other systems across the world to bridge divides and create similarly meaningful communities.

This article shares the lessons from our multi-country project Safe, Inclusive Participative Pedagogy: Improving Early Childhood Education in Fragile Contexts (UKRI GCRF) on how children in communities in Brazil, Eswatini, South Africa, and Scotland have experienced the effects of the pandemic. This article benefits from having co-authors from various countries, bringing their own located knowledge to considerations of children's rights and early childhood education in the wake of the pandemic. The authors discuss different perspectives on children's human rights within historical, social, and cultural contexts and, by doing so, will discuss how the global pandemic has placed a spotlight on the previous inequalities within early years education and how the disparity of those with capital (economic and social) have led to an even greater disproportion of children needing health and educational support.

J	Lima, MRP; McCallum, CA; Menezes, GMD				Lima, Mariana Ramos Pitta; McCallum, Cecilia Anne; Menezes, Greice Maria de Souza			Gynecological and obstetrical violence, biomedical technologies and abortion care in a public maternity ward in North-East Brazil	SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article						Abortion; Biomedical technologies; Obstetric violence; Post abortion care; Brazil	UNIFIED HEALTH SYSTEM; CHILD HEALTH; SALVADOR	Introduction: Brazilian legislation restricts the practice of abortion. In Brazil, abortion is a major public health problem due to the morbidity, mortality and hospitalization caused by the practice of unsafe abortions. Complications related to induced abortion and miscarriages are treated in "maternity wards, "where obstetric violence can be perpetrated. Purpose of research: To analyse, based on ethnographic data, the practices of biomedical technologies and their relation to practices of gynecological and obstetrical violence. Results: Three main practices are systematized for didactic purposes: treatment of complications from abortion in maternity wards; ultrasound; and curettage. Despite the existence of national standards - due to the advances of the brazilian health and feminist movement - and international standards, there is still institutional resistance to the adoption of practices that prioritize women's well-being. Conclusions: The way in which the ward is organized and materialized and the adoption of certain practices and technologies (and the omission of others) contribute to reproducing obstetric violence. The daily practices in the hospital do not escape the moralization of abortion, and the strong economic, racial and gender inequalities that go beyond the institutional space of the hospital. The analysis allows us to understand that the practice of biomedical technologies shapes and is shaped in a symbolic and situated way and can serve as an instrument for practices of embodied violence. Finally, it is necessary to review the model of post-abortion care.

Inequality fell in health and education since the late 1920s, due to the globalization of mass schooling and the diffusion of the health transition, but only dropped in population-weighted terms from 1970 onward for political and civil liberties, as the emergence of authoritarian regimes increased its dispersion since the end of World War I. In terms of augmented human development inequality declined since 1900. These results are at odds with per capita income inequality that rose over time and only shrank from 1990 onward. The gap between the OECD and the Rest of the world accounted only partially for inequality in well-being since the dispersion within developing regions became its main driver from the mid-20th century onward. Countries in the middle and lower deciles of the world distribution achieved the largest relative gain over the past century.

Climate to COVID, global to local, policies to people: a biopsychosocial ecological framework for syndemic prevention and response in behavioral medicine	TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Climate change; COVID-19; Syndemic; Biopsychosocial ecology; Obesity; Diet	MENTAL-HEALTH; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; OBESITY; CAPACITY; INSIGHTS; DISEASE; IMPACT; THREAT	We face a crisis of interconnected environmental and human health problems rooted in policies, behaviors, and social inequalities that behavioral medicine can address with ecological and community-based approaches. Land development, pollution, and waste have affected natural environments, contributing to hurricanes, wildfires, and pandemic infectious diseases like COVID-19. Globalized corporate food systems that produce ultra-refined foods with low nutritional value contribute to both environmental conditions and health conditions like obesity and undernutrition. This has the greatest impact on communities already suffering from elevated health risks driven by economic inequities rooted in racism. These interacting environmental, health, and social conditions represent a syndemic. We outline practical suggestions to address this syndemic of environmental degradation, pandemic infectious disease, chronic disease, undernutrition, and inequity through research and practice at many levels, including individual behavior, local communities, and regional, national and global policy. Collaboration with communities is central to simultaneously tackling interconnected human and environmental health threats. For example, community-led groups have increased access to healthy food in response to pandemic conditions. Building on behavioral medicine's rich foundation of ecological models, communities have partnered with local researchers to address the needs of equitable public transport and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through multilevel research and practice. Policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and community members should collaborate with each other and across disciplines to find lasting, multiduty solutions to improve physical, psychosocial, and planetary health.

It has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization and leading researchers from academic institutions around the globe. Structural racism disproportionately exposes communities targeted for marginalization to the harmful consequences of climate change through greater risk of exposure and sensitivity to climate hazards and less adaptive capacity to the health threats of climate change. Given its interdisciplinary approach to integrating behavioral, psychosocial, and biomedical knowledge, the discipline of behavioral medicine is uniquely qualified to address the systemic causes of climate change-related health inequities and can offer a perspective that is currently missing from many climate and health equity efforts. In this article, we summarize relevant concepts, describe how climate change and structural racism intersect to exacerbate health inequities, and recommend six strategies with the greatest potential for addressing climate-related health inequities.

The aim of this exploratory study was to review employment-related determinants of health and health protection during the pandemic, or more specifically, to examine several links between non-standard employment, unemployment, economic, health, and safety outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden, Belgium, Spain, Canada, the United States, and Chile, based on an online survey conducted from November 2020 to June 2021. The study focused on both non-standard workers and unemployed workers and examined worker outcomes in the context of current type and duration of employment arrangements, as well as employment transitions triggered by the COVID-19 crisis. The results suggest that COVID-19-related changes in non-standard worker employment arrangements, or unemployment, are related to changes in work hours, income, and benefits, as well as the self-reported prevalence of suffering from severe to extreme anxiety or depression. The results also suggest a link between worker type, duration of employment arrangements, or unemployment, and the ability to cover regular expenses during the pandemic. Additionally, the findings indicate that the type and duration of employment arrangements are related to the provision of personal protective equipment or other COVID-19 protection measures. This study provides additional evidence that workers in non-standard employment and the unemployed have experienced numerous and complex adverse effects of the pandemic and require additional protection through tailored pandemic responses and recovery strategies.

Pathways between Social Capital and Oral Health from Childhood to Adolescence	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						child; dental caries; quality of life; social factors; risk factors; cohort studies	DENTAL-CARIES; INEQUALITIES; POSITION; NETWORK	This study aimed to evaluate the theoretical pathways by which social capital can influence dental caries and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of children over time. This 10-y prospective cohort started in 2010 with a sample of 639 preschoolers aged 1 to 5 y from the southern Brazil. Community and individual social capital were assessed at baseline through the presence of formal institutions in the neighborhood and social networks, respectively. In the 10-y follow-up, the individual social capital was evaluated by social trust and social networks. Dental caries was measured by the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS), and the short version of the Child Perception Questionnaire (CPQ11-14) was used to assess OHRQoL. Demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral (frequency of toothbrushing and use of dental services), and psychosocial (sense of coherence) characteristics were also assessed. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the associations between variables over time. About 429 children were reassessed at 10-y follow-up (67.1% cohort retention rate). High community social capital at baseline directly predicted lower occurrence of dental caries and better OHRQoL after 10 y. Social capital at community level also indirectly predicted lower occurrence of dental caries through sense of coherence, frequency of toothbrushing, and use of dental services. Individual social capital at follow-up was indirectly linked to OHRQoL via the psychosocial pathway (sense of coherence). Community-level social capital was associated with dental caries and OHRQoL over time. The relationship between individual social capital and oral health was mediated through the psychosocial pathway.	[Knorst, J. K.; Ardenghi, T.

By analysing policy reports from national and international agencies, this document focuses on three themes: (i) the Digital Divide and Education; (ii) new home spaces, Internet Dangers, and Domestic Violence, and (iii) Hunger and Malnutrition in COVID-19 times. The views expressed in this document emerged from the author reflections and experiences and consider cultural and political perspectives of the analysed context to interpret the meaning of the themes. This document emphasizes how events during the pandemic have accentuated pre-existent social inequalities in the country (e.g. infant poverty and malnutrition, socioeconomic gaps in access to digital connectivity) that negatively affect the physical, cognitive, and emotional development of children.

Even in resource-rich TB low-incidence settings, we need more focus on the role of social risk factors to end the TB epidemic. Methods Nationwide, retrospective register-based, case-control study from 1990 to 2018, including all TB patients in Denmark >= 18 years old (n = 9581) matched 1:3 on sex and age with population controls. TB risk factors were assessed in logistic regression models and estimated by odds ratio (OR). Results All TB patients had considerably lower socio-economic status compared with controls (P < 0.0001). Among ethnic Danes, TB was mostly found among males, persons between 35 and 65 years, those living alone, those with low educational level, persons on social welfare benefits and those with low income. Conversely, for migrants, being younger, sex and living alone were less important, whereas having children was protective. In an adjusted multivariable regression model among Danes, key risk factors for TB were being on disability pension (OR = 2.7) and cash benefits (OR = 4.7). For migrants, fewer social risk factors increased TB risk, although low income and cash benefits did (OR = 3.1). Conclusion Even today in a resourceful setting, socio-economic status drives disparities in health. In our study, multifactorial social deprivation was highly associated with TB. Especially household structure, education, employment and income were important risk factors that should be addressed in the future to accelerate TB control and end the TB epidemic.

Assessing Socio-Spatial Relationships Between Air Quality Perceptions and Exposures in Southern Chile	APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY			English	Article						Public perception; Air pollution; Chile; Environmental justice; PM2 5	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ANALYSIS; POLLUTION EXPOSURE; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; RISK PERCEPTION; HEALTH-RISKS; URBAN; COMMUNITY; BURDEN; EXPERIENCE; SYMPTOMS	An extensive body of research has been noted that many socially deprived communities tend to live in areas characterized by higher levels of outdoor air pollution. Whilst there is an expanding literature documenting this disproportionate distribution, most previous studies have taken place in the Global North, have focused with industrial or vehicle air pollution sources and have tend to ignore the complex interactions between exposures, public perceptions and social factors. In this paper, we investigate the social vulnerability to and risk perceptions of air pollution sourced from domestic heating in two Chilean cities with particularly high levels of PM2.5 during winter months. To this end, we integrate primary survey data, with geographically detailed estimates of air pollution exposures and area-level characteristics obtained from the Chilean Census. We first examine the spatial distribution of PM2.5 exposures and air quality perceptions, and subsequently explore relationships between socio-demographic characteristics, air pollution exposure, and health concerns. Our results revel evident spatial patterns of dispersion, with some neighborhoods being more polluted than others. Age and percentage of roofs in poor condition in the participant's census tract are the best predictors of PM2.5 exposure. We find no correlation between perceived and real levels of contamination. Our multivariate analysis indicates that personal perceptions of air quality are significantly associated with age, gender, family structure, and heating behaviors. Such detailed depictions provide insights into potential meaningful strategies to improve air quality and highlight the need to incorporate measures to better protect older adults.

Research approaches have changed too, with increasing use of remote data collection methods. These multiple changes necessitate new or adapted safeguarding responses. This practice piece shares practical learnings and resources on safeguarding from the Accountability for Informal Urban Equity hub, which uses participatory action research, aiming to catalyse change in approaches to enhancing accountability and improving the health and well-being of marginalised people living and working in informal urban spaces in Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Sierra Leone. We outline three new challenges that emerged in the context of the pandemic (1): exacerbated relational vulnerabilities and dilemmas for researchers in responding to increased reports of different forms of violence coupled with support services that were limited prior to the pandemic becoming barely functional or non-existent in some research sites, (2) the increased use of virtual and remote research methods, with implications for safeguarding and (3) new stress, anxiety and vulnerabilities experienced by researchers. We then outline our learning and recommended action points for addressing emerging challenges, linking practice to the mnemonic 'the four Rs: recognise, respond, report, refer'. COVID-19 has intensified safeguarding risks. We stress the importance of communities, researchers and co-researchers engaging in dialogue and ongoing discussions of power and positionality, which are important to foster co-learning and co-production of safeguarding processes.

Although bullying and oral health have always been a topic of concern, there is limited information regarding the impact of this problem on the general population, with no evidence in this regard among the Australian Indigenous population. Thus, we aimed to quantify the relationship between bullying victimization and oral health problems by remoteness among 766 Australian Indigenous children aged between 10-15-years using data from the LSIC study. Bivariate and multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression analyses were employed. Findings indicated children self-reported bullying more than parents reported their children were being bullied (44% vs. 33.6%), with a higher percentage from rural/remote areas than urban areas. Parents reported that oral health problems increased the probability (OR 2.20, p < 0.05) of being bullied, in Indigenous children living in urban areas. Racial discrimination, lower level of parental education and poor child oral hygiene increase the risk of bullying victimization. Parental happiness with life and a safe community were associated with a lower risk of bullying. Dental problems are linked with Australian Indigenous children experiencing bullying victimization. Cultural resilience and eliminating discrimination may be two modifiable paths to ameliorating health issues associated with bullying in the Australian Indigenous community.

No more unimplementable nurse workforce planning	CONTEMPORARY NURSE			English	Article						mathematical programming; optimisation; decision-making; optimal safe staffing; nurse scheduling; nursing workforce; social justice	OUTCOMES	Objective: This paper aims to spur thought-provoking practical debates on current nurse workforce staffing and scheduling systems in relation to a critical review of Ang and colleagues' (2018) article entitled "Nurse workforce scheduling in the emergency department: A sequential decision support system considering multiple objectives." Design: Discussion paper on a practical discourse in connection with the aforementioned published article. Discussion: Mathematical Programming (optimisation) (MP)-based nursing research has been published for nearly thirty years almost exclusively in industrial engineering or health business administration journals, demonstrating a widening gap between nursing research and practice. Nurse scientists' knowledge and skill of MP is insufficient, as are their interdisciplinary collaborations, setting back the advancement of nursing science. Above all, nurse scientists skilled in decision science are desperately needed for that analytic intellection which is rooted in the 'intrinsic nature and value of nursing care.' It is imperative that nurse scientists be well-prepared for the new age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution through both an education in MP and interdisciplinary collaboration with decision science experts in order to prevent potential stereotyped MP-based algorithm-driven destructive influences. Conclusions: The current global nursing shortage makes optimal nursing workforce staffing and scheduling more important. MP helps nurse executives and leaders to ensure the most efficient number of nurses with the most effective composition of nurse staffing at the right time for a reasonable cost. Nurse scientists urgently need to produce a new nursing knowledge base that is directly implementable in nursing practice. Impact Statement: Nurse scientists should take the leading role in producing the mathematical programming-integrated knowledge base that is directly implementable in practice.

This comes at a time when unequal living conditions and global disparities in response and recovery have been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and recent large impact trials have delivered mostly disappointing results suggesting the need for radically more effective interventions to improve global public health. We find ourselves at an inflection point in global WASH with an opportunity to build new approaches with potentially more equitable, cost-effective, and scalable solutions. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is an important and innovative tool for WASH advances. Yet, the use of mHealth has not been equally distributed in terms of its benefits nor is its impact guaranteed. In resource-constrained settings, where technology can increase inequalities, special attention should be paid to structural and systemic hierarchies during the development of mHealth programs along with the acknowledgment and understanding of how these systems can reinforce the systematic exclusion of those most vulnerable. The WASH sector needs to adapt to a future that is innovative and inclusive with a commitment to rethinking the resources needed to enhance scope and impact. We highlight urban sanitation in Brazil as a case study to demonstrate that mHealth can support and enhance publicly funded infrastructure and to help reimagine WASH for postpandemic and beyond.

The University of Minnesota has offered a global pediatrics track to residents since 2005. This study aimed to understand the impacts of a global pediatrics track on graduates' career choices, skills, and current engagement in global health. An electronic survey was sent to 110 track graduates in February to April 2020. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. Content analysis of written comments was conducted. The response rate was 62% overall, varying by question. Overall, 75% of responding graduates reported global pediatrics track participation affected their career choices. Eighty-four percent recalled plans to work in global health after graduation and 64% of respondents reported working in global health abroad or at home at the time of the survey. Incorporation of public health and global research represented the greatest percentage change in career plans from the time of enrollment to graduation (24% and 27%, respectively). Ninety-five percent of respondents reported that track participation improved their ability to elicit information about cultural beliefs and practices, and 86% reported improvement in cost-conscious care. An increase in global health knowledge and skills was the most common category of impact cited by respondents. Neonatal resuscitation, bubble continuous positive airway pressure, and homemade spacers for metered-dose inhalers were the most used global health-adapted skills. Our study found that graduates of the global pediatrics track perceive their participation affected their knowledge, skills, and attitudes positively, with the potential to improve clinical care and promote health equity locally and globally.

Perceptions of the Coronavirus and COVID-19 testing and vaccination in Latinx and Indigenous Mexican immigrant communities in the Eastern Coachella Valley	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						COVID-19; Health disparities; Immigrant health; Latinx; Community-based participatory research; Indigenous Mexicans	HEALTH	Background A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (known as COVID-19), spread rapidly around the world, affecting all and creating an ongoing global pandemic. Across the United States, Latinx and Indigenous populations have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 cases and death rates. An examination of the perceptions and beliefs about the spread of the virus, COVID-19 testing, and vaccination amongst racial-ethnic minority groups, specifically Latinx and Indigenous Latin American immigrant communities, is needed to alleviate the widespread disparity in new cases and deaths. Methods This study was carried out from August 2020 to January 2021 and used community-based participatory research to engage community partners and build the capacity of community health workers (i.e., promotores de salud) and pre-medical and medical students in conducting qualitative research. The objective of the study was to examine the structural and social determinants of health on perceptions of the coronavirus, its spread, and decisions around COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Data collection included ethnography involving observations in public settings and focus groups with members of Latinx and Indigenous Mexican farm-working communities in the Eastern Coachella Valley, located in the Inland Southern California desert region. A total of seven focus groups, six in Spanish and one in Purepecha, with a total of 55 participants were conducted. Topics covered include perceptions of the coronavirus and its spread, as well as COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Results Using theme identification techniques, the findings identify structural and social factors that underly perceptions held by Latinx and Indigenous Mexican immigrants about the virus and COVID-19, which, in turn, shape attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Common themes that emerged across focus groups include misinformation, lack of trust in institutions, and insecurity around employment and residency. Conclusions This immigrant population is structurally vulnerable to historical and present-day inequalities that put them at increased risk of COVID-19 exposure, morbidity, and mortality. Study findings indicate a significant need for interventions that decrease structural vulnerabilities by addressing issues of (dis)trust in government and public health among this population.

Exploring potential for occupational therapy practice models within areas of social deprivation: A qualitative inquiry within a community-centred food cooperative	BRITISH JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY			English	Article						Collective occupation; foodbanks; occupational injustice; qualitative; health inequalities	JUSTICE	Background A health inequalities gap exists between wealthy and deprived areas. Community-level occupation-focused interventions may support citizens and address inequities within their environments. Since the global financial crash of 2008 and fiscal policy changes within the United Kingdom, there has been a rise in food insecurity. Community volunteer initiatives have responded by providing for their residents. The aim of this study was to explore how occupational therapists may be agents for social change through exploring perspectives of members and volunteers from a community food cooperative in an area of social deprivation. Methods Eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with cooperative members and volunteers within a food cooperative established to address food insecurity in a local community. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results We found three main themes: It's Not a Foodbank, Shared Hardship and a cross-cutting theme of Community. The results suggest occupation-focused responses can support the development of community and collective occupations thereby contributing solutions to shared problems. Conclusion A community-centred, rights-based approach has supported local community need where socio-economic disadvantage and health inequalities were identified. Scope exists for occupational therapists to work genuinely with (not for) communities to address occupational injustice through collective occupation.

Facing the future of substance use disorders treatment in Vietnam-A case study for international development and cooperation	JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT			English	Article						SUD; Substance use disorder; Treatment; Health policy; International development	HIV	Vietnam made progress transitioning from a criminal justice to a health treatment response for substance use disorders (SUD) in recent years. This case study describes the evolution of Vietnam's SUD treatment system from 2005 to 2020 to understand and learn from the phases of its development. The case study is based on data from a predesigned interview guide for 47 respondents, literature and policy desk review and direct experience of the authors. Vietnam saw remarkable growth of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment from 2005 when methadone was unavailable, to 2020 with 335 methadone clinics in all 63 provinces serving more than 52,200 patients. The growth in OUD treatment accounts for much of Vietnam's success managing its HIV epidemic for which injection drug use was a major vector. An unintended consequence, however, focused only on OUD as a strategy to address HIV and was unable to address multiple substances. Most elements of a modern evidence and community-based SUD treatment system exist in Vietnam; however, they are siloed and influenced by multiple government administrative jurisdictions. Faced with rising amphetamine and persistent alcohol use, the path ahead for Vietnam involves a choice between a reliance on compulsory rehabilitation centers or a plan to broaden the scope of substances and treatments, and further integrate with Vietnam's commune-based primary health system.

Previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study showed wide variation in injury death and disability adjusted life year (DALY) rates across Europe, indicating injury inequality gaps between sub-regions and countries. The objectives of this study were to: 1) compare GBD 2019 estimates on injury mortality and DALYs across European sub-regions and countries by cause-of-injury category and sex; 2) examine changes in injury DALY rates over a 20 year-period by cause-of-injury category, sub-region and country; and 3) assess inequalities in injury mortality and DALY rates across the countries. Methods We performed a secondary database descriptive study using the GBD 2019 results on injuries in 44 European countries from 2000 to 2019. Inequality in DALY rates between these countries was assessed by calculating the DALY rate ratio between the highest-ranking country and lowest-ranking country in each year. Results In 2019, in Eastern Europe 80 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 71 to 89] people per 100,000 died from injuries; twice as high compared to Central Europe (38 injury deaths per 100,000; 95% UI 34 to 42) and three times as high compared to Western Europe (27 injury deaths per 100,000; 95%UI 25 to 28). The injury DALY rates showed less pronounced differences between Eastern (5129 DALYs per 100,000; 95% UI: 4547 to 5864), Central (2940 DALYs per 100,000; 95% UI: 2452 to 3546) and Western Europe (1782 DALYs per 100,000; 95% UI: 1523 to 2115). Injury DALY rate was lowest in Italy (1489 DALYs per 100,000) and highest in Ukraine (5553 DALYs per 100,000). The difference in injury DALY rates by country was larger for males compared to females. The DALY rate ratio was highest in 2005, with DALY rate in the lowest-ranking country (Russian Federation) 6.0 times higher compared to the highest-ranking country (Malta). After 2005, the DALY rate ratio between the lowest- and the highest-ranking country gradually decreased to 3.7 in 2019. Conclusions Injury mortality and DALY rates were highest in Eastern Europe and lowest in Western Europe, although differences in injury DALY rates declined rapidly, particularly in the past decade. The injury DALY rate ratio of highest- and lowest-ranking country declined from 2005 onwards, indicating declining inequalities in injuries between European countries.

Health Equity in Pediatric Drug Development: Translating Aspiration into Operation	THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION & REGULATORY SCIENCE			English	Review						Child; Adolescent; Drug development; Stakeholders; Engagement; Health equity; Access	ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; CLINICAL-TRIALS; CONSENT BIAS; CHILDREN; PROGRESS; SCIENCE; PEOPLE; YOUTH; CARE	The concept of health equity-the attainment of the highest possible level of health for all members of society-requires equitable access to all aspects of healthcare, including pediatric drug development. However, many communities are under-represented in pediatric drug development programs. Barriers to participation include geographic, economic, racial/ethnic bias, legal, cultural, linguistic, and other factors. While there is no "one size fits all" approach to addressing these barriers, community engagement and collaboration is recognized by the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, and other global health organizations as a cornerstone for building a more equitable healthcare system. In this article, we will present case studies of stakeholder and community engagement in clinical research for rare diseases and other areas of healthcare, as examples of strategies and practices for actively involving under-represented communities and fostering their participation in pediatric drug development programs. These studies may serve as templates for facilitating equity in pediatric drug development from aspiration into operation.

Further, the country has enshrined equity as a core value in their strategic and development frameworks and policies. Although national statistics show improved health outcomes, there exists persistent inequities in avoidable health risks and premature deaths. Additionally, the improving health statistics mask the disparities in health outcomes based on education, employment status, income level, gender and ethnicity dimensions. The EquiFrame framework was used to assess the extent to which equity was entrenched in MNCH health policies and plans. The framework, which describes core concepts against which health policies and plans can be assessed, also provides a scoring criterion for policy assessment. The framework was modified to include the concept of intersectionality, which is increasingly gaining significance in the health policy ecosystems. The policies and plans reviewed in this analysis exercise were selected based on (1) their relevance - only policies and plans in force as of the year 2020 were considered; (2) availability in the public domain as this study was limited to desk research; and (3) relevance to MNCH. A total of five policies and plans were analyzed and evaluated against the 15 core concepts presented in the modified EquiFrame framework. Following the outcomes of the assessment, documents were ranked as either being low, moderate, or high, in exhaustively addressing the core concepts. The Ethiopia Health Sector Transformation Plan (2016-2020) is the only policy or plan that earned a high ranking. The other four policies and plans were ranked as moderate. This shows that while majority of the Ethiopian health sector policies and plans exist and address the core health equity concepts, they fail to: (i) spell out plans to implement and monitor the proposed interventions; and (ii) demonstrate evidence that the interventions were implemented or monitored. With the global goal of leaving no one behind, future policy development in Ethiopia needs to prioritize equity considerations in order to enhance the ongoing health improvement.

Drawing on commonly used approaches to gender in global health and development, and taking into consideration critiques of the lack of consideration of gender in social marketing programmes, this article addresses gaps in knowledge about gender concepts necessary to understand the lived experiences of people and how these experiences influence behaviour. The article also presents gender integration approaches within a continuum from gender-unequal to gender-transformative, and uses practical examples from social marketing programmes. Pathways to understand how to adopt gender-responsive approaches in the different phases of social marketing programming are proposed. Final reflections beyond programming are also provided to the social marketing community, including the need to embrace reflexivity and be aware of decolonisation movements.

J	Mateen, FJ				Mateen, Farrah J.			Progress towards the 2030 sustainable development goals: direct and indirect impacts on neurological disorders	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Neurology; Health policy; Global health; Sustainable development goals; Poverty	CEREBRAL-PALSY; EDUCATION; CHILDREN; RISK	The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set forth in 2015 as a blueprint for all nations to create a more sustainable future together. These 17 social, environmental, and economic goals have established targets to meet globally by the year 2030, with a focus on pro-poor initiatives, gender equality, and ending hunger. The relationship of the SDGs with neurological disorders and how the achievement of the SDGs intersects with the future of neurological practice have not been comprehensively examined. However, the incidence of neurological disorders, the outcomes of people living with neurological disorders, and the training of future neurologists can be interlinked, directly or indirectly, with programming for the SDGs and their eventual achievement. Each SDG is reviewed in the context of neurology. This lens can inform programming and policy, enhance research and training, and improve inter-sectoral action for neurological disorders worldwide.

This situation is further exacerbated and exposed by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The Joint Action on Health Information (InfAct) that builds on previous works of the BRIDGE Health project, carried out collaborative action to set up a sustainable infrastructure for health information in the European Union (EU). The aim of this paper is to present InfAct's proposal for a sustainable research infrastructure, the Distributed Infrastructure on Population Health (DIPoH), which includes the setup of a Health Information Portal on population health to be maintained beyond InfAct's time span. Methods The strategy for the proposal was based on three components: scientific initiatives and proposals to improve Health Information Systems (HIS), exploration of technical acceptability and feasibility, and finally obtaining high-level political support.. The technical exploration (Technical Dialogues-TD) was assumed by technical experts proposed by the countries, and political guidance was provided by the Assembly of Members (AoM), which gathered representatives from Ministries of Health and Science of EU/EEA countries. The results from the AoM and the TD were integrated in the sustainability plan compiling all the major outputs of InfAct. Results The InfAct sustainability plan was organized in three main sections: a proposal of a new research infrastructure on population health (the DIPoH), new health information tools and innovative proposals for HIS, and a comprehensive capacity building programme. These activities were carried out in InfAct and are being further developed in the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI). PHIRI is a practical rollout of DIPoH facilitating and generating the best available evidence for research on health and wellbeing of populations as impacted by COVID-19. Conclusions The sustainability plan received wide support from Member States and was recognized to have an added value at EU level. Nevertheless, there were several aspects which still need to be considered for the near future such as: (i) a commitment of stable financial and political support by Member States (MSs), (ii) the availability of resources at regional, national and European level to deal with innovations, and (iii) a more direct involvement from EU and international institutions such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD for providing support and sustainable contributions.

J	Anyatonwu, OP; San Sebastian, M				Anyatonwu, Obinna Princewill; San Sebastian, Miguel			Rural-urban disparities in postpartum contraceptive use among women in Nigeria: a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Contraceptive; Postpartum; Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition; Inequality; Nigeria	PREGNANCY; FERTILITY; EDUCATION; OUTCOMES; STATE; RISK	Background Unintended pregnancies are a global public health concern that could be prevented with appropriate access to contraceptive methods. Evidence from research has indicated that avoidance of closely space birth/pregnancy within the first year of postpartum, mitigates the risk of adverse health outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth-weight, etc. Postpartum family planning helps women to minimize closely spaced and unplanned pregnancies within the first 12 months after delivery. Less contraceptive use is often present in more socially disadvantaged groups. Studies from Nigeria have shown a persistent disparity on contraceptive use between rural and urban residents. To identify the factors explaining these inequalities is important to implement targeted interventions. This study aimed to identify the factors contributing to the rural-urban disparity in postpartum contraceptive use among women in Nigeria. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using the Nigerian Demographic Health Survey. In total, 28,041 postpartum Nigerian women were included. Self-reported contraceptive use was the outcome, while the selected explanatory variables were grouped according to three theoretical perspectives: materialistic, behavioural/cultural, and psychosocial variables. Descriptive statistics and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition were used to summarize and identify the factors contributing to the rural-urban disparity in postpartum contraceptive use. Results In this study, 27% of women reported to have used contraceptives during the postpartum period. The rural-urban disparity in postpartum contraceptive use accounted for 18.2 percentage points. The findings further showed that the disparities in postpartum contraceptive use between rural-urban residence were mostly explained by materialistic variables (82%), followed by the behavioural/cultural variables and age (included as covariate) accounting for 15.6 and 3.0%, respectively. Household wealth (37%) and educational attainment (38%) had the most significant contribution to the differences in postpartum contraceptive use. Only 15% of the difference in postpartum contraceptive use remained unexplained. Conclusion This study has shown important inequalities in postpartum contraceptive use between rural and urban residents in Nigeria. These differences were mainly explained by materialistic factors. These findings highlight crucial areas for the government to target in order to close the existing gap between rural and urban settings in contraceptive use in the country.

Implications of the World Bank's Systematic Diagnostic Reports for the Rise of Noncommunicable Diseases in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article						the World Bank; Marxist theories of health; critical development; NCDs; Organization of Eastern Caribbean States	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; BOLIVARIAN ALLIANCE; POVERTY REDUCTION; STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT; PEOPLES; UNDERDEVELOPMENT; NEOLIBERALISM; HEALTH	Since its foundation in 1944, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, soon renamed the World Bank (hereafter, "the Bank"), has shifted its initial goal of reconstructing post-World War II Europe to promoting economic development and alleviating poverty in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Bank assistance is provided through loans awarded to countries that agree to policy changes that the Bank deems necessary to achieve its stated goals. Bank policies-dubbed Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) and, over time, superseded by Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers-have been criticized for not only failing to ameliorate underdevelopment and poverty, but for exacerbating both. The most recent Bank approach to development and poverty alleviation, the Systematic Diagnostic Reports (SDR), attempts to address these criticisms. We appraise the SDR for six Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). All share daunting economic and social challenges, including an ongoing epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). We argue that, contrary to the Bank's claims, these challenges will continue under, and may even be exacerbated by, the policies the Report demands, and we elaborate on their implications for NCDs in the OECS and for social and health equity in the region.

J	Gebremeskel, AT; Omonaiye, O; Yaya, S				Gebremeskel, Akalewold T.; Omonaiye, Olumuyiwa; Yaya, Sanni			Sex differences in HIV testing among elders in Sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review protocol	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							OLDER-ADULTS; RISK BEHAVIOR; PREVALENCE; INEQUALITIES; PREVENTION; INFECTION; UGANDA; HEALTH	Background: Elders (age 50+) HIV demographic (age and sex) data are essential to better understand their HIV service utilization and develop appropriate evidence-based responses and policies. Despite a significant prevalence rate of HIV and growing numbers of this population group, data are still scarce, and studies have neglected them in Sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this protocol is to outline the methodological process of a systematic review that will gather qualitative and quantitative data to critically examine sex differences in HIV testing among elders (age 50+) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: This protocol adheres to the PRISMA-P reporting guidelines. We will conduct a systematic database search to retrieve all observational and qualitative studies. Electronic search strategies will be developed for MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Health, and CINAHL for studies reporting HIV data. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. The search strategy will consist of free-text and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Search terms for elders (50+) will include the following:"elders","older adults","aged","geriatric" and "seniors". The primary outcome of interest is sex differences in the uptake of HIV counselling and testing (HCT). The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using appropriate tools. Screening, data extraction, and assessments of risk of bias will be performed independently by two reviewers. Narrative synthesis will be conducted with studies that are compatible based on population and outcome. As it will be a systematic review, without human participants' involvement, there will be no requirement for ethical approval. Discussion: The systematic review will present key evidence on sex differences in HIV testing among elders in Sub-Saharan Africa. The findings will be used to inform program developers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to enhance sex disaggregated HIV data to improve access to HIV counselling and testing service for elders in Sub-Saharan Africa. The final manuscript will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal and scientific conferences.

The focus of the study explores stigma amongst individuals diagnosed with mental illness and their caregivers. The study investigates the positioning of the researcher in a superior light by participants which often wrests power from those who should be considered the true experts of their own circumstances. Inequality in the interview process thus carried the risk of impacting the quality of the data, as some participants did not consider themselves as 'experts' of their condition. The paper explores strategies for addressing these challenges of hierarchy and inequality in the research process in the Global South. Based on the study, we report on our experiences as follows: (1) ensuring that participants are empowered to engage with researchers; and (2) training local researchers to engage in culturally sensitive research processes.

Factors Influencing Recovery and Well-Being Among Asian Survivors of International Criminal Sex Trafficking in an Urban US City	JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE			English	Article						cultural contexts; mental health and violence; prostitution; sex work; sexual assault; situational factors; support seeking	WOMEN; SERVICES; TRAUMA; HEALTH; REVICTIMIZATION; EXPERIENCES; VIOLENCE; CARE	Sex trafficking is serious form of gender-based violence that results in profound adverse health outcomes, yet one that is poorly understood. New York City is a major hub for sex trafficking, with a significant but unquantified number of victims originating from East Asian countries and trafficked via illicit massage businesses. Peer-reviewed studies among Asian survivors of international criminal sex trafficking do not exist. The aim of this study is to qualitatively examine the factors at various levels of influence that impact the recovery and reintegration process of Asian criminal sex trafficking survivors in the United States from the perspective of survivors and front-line service providers. The study was guided by community-based participatory research and trauma-informed approaches, leveraging a collaboration with a well-established service provider organization. Ten in-depth interviews were conducted between 2018 and 2019 with three Korean survivors and seven key informants who were anti-trafficking service providers working with East Asian clients. Data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Survivors and service providers vocalized factors at multiple levels that either facilitate or impede recovery and well-being. Levels of influence included structural (e.g., poverty/debt bondage, immigration status, limited English proficiency), cultural (e.g., fatalism, collectivism), institutional (e.g., lack of culturally appropriate, trauma-informed care), interpersonal (e.g., exploitation, social support), and individual (e.g., resilience). Stigma was a crosscutting factor that spanned all levels of influence. This study highlights the voices of survivors and front-line service providers to understand the lives of an under-researched population of Asian sex trafficking survivors. Ultimately, the root, structural causes of survivor marginalization need to be addressed, which stem from the intersection of class-, gender-, and race-related inequities. While survivors continue to experience exploitation and marginalization post-trafficking, they also carry an enormous amount of resilience that must be leveraged in their path to recovery from trauma.

Socioeconomic inequalities in self-rated health in Japan, 32 European countries and the United States: an international comparative study	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Self-assessed health; perceived health; health surveys; socioeconomic factors	REGRESSION-MODELS; INCOME; DETERMINANTS; MORTALITY; RESPONSES; ADULTS; TRENDS	Aims: Japan is known as a country with low self-rated health despite high life expectancy. We compared socioeconomic inequalities in self-rated health in Japan with those in 32 European countries and the US using nationally representative samples. Methods: We analysed individual data from the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions (Japan), the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (US) in 2016. We used ordered logistic regression models with four ordinal categories of self-rated health as an outcome, and educational level or occupational class as independent variables, controlling for age. Results: In Japan, about half the population perceived their health as 'fair', which was much higher than in Europe (approximate to 20-40%). The odds ratios of lower self-rated health among less educated men compared with more educated were 1.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61-1.85) in Japan, and ranged from 1.67 to 4.74 in Europe (pooled; 2.10 (95% CI 2.01-2.20)), and 6.65 (95% CI 6.22-7.12) in the US. The odds ratios of lower self-rated health among less educated women were 1.79 (95% CI 1.65-1.95) in Japan, and ranged from 1.89 to 5.30 in Europe (pooled; 2.43 (95% CI 2.33-2.54)), and 8.82 (95% CI 8.29-9.38) in the US. Socioeconomic inequalities were large when self-rated health was low for European countries, but Japan and the US did not follow the pattern. Conclusions: Japan has similar socioeconomic gradient patterns to European countries for self-rated health, and our findings revealed smaller socioeconomic inequalities in self-rated health in Japan compared with those in western countries.

Many studies have investigated this measure but used limited cities. To fill this gap, this study visualizes green space accessibility for 4353 cities across the globe. Three global open datasets and two different scales (city- and national-scales) were involved for the analysis. We found that most countries and cities have a relative high value in terms of the green space accessibility, and those with a relatively low value are mostly located in South American, African, and Asian countries and cities. The results may be useful not only for local governments to implement precise planning for reducing potential inequality in access to green space, but also for researchers to further investigate the relationship between green space accessibility and various issues related to urban built-up environment.

Using the panel survey data in Japan (N = 3,725), this positive sociological study investigated who were more/less resilient under COVID-19, with attention to the heterogeneity in life satisfaction (LS). It was first confirmed that older adults' LS had substantially improved during the pandemic, indicating their resilience on average. However, the multinomial logistic regression and the fixed effects model revealed that the shift in LS was associated with age, gender, income, family/social relationships, and heath in a nuanced way. This suggests, while older adults who have access to economic, social, and health-related resources can maintain/enhance their LS under the global crisis, those without such assets face the risk of being penalized. In these uncertain times, it is therefore imperative to shed light on the resilience divide among older adults alongside their average strength.

Ecologically unequal exchange and disparate death rates attributable to air pollution: A comparative study of 169 countries from 1991 to 2017	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Ecologically unequal exchange; Air pollution; Ecological development; Growth curve; Environmental justice	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS; ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; CO2 EMISSIONS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; GREENHOUSE-GAS; GLOBAL BURDEN	Ambient air pollution is among the most pressing environmental problems in our contemporary world that poses significant risks to global ecological and public health. This study analyzes cross-national heterogeneities in trajectories of death rates attributable to ambient air pollution. Compiling panel data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, the Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS), and the World Development Indicators, we create a dataset that tracks 169 countries from 1991 to 2017. Using growth curve models (GCMs), we estimate countryspecific trajectories of death rates attributable to air pollution, and condition them on time-invariant and timevarying independent variables. The results suggest that while the global death rate attributable to air pollution has been continuously decreasing, there are heterogeneities in countries' death rate trajectories based on their geographic location and position in the world economy. High-income countries of the global North have perpetually witnessed lower death rates attributable to air pollution compared to middle- and low-income countries of the global South. Moreover, our results indicate that increased export to high-income countries, as a proxy for ecologically unequal exchange, leads to higher death rates from air pollution in middle- and lowincome countries.

J	Kohrt, BA; Carruth, L				Kohrt, Brandon A.; Carruth, Lauren			Syndemic effects in complex humanitarian emergencies: A framework for understanding political violence and improving multi-morbidity health outcomes	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Humanitarian emergencies; Political violence; Syndemic; War; Conflict; Mental health; Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; COMBAT-RELATED PTSD; MENTAL-HEALTH; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS; METABOLIC SYNDROME; CHILD SOLDIERS; SOMALI REGION; DEPRESSION	A hallmark of complex humanitarian emergencies is the collective exposure, often over extended periods of time, to political violence in the forms of war, terrorism, political intimidation, repression, unlawful detention, and forced displacement. Populations in complex humanitarian emergencies have higher risks of multiple co morbidities: mental disorders, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and chronic non-communicable diseases. However, there is wide variation in the health impacts both across and within humanitarian emergencies. Syndemic theory is an approach to conceptualizing disease and social determinants to understand differential patterns of multi-morbidity, elucidate underlying mechanisms, and better design interventions. Syndemic theory, if applied to complex humanitarian emergencies, has the potential to uncover origins of localized patterns of multi-morbidity resulting from political violence and historical inequities. In this paper, we present two case studies based on mixed-methods research to illustrate how syndemic models can be applied in complex humanitarian emergencies. First, in a Nepal case study, we explore different patterns of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression co-morbidity among female former child soldiers returning home after war. Despite comparable exposure to war-related traumas, girl soldiers in high-caste Hindu communities had 63% co morbidity of PTSD and depression, whereas girl soldiers in communities with mixed castes and religions, had 8% PTSD prevalence, but no cases of PTSD and depression co-morbidity. In the second case study, we explore the high rates of type 2 diabetes during a spike in political violence and population displacement. Despite low rates of obesity and other common risk factors, Somalis in Ethiopia experienced rising cases of and poor outcomes from type-2 diabetes. Political violence shapes healthcare resources, diets, and potentially, this epidemiological anomaly. Based on these case studies we propose a humanitarian syndemic research agenda for observational and intervention studies, with the central focus being that public health efforts need to target violence prevention at family, community, national, and global levels.

J	Saxena, A; Mendenhall, E				Saxena, Akshar; Mendenhall, Emily			Syndemic thinking in large-scale studies: Case studies of disability, hypertension, and diabetes across income groups in India and China	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Syndemics; India; China; Diabetes; Hypertension; Disability	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; RISK-FACTOR; HEALTH; INEQUALITY; PREVALENCE; DETERMINANTS; DEPRESSION; MELLITUS; COMORBIDITIES; MECHANISMS	Syndemics consider where two or more conditions cluster, how they interact, and what macro-social processes have driven them together. Yet, syndemics emerge and interact differently across contexts and through time. This article considers how syndemics involving Type 2 diabetes (DM), disability, and income differ among men and women and between India and China. We use the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) data. Using multivariable logistic regression, we assess the interaction of socio-economic factors and diseases on a multiplicative scale. We found that gender and income interact significantly in China to increase the odds of reporting hypertension and diabetes, but only for reporting diabetes in India. High income interacts with metabolic conditions to increase the odds of reporting comorbidity. Hypertension and diabetes were both independently and jointly associated with increase in the odds of being disabled in both countries, but the association varies by conditions. We argue that, first, our study reveals how these syndemics differ between countries and, second, that they differ significantly between income groups. Both findings refute the idea that a "global syndemic" exists. Instead, we emphasize the need for more ethnographic work that invests in local historical, social, and political interpretations of syndemics. Furthermore, ethnographic evidence suggests that the lowest-income communities face compounded social stress, untreated depression, and poor healthcare access alongside these clustered "metabolic" conditions. This point is most notable to demonstrate the need for chronic integrated care for not only the wealthy but also poorer people with metabolic conditions.

Law-making and the policing of teenage sexuality in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo	JOURNAL OF EASTERN AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						Uganda; Democratic Republic of Congo; sexuality; youth; regulation; legislation; patriarchy	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERVENTION; ADOLESCENTS; VIOLENCE; EASTERN; AFRICA; SEX; HOMOSEXUALITY; PERSPECTIVES; DISCOURSE	Age-of-consent legislation serves to protect children from sexual abuse. In Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, however, the reform of laws against sexual violence has led to a criminalisation of non-violent and consensual sexual interactions with and between underage teenagers. These reforms have been inspired by evolving international norms, but discourses in both countries emphasised the regulation of female and youth sexuality over norms of self-determination. This contribution unpacks the interlocking actions of activists, parliaments, police, judges and parents, which turned protective anti-sexual violence legislation into an instrument of patriarchal control. Methodologically, the comparative analysis charts discourses and practices in both countries based on ethnographic, qualitative and statistical data. We trace legislative debates, demonstrate the significance of policing and prosecution of consensual youth sexuality, and discuss incentives for police and justice institutions to engage in this field. We contrast young people's diverse views on underage sexuality with parental attempts to uphold patriarchal norms with the help of the police. The conclusion discusses the social cost of criminalising consensual teenage sexuality and asks whether these violent interventions indicate a crisis of patriarchal authority.

J	Brysk, A				Brysk, Alison			Pandemic patriarchy: The impact of a global health crisis on women's rights	JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							COVID-19	The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a surge in patriarchal repression for women worldwide, with marked increases in gender violence, gendered job loss and deterioration in labor conditions, regression in health care access and reproductive rights, and backlash against feminist consciousness. Beyond intensifying chronic rights gaps and the preexisting conditions of patriarchy, the global health crisis has increased the gendered impact of interdependence across the social-civil-security rights domains, the public-private divide, and intersecting identities of gender, race, and class. The cumulation of these shifts constitutes a new phase of pandemic patriarchy that sets new parameters for the fulfillment of women's rights in the international rights regime. The uneven rights regime response to the panoply of rights challenges under conditions of pandemic patriarchy shows that an adequate global response must move beyond the recognition of women's rights as human rights to incorporate feminism as an ethic of care, struggle for systematic gender equity, and feminist reconstruction of global governance.

West African medicinal plants and their constituent compounds as treatments for viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19	DARU-JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Antiviral; Medicinal Plants; Traditional Medicine; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; West Africa	RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; GARLIC EXTRACT; STEM BARK; LEAVES; PHYTOCHEMICALS; CORONAVIRUSES; REPLICATION; INHIBITION	Objectives The recent emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic (caused by SARS-CoV-2) and the experience of its unprecedented alarming toll on humanity have shone a fresh spotlight on the weakness of global preparedness for pandemics, significant health inequalities, and the fragility of healthcare systems in certain regions of the world. It is imperative to identify effective drug treatments for COVID-19. Therefore, the objective of this review is to present a unique and contextualised collection of antiviral natural plants or remedies from the West African sub-region as existing or potential treatments for viral infections, including COVID-19, with emphasis on their mechanisms of action. Evidence acquisition Evidence was synthesised from the literature using appropriate keywords as search terms within scientific databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Results While some vaccines and small-molecule drugs are now available to combat COVID-19, access to these therapeutic entities in many countries is still quite limited. In addition, significant aspects of the symptomatology, pathophysiology and long-term prognosis of the infection yet remain unknown. The existing therapeutic armamentarium, therefore, requires significant expansion. There is evidence that natural products with antiviral effects have been used in successfully managing COVID-19 symptoms and could be developed as anti-COVID-19 agents which act through host- and virus-based molecular targets. Conclusion Natural products could be successfully exploited for treating viral infections/diseases, including COVID-19. Strengthening natural products research capacity in developing countries is, therefore, a key strategy for reducing health inequalities, improving global health, and enhancing preparedness for future pandemics.

Contemporary urban planning practices result in environmental risk factors (e.g. air pollution, noise, lack of green space, excess heat) that put health and wellbeing of city dwellers at risk and contribute to chronic diseases and premature death. Despite a growing body of evidence on adverse health impacts related to current urban and transport planning practices, especially for cities in the Global North, not much is known about associated health impacts in South American cities. Therefore, we estimated the mortality burden attributable to breaching internationally-recommended or locally-preferable exposure levels of urban planning related environmental exposures in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We carried out a health impact assessment study, following the comparative risk assessment framework, to assess preventable mortality impacts of breaching exposure recommendations for air pollution, green spaces and temperature at the census tract (CT) level (n = 18,363). We also assessed the distribution thereof by socioeconomic vulnerability. Results: We estimated that annually 11,372 (95% CI: 7921; 15,910) attributable deaths could be prevented by complying with recommended exposure levels. The largest proportion of preventable mortality was due to breaching air pollution limits (i.e. 8409 attributable deaths), followed by insufficient green space (i.e. 2593), and excess heat (i.e. 370). Adverse health impacts were larger in CTs of lower socioeconomic vulnerability, due to demographic profile, traffic density and residential area configurations. Discussion: Not complying with the health limits for air pollution, green space and temperature exposures resulted in a considerable preventable mortality burden (i.e. 17% of total expected deaths) in Sao Paulo. This burden can be reduced by improving current urban and transport planning practices.

However, thus far no studies have related the State's role in this important health-promoting home practice, namely healthy cooking. We aim to elaborate on the concept and develop a multilevel conceptual model of cooking autonomy (CMCA) in order to relate the State's role in healthy home cooking. This is a theoretical-conceptual study consisting of three phases: conceptual elaboration, expert panel consultation, and content validity of the CMCA developed in this study. A comprehensive literature review worked as the theoretical and conceptual basis, featuring Amartya Sens human capability approach. A total of 28 experts issued their opinions in listening workshops and interviews. Cooking autonomy was defined as the capacity to think, to decide, and to act to prepare meals from scratch, influenced by interpersonal relations, environment, cultural values, access to opportunities, and guarantee of rights. The CMCA has six levels, differing according to the degree of participation of an individual. We also present two charts with examples of the agent's practices and actions that can be developed by the State in the public policy sphere. As a pioneering model in the international literature, the CMCA provides the conceptual basis for the development of studies and interventions on cooking autonomy, focusing not only on individual skills, but also on the role of public policies for healthy home cooking.

To date, however, there is no detailed information on the global health burden of SIDS. Aims To characterize the global disease burden of SIDS and its trends from 1990 to 2019 and to compare the burden of SIDS according to the socio-demographic index (SDI). Design Systematic analysis based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data. Methods Epidemiological data of 204 countries from 1990 to 2019 were collected via various methods including civil registration and vital statistics in the original GBD study. Estimates for mortality and disease burden of SIDS were modeled. Crude mortality and mortality rates per 100 000 population were analyzed. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and DALY rates were also assessed. Results In 2019, mortality rate of SIDS accounted for 20.98 [95% Uncertainty Interval, 9.15-46.16] globally, which was a 51% decrease from 1990. SIDS was most prevalent in Western sub-Saharan Africa, High-income North America and Oceania in 2019. The burden of SIDS was higher in males than females consistently from 1990 to 2019. Higher SDI and income level was associated with lower burden of SIDS; furthermore, countries with higher SDI and income had greater decreases in SIDS burden from 1990 to 2019. Conclusions The burden of SIDS has decreased drastically from 1990 to 2019. However, the improvements have occurred disproportionately between regions and SDI levels. Focused preventive efforts in under-resourced populations are needed.

This involves private equity firms producing a global wealth chain (GWC) between their investors and the target asset, using offshore financial centres to facilitate tax-avoiding reflux of capital. Moreover, they are opening up ambulatory health care as an asset for capital investment by overcoming previous market barriers to ambulatory health care via a legal construct. In this paper, we trace the spatial links of these finance-side and sector-specific corporate chains based on a capital flow analysis of private equity takeovers of Medical Care Centres (MCCs) in Bavaria, Germany. With our heuristics of a double-layered GWC, which enables the extraction of value from the German health system, we contribute to the emerging GWC debate that aims to conceptualise the complex and often opaque spatialisations of financialisation processes.

Corporate social and community-oriented support by UK food retailers: a documentary review and typology of actions towards community wellbeing	PERSPECTIVES IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						public health policy; community engagement; community wellbeing; social responsibility; food retail; inequalities	INDUSTRY	Aim: This article provides a comprehensive exploration of the varied Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actions in relation to supporting communities reported by the UK's leading food retailers. Findings are discussed against a backdrop of enduring inequalities, exacerbated by the on-going global Coronavirus pandemic, with actions considered for their potential contribution to community-based approaches to addressing local wellbeing and inequalities. Method: This article presents the structure and key characteristics of community-oriented CSR in food retailing in the UK. A thematic analysis of comprehensive documentary evidence from the 11 principle UK food retailers was conducted, drawing on asset-based frameworks of community-centred actions towards wellbeing. Findings: The findings suggest an increasing acknowledgement in food retail that local community is of key importance. Initiatives were categorised according to a typology, comprising national partnerships, local store-based funding and support actions, targeted programmes on healthy lifestyles or employability, and changes to store operations, in the favour of priority groups, prompted by the pandemic. Conclusion: The article combines an up to date overview of community-focused CSR agendas and support by food retailers at a time of significant economic and social challenge for the UK. It highlights the potential of the sector to contribute more strategically to reducing inequalities and supporting community wellbeing, alongside statutory and voluntary sector partners.

J	Ho, CWL				Ho, Calvin Wai-Loon			Operationalizing "One Health" as "One Digital Health" Through a Global Framework That Emphasizes Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits From the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Related Digital Technologies	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						FAIR; Convention on Biological Diversity; digital; artificial intelligence; One Health; benefit sharing; International Health Regulations; data sharing	NAGOYA PROTOCOL; BIODIVERSITY; ETHICS; TRANSMISSION; CHALLENGES; NETWORKS; SPREAD; FUTURE; VALUES; LEGAL	The operationalization of One Health (OH) through digitalization is a means to deploy digital technologies (including Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data and related digital technologies) to better capacitate us to deal with growing climate exigency and related threats to human, animal and plant health. With reference to the concept of One Digital Health (ODH), this paper considers how digital capabilities can help to overcome 'operational brakes' in OH through new and deeper insights, better predictions, and more targeted or precise preventive strategies and public health countermeasures. However, the data landscape is fragmented and access to certain types of data is increasingly restrictive as individuals, communities and countries seek to assert greater control over data taken from them. This paper proposes for a dedicated global ODH framework-centered on fairness and equity-to be established to promote data-sharing across all the key knowledge domains of OH and to devise data-driven solutions to challenges in the human-animal-ecosystems interface. It first considers the data landscape in relation to: (1) Human and population health; (2) Pathogens; (3) Animal and plant health; and (4) Ecosystems and biodiversity. The complexification from the application of advance genetic sequencing technology is then considered, with focus on current debates over whether certain types of data like digital (genetic) sequencing information (DSI) should remain openly and freely accessible. The proposed ODH framework must augment the existing access and benefit sharing (ABS) framework currently prescribed under the Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in at least three different ways. First, the ODH framework should apply to all genetic resources and data, including DSI, whether from humans or non-humans. Second, the FAIRER principles should be implemented, with focus on fair and equitable benefit-sharing. Third, the ODH framework should adopt multilateral approaches to data sharing (such as through federated data systems) and to ABS. By operationalizing OH as ODH, we are more likely to be able to protect and restore natural habitats, secure the health and well-being of all living things, and thereby realize the goals set out in the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework under the CBD.

The purpose of this study is to conduct an in-depth literature review to identify how BDA and AI were involved in the management of Covid-19 (while considering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)). The rigorous search resulted in a portfolio of 607 articles, retrieved from the Web of Science database, where content analysis has been conducted. This study identifies the BDA and AI applications developed to deal with the initial Covid-19 outbreak and the containment of the pandemic, along with their benefits for the social good. Moreover, this study reveals the DEI challenges related to these applications, ways to mitigate the concerns, and how to develop viable techniques to deal with similar crises in the future.

J	Tang, SS; Lee, HF; Huang, X; Zhou, J				Tang, Shuangshuang; Lee, Harry F.; Huang, Xu; Zhou, Jing			Poverty Stories of rural households in China: The case of North Jiangsu	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Poverty trap; Migration; Local non-farm employment; Poor rural household; China	INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; NONFARM EMPLOYMENT; FAMILY MIGRATION; LABOR MIGRATION; URBAN MIGRATION; REDUCTION; DETERMINANTS; EDUCATION; ALLEVIATION; INEQUALITY	After decades of rapid economic growth and massive rural-to-urban migration, rural poverty in China has been largely alleviated. Existing literature has highlighted the crucial role played by non-farm employment in the rural population's escape from poverty. However, despite some engagement in non-farm employment, a huge population in rural China remains poor. Why rural households remain poor in spite of non-farm employment has not been sufficiently explored by scholars. To fill the research gap, this paper explores the underlying mechanisms of poverty among the poor rural population, based on a recent questionnaire survey (n = 2,822) conducted in rural North Jiangsu in China. Our multinomial logistic regression model and OLS regression model show that education is positively associated with the likelihood of engaging in non-farm sectors. Relatively low education attainment of working-age household members (secondary education and below) restricted the earnings from non-farm activities, reducing the likelihood of escaping poverty. Supporting higher education for their children is often a heavy burden for poor non-agricultural rural households, driving them into the poverty trap. The results also show that significant family events, such as severe illness and children's college enrollment, have kept rural households poor, even if some household members have participated in non-farm activities through migration or working in the local non-rural sector. In addition, instead of being looked after, some apparently dependent family members (the elderly) undertake agricultural activities and domestic work to support the out-migration of the labor force in poor rural households to enable household wealth accumulation. The findings suggest that policymakers should implement a series of reforms, especially regarding improvement in health insurance and education and the economic development in the local areas (incl. rural areas and nearby towns) to deal with rural poverty.

In Cochrane's seminal thinking, political context was included with the purpose of promoting healthcare equity. However, the subsequent evidence-based healthcare models marginalized political context. In this paper, we argue that current models of evidence-based healthcare fail to respond to emerging healthcare challenges. We claim that reintegration of political context is crucial to make healthcare sustainable. Global communities are anticipating ecological crises with immense repercussions for healthcare. This prospect illustrates that healthcare models failing to integrate political context also risk neglecting some of the most relevant healthcare issues of our time.

J	Sarkar, K				Sarkar, Koyel			Can status exchanges explain educational hypogamy in India?	DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH			English	Article							GENDER-GAP; MARRIAGE; CASTE; MARKET; INTERMARRIAGE; CONSEQUENCES; REVERSAL; WOMENS; ORIGIN; TRENDS	BACKGROUND In contrast to global trends in which education hypogamy occurs when a reversal in the gender gap has taken place, an increase in women???s education in India is closely followed by hypogamy, although women are still the less-educated gender. Two trends associated with this development suggest that educational hypogamy is a product of status exchange: an increase in educational hypogamy among lower-caste groups and a slow rise in caste exogamy. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study is to determine whether status exchanges can explain educational hypogamy in India. The initial assumptions are that educational hypogamy can be explained by the desire of women to ???marry up??? to attain the caste of the husband and of women who belong to higher castes (who have less to gain by caste status) to ???marry up??? to benefit from the occupation of the husband. METHODS AND RESULTS The Indian Demographic and Health Survey 2015???2016 dataset and logistic regression models were used to address the research question. The findings suggest that the educational trade-off with social and economic exchanges is interconnected, which is affected significantly by the caste groups to which the women and their prospective husbands belong. When marrying less-educated men, the preference to rise by caste is high among lower-caste women, whereas the preference to rise by occupation is important among women belonging to higher castes. CONTRIBUTION This study solves the Indian hypogamy puzzle by applying status-exchange mechanisms through education, caste, and occupation in the marriage market. It also shows that the growth in educational achievement for Indian women does not diminish social inequalities but provides other means by which social status can be exchanged.

Public acceptability of vaccination is a major driver in containing the disease. However, in marginalized and stigmatized populations, uncertainty and unwillingness may be a challenge. This study aimed to analyze the factors associated with uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in men who have sex with men (MSM) living in France. The data used came from Rapport au Sexe (ERAS) 2021, a voluntary, cross-sectional, anonymous, self-administered, online survey conducted from 26 February to 11 April 2021. Among the 15,426 respondents included in the analysis, 60.5% were willing to vaccinate (these included persons already vaccinated), 17.5% were not, and 22% were uncertain. Factors independently associated with uncertainty and unwillingness were lower education level, low health literacy level, financial hardship, being under 30 years of age, and living in a rural area. HIV-positive MSM were less likely to report vaccination uncertainty and unwillingness than HIV-negative MSM and those with unknown serostatus. Although more impacted by COVID-19, socioeconomically vulnerable MSM were the sub-group most unwilling to vaccinate. To improve acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination in MSM, policy makers and researchers must increase access to and understanding of medical information by considering the general public's health literacy when developing information sources. Moreover, a dedicated global care approach, which ensures these populations can be reached, is necessary.

Methods In this systematic analysis, we present the national and subnational estimates of the burden of disease in Iran using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. We report trends in demographics, all-cause and cause-specific mortality, as well as years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by major diseases and risk factors. A multi-intervention segmented-regression model was used to explore the overall impact of health sector changes and sanctions. For this analysis, we used a variety of sources and reports, including vital registration, census, and survey data to provide estimates of mortality and morbidity at the national and subnational level in Iran. Findings Iran, which had 84middot3 million inhabitants in 2019, had a life expectancy of 79middot6 years (95% uncertainty interval 79middot2-79middot9) in female individuals and 76middot1 (75middot6-76middot5) in male individuals, an increase compared with 1990. The number of DALYs remained stable and reached 19middot8 million (17middot3-22middot6) in 2019, of which 78middot1% were caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) compared with 43middot0% in 1990. During the study period, age-standardised DALY rates and YLL rates decreased considerably; however, YLDs remained nearly constant. The share of age-standardised YLDs contributing to the DALY rate steadily increased to 44middot5% by 2019. With regard to the DALY rates of different provinces, inequalities were decreasing. From 1990 to 2019, although the number of DALYs attributed to all risk factors decreased by 16middot8%, deaths attributable to all risk factors substantially grew by 43middot8%. The regression results revealed a significant negative association between sanctions and health status. Interpretation The Iranian health-care system is encountering NCDs as its new challenge, which necessitates a coordinated multisectoral approach. Although the Iranian health-care system has been successful to some extent in controlling mortality, it has overlooked the burden of morbidity and need for rehabilitation. We did not capture alleviation of the burden of diseases in Iran following the 2004 and 2014 health sector reforms; however, the sanctions were associated with deaths of Iranians caused by NCDs.

Teleneurology and Health Disparities	SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						teleneurology; telemedicine; racial or ethnic disparities	TELEMEDICINE; CARE	The disparate access to, and use of, telemedicine reflects those of in-person health. These disparities are perpetuated as a result of individual, social, and structural factors like low digital literacy, unequal availability of broadband services, and systemic racism. This review focuses on extant literature on disparities in teleneurology, including racial or ethnic disparities, language inequities, and the global context. Understanding social and structural barriers to equitable access to quality teleneurology is critical to addressing and preventing health disparities, ensuring effective and equitable neurological care for all patients.

Aim To evaluate the results of a primary care program implemented to reduce health inequalities associated with social determinants in patients with type 2 diabetes. Method An exploratory pilot retrospective cross-sectional study that includes secondary data of 404 nonrandomized patients belonging to socially depressed areas and conventional areas. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. Results The age of the subjects included in the study was 66.80 +/- 9.7 years with a proportion of 56.7% men. Proportions of patients from socially depressed areas and adherence to the Nursing Follow-up Program were around 33% and 60%, respectively. The obesity rate was 51%, percentage of patients with HbA1c<7% was 59%. No significant differences were found between patients belonging to socially depressed areas and those who do not, except for greater adherence to nursing follow-up programs. Multivariate models assessed chronical complications as health outcomes (cardiovascular diseases, retinopathy, and nephropathy) as health outcomes showing the influence of previously described risk factors. However, in none of the models did belonging to a socially depressed area or adherence to the Nursing Follow-up Program were predictors. Conclusions The program has proven to be efficient in equating the health outcomes related with cardiovascular risk of patients from both types of areas. Well-directed health policies could bring primary care systems closer to sustainable development goals through the reduction of health disparities that affect socially vulnerable groups. Clinical relevance To introduce a risk strategy and to adopt a family approach, contemplating the sociocultural and educational differences that diversely affect men and women in their health status has proven to be useful in reducing health disparities due to social determinants in patients with type 2 diabetes.

We aimed at monitoring these inequalities from population-based survey data in 18 SSA countries between 2010 and 2018. Methods: We defined eight HIV indicators aimed at capturing uptake of HIV prevention services among adult participants. Country-specific wealth-related inequalities were measured using the Relative and Slope Index of Inequalities (RII and SII, respectively) and then pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. We compared inequalities between African regions using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: The sample consisted of 358 591 participants (66% women). Despite variability between countries and indicators, the meta-analysis revealed significant levels of relative and absolute inequalities in six out of eight indicators: HIV-related knowledge, positive attitudes toward people with HIV (PWH), condom use at last sexual intercourse, participation to prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs, medical male circumcision and recent HIV testing. The largest inequalities were reported in condom use, with condom use reported five times more among the richest versus the poorest [RII = 5.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.79-9.05] and in positive attitudes toward PWH, with a 32-percentage point difference between the richest and poorest (SII = 0.32, 95% CI 0.26-0.39). Conversely, no significant inequalities were observed in multipartnership and HIV seropositivity among youth. Overall, inequalities tended to be larger in West and Central vs. East and Southern African countries. Conclusion: Despite efforts to scale-up HIV-prevention programs, socioeconomic inequalities remain substantial over the continuum of HIV primary and secondary prevention in several SSA countries.

Role of systems science in preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases: protocol for a scoping review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review						public health; infectious diseases; health policy		Introduction In recent history, many new infectious diseases have affected humans for the first time or have appeared in previously unaffected areas of the world; these diseases are known as emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Examples of EIDs include COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease. EIDs are known for their complexity. Multiple factors play a role in their spread, including increases in human population, conflicts, urbanisation, air travel, global trade and inequalities in wealth distribution and access to healthcare. In order to gain a better understanding of such complexity, we aim to explore the role of systems science, which allows us to view EIDs in the context of complex adaptive systems rather than simple causes and effects. The objectives of this scoping review are to explore and map the theoretical concepts and key characteristics of studies that use systems methods in controlling EIDs, to identify the gaps in knowledge and disseminate the results. Methods We will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for this scoping review, comprising the following stages: formulating the research question and subquestions, scanning the literature for available data, selecting relevant publications, charting the data by two independent reviewers, aggregating the findings, reporting, summarising and disseminating the results. We will review peer-reviewed articles, preprints and grey literature available in all languages. Discussion We intend that this scoping review will contribute to a better understanding of the use of systems methods to inform policymakers about how to prevent and control EIDs. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics approval is not required for a scoping review because it is based on reviewing and collecting data from publicly available sources. To disseminate the findings, results will be shared through academic publications, seminars and conferences.

We studied the association between psychological distress and social support among conflict refugees in urban, semi-rural and rural settlements in Uganda during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Cross-sectional survey data on psychological distress, social support, demographics, socio-economic and behavioral variables was gathered from 1014 adult refugees randomly sampled from urban, semi-rural and rural refugee settlements in Uganda, using two-staged cluster sampling. Data was analyzed in SPSS-version 22, and statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Results Refugees resident in rural/semi-rural settlements exhibited higher levels of psychological distress [F(2, 1011) = 47.91; p < 0.001], higher availability of social interaction [F(2, 1011) = 82.24; p < 0.001], lower adequacy of social interaction [F(2, 1011) = 54.11; p < 0.001], higher availability of social attachment [F(2, 1011) = 47.95; p < 0.001], and lower adequacy of social attachment [F(2, 1011) = 50.54; p < 0.001] than peers in urban settlements. Adequacy of social interaction significantly explained variations in psychological distress levels overall and consistently across settlements, after controlling for plausible confounders. Additionally, adequacy of social attachment significantly explained variations in psychological distress levels among refugees in rural settlements, after controlling for plausible confounders. Conclusion There is a settlement-inequality (i.e. rural vs. urban) in psychological distress and social support among conflict refugees in Uganda. To address psychological distress, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Services (MHPSS) should focus on strategies which strengthen the existing social networks among refugees. Variations in social support are a key predictor of distress which should guide tailored need-adapted interventions instead of duplicating similar and generic interventions across diverse refugee settlements.

Our study suggests four main findings. First, health impacts are a key concern for working-class communities. Second, the long-term effects of toxic pollution undermine communities' ability to act preventively. Third, industrial activities, waste manage-ment and nuclear energy conflicts are more likely to report health impacts than other economic activities. Last, mobilising groups are reluctant to consider the closure of a polluting project a successful outcome because of the persistence of toxic pollution across time. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of what we have termed 'environmental health conflicts' (EHCs).

COVID-19 COMES TO THE COLORADO SUPREME COURT	DENVER LAW REVIEW			English	Article								In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged communities across the United States-and Colorado was no exception. The state government acted quickly to respond to this ongoing public health emergency, and those actions were soon subject to a variety of legal challenges. This Article analyzes the Colorado Supreme Court's decisions resulting from those legal challenges. It argues that the court never sent a clear signal about how much flexibility it would give the government to meet this unprecedented crisis. Still, the court's opinions suggest that a bare majority of justices are willing to take the existence of this international public health emergency into account in their decision-making.

Complex social and environmental factors define wellbeing outcomes and inequities present in cities. Additionally, political decisions are seldom thought and developed considering the needs and participation of children and adolescents. The REDibuja study aims to develop a multidimensional framework of wellbeing for children and adolescents and to validate an index of opportunities for better wellbeing for children and adolescents in the urban context of Temuco, Chile. This child-centered and cross-sectional study will involve mixed methodologies throughout the implementation of five work packages for two years (2022-2023): (1) development of a conceptual framework for child and adolescent wellbeing, (2) integration of available and public data, (3) studies in the local context, (4) data integration using geographic information systems, and (5) validation of the wellbeing opportunity index for children and adolescents.

However, the progress of COVID-19 vaccination varies from different countries, and global vaccine inequity has been a worldwide public health issue. This study collected data from the Our World in Data COVID-19 vaccination data set between 13 December 2020 and 1 January 2022. The measurement reflecting the pandemic situation included New cases, New deaths, Hospital patients, ICU patients, and the Reproduction rate. Indicators for measuring the vaccination coverage included Total vaccinations per hundred and People vaccinated per hundred. The Human Development Index (HDI) measured the country's development level. Findings indicated that countries with higher HDI have more adequate vaccine resources, and global vaccine inequity exists. The study also found that vaccination significantly mitigates the pandemic, and reaching 70% immunization coverage can further control the epidemic. In addition, the emergence of Omicron variants makes the COVID-19 epidemic situation even worse, suggesting the importance and necessity of addressing vaccine inequity. The globe will face a greater challenge in controlling the pandemic if lower-vaccinated countries do not increase their vaccination coverage. Addressing the issue of vaccine inequity needs the cooperation of HIC, LMIC, public health departments, and vaccine producers. Moreover, the media has to contribute to effective public health communication by raising public perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination, and vaccine inequity.

This research project aims to identify facilitating and inhibiting factors for the creation of healthy living environments. (2) After preliminary literature and qualitative research work, an online-based Delphi survey was conducted (December 2020-March 2021). This included the rating and commentating of 22 theses at two times, whereby the results of the first round of rating were visible to the participants the second time. (3) Twelve experts from seven European countries participated in the Delphi survey across both rounds (1st round: n = 37; 12 countries). The consensus was particularly clear with regard to providing resources, which, in turn, are especially necessary for involving target groups in health promotion. (4) The results illustrate the relevance of further cross-national exchange. Certain aspects however, such as the HiAP approach or strategies to reach disadvantaged groups, are still challenging in practice. In order to develop concrete recommendations, the theses need to be further operationalised. The Delphi method offers a suitable possibility to map international expertise in this field and with a focus on health equity.

The inclusion of this agenda in the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations has shown that worsened environmental degradation is currently a major threat facing humankind. The World Commission on Environment and Development 2015 has highlighted that income inequality is one of the major causes for environmental deterioration. Hence, reducing environmental degradation requires a look at the problem of unequal income distribution. Moreover, educational attainment plays a vital role in providing relevant knowledge and skills to people in handling environmental problems. Thus, the objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between income inequality, educational attainment, and CO2 emissions by employing a panel data analysis for a group of 64 countries from 1990 to 2016.The study uses mainly dynamic common correlated effects (DCCE) estimator to take into account the issue of cross-section dependence which has been ignored by most of the previous studies. By tackling the problem of cross-section dependence, unbiased and reliable results could be produced in estimations. Our results portray that an inverted U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) is found to be valid. Additionally, income inequality has a negative impact on environmental degradation. Likewise, educational attainment and CO2 emissions are revealed to be negatively correlated. The findings of the study could provide a better understanding on the root causes of environmental degradation, and further suggest remedial actions to overcome the problem.

The survey found that a combination of barriers led to FDPs falling through the gaps of national Covid-19 vaccination campaigns, despite their heightened vulnerability to Covid-19 infection and transmission. Only one person out of the 1,914 FDPs surveyed reported receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. The survey also highlighted the significant indirect impacts of the pandemic on forcibly displaced families, and children specifically, with the socioeconomic aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic worsening displaced children's deprivations across health and nutrition, protection support, and education.

Surveillance for Violent Deaths - National Violent Death Reporting System, 42 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 2019	MMWR SURVEILLANCE SUMMARIES			English	Article							INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; UNITED-STATES; OVERDOSE DEATHS; ETHNIC DISPARITIES; HOMICIDES; PREVENTION; OPIOIDS; HEALTH; WOMEN; RISK	Problem/Condition: In 2019, approximately 67,000 persons died of violence-related injuries in the United States. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) on violent deaths that occurred in 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico in 2019. Results are reported by sex, age group, race and ethnicity, method of injury, type of location where the injury occurred, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics. Period Covered: 2019. Description of System: NVDRS collects data regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner and medical examiner records, and law enforcement reports. This report includes data collected for violent deaths that occurred in 2019. Data were collected from 39 states with statewide data (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming), three states with data from counties representing a subset of their population (30 California counties, representing 57% of its population, and 47 Illinois counties and 40 Pennsylvania counties, representing at least 80% of their populations), the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. NVDRS collates information for each violent death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, homicide followed by suicide, or multiple suicides) into a single incident. Results: For 2019, NVDRS collected information on 50,374 fatal incidents involving 51,627 deaths that occurred in 42 states (39 states collecting statewide data, 30 California counties, 47 Illinois counties, and 40 Pennsylvania counties), and the District of Columbia. In addition, information was collected for 831 fatal incidents involving 897 deaths in Puerto Rico. Data for Puerto Rico were analyzed separately. Of the 51,627 deaths, the majority (64.1%) were suicides, followed by homicides (25.1%), deaths of undetermined intent (8.7%), legal intervention deaths (1.4%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force acting in the line of duty, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (<1.0%). The term "legal intervention" is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement. Demographic patterns and circumstances varied by manner of death. The suicide rate was higher for males than for females. Across all age groups, the suicide rate was highest among adults aged 45-54 years. In addition, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) and non-Hispanic White (White) persons had the highest suicide rates among all racial and ethnic groups. Among males, the most common method of injury for suicide was a firearm, whereas poisoning was the most common method of injury among females. Among all suicide victims, suicide was most often preceded by a mental health, intimate partner, or physical health problem or by a recent or impending crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. The homicide rate was higher for males than for females. Among all homicide victims, the homicide rate was highest among persons aged 20-24 years compared with other age groups. Non-Hispanic Black (Black) males experienced the highest homicide rate of any racial or ethnic group. Among all homicide victims, the most common method of injury was a firearm. When the relationship between a homicide victim and a suspect was known, the suspect was most frequently an acquaintance or friend for male victims and a current or former intimate partner for female victims. Homicide most often was precipitated by an argument or conflict, occurred in conjunction with another crime, or, for female victims, was related to intimate partner violence. Nearly all victims of legal intervention deaths were male, and the legal intervention death rate was highest among men aged 25-29 years. The legal intervention death rate was highest among AI/AN males, followed by Black males. A firearm was used in the majority of legal intervention deaths. When a specific type of crime was known to have precipitated a legal intervention death, the type of crime was most frequently assault or homicide. The three most frequent circumstances reported for legal intervention deaths were as follows: the victim's death was precipitated by another crime, the victim used a weapon in the incident, and the victim had a mental health or substance use problem (other than alcohol use). Unintentional firearm deaths were most frequently experienced by males, White persons, and persons aged 15-24 years. These deaths most frequently occurred while the shooter was playing with a firearm and were precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger or mistakenly thinking the firearm was unloaded. The rate of deaths of undetermined intent was highest among males, particularly among Black and AI/AN males, and among adults aged 30-44 years. Poisoning was the most common method of injury in deaths of undetermined intent, and opioids were detected in nearly 80% of decedents tested for those substances. Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS on violent deaths that occurred in 2019. The suicide rate was highest among AI/AN and White males, whereas the homicide rate was highest among Black males. Mental health problems, intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, and acute life stressors were primary circumstances for multiple types of violent death. Public Health Action: Violence is preventable, and data can guide public health action. NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in developing, implementing, and evaluating programs, policies, and practices to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, the New Hampshire Violent Death Reporting System (VDRS), Indiana VDRS, and Colorado VDRS have used their VDRS data to guide suicide prevention efforts and generate reports highlighting where additional focus is needed. In New Hampshire, VDRS data have been used to monitor the increase in suicide rates during 2014-2018 and guide statewide collaborative prevention efforts. Indiana VDRS used local data to demonstrate differences in suicide and other related mental health problems among Black persons and highlight a need for improved suicide awareness and culturally competent mental health care. The Colorado VDRS conducted geospatial and demographic analysis, considering local VDRS data with existing suicide prevention efforts and resources, to identify regions with high suicide rates regions and populations at high risk for suicide. Similarly, states participating in NVDRS have used their VDRS data to examine related to homicide in their state. In North Carolina for example, where homicide rates among AI/AN and Black persons were approximately 2.5 times higher than the statewide homicide rate, the North Carolina VDRS program aims to partner with historically Black colleges and universities in the state to train researchers to use VDRS data to address health equity issues in and around their immediate community.

Interestingly, however, this debate has mostly overlooked the transnational aspects of these unintended consequences. This study examines one such aspect, namely the economic spillover of sanctions to neighboring countries. Our global vector autoregression oil and inventory model (GOVAR) simulations on Indonesia, a medium-level oil producer, indicate sanctions may spill over to its neighbors' domestic economy. The risk and nature of spillover varies with respect to the type of sanctions employed, timing of sanctions, and the macroeconomic indicator in the neighboring state in question. Equity markets appear especially susceptible to a contagion effect. Understanding how a sanction spills over to neighboring states can help sender states design sanctions that minimize regional disruptions.

It has also been seen as a social determinant of health. People whose sexual orientation is non-heterosexual or sexual minorities or sexually diverse are included in the broad umbrella term LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) which is a commonly used acronym in activism, social policy, and subsequently cultural literature. For this reason, this Commission focuses primarily on sexual orientation i.e. lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) groups. We have used terms non-heterosexual, sexual minorities or sexual variation interchangeably. We have not considered asexual individuals as research in the field is too limited. We are cognisant of the fact that topics relating to mental health and sexual orientation discussed in this Commission will intersect with other issues of personal, cultural and social identity, and will thus be relevant to individuals including many transgender individuals. The inclusion of mental health issues relevant to gender-diverse individuals as well as gender identity is important and deserves its own separate detailed discussion. The exact number of sexually diverse individuals in a population is often difficult to estimate but is likely to be somewhere around 5% of the population. Rates of various psychiatry disorders and suicidal ideation and acts of suicide in LGB populations are higher than general population and these have been attributed to minority stress hypothesis. Elimination of inequality in law can lead to reduction in psychiatric morbidity in these groups. However, these are all diverse groups but even within each group there is diversity and each individual has a distinct and unique experiences, upbringing, responses to their own sexual orientation, and generating varying responses from families, peers and friends as well as communities (including healthcare professionals). The mental healthcare needs of sexual minority individuals vary and these variations must be taken into account in design, development and delivery of healthcare and policies. Improving access to services will help engagement and outcomes and also reduce stigma. The commission recommends that there is no role for so-called conversion therapies and other recommendations are made for clinicians, researchers and policymakers.

J	Farber, R				Farber, Reya			Gender, health, and labor in Thailand's medical hub	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Medical tourism; Gender; Political economy of health; Health care; Globalization; Thailand; Transgender	TOURISM; WORKERS; STATE; CARE	As global economic and political conditions shift, Asian countries have placed technologies at the center of their development strategies, fostering new levels of wealth and expertise, but also generating new inequities. Among the most successful of these state-supported strategies have been efforts to develop and invest in new medical technologies, and recruit patients willing to travel across national borders for health care, in a process known as medical tourism. Medical tourism has afforded countries like Thailand greater wealth and prestige, and can also increase disparities for people in destination countries by encouraging specialized and privatized services catered towards wealthier patients. However, sparse research has focused on how these state strategies to promote medical tourism affect the health outcomes of people in destination countries, nor on the gendered labor that supports these state strategies. This article fills these gaps by analyzing medical tourism in Thailand as a gendered techno-development strategy, or a state-sponsored initiative which incorporates gendered labor and technologies, while also creating gendered health inequities. The article bridges a political economy approach to global health with gendered analyses of health and labor. The analysis draws on 14 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Thailand, conducted in 2016 and 2017-2018, and in-depth interviews with 62 participants. It illuminates the gendered labor relations that help foster state development strategies such as medical tourism, as well as gendered health outcomes for people in a destination country.

Based on a qualitative study conducted between February 2020 and January 2021 with allo-HSCT recipients, their family caregivers and healthcare professionals, we examined the social, economic and cultural factors shaping the patients' complex experience. We have called this kind of State-sponsored intra-national medical transfer "overseas therapeutic mobility". The patients' experience of this therapeutic journey beyond their geographical and cultural frontiers has some similarities with transnational therapeutic mobility. Overseas therapeutic mobility to undergo highly technical treatment requires considerable logistic efforts and mobility skills. The remoteness of their families and their affective and cultural environment give mobile patients a feeling of disorientation and causes them much social suffering. The two-fold condition of being a sick person with a possibly lethal disease and being treated overseas can be regarded as a double ordeal. In addition, the unfunded costs place a heavy burden on the patients and those whose families have limited resources. This study points to the cleavages which occur between post-colonial overseas regions and mainland France, and the territorial inequalities existing in patients' access to specialized treatment due to French policies of healthcare centralization.

J	Belay, DG; Chilot, D; Asratie, MH				Belay, Daniel Gashaneh; Chilot, Dagmawi; Asratie, Melaku Hunie			Spatiotemporal distribution and determinants of open defecation among households in Ethiopia: <i>A Mixed effect and spatial analysis</i>	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRIEF CONCEPTUAL TUTORIAL; SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; INEQUALITIES; WATER	Background Open defecation is the disposal of human faeces in the fields, forests, bushes, and open bodies of water. It is practiced more in sub-Saharan African countries and is considered a sign of underdevelopment. Open defecation facilitates the transmission of pathogens that cause diarrheal diseases which is the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease. In Ethiopia, it kills half a million under-five children annually. Even though open defecation practice is a major cause of childhood mortality and morbidity in Ethiopia, there is minimal evidence on the trend, spatiotemporal distribution, wealth-related inequalities, and other determinates of open defecation practice. Objectives Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the trend, spatiotemporal distribution, and determinants of open defecation among households in Ethiopia. Methods Cross-sectionally collected secondary data analysis was conducted based on 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A total weighted sample of 16,554 households was included. We assessed the 16 years (2000-2016) trend of open defecation with 95% confidence intervals. Data were weighted, recoded, cleaned, and analyzed using STATA version 14.2 software. A mixed-effect analysis was employed to identify factors contributing to open defecation practice in Ethiopia. In the final multivariable analysis, the associations between dependent and independent variables were presented using adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals with a p-value of <0.05. The concentration index was used to assess wealth-related inequalities, while spatial analysis was used to explore the spatial distribution and significant windows of open defecation practice. Results The trend of open defecation practice in Ethiopia was significantly decreased from 81.96% (95% CI: 81.08, 82.8) in 2000 EDHS, to 32.23% (95% CI: 31.16, 33.31) in 2016 EDHS. Individual-level factors such as; age, educational attainment, marital status, media exposure, wealth status, and source of drinking water, as well as community-level factors such as residence, region, community-level poverty, and community level media usage, had a significant association. Open defecation practice was significantly and disproportionately concentrated on the poor households [C = -0.669; 95% CI: -0.716, -0.622]. A non-random open defecation practice was observed in Ethiopia. Among the 11 regions, primary clusters were identified in only 3 regions (Afar, Somali, and Eastern Amhara) Conclusion Open defecation practice remains a public health problem irrespective of the significant decrease seen in Ethiopia for the past 16 years. Individual and community-level factors had a significant association with this problem. Since it is a leading cause of under-five children mortality and morbidity, the Ethiopian ministry of health should plan and work on basic sanitation programs that focus on the poorest communities, rural societies, and small peripheral regions. These programs should include regional planning for sanitation, and translation of materials into local languages to prevent under-five mortality and morbidity due to diarrheal diseases caused by open defecation.

J	Ai, FL; Wan, X				Ai, Feiling; Wan, Xia			Gini coefficient decomposition-based and mortality-rate-difference-based description of mortality causes in the Chinese population from 1991 to 2019: a retrospective cross-sectional surveillance study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						EPIDEMIOLOGY; PUBLIC HEALTH; STATISTICS & RESEARCH METHODS	SUICIDE RATES; GLOBAL BURDEN; DISEASE; TRENDS; REGISTRATION; INEQUALITY; SYSTEM; URBAN	Objectives Improved national Disease Surveillance Points systems (DSPs) in China have clarified mortality causes in the Chinese population. This study aimed to investigate the variations and drivers of multiple mortality causes. Design This was a retrospective cross-sectional surveillance study. Setting Original data in 1991 and 2000, and secondary data in 2010 and 2019 were collected from DSPs across China. Participants Standardised mortality rates (SMRs) and crude mortality rates (CMRs) of the Chinese population in 1991, 2000, 2010 and 2019 were ascertained. Main outcome measures Changes in the Gini coefficients (G), computed using SMR, were decomposed into reranking (R) and proportionality (P) to identify variations in communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases (CMNN); non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injury. The CMR difference (in %) was partitioned into the demographic structure and non-demographic factors using the mortality-rate-difference method. Results From 1991 to 2019, the overall CMR increased from 591.327/100 000 to 674.505/100 000, whereas the SMR continually decreased. An increasing concentration of NCDs contributed to the increased all-cause G from 0.443 to 0.560 during 1991-2019. Between 1991 and 2019, compared with CMNN (R=0.054) and NCDs (R=0.037), the ranking of injury changed the most (R=0.174). The ranking of diabetes, falls and road traffic accidents increased markedly over time. The decreased SMR of NCDs (P=-0.013) was mainly due to low-ranking causes, whereas changes in CMNN (P=0.003) and injury (P=0.131) were due to high-ranking causes. All-cause CMR increased by 14.06% from 1991 to 2019 due to greater contributions from the demographic structure (68.46%) than the non-demographic factors (-54.40%). Demographic structural changes accounted more for CMR increases in males (70.52%) and urban populations (75.58%). Conclusions Prevention and control measures targeting NCDs and specific causes are imperatively needed, and should be strengthened as the population ages, especially for males and rural populations.

J	Calyx, C; Finlay, SM				Calyx, Cobi; Finlay, Summer May			Improving a framework for evaluating participatory science	EVALUATION			English	Article						'citizen science'; decolonisation; evaluation; 'Indigenous data sovereignty'; participatory; science	CITIZEN SCIENCE; HEALTH	This article proposes improvements to an open framework for evaluating participatory science, including projects framed as citizen science. An original proposed framework, while valuable in its comprehensiveness, used problematic language that makes it unworkable in many international contexts. In countries like Australia where Indigenous data sovereignty matters profoundly, language about 'target groups' and 'easing access' to knowledge can harmfully perpetuate colonial discourses. The original proposed framework is sufficiently useful that it is worth constructively revising, so critique in this article is aimed towards collaborative progression of an open framework more suitable for international use. As well as replacing 'target groups' with partnership approaches, we argue that 'easing access' to knowledge for exploitation is a frame perpetuating the colonial doctrine of discovery, proposing recovery as an alternative aligned with several international movements for social justice and sustainability.

The empirical literature finds that individuals with higher levels of education experience lower risks of poor health outcomes compared to individuals with less education. Outstanding to this literature is the examination of a dimension of education - literacy - and its association with health. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between literacy (reading, numeracy) and health (self-reported health). We use data from the 2012 wave of the Canadian Longitudinal International Survey of Adults (LISA). The LISA includes rich information on health, broader sociodemographic characteristics (income, age, sex, etc.) as well as information on literacy skills from the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Using logistic regression, we first reaffirm the association between education and self-reported health. We then find that after controlling for measures of literacy, understood as proficiency in reading and numeracy, the magnitude of effect of education on health is reduced. Skills in literacy reduce the risk of reporting poor health, but only for the older subset of respondents (ages 40-65). Our results suggest that literacy should not be understated in empirical research on education and health, and in fact serve to sharpen our understanding of how education impacts health by drawing attention to indirect pathways.

While most cities are situated close to water, whether inland waterways, lakes, or the sea, these blue spaces are not integrated into urban planning to their full potential and their public health impacts are not always recognised by planning authorities. Furthermore, cities face future challenges regarding climate change, socio-economic developments like tourism, urbanization, and rising social inequalities. The development of healthy blue spaces can support cities in their pursuit of ways to confront these challenges. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary analyses of the local impacts of these trends and promising interventions have been scarce to date. This study explores the use of such methodology by presenting experiences related to five European cities: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Plymouth, Tallinn and Thessaloniki, using an interactive and participative approach with local experts and stakeholders. Future scenarios have been developed based on the question: How can blue spaces contribute to a healthier city population, given the long term trends? The results highlight the importance of addressing the local context when seeking sustainable solutions for cities. The future scenarios deliver information that could serve as useful input for local planning processes.

Despite a favourable rhetoric for cycling, in many cities in Latin America, its uptake has gained more traction among younger and carless populations than frequent users of private motorised vehicles. Recognising this reality, our article poses arguments for cycling beyond its classic benefits via direct comparisons of its performance against that of private cars. Our paper compares cycling and car-based trips, presenting evidence in cycling for policy and decision-making targeting a demand segment that has historically been more resistant to modal shifts to sustainable mobility. We contrast performance of both modes in relation to coverage and accessibility, testing different modal shift scenarios in the context of Bogot ' a, Colombia's capital city. As a city that has been recognised in the international literature for both its successes in urban transport policy and its persisting mobility and access inequalities, Bogota's contrasts are an ideal setting for this research. We build on a geo-coded household travel survey for 2015 and API-sourced datasets to develop spatial coverage and potential accessibility metrics for cycling and car-based trips. Findings suggest Bogota's large potential for further increases in cycling, particularly from car-users, which can lead to overall societal gains in terms of sustainable accessibility and present a fertile ground for bike-sharing systems. The paper builds on spatially and socially distributed findings to identify areas with the highest potential for bike-sharing in Bogota	[Oviedo, Daniel; Sabogal-Cardona, Orlando] UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit, London, England; [Oviedo, Daniel] UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England	University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London	Oviedo, D (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Dev Planning Unit, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.	daniel.oviedo@ucl.ac.uk; orlando.sabogal.20@ucl.ac.uk	Oviedo Hernandez, Daniel/AGJ-6328-2022	Sabogal-Cardona, Orlando/0000-0002-9711-0411; Oviedo Hernandez, Daniel/0000-0002-5692-6633					80	7	7	4	20	ELSEVIER SCI LTD	London	125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND	0966-6923	1873-1236		J TRANSP GEOGR	J.

However, being from an advantaged family and a more affluent school seemed to have a protective function. The negative association between inequality and belonging was lower for students from more affluent families and schools. This study showed the importance of income inequality on school belonging and highlighted the roles played by socioeconomic resources in buffering inequality's potentially harmful consequences. Students' school belonging is critical to overall functioning. Most past studies of school belonging's antecedents focused on individual-level and proximal environmental factors, neglecting broader socioecological factors such as income inequality. Hence, this study examined whether income inequality is associated with students' school belonging. We further examined whether having high socioeconomic status could buffer the harmful consequences of income inequality on school belonging. We drew on 822,230 students' survey responses from 65 countries/regions using 3 waves of data (2000; 2003; and 2012) from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). Multilevel and cross-temporal analyses were used. Results showed that country-level income inequality in the past year was associated with lower school belonging, controlling for other variables at the country, school, and student-levels. School and family socioeconomic status moderated the effects of inequality. More specifically, for students in more affluent schools and more advantaged families, the association between inequality and belonging was weaker. This study demonstrates the importance of income inequality and the buffering role played by socioeconomic status in school belonging. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Psychosocial and Vocational Impacts of COVID-19 on People With and Without Disabilities	REHABILITATION PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						COVID-19; chronic illness; disabilities; employment; psychosocial	MENTAL-HEALTH; UNEMPLOYMENT; EMPLOYMENT; OUTBREAK; DISEASE; WORK; LIFE	Purpose/Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to devastating economic impacts and psychosocial changes for individuals around the world, including people with chronic illness and disabilities (CID). This study explored the impacts on employment and how it related to stress and satisfaction with life during COVID-19 between people with and without CID. Research Method/Design: A cross-sectional study design was used with 1,380 adults from 20 countries who were employed before the COVID-19 pandemic, including 318 people with CID. Statistical methods (i.e., descriptive statistics, chi-square analyses, two-way analysis of variances) were used to analyze the time, employment, group, and interaction effects. Results: There were three main findings. (1) Compared with those without CID, individuals with CID were more likely to have their employment impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and they were more often laid off or dismissed from their job. (2) Individuals with CID reported significantly higher stress and lower life satisfaction compared with those without CID during the COVID-19 pandemic regardless of its impacts on employment. (3) Individuals whose employment was impacted reported significantly lower life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic regardless of their CID status. Conclusion/Implications: Findings highlight the employment and psychosocial impacts of a global pandemic and provide implications for moving forward in regards to vocational and psychosocial intervention services and supports that will be needed, especially for those with CID. Impact and Implications This study extends existing literature by analyzing impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across the globe on employment and psychosocial outcomes (i.e., stress and life satisfaction) for people with chronic illness and disability (CID) compared with those without CID and informs research and practices for supporting those who have been adversely impacted. Given the significant negative impacts of COVID-19 on employment for individuals with CID in comparison with those without CID, vocational rehabilitation agencies should provide vocational supports for individuals with CID and work to develop new employment options. Researchers and practitioners should develop effective vocational and psychosocial intervention strategies (e.g., through telehealth) to resolve global employment and mental health issues related to COVID-19 to minimize inequality between individuals with and without CID and improve their quality of life.

Despite significant efforts made, limited research ideas are conceptualised and implemented in low-resource settings to tackle diseases of poverty, and this is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa. There is strong evidence to show that the barriers to locally led research do not vary largely between disease, study type and location and can be largely solved by addressing these common gaps. The European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was established in 2003 as a European response to the global health crisis caused by the three main poverty-related diseases HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. EDCTP has established a model of long-term sustainable capacity development integrated into clinical trials which addresses this lack of locally led research in sub-Saharan Africa, supporting the development of individual and institutional capacity and research outputs that change the management, prevention and treatment of poverty-related and neglected infectious diseases across Africa. In recognition of emergent data on what the barriers and enablers are to long-term, sustainable capabilities to run studies, EDCTP formed a new collaboration with The Global Health Network (TGHN) in September 2017, with the aim to make a set of cross-cutting tools and resources to support the planning, writing and delivery of high-quality clinical trials available to research staff wherever they are in the world, especially those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) via TGHN platform. These new resources developed on the 'EDCTP Knowledge Hub' are those identified in the mixed method study described in this commentary as being key to addressing the gaps that the research community report as the most limiting elements in their ability to design and implement studies. The Knowledge Hub aims to make these tools freely available to any potential health research team in need of support and guidance in designing and running their own studies, particularly in low-resource settings. The purpose is to provide open access to the specific guidance, information and tools these teams cannot otherwise access freely. Ultimately, this will enable them to design and lead their own high-quality studies addressing local priorities with global alignment, generating new data that can change health outcomes in their communities.

Healthcare accessibility in preconflict Syria: a comparative spatial analysis	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						Health services administration & management; organisation of health services; international health services; public health	TYPE-2 DIABETES-MELLITUS; INTEGRATED APPROACH; ACCESS; CONFLICT; SERVICES; COMMISSION; INQUIRY; SICHUAN; SECTOR; REFORM	Introduction There is scarce information about the allocation of health resources in Syria. Pre-existing inequalities were further intensified after the 2011 conflict which displaced over 50% of the population. This study provides an analysis of health inequalities in Syria focusing on spatial access to public hospitals and employs data from 2010, just prior to the outbreak of conflict. Establishing a preconflict snapshot of the health system could serve as a helpful baseline assessment for future studies to measure the impact of the conflict on the health system. Such information could also offer systematic data to guide postconflict reconstruction efforts. Methods We compared two methods to quantify the inpatient bed access: provider to population ratio (PPR) and two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. We compared PPR calculated at the governorate level with population weighted 2SFCA score calculated at a resolution of 2 km by 2 km. We then aggregated at the governorate level, tested multiple catchment sizes and calculated Gini coefficient for each governorate. Results We found high inequality in access to public hospitals across and within governorates, especially in the north and eastern regions, where all governorates ranked in the lowest two quintiles using both PPR and 2SFCA. Relatively small governorates in the west and the south had higher spatial access and less inequality. Testing variability in catchment size showed that even at 125 km catchment, 65% of the country had accessibility below national average. Conclusion Methodologically, the use of 2SFCA provided more nuanced insights about hospital bed allocation than PPR. 2SFCA was able to account for the cross-boundary effect and road network quality. Realistic representation of health accessibility is possible in data-scarce settings such as Syria and could be adapted to assess health access inequalities in conflict and postconflict settings.

Little is known about the overall historical trends in AI/AN opioid-only and opioid/polysubstance-related mortality. This study will address this gap. Design This is a retrospective longitudinal ecological study. Setting US death records from 1999 to 2019 using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. Participants US non-Hispanic AI/AN people age 12 years and older. Measures The primary outcomes, identified via the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems codes, included overdose deaths due to (1) opioids only, opioids in combination with any other substance, all-opioid related overdoses; (2) combinations of opioids and alcohol, opioids and methamphetamine, opioids and cocaine, opioids and benzodiazepines; and (3) specific types of opioids. Results From 1999 to 2019, opioid-only mortality rates increased from 2.8 to 15.8 per 100 000 (p<0.001) for AI/AN women and 4.6 to 25.6 per 100 000 (p<0.001) for AI/AN men. All opioid-related mortality rates increased significantly (p<0.001) from 5.2 to 33.9 per 100 000 AI/AN persons, 3.9 to 26.1 for women and 6.5 to 42.1 for men. AI/AN also exhibited significant increases in mortality rates due to opioids and alcohol, opioids and benzodiazepines, opioids and methamphetamine, and AI/AN men experienced substantial increases in mortality due to opioids and cocaine. Mortality rates by individual opioid types increased significantly over time for heroin, natural and semi-synthetic (prescription), and synthetic opioids (fentanyl/fentanyl analogues) other than methadone. Conclusions These findings highlight magnification over time in opioid-related deaths and may point to broader systemic factors that may disproportionately affect members of AI/AN communities and drive inequities.

The impact of regional characteristics on development in early childhood beyond family SEP has been rarely investigated. This study aimed to identify regional predictors of global developmental delay at school entry taking family SEP into consideration.& nbsp;Method: We used representative, population-based data from mandatory school entry examinations of the German federal state of Brandenburg in 2018/2019 with n=22,801 preschool children. By applying binary multilevel models, we hierarchically analyzed the effect of regional deprivation defined by the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD) and rurality operationalized as inverted population density of the children's school district on global developmental delay (GDD) while adjusting for family SEP (low, medium and high).& nbsp;Results: Family SEP was significantly and strongly linked to GDD. Children with the highest family SEP showed a lower odds for GDD compared to a medium SEP (female: OR=4.26, male: OR=3.46) and low SEP (female: OR=16.58, male: OR=12.79). Furthermore, we discovered a smaller, but additional and independent effect of regional socioeconomic deprivation on GDD, with a higher odds for children from a more deprived school district (female: OR=1.35, male: OR=1.20). However, rurality did not show a significant link to GDD in preschool children beyond family SEP and regional deprivation.& nbsp;Conclusion: Family SEP and regional deprivation are risk factors for child development and of particular interest to promote health of children in early childhood and over the life course.

Decomposing consumer and producer effects on sugar from beverage purchases after a sugar-based tax on beverages in South Africa	ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Decomposition; Health Promotion Levy; South AfricaSugar; Sugar-Sweetened Beverages; Tax	SWEETENED BEVERAGES; CHILDHOOD OVERWEIGHT; ENERGY-INTAKE; CONSUMPTION; OBESITY; FRUCTOSE; HEALTH; FOOD; REFORMULATION; PROMOTION	Growing global concern about obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases has raised interest in fiscal policy as a tool to reduce this disease burden and its social costs, especially excise taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Of particular interest have been nutrient-based taxes to improve diet quality. These can incentivize producers to reformulate existing products and introduce healthier alternatives into their ranges. In 2018, South Africa adopted a sugar-based tax on SSBs, the Health Promotion Levy (HPL). Early findings suggest that purchases of higher-sugar taxable beverages fell and purchases of no-and lower-sugar beverages increased, alongside significant reductions in the sugar content of overall beverage purchases. However, underlying these changes are consumption shifts as well as product reformulation and changes in producers' product portfolios. Drawing on a household scanner dataset, this study employed a descriptive approach to decompose changes in the sugar content of households' non-alcoholic beverage purchases into producer factors (reformulation and product entry and exit) and consumer factors (product switching and volume changes as a result of price changes, changing preferences, or other factors). We look at these factors as the tax was announced and implemented across a sample of over 3000 South African households, and then by Living Standard Measures (LSM) groups (middle vs. high). The sugar content of beverage purchases fell by 4.9 g/capita/day overall, a 32% decrease. Taken in isolation, consumer switching and volume changes together led to a reduction equivalent to 71% of the total change, while reformulation accounted for a decrease equal to 34% of that change. Middle-LSM households experienced larger reductions than high-LSM households due to larger changes on the consumer side. For both LSM groups, reformulation-led reductions mostly occurred after implementation, and most changes came from taxable beverage purchases. As sugary drink tax designs evolve with broader implementation globally, under -standing both supply-and demand-side factors will help to better assess the population and equity potential of these policies.

J	Kim, DJ; Kim, AI				Kim, Dong Jin; Kim, Andrew Ikhyun			Global health diplomacy and North Korea in the COVID-19 era	INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article						global health diplomacy; humanitarian assistance; COVID-19; international sanctions; North Korea	SELF-INTEREST	This article uses global health diplomacy to examine the challenges and opportunities of international health aid to North Korea in the COVID-19 era. It finds that vaccine provision is both within the enlightened self-interest of donor states and meets the global responsibility to address unequal access to vaccines. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed increasing global inequality in responding to the issues of health. How do we resolve the tension between normative concerns for global responsibility and strategic concerns for national interest in facilitating health aid to vulnerable populations in low-income countries in the COVID-19 era? This article presents global health diplomacy as a conceptual framework that could overcome thedichotomy of humanitarianism and international politics, using health aid to North Korea during COVID-19 as a case-study. Health is a critical component of human dignity and can be a normative motivation for cooperation beyond sovereign borders. However, health is also an important element of national interest and can be a strategic motivation for transnational cooperation. The overlap between the moral and rational spaces in global health diplomacy demonstrates how COVID-19 assistance to North Korea's vulnerable population is in the enlightened self-interest of donors to prevent resurgences of new COVID-19 variants. Moreover, this framework imbues all parties, including aid recipients such as North Korea, with the global cooperative responsibility to address health. In this sense, global health diplomacy can reframe the tensions between humanitarianism and politics, morality and rationality, and cosmopolitanism and nationalism, from antithetical to complementary.

Relative to whites and higher-income groups, racial-ethnic minority and lower-income Americans also frequently express greater concern about high-profile global environmental threats like climate change, but they are widely misperceived as being less concerned about these issues than white and higher-income Americans. We use new survey research to explore public perceptions of COVID-19-another global threat marked by substantial racial, ethnic, and class disparities-finding a distinct pattern of misperceptions regarding groups' concerns. We then discuss how these misperceptions represent a unique form of social misinformation that may pose a threat to science and undermine the cooperation and trust needed to address collective problems.

J	Janzwood, A; Millar, H				Janzwood, Amy; Millar, Heather			Bridge fuel feuds: The competing interpretive politics of natural gas in Canada	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Carbon lock-in; Climate policy; Energy transitions; Fossil fuels; Framing; Natural gas	LOW-CARBON PATHWAYS; CLIMATE POLITICS; ENERGY; POLICY; FRACKING; EMISSIONS; DECARBONIZATION; PERCEPTIONS; TRANSITIONS; INNOVATION	Fossil fuel proponents and governments have framed natural gas as a "bridge fuel" necessary for a smooth global energy transition. However, environmental and climate justice groups warn that natural gas will lock in high carbon pathways, in addition to creating significant environmental harms and health risks for affected communities. This contestation around the framing of natural gas reflects a process of interpretive politics, namely the struggle of different actors to define policy problems and present potential solutions to influence policy outcomes. We explore the interpretive politics of natural gas in Canada by analyzing government climate plans and press releases produced by industry associations and other relevant, primarily non-governmental, organizations in the post-Paris era. We identify three distinct variations of the bridge fuel narrative around the purported clean energy benefits of natural gas driven by industry associations and provincial governments. Though the language of clean energy benefits is spreading, the meaning varies significantly by regional context. The malleable position of natural gas as a source of interpretive contestation has important implications for future coalition-building and decarbonization.

Prior to the pandemic, health systems in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) were particularly stretched and vulnerable. The International Society of Global Health (ISoGH) sought to systematically identify priorities for health research that would have the potential to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. Methods The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method was used to identify COVID-19-related research priorities. All ISoGH members were invited to participate. Seventy-nine experts in clinical, translational, and population research contributed 192 research questions for consideration. Fifty-two experts then scored those questions based on five pre-defined criteria that were selected for this exercise: 1) feasibility and answerability; 2) potential for burden reduction; 3) potential for a paradigm shift; 4) potential for translation and implementation; and 5) impact on equity. Results Among the top 10 research priorities, research questions related to vaccination were prominent: health care system access barriers to equitable uptake of COVID-19 vaccination (ranked 1st), determinants of vaccine hesitancy (4th), development and evaluation of effective interventions to decrease vaccine hesi-tancy (5th), and vaccination impacts on vulnerable population/s (6th). Health care delivery questions also ranked highly, including: effective strategies to manage COVID-19 globally and in LMICs (2nd) and in-tegrating health care for COVID-19 with other essential health services in LMICs (3rd). Additionally, the assessment of COVID-19 patients' needs in rural areas of LMICs was ranked 7th, and studying the leading socioeconomic determinants and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs using multi-faceted approaches was ranked 8th. The remaining questions in the top 10 were: clarifying paediatric case-fatality rates (CFR) in LMICs and identifying effective strategies for community engagement against COVID-19 in different LMIC contexts. Interpretation Health policy and systems research to inform COVID-19 vaccine uptake and equitable access to care are urgently needed, especially for rural, vulnerable, and/or marginalised populations. This research should occur in parallel with studies that will identify approaches to minimise vaccine hesitan-cy and effectively integrate care for COVID-19 with other essential health services in LMICs. ISoGH calls on the funders of health research in LMICs to consider the urgency and priority of this research during the COVID-19 pandemic and support studies that could make a positive difference for the populations of LMICs.

However, today most streets are unilaterally used and designed likewise. Car-centred spatial distribution is currently being questioned in the course of urban densification and in light of climate and ecological challenges. The presented work focuses on a multi-layered transformation of streetscapes towards a multi-purpose social and ecological space, which goes beyond a mere redistribution of space and functions. This paper draws from the results of an interdisciplinary research project headed by the Institute of Landscape Architecture (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna). The Viennese situation is aligned with international trends. The research includes comparative analysis of streetscapes in Vienna and comparable cities, literature reviews, collaborative workshops and qualitative interviews. As a result, progressive layout specifications and quality aspects for future streets are proposed and presented in extracts. Furthermore, the goal of green space social equity is linked. The paper concludes by arguing for comprehensive consideration and redesign of streetscapes as one promising puzzle to counteract the evident challenges of climate change in urban settings. Its range reaches from small scale microclimatic improvements up to citywide provision of accessible, useable, ecologically sound and sustainable public space with new standards for streets as potential backbone.

International reference pricing of pharmaceuticals in the United States: Implications for potentially curative treatment	JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE & SPECIALTY PHARMACY			English	Article							DRUGS; IMPACT; POLICY	Recent federal drug price control proposals have included mechanisms to benchmark US prices to international prices. These international price referencing (IRP) proposals recommend that the US government develop an index based on prices paid by a group of higher-income countries and restrict US prices to a narrow range of the index. IRP is a policy tool used across the globe to control drug costs, particularly in markets in which health care resources are limited. If IRP is implemented in the United States, where the drug industry derives roughly 50% of global pharmaceutical sates, what impact might it have on innovation and access? In this brief commentary, we explore this question in the context of cell and gene therapies (CGTs) (evolving therapeutics that have high clinical potential as well as uncertainty and risk). Many CGTs are in development, and the world faces a challenge in providing access. Pressure to provide access to patients who would benefit may create greater global concerns about health equity and access. We conclude that an IRP policy in the United States might exacerbate access problems to promising CGTs and impact innovation and population health.

This study mainly aims to investigate spatiotemporal trends in LE in 134 countries from 1960 to 2016 by using Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling. Further, the relations between per capita gross domestic product (GDPpc) and population-weighted fine particulate matter (pwPM2.5) and LE are investigated from a global perspective from 1998 to 2016 by using the Bayesian regression model. The results illustrated the heterogeneity of spatiotemporal trends in LE globally. Specifically, Africa and South-East Asia show much lower LE levels, and the Americas, European, and Western Pacific exhibit a relatively higher LE level compared to the overall level. The countries with low overall levels of LE show a relatively stronger upward trend than the overall upward trend and vice versa. In addition, this study demonstrates that the spatial differences in effects of influence factors on LE in the six WHO regions in the 134 countries. Africa shows the highest positive regression coefficient of GDPpc and lowest negative regression coefficient of pwPM2.5 on LE than other regions in the world. Furthermore, it shows the complexity of the interaction between economic growth and air pollution on LE across six WHO regions. Our findings suggest the public policies to reduce the health damage caused by air pollution, especially in Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, and Europe where the pwPM2.5 negatively affect the LE benefits from economic growth.

Public mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: impacts on children's rights	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						Children's rights; mental health; public health; COVID-19; pandemic	ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES; ADOLESCENTS; DISORDERS; CONNECTEDNESS; INEQUALITIES; SYMPTOMS; PROMOTE; SUPPORT; SCHOOL; PEER	Restrictions on social and economic activities imposed by governments around the world in response to COVID-19, including the closure of schools and childcare facilities, have had a detrimental impact on children's mental health and wellbeing. Initial responses to support mental health during the pandemic have largely focussed on immediate support and crisis management. However, as governments plan for recovery from the pandemic it is important to focus on the wider determinants of children's mental health including their relationships and the environments and societies in which they live in order to prevent a future global mental health crisis. This narrative review draws on the Independent Children's Rights Impact Assessment on the response to COVID-19 in Scotland to evaluate how the measures implemented by the Scottish Government have impacted on children's rights related to the wider determinants of mental health. The review reflects on the indivisibility of both children's rights and the different aspects of children's lives, particularly when considering issues such as mental health. Using the Scottish context as an exemplar, it highlights the value of a rights-based framework for providing a holistic view that can inform preventative approaches to support better mental health among children in the future.

J	Marshall, S; Taylor, K; Tödt, S				Marshall, Shelley; Taylor, Kate; Todt, Sara			Gendered Distributive Injustice in Production Networks: Implications for the Regulation of Precarious Work	INDUSTRIAL LAW JOURNAL			English	Article							HOME-BASED WORKERS; GLOBAL PRODUCTION NETWORKS; WOMEN HOMEWORKERS; LABOR AGENCY; HEALTH; GEOGRAPHIES; MARKETS	This paper is concerned with how precarious work in gendered production networks can be regulated to address distributional injustices-examining the regulation of homework in Thailand as a case study. The contribution of this paper is to empirically analyse these outcomes of the organisation and governance of production as gendered distributional injustices. The analytic extends the distributive analysis employed by Shamir by applying feminist global production network scholarship developed by scholars such as Anne Tallontire, Catherine Dolan, Sally Smith, Wilma Dunaway and Stephanie Barrientos. Our aim is to capture the complex ways in which distributional injustices are created in gendered production networks by examining both distributional asymmetries between homeworkers and other actors along the value chain (vertical dynamics), as well as the way that local gender relations shape the social undervaluation of women's home-based work (horizontal dynamics). We draw on rich empirical research to describe these distributional asymmetries for homeworkers in the North-East of Thailand who repair faults in fishing net production for global markets. A handful of countries in the Economic South have reformed labour regulation to address capitalist innovation resulting in new models of production and accumulation. Thailand joined these ranks in 2010, but this has gone without notice in the comparative labour regulation literature. We interrogate the extent that the gendered distributional injustices we identify are corrected through the interventions of Thai labour regulation. We compare the Thai approach with International Labour Organisation Convention 177 (1996) Homework (referred to herein as the ILO Homework Convention or C177). We conclude by suggesting ways that the Thai approach could be strengthened, drawing in places on examples of labour regulation advances in other countries.

Assessing the Consequences of External Reference Pricing for Global Access to Medicines and Innovation: Economic Analysis and Policy Implications	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						External Reference Pricing; Patient Access; Pharmaceutical Innovation; Price Regulation; U; S; Worldwide	COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; REDUCED EJECTION FRACTION; CHRONIC HEART-FAILURE; SACUBITRIL-VALSARTAN; MARKET-SIZE; PHARMACEUTICALS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; HYPERTENSION; COMBINATION; EXPENDITURE	Background: External reference pricing (ERP) is used to set pharmaceutical prices to improve affordability, but its application may have negative consequences on patient access-thus, equity-across countries and on global innovation. With the United States contemplating ERP, negative effects could be magnified. Our aim: identify and quantify some major consequences of ERP. Research design, methods: Besides relying on databases and ERP modelling, we developed a heart failure case study. 4-step approach: 1) review ERP policies; 2) establish worldwide "price corridor"; 3) quantify patient access and health outcomes impact by ERP; 4) estimate ERP impact on innovation.Results: Our ERP referencing analysis highlights its perverse effects especially in lower-income countries. As counterstrategies to protect their revenues, manufacturers often implement tight list price corridors or launch avoidance/delays. Consequences include suboptimal patient access-hence, worse outcomes-illustrated by our case study: 500,000 + QALYs health loss. Additionally, the ensuing revenue reduction would likely cause innovation loss by one additional medicine that would have benefitted future patients.Conclusion: This research provides key insights on potential unintentional consequences of medicine price setting by ERP worldwide and under a new proposal for the United States. Our results can inform stakeholder discussions to improve patient access to innovative medicines globally.

J	Kelleher, D; Doherty, E; O'Neill, C				Kelleher, Dan; Doherty, Edel; O'Neill, Ciaran			Examining the transnational preventive healthcare utilisation of a group of Eastern European migrants living full-time in another European state	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Migrant health; Migrant preventive care utilisation; Transnational healthcare utilisation; Ireland; Poland; Europe	REPUBLIC-OF-IRELAND; SERVICES; ACCESS; INEQUALITIES; BORN	Migrants in Europe are shown to have consistently lower uptake of preventive healthcare compared to European host populations. This paper examines how the transnational preventive care use of Eastern European migrants in their country of origin may be associated with preventive care uptake in their European host country. Preventive care use data in Ireland was collected on 119 Polish migrants and 123 native Irish from June 2018 to September 2019. Preventive care use data was also collected on the Polish migrant group in Poland during the same period. Preventive care use was captured by examining general practitioner visits, blood or urine test uptake, and cancer screening uptake. Probit models were first estimated to examine whether the Polish migrants were more or less likely to have used each service in Ireland than the native Irish. Second, three bivariate probit models were estimated to examine the use of each service by the Polish migrants only in Ireland and Poland as the two dependant variables. The Polish migrants are less likely to have GP visits, blood or urine test uptake, and cancer screening uptake in Ireland compared to the native Irish. The Polish migrants from this study are also shown to potentially substitute blood or urine test uptake in Ireland for uptake in Poland. Transnational ties can determine the preventive care utilisation of migrants in Europe.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Through in-depth interviews with those centrally involved in the case, interviews with criminal justice professionals currently working with video evidence of violent crime, and review of official documents and media reports, we explore the complex role video evidence played in this case and the legacy it continues to have in society, the justice system, and in the individual lives of those involved twenty-five years later. Two primary sources of harm arose in our analysis: critogenic harm related to the use of video evidence in the justice process; and harm arising from the media publicity surrounding the video evidence. Both of these sources of harm intensified the trauma for victims and their families, and contributed to distress and trauma reactions of criminal justice professionals and members of the jury. Given the global increase in the use of video-evidence in criminal justice processes, it is imperative that continuing harms to those involved in the process are considered and mitigated.

We argue that Indigenous peoples share the experience of colonization and its social and psychological consequences. We develop this argument across four sections: (a) the global history of colonization and social inequalities; (b) aspects concerning identity and group processes, including the intergenerational transmission of shared values, the connection with nature, and the promotion of social change; (c) prejudice and discrimination toward Indigenous peoples and the role of psychological processes to improve relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples; and (d) the impact of historical trauma and colonialism on dimensions including cognition, mental health, and the well-being of Indigenous peoples as well as the basis for successful interventions that integrate Indigenous knowledge. Finally, we address future challenges for research on these topics.

Curing Coma Campaign Contributing	Ethics Priorities of the Curing Coma Campaign: An Empirical Survey	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Coma; End-of-life; Ethics; Disorders of consciousness	DISORDERS; HEALTH	Background The Curing Coma Campaign (CCC) is a multidisciplinary global initiative focused on evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, research, and prognostication for patients who are comatose due to any etiology. To support this mission, the CCC Ethics Working Group conducted a survey of CCC collaborators to identify the ethics priorities of the CCC and the variability in priorities based on country of practice. Methods An electronic survey on the ethics priorities for the CCC was developed using rank-choice questions and distributed between May and July 2021 to a listserv of the 164 collaborators of the CCC. The median rank for each topic and subtopic was determined. Comparisons were made on the basis of country of practice. Results The survey was completed by 93 respondents (57% response rate); 67% practiced in the United States. On the basis of respondent ranking of each topic, the prioritization of ethics topics across respondents was as follows: (1) clinical care, (2) diagnostic definitions, (3) clinical research, (4) implementation/innovation, (5) family, (6) data management, (7) public engagement/perceptions, and (8) equity. Respondents who practiced in the United States were particularly concerned about public engagement, the distinction between clinical care and research, disclosure of results from clinical research to families, the definition of "personhood," and the distinction between the self-fulfilling prophecy/nihilism and medical futility. Respondents who practiced in other countries were particularly concerned about diagnostic modalities for clinical care, investigational drugs/devices for clinical research, translation of research into practice, and the definition of "minimally conscious state." Conclusions Collaborators of the CCC considered clinical care, diagnostic definitions, and clinical research the top ethics priorities of the CCC. These priorities should be considered as the CCC explores ways to improve evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, research, and prognostication of patients with coma and associated disorders of consciousness. There is some variability in ethics priorities based on country of practice.

SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccine Effectiveness in Health Care Workers by Dosing Interval and Time Since Vaccination: Test-Negative Design, British Columbia, Canada	OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						vaccine effectiveness; SARS; CoV; 2; healthcare workers; test; negative design	INFECTION; RESPONSES; DISEASE	Background One- and two-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by dosing interval and time since vaccination were assessed among healthcare workers (HCWs) in publicly funded acute and community (nonresidential) healthcare facilities in British Columbia, Canada. Methods A test-negative design was used with controls matched to cases (6:1) on epidemiological week of SARS-CoV-2 test date. mRNA vaccination was defined by receipt of the first dose >= 21 days or second dose >= 14 days before the test date. HCWs >= 18 years old tested for SARS-CoV-2 between epi-weeks 3 and 39 (January 17-October 2, 2021) were included, when varying dosing intervals and a mix of circulating variants of concern contributed, including Delta dominance provincially from epi-week 31 (August 1). Results Single- and two-dose analyses included 1265 and 1246 cases, respectively. The median follow-up period (interquartile range) was 49 (34-69) days for single-dose and 89 (61-123) days for two-dose recipients, with 12%, 31%, and 58% of second doses given 3-5, 6, or >= 7 weeks after the first. Adjusted mRNA VE against SARS-CoV-2 was 71% (95% CI, 66%-76%) for one dose and 90% (95% CI, 88%-92%) for two doses, similar to two heterologous mRNA doses (92%; 95% CI, 86%-95%). Two-dose VE remained >80% at >= 28 weeks post-second dose. Two-dose VE was consistently 5%-7% higher with a >= 7-week vs 3-5-week interval between doses, but with overlapping confidence intervals. Conclusions Among HCWs, we report substantial single-dose and strong and sustained two-dose mRNA vaccine protection, with the latter maintained for at least 7 months. These findings support a longer interval between doses, with global health and equity implications.

Social pathologies and urban pathogenicity: Moving towards better pandemic futures	URBAN STUDIES			English	Article						gender; governance; health; inequality; pandemic; pathogenicity; race; ethnicity	RACIAL DISPARITIES; HEALTHY PUBLICS; COVID-19; DISCRIMINATION; DETERMINANTS; INEQUITIES; CAPITALISM; QUARANTINE; DISEASE	In this article, we suggest rethinking how to move forward in a way that better elucidates socio-economic and political factors driving inequities, and in turn points to more broad sweeping, deep-rooted changes necessary if pandemics in the future are finally going to be mitigated pre-emptively rather than reactively. To this end, we argue that a more comprehensive, flexible and incisive approach is necessary - a hermeneutic framework that focuses analytical attention and action on interventions upstream, on the multifaceted interrelations necessary before lives currently deemed disposable are lost. Unlike dominant public health and epidemiological approaches, that is, Social Determinants of Health and Syndemics, proven unlikely to fuel structural change or to enable pre-emptive response, we propose the framework of pathogenicity and apply it to urban contexts to answer questions concerning the relationship between microbes on the one hand, and on the other, the urban, social, political, ideological, global, scientific, economic and many other relations that galvanise these into pathogens. By employing pathogenicity in the context of two case studies in the US and Turkey, we shift emphasis away from tackling microbes to better understanding what makes those microbes, and even the interventions implemented to stop them, so destructive.

Another aim of this study is to classify the countries in the geographical region classification made by the World Economic Form according to the Global Gender Gap.Methods: The universe of work consists of 144 countries in East Asia and Pacific, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe. In this study 14 indicators are used. Hierarchical clustering analysis was utilized in the analysis of the data. Ward technique and square Euclidean distance were used in obtaining clusters.Results: In the study, 50% of the gaps in the economic participation opportunity and educational attainments sub dimension. It has also been observed that in the health and survival sub-dimension countries have almost completely closed gender gaps and have not closed the gaps of any country in the political empowerment sub dimension. As a result of the clustering analysis the countries were divided into two groups according to the Global Gender Gap.

Although progress has been made in recent years, substantial operational challenges persist in resource-limited settings with frequent stock-outs contributing to sub-optimal immunization coverage and inequality in vaccine access. In this paper, we investigate the role of rainy season induced supply chain disruptions on vacci-nation coverage and inequalities. We develop a modeling framework combining spatial modeling-to pre-dict flood disruptions in road networks-and a discrete-event simulation of a multi-tiered vaccine supply chain (VSC). Our models are fitted using data from the Malagasy VSC network and validated to the best extent possible with scarce data. Our baseline simulation predicts the national vaccination coverage with good accuracy and suggests that 67% of regions with low reported immunization coverage are affected by rainy season disruptions or operational inefficiencies, causing significant geographical inequalities in vac-cine access. We investigate various mitigation strategies to increase the resiliency of VSCs and find that, by strategically placing buffer inventory at targeted facilities prior to the rainy season, the proportion of children receiving all basic vaccines in these areas is increased by 8% and the geographical inequality in vaccination coverage between areas affected and not affected by the rainy season is reduced by 11%. By also increasing the replenishment frequency from every third month to every month, the national vac-cination coverage improves by 41%. Our results contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing actionable insights for improving vaccination coverage (SDG 3) and investigat-ing the resiliency of the VSC to increased flooding due to climate change (SDG 13).

Previous evidence has confirmed the critical effect of distributive justice on turnover intention, but few studies have focused on the mediating mechanism behind this relationship or the medical staff. This study aimed to examine the mediating roles of organizational commitment and work engagement in the relationship between distributive justice and turnover intention of medical staff, and explore potential occupational differences. Methods: Stratified random sampling was adopted to select qualified medical staff from each clinical department of a large general hospital in Shenzhen, China, at a physician-to-nurse ratio of 1:1.5. The medical staff were surveyed using the Distributive Justice Scale, the Organizational Commitment Scale, the Work Engagement Scale, and the Turnover Intention Scale from May to July 2020. Of the 500 medical staff sampled, 480 responded (response rate: 96.00%), and 457 were finally included for analysis (effective response rate: 95.21%). A mediation analysis was performed using Model 6 of the SPSS macro PROCESS program. Results: There were significant positive correlations among distributive justice, organizational commitment, and work engagement and significant negative correlations among distributive justice, organizational commitment, work engagement, and turnover intention. Distributive justice directly and negatively affected the turnover intention of physicians and nurses, but there were occupational differences in the underlying mechanism between distributive justice and turnover intention. Distributive justice indirectly affected turnover intention among physicians mainly through the mediating effect of organizational commitment, and indirectly among nurses through three different pathways: the mediating effect of organizational commitment, the mediating effect of work engagement, and the chain mediating effect of organizational commitment and work engagement. Conclusion: The relationship between distributive justice and turnover intention was found to be mediated by organizational commitment and work engagement among medical staff in Shenzhen, with variations between physicians and nurses. Thus, appropriately targeted interventions are needed for physicians and nurses to reduce turnover intention.

J	Mousavi, T; Nikfar, S; Abdollahi, M				Mousavi, Taraneh; Nikfar, Shekoufeh; Abdollahi, Mohammad			Achieving Equitable Access to Medicines and Health Services: A COVID-19-time Recalled Matter	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH			English	Review						COVID-19; Equity; Health; Inequity; Medicine; Pharmaceutical; Policy		In the 21st century, while some people seek to use artificial intelligence for health services delivery, others have to surrender their health rights to meet basic needs. The gradient in health has become more pronounced in the COVID-19 crisis considering discrepancies in disease prevalence, geographical accessibility, availability, affordability, quality/safety of health services, and human resources. Through PubMed, Google-Scholar, Scopus, WHO, OECD, and UN databases, the English documents and global statistics were collected. Determining the role of health equity-related factors and introducing mechanisms to maintain regional and international justice in health, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic, were among the core concepts of this paper. Social determinants of health (SDH), interregional and intraregional bodies are the main drivers of discrimination in health services. Governments should relish chief health strategists' role in possessing legitimacy, accountability, direction, transparent performance, fairness, and good governance in one word. Improving health literacy and telemedicine, providing income support, and reforming insurance where needed, are other national mechanisms to amend inequity. Among interregional issues, what is concerning is the matter of sanctions on access to health services, which is against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Shortage of vital medications, ventilators, test kits, COVID-19 vaccines, pharmaceutical raw materials, foreign currency, decreased national currency value, purchasing power parity, and quality/safety of health services resulted from such oppression. The article also provides practical suggestions, paving the way for re-establishing global solidarity and developing health justice in deprived regions.

The present research employed a mixed-method campus climate study of LGBT+ and cis-heterosexual students sampled from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines and the UK. Phase 1 reports a large-scale survey assessing relationships among students' social attitudes toward LGBT+, campus climate perceptions and experiences of harassment, well-being, academic persistence, and social identity belonging within the university (LGBT+ = 877; cis-heterosexual = 2107). Phase 2 reports focus groups and interviews with 35 LGBT+ students, further exploring their campus climate experiences. Triangulated results highlight the role of social identity belonging in creating positive LGBT+ campus climates. Fostering belonging, through visible institutional support for intersectional LGBT+ student organisations and endorsement of LGBT+ inclusive policies and programmes, is recommended for creating safe and inclusive spaces for LGBT+ students.

In Lebanon, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant economic crisis further exacerbated the living conditions of this segment of the population. This study explored the barriers to accessing healthcare services among people living with diabetes and lower-limb amputation during the pandemic. Methods We conducted semi-structured, in-depth phone interviews with users of the Physical Rehabilitation Program, offered by the International Committee of the Red Cross. We used a purposive sampling technique to achieve maximum variation. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed using thematic analysis following the "codebook" approach. Transcripts were coded and grouped in a matrix that allowed the development of themes and sub-themes inductively and deductively generated. Results Eight participants (7 males, 1 female) agreed to be interviewed and participated in the study between March and April, 2021. Barriers to healthcare services access were grouped according to five emerging themes: (1) economic barriers, included increasing costs of food, health services and medications, transportation, shortage of medications, and limited income; (2) structural barriers: availability of transportation, physical environment, and service quality and availability; (3) cultural barriers: marginalization due to their physical disabilities; favoritism in service provision; (4) personal barriers: lack of psychosocial support and limited knowledge about services; (5) COVID-19 barriers: fear of getting sick when visiting healthcare facilities, and heightened social isolation due to lockdowns and physical distancing. Conclusion The underlying economic crisis has worsened the conditions of people living with diabetes and lower-limb amputation. The pandemic has made these individuals more vulnerable to external and contextual factors that cannot be addressed only at an individual level. In the absence of a protective legal framework to mitigate inequalities, we provide recommendations for governments and nongovernmental institutions to develop solutions for more equitable access to healthcare for this segment of the population.

Socio-economic inequalities in physical activity among Japanese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Educational level; Household income; Domain-speci fic physical activity; Socio-economic status; Epidemiology; Public health	ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE GPAQ; SELF-RATED HEALTH; TIME; BENEFITS; IMPACT	Objectives: This study aimed to explore the socio-economic inequalities in physical activity (PA) based on domains of daily life, such as work, transport, recreation and sedentary life, among Japanese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Methods: This study used data from the 2020 National Sport and Lifestyle Survey, conducted by the Sasakawa Sports Foundation. Data of 2,296 (1,103 women) participants were analysed. PAs were assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Educational level and household income were used as indicators of socio-economic status. We calculated the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII). Results: We detected absolute and relative inequalities for household income in all PA domains, except for work-related PA. The higher the participants' income, the longer they engaged in transport-and recreation-related PA and sedentary behaviour. Recreation-related PA had a larger disparity than other domains, with SII at 20.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]-28.4 to-13.1) and RII at 0.58 (95% CI 0.47-0.71). At the educational level, each inequality was observed in work-and recreation-related PA and sedentary behaviour. The higher the participants' educational level, the longer they engaged in recreation-related PA and sedentary behaviour. However, work-related PA was longer at lower educational levels, with RII at 1.90 (95% CI 1.48-2.4 4). The inequality in recreation-related PA was also relatively large (SII 23.3%, 95% CI-30.9 to-15.7; RII 0.54, 95% CI 0.45-0.66). Conclusion: Our study revealed significant socio-economic disparities in each PA domain, particularly in recreational PA. These results suggest a widening gap because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Social context and economical disparities, are known to be determining factors. Cultural and educational constrains however, are also important contributors to the establishment and development of health inequities. As an important starting point for a comprehensive discussion, a detailed analysis of the literature corpus is thus desirable: we need to recognize what has been done, under what circumstances, even what possible sources of bias exist in our current discussion on this relevant issue. By finding these trends and biases we will be better equipped to modulate them and find avenues that may lead us to a more integrated view of health inequity, potentially enhancing our capabilities to intervene to ameliorate it. In this study, we characterized at a large scale, the social and cultural determinants most frequently reported in current global research of health inequity and the interrelationships among them in different populations under diverse contexts. We used a data/literature mining approach to the current literature followed by a semantic network analysis of the interrelationships discovered. The analyzed structured corpus consisted in circa 950 articles categorized by means of the Medical Subheadings (MeSH) content-descriptor from 2014 to 2021.

Social inequalities and their impact on children's health: a current and global perspective	JORNAL DE PEDIATRIA			English	Review						Social inequities in health; Social determinants; Child health	CASH TRANSFER PROGRAM; INFANT HEALTH; BRAZIL; MORTALITY; POVERTY; TRENDS; CARE	Objective: To describe the consequences of social inequalities on children's health as a global and persistent problem, demonstrating its historical and structural roots in different societies. Data sources: Relevant articles in the PubMed/MEDLINE database, in addition to those found in a manual search and in the bibliographic references of selected studies and consultation to the websites of international organizations to obtain relevant data and documents. Data synthesis: To understand how inequities affect health, it is necessary to know the unequal distribution of their social determinants among population groups. In the case of children, the parental pathway of determinants is central. The non-equitable way in which many families or social groups live, determined by social and economic inequalities, produces unequal health outcomes, particularly for children. This is observed between and within countries. Children from the most vulnerable population groups consistently have worse health conditions. Interventions aimed at children's health must go beyond care and act in an integrated manner on poverty and on social and economic inequalities, aiming to end systematic and unfair differences. Conclusions: Despite the considerable advances observed in children's health in recent decades at a global level, the inequalities measured by different indicators show that they persist. This scenario deserves attention from researchers and decision-makers, especially in the context of the global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has further intensified the situation of vulnerability and social inequalities in health around the world.

A key to promoting ethical decision-making frameworks is by calibrating the sustainability at regional, national, and global levels to incorporate coordinated reforms. We performed a sustained ethical analysis and critically reviewed evidence addressing country-level responses to practices during the COVID-19 pandemic using PubMed entire population during the pandemic was applied to thematically delineate findings under equality, best outcomes (utility), prioritizing the worst off, and prioritizing those tasked with helping others. The findings demarcate ethical concerns about the validity of drug and vaccine trials in developing and developed countries, hints of unjust healthcare organizational policies, lack of equal allocation of pertinent resources, miscalculated allocation of resources to essential workers and stratified populations.

Decomposing socio-economic inequalities in antenatal care utilisation in 12 Southern African Development Community countries	SSM-POPULATION HEALTH			English	Article						Antenatal care; Maternal care; Socioeconomic inequality; Southern african development community	HEALTH-SERVICES; DETERMINANTS; NEWBORN; ACCESS	Although many countries are making progress towards achieving the global sustainable development goals, subSaharan Africa (SSA) lags behind. SSA bears a relatively higher burden of maternal morbidity and mortality than other regions despite existing cost-effective interventions. This paper assesses antenatal care (ANC) service utilisation among women in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, one of the four SSA regions. Specifically, it assesses socioeconomic inequality in the number of ANC visits, use of no ANC service, between one and three ANC visits and at least four ANC visits, previously recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Data come from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys in twelve SADC countries. Wagstaff's normalised concentration index (CI) was used to assess socioeconomic inequalities. Factors explaining these inequalities were assessed using a standard method and similar variables contained in the DHS data. A positive CI means that the variable of interest is concentrated among wealthier women, while a negative CI signified the opposite. The paper found that wealthier women in the SADC countries are generally more likely to have more ANC visits than their poorer counterparts. Apart from Zambia, the CIs were positive for inequalities in at least 4 ANC visits and negative for between 1 and 3 ANC visits. Women from poorer backgrounds significantly report no ANC visits than wealthier women. Apart from the portion that was not explainable due to limitations in the variables included in the model, critical social determinants of health, including wealth, education and the number of children, explain socioeconomic inequalities in ANC coverage in SADC. A vital policy consideration is not to leave any woman behind. Therefore, addressing access barriers and critical social determinants of ANC inequalities, such as women's education and economic well-being, can potentially redress inequalities in ANC coverage in the SADC region.

Methods: A total of 2,379 girls (51% AA) from ages 9 to 10 were recruited in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Growth and Health Study. The various health indicators and dietary habits of these girls were assessed annually for 10 years. We model 2nd, 5th, 95th, and 98th percentile values of the health risk factors to compare trajectories between AA and CA adolescents by employing novel kernel smoothing regression and global tests of equality for regression curves. Health risk factors such as dietary fiber, intake of sodium, sugar, and total calories, systolic blood pressure, weight, body fat percentage, and high-density lipoprotein levels were compared. Results: Trajectories of sugar, sodium, and total calories intake and systolic blood pressure, weight, body fat percentage, and high-density lipoprotein among AA girls were significantly higher than those of CA girls throughout their adolescence. Conclusions: AA girls exhibit several health risk factors that are significantly higher than those of CA adolescent girls at the 95th and 98th percentile. Interventions may be warranted for the purposes of ensuring access to health risk information as well as a greater ease of access to healthier food choices within the educational food system.

TTTTT A hot topic at the environment-health nexus: investigating the impact of climate change on infectious diseases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						climate change; impact; infectious diseases; global warming; adaptation; mitigation		Climate change - the ultimate challenge of our time: COVID-19 pandemic aside, climate change is the ultimate challenge of our time. However, to date, there has been insufficient political thrust to make that much-needed climate action a reality. Climate change and infectious diseases: Infectious diseases represent only one facet of the threats arising from climate change. Direct impacts from climate change include the more frequent occurrence and increased magnitude of extreme weather events, as well as changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. For climate-sensitive infectious diseases, these changes implicate a shift in geographical and temporal distribution, seasonality, and transmission intensity. Sizing up the problem: Susceptibility to the deleterious effects of climate change is a net result of the interplay of not only environmental factors, but also human, societal, and economic factors, with social inequalities being a major determinant of vulnerability. The global South is already disproportionately affected by the climate crisis. The financial capacity to pursue adaptation options is also limited and unevenly distributed. Conclusions: Climate change-induced mortality and morbidity from both infectious and non-infectious diseases, among other adverse scenarios, are expected to rise globally in the future. The coming decade will be crucial for using all remaining opportunities to develop and implement adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

To advise on ethical guidelines for such activities, the aim of this study was to present LMIC stakeholders' perceptions of visiting surgical teams from high-income countries. Method We performed a systematic review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines in November 2021, using standardised search terms in PubMed/Medline (National Library of Medicine), EMBASE (Elsevier), Global Health Database (EBSCO) and Global Index Medicus, and complementary hand searches in African Journals Online and Google Scholar. Included studies were analysed thematically using a meta-ethnographic approach. Results Out of 3867 identified studies, 30 articles from 15 countries were included for analysis. Advantages of visiting surgical teams included alleviating clinical care needs, skills improvement, system-level strengthening, academic and career benefits and broader collaboration opportunities. Disadvantages of visiting surgical teams involved poor quality of care and lack of follow-up, insufficient knowledge transfers, dilemmas of ethics and equity, competition, administrative and financial issues and language barriers. Conclusion Surgical short-term visits from high-income countries are insufficiently described from the perspective of stakeholders in LMICs, yet such perspectives are essential for quality of care, ethics and equity, skills and knowledge transfer and sustainable health system strengthening. More in-depth studies, particularly of LMIC perceptions, are required to inform further development of ethical guidelines for global surgery and support ethical and sustainable strengthening of LMIC surgical systems.

J	Veenstra, G; Vanzella-Yang, A				Veenstra, Gerry; Vanzella-Yang, Adam			Interactions between parental and personal socioeconomic resources and self-rated health: Adjudicating between the resource substitution and resource multiplication theories	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Canada; Parental education; Personal education; Parental family income; Personal family income; Self-rated health	EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; INCOME INEQUALITY; CANADA; BENEFITS; RETURNS; GENDER	A small body of research has documented intriguing findings, mostly from the United States but also from Europe, which suggest that the positive health effects of socioeconomic resources in adulthood may be conditioned by socioeconomic circumstances in childhood. There are two competing theories in this literature. The first contends that socioeconomic resources have a stronger effect on adult health for people from disadvantaged backgrounds because socioeconomic resources in adulthood substitute or compensate for a paucity of health related resources earlier in life. The second contends that socioeconomic resources have a stronger effect on adult health for people from advantaged backgrounds because socioeconomic resources in adulthood compound or multiply the health effects of socioeconomic resources earlier in life. We used survey data from the 2012 Longitudinal and International Study of Adults linked to current and historical income data from the Canada Revenue Agency to investigate interactions between parental and personal socioeconomic resources - education and income, treated separately - as predictors of self-rated health in a sample of Canadians aged 25 to 50. Consistent with the resource multiplication theory, we found that the presumed benefits of personal family income for self-rated health were stronger for women from wealthier backgrounds than for women from poorer backgrounds. We found no evidence to support either theory among men. Overall, none of the interactions involving the education of parents or their adult children reached statistical significance. Our results are indicative of the importance of distinguishing between education and income for adults and their parents when adjudicating between these two theories.

This review briefly highlights key substantive areas of focus in social epidemiology over the past 30 years, reflects on major advances and insights, and identifies challenges and possible future directions. Future opportunities for social epidemiology include grounding research in theoretically based and systemic conceptual models of the fundamental social drivers of health; implementing a scientifically rigorous yet realistic approach to drawing conclusions about social causes; using complementary methods to generate valid explanations and identify effective actions; leveraging the power of harmonization, replication, and big data; extending interdisciplinarity and diversity; advancing emerging critical approaches to understanding the health impacts of systemic racism and its policy implications; going global; and embracing a broad approach to generating socially useful research.

This article reviews the roles that cities have played in creating healthful urban food systems and the effects of those policies on public health. It explains that despite wide-ranging policy initiatives, disparities in food insecurity and malnourishment persist. It concludes by describing several promising pathways for urban food policy: engaging in food-focused urban planning to create equitable food environments; treating policies to address inequality and social justice as upstream food policies; considering the effects of new business models such as online food retail in urban food policy making; and using food procurement as a lever to influence regional, national, and global food systems.

J	Eryurt, MA; Yalçin, SS				Eryurt, Mehmet Ali; Yalcin, Siddika Songul			Zero-dose children in Turkey: regional comparison of pooled data for the period 1990 to 2018	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Zero-dose children; Unvaccinated; Turkey; Demographic and Health Survey; Regional inequality	SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS; IMMUNIZATION; COVERAGE	Background Immunization plays a vital role in child health and survival. Zero-dose children are coming increasingly into focus as part of the global Immunization Agenda 2030. Although the percentage of zero-dose children has decreased in Turkey over time, regional/socioeconomic inequalities persist. This study aims to analyze the trend in zero-dose children and the factors associated with this problem in Turkey in light of regional inequalities. Methods Six data sets (1993, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018) were pooled from the last six Turkey Demographic and Health Surveys (TDHSs). The vaccination module for children aged 12-35 months and variables related to household characteristics, socio-economic, cultural characteristics of parents, bio-demographic/health-related factors were taken from the DHS data. Binary logistic regression analyses were carried out by taking into account the complex sample design of surveys for Turkey in general, the East region, and other regions. Results Significant progress has been made in reducing the number of zero-dose children in Turkey over the last three decades, as it has dropped from 3.2 to 0.9%. The results of multivariate analyses revealed that survey year, household wealth, the mother's level of education, payment of bride price, mother's native language, place of delivery, and the number of antenatal care visits are associated with zero-dose children. Factors associated with zero-dose children also differ between the East region, and other regions. Conclusion Public health programs targeting uneducated parents, poor households, lack of social security, Kurdish-speaking mothers, older mothers and those without antenatal care should be implemented to promote childhood immunization.

J	Debie, A; Khatri, RB; Assefa, Y				Debie, Ayal; Khatri, Resham B.; Assefa, Yibeltal			Successes and challenges of health systems governance towards universal health coverage and global health security: a narrative review and synthesis of the literature	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Review						Health systems governance; Universal health coverage; Global health security	REFORMS; ASIA; UHC	Background The shift in the global burden of disease from communicable to noncommunicable was a factor in mobilizing support for a broader post-Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) health agenda. To curb these and other global health problems, 193 Member States of the United Nations (UN) became signatories of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and committed to achieving universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030. In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the importance of health systems governance (HSG) is felt now more than ever for addressing the pandemic and continuing to provide essential health services. However, little is known about the successes and challenges of HSG with respect to UHC and health security. This study, therefore, aims to synthesize the evidence and identify successes and challenges of HSG towards UHC and health security. Methods We conducted a structured narrative review of studies published through 28 July 2021. We searched the existing literature using three databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Search terms included three themes: HSG, UHC and health security. We synthesized the findings using the five core functions of HSG: policy formulation and strategic plans; intelligence; regulation; collaboration and coalition; and accountability. Results A total of 58 articles were included in the final review. We identified that context-specific health policy and health financing modalities helped to speed up the progress towards UHC and health security. Robust health intelligence, intersectoral collaboration and coalition were also essential to combat the pandemic and ensure the delivery of essential health services. On the contrary, execution of a one-size-fits-all HSG approach, lack of healthcare funding, corruption, inadequate health workforce, and weak regulatory and health government policies were major challenges to achieving UHC and health security. Conclusions Countries, individually and collectively, need strong HSG to speed up the progress towards UHC and health security. Decentralization of health services to grass root levels, support of stakeholders, fair contribution and distribution of resources are essential to support the implementation of programmes towards UHC and health security. It is also vital to ensure independent regulatory accreditation of organizations in the health system and to integrate quality- and equity-related health service indicators into the national social protection monitoring and evaluation system; these will speed up the progress towards UHC and health security.

Global Regulatory and Public Health Initiatives to Advance Pediatric Drug Development for Rare Diseases	THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION & REGULATORY SCIENCE			English	Review						Rare diseases; Pediatric drug development; Regulatory policy	MEDICAL GENETICS; ENGAGEMENT; STATE; MODEL	The literature thoroughly describes the challenges of pediatric drug development for rare diseases. This includes (1) generating interest from sponsors, (2) small numbers of children affected by a particular disease, (3) difficulties with study design, (4) lack of definitive outcome measures and assessment tools, (5) the need for additional safeguards for children as a vulnerable population, and (6) logistical hurdles to completing trials, especially with the need for longer term follow-up to establish safety and efficacy. There has also been an increasing awareness of the need to engage patients and their families in drug development processes and to address inequities in access to pediatric clinical trials. The year 2020 ushered in yet another challenge-the COVID-19 pandemic. The pediatric drug development ecosystem continues to evolve to meet these challenges. This article will focus on several key factors including recent regulatory approaches and public health policies to facilitate pediatric rare disease drug development, emerging trends in product development (biologics, molecularly targeted therapies), innovations in trial design/endpoints and data collection, and current efforts to increase patient engagement and promote equity. Finally, lessons learned from COVID-19 about building adaptable pediatric rare disease drug development processes will be discussed.

Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, public health experts have started to reflect on the extent to which previous preparations have been helpful as well as on the gaps in pandemic preparedness planning. In the present commentary, we advocate for the inclusion of social and ethical factors in future pandemic planning-factors that have been insufficiently considered so far, although social determinants of infection risk and infectious disease severity contribute to aggravated social inequalities in health.

We explored socioeconomic and gendered differences in travel behaviour in Africa, to develop an understanding of travel-related inequity. We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019124802). In 2019, we searched MEDLINE, TRID, SCOPUS, Web of Science, LILACS, SciELO, Global Health, Africa Index Medicus, CINAHL and MediCarib for studies examining travel behaviour by socioeconomic status and gender in Africa. We appraised study quality using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. We synthesised qualitative data using meta-ethnography, followed by a narrative synthesis of quantitative data, and integrated qualitative and quantitative strands using pattern matching principles. We retrieved 103 studies (20 qualitative, 24 mixed-methods, 59 quantitative). From the meta-ethnography, we observed that travel is: intertwined with social mobility; necessary to access resources; associated with cost and safety barriers; typified by long distances and slow modes; and dictated by gendered social expectations. We also observed that: motorised transport is needed in cities; walking is an unsafe, 'captive' mode; and urban and transport planning are uncoordinated. From these observations, we derived hypothesised patterns that were tested using the quantitative data, and found support for these overall. In lower socioeconomic individuals, travel inequity entailed reliance on walking and paratransit (informal public transport), being unable to afford travel, travelling less overall, and travelling long distances in hazardous conditions. In women and girls, travel inequity entailed reliance on walking and lack of access to private vehicles, risk of personal violence, societally-imposed travel constraints, and household duties shaping travel. Limitations included lack of analytical rigour in qualitative studies and a preponderance of cross-sectional quantitative studies (offering a static view of an evolving process). Overall, we found that travel inequity in Africa perpetuates socioeconomic and gendered disadvantage. Proposed solutions focus on improving the safety, efficiency and affordability of public transport and walking.

Timely diagnosis and prompt treatment are of paramount importance for optimal patient outcome. However, only few studies have assessed quality of care (QoC) in endocarditis. We aimed to describe QoC and changes in epidemiological features of endocarditis from 1990 to 2019. Methods and results Using primary indices of mortality, incidence, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life year, obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, we calculated four secondary measures. Principal component analysis was performed to calculate QoC index (QCI), scored on a scale of 0-100 with higher values indicating better QoC, for different locations, age groups, and genders from 1990 to 2019. The all-ages incidence rate of endocarditis was estimated to increase significantly from 1990 to 2019, while mortality rate did not change. The age-standardized QCI was 73.6% globally, with higher values in high-income countries than in low-income countries. High-income North America (82.0%) and Asia Pacific (81.1%) had the highest QCI, whereas Eastern Europe (43.3%) had the lowest. Globally, the 30-49 and 95+ age groups had the highest (91.3%) and the lowest (71.7%) QCI, respectively. In most countries, particularly those with lower socio-demographic index, women had better QCI. Conclusion This is the first global assessment of QCI, shedding light on the current trends and highlighting the necessity of improving the endocarditis QoC, mainly by timely case detection, adherence to antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines, utilizing targeted antibiotics and advanced treatments, in the African region and resolving gender inequality in selected countries.

Anxiety and the Onset of COVID-19: Examining Concerns of Historically Excluded Scholars	INTERNATIONAL STUDIES PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						COVID-19; anxiety; parents; gender; historically excluded scholars	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; LANGUAGE USE; MENTAL-HEALTH; POLITICAL-SCIENCE; WOMEN; EXPERIENCES; FACULTY; SELF; PRODUCTIVITY; PERCEPTIONS	The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic increased uncertainty, leading to questions about how it spread, how long it would last, and its long-term effects. In academia, many scholars worried about their positions and career advancement. Our research focuses on how different groups within academia coped during the initial period of the pandemic, with particular attention paid to the role of anxiety. We argue that vulnerable groups, such as historically excluded individuals, graduate students, and women, felt even higher levels of anxiety. We use original survey data collected from international relations and political science scholars during May 2020. We content analyze open-ended responses to illustrate the impacts of the pandemic on our participants' work life, including research productivity, the job market, promotion, and tenure. These analyses reveal not only what different groups of scholars are concerned about, but also the different ways in which they discuss the pandemic. Our research aims to highlight the social and mental health effects of the pandemic, with an eye toward addressing inequalities in academia.	[RAMOS, J. E. N. N. I. F. E. R.

In east and southern Africa, renewed global action is needed to invigorate an effective yet undervalued approach to expanding HIV prevention and improving women's health: integration of quality HIV and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. The urgency of advancing effective integration of these services has never been clearer or more pressing. In this piece, national health officials from Kenya, Malawi, and Zimbabwe and global health professionals have joined together in a call to catalyze actions by development partners in support of national strategies to integrate HIV and SRH information and services. This agenda is especially vital now because these adolescent girls and young women are falling through the cracks due to the cascading effects of COVID-19 and disruptions in both SRH and HIV services. In addition, the scale-up of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been anemic for this population. Examining the opportunities and challenges of HIV/SRH integration implemented recently in three countries - Kenya, Malawi, and Zimbabwe - provides lessons to spur integration and investments there and in other nations in the region, aimed at improving health outcomes for adolescent girls and young women and curbing the global HIV epidemic. While gaps remain between strong national integration policies and program implementation, the experiences of these countries show opportunities for expanded, quality integration. This commentary draws on a longer comparative analysis of findings from rapid landscaping analyses in Kenya, Malawi, and Zimbabwe, which highlighted cross-country trends and context-specific realities around HIV/SRH integration.

Impact of socioeconomic deprivation on evaluation for heart transplantation at an urban academic medical center	CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article						disparities; health equity; heart failure; heart transplantation; socioeconomic status	NEIGHBORHOOD-DISADVANTAGE; FAILURE; ENGLAND	Introduction For patients with advanced heart failure, socioeconomic deprivation may impede referral for heart transplantation (HT). We examined the association of socioeconomic deprivation with listing among patients evaluated at our institution and compared this against the backdrop of our local community. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients evaluated for HT between January 2017 and December 2020. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were recorded. Block group-level area deprivation index (ADI) decile was obtained at each patient's home address and Socioeconomic Status (SES) index was determined by patient zip code. Results In total, 400 evaluations were initiated; one international patient was excluded. Among this population, 111 (27.8%) were women, 219 (54.9%) were White, 94 (23.6%) Black, and 59 (14.8%) Hispanic. 248 (62.2%) patients were listed for transplant. Listed patients had significantly higher SES index and lower ADI compared to those who were not listed. However, after adjustment for clinical factors, ADI and SESi were not predictive of listing. Similarly, patient sex, race, and insurance did not influence the likelihood of listing for HT. Notably, the distribution of the referral cohort based on ADI deciles was not reflective of our center's catchment area, indicating opportunities for improving access to transplant for disadvantaged populations. Conclusions Although socioeconomic deprivation did not predict listing in our analysis, we recognize the need for broader outreach to combat upstream bias that prevents patients from being referred for HT.

Towards A new model of global health justice: the case of COVID-19 vaccines	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						COVID-19; Ethics; Internationality; Resource Allocation; Right to Health		This paper questions an exclusively state-centred framing of global health justice and proposes a multilateral alternative. Using the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to illustrate, we bring to light a broad range of global actors up and down the chain of vaccine development who contribute to global vaccine inequities. Section 1 (Background) presents an overview of moments in which diverse global actors, each with their own priorities and aims, shaped subsequent vaccine distribution. Section 2 (Collective action failures) characterises collective action failures at each phase of vaccine development that contributed to global vaccine disparities. It identifies as critical the task of establishing upstream strategies to coordinate collective action at multiple stages across a range of actors. Section 3 (A Multilateral model of global health governance) takes up this task, identifying a convergence of interests among a range of stakeholders and proposing ways to realise them. Appealing to a responsibility to protect (R2P), a doctrine developed in response to human rights atrocities during the 1990s, we show how to operationalise R2P through a principle of subsidiarity and present ethical arguments in support of this approach.

Accelerated shifts in the functioning of the Earth System are mainly driven by the production and consumption of wealthy economies. Social, environmental and health costs of such industrialization, however, bear on low-income communities inhabiting severely degraded territories by polluting activities (i.e., sacrifice zones). How global, national and local socio-economic and governance processes have interacted in perpetuating socio-environmental inequalities in these territories has been rarely explored. Here, we develop an historical quantitative approach integrating a novel chemostratigraphic record, data on policy making, and socio-economic trends to evaluate the feedback relationship between environmental injustice and Anthropocene in sacrifice zones. We specifically outline a case study for the Puchuncavi valley -one of the most emblematic sacrifice zones from Chile-. We verify an ever-growing burden of heavy metals and metalloids over the past five decades paced by the staggering expansion of local industrial activities, which has ultimately been spurred by national and transnational market forces. Local poverty levels have declined concomitantly, but this path toward social equality is marginal as costs of pollution have grown through time. Indeed, national and international pollution control actions appear insufficient in mitigating the cumulative impact brought by highly toxic elements. Thus, our sub-decadal reconstruction for pollution trends over the past 136 years from a sediment record, emerges as a science-based tool for informing the discussion on Anthropocene governance. Furthermore, it helps to advance in the assessment of environmental inequality in societal models that prioritize economic growth to the detriment of socio-environmental security.

Innovative methods to analyse the impact of gender norms on adolescent health using global health survey data	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Gender norms; Global health; Survey data; Gender equality; Attitudes; Behaviours; Reference group; Sanctions	COHORT PROFILE; SOCIAL NORMS; BIRTH	Background: Understanding how gender norms affect health is an important entry point into designing programs and policies to change norms and improve gender equality and health. However, it is rare for global health datasets to include questions on gender norms, especially questions that go beyond measuring gender-related attitudes, thus limiting gender analysis.Methods: We developed five case studies using health survey data from six countries to demonstrate approaches to defining and operationalising proxy measures and analytic approaches to investigating how gender norms can affect health. Key findings, strengths and limitations of our norms proxies and methodological choices are summarised.Findings: Case studies revealed links between gender norms and multiple adolescent health outcomes. Proxys for norms were derived from data on attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours, as well as differences between attitudes and behaviours. Data were cross-sectional, longitudinal, census- and social network-based. Analytic methods were diverse. We found that gender norms affect: 1) Intimate partner violence in Nigeria; 2) Unhealthy weight control behaviours in Brazil and South Africa; 3) HIV status in Zambia; 4) Health and social mobility in the US; and 5) Childbirth in Honduras.Interpretation: Researchers can use existing global health survey data to examine pathways through which gender norms affect health by generating proxies for gender norms. While direct measures of gender norms can greatly improve the understanding of how gender affects health, proxy measures for norms can be designed for the specific health-related outcome and normative context, for instance by either aggregating behaviours or attitudes or quantifying the difference (dissonance) between them. These norm proxies enable evaluations of the influence of gender norms on health and insights into possible reference groups and sanctions for non-compliers, thus informing programmes and policies to shape norms and improve health.

J	Khalid, S; Dixon, S; Vijayasingham, L				Khalid, Shazmin; Dixon, Shrijna; Vijayasingham, Lavanya			The gender responsiveness of social entrepreneurship in health-A review of initiatives by Ashoka fellows	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Gender; Social entrepreneurship; Health programming; Health financing; Intersectoral health partnerships	MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; ENHANCE HEALTH; ENTERPRISE; INNOVATION; INEQUALITIES; PROMOTION; INTERSECTIONALITY; WOMEN; CARE	There are vocal calls to act on the gender-related barriers and inequities in global health. Still, there are gaps in implementing programmes that address and counter the relevant dynamics. As an approach that focuses on social problems and public service delivery gaps, social entrepreneurship has the potential to be a closer health sector partner to tackle and transform the influence of gender in health to achieve health systems goals better. Nevertheless, social entrepreneurs' engagement and impact on gender and health remain understudied. Using the Ashoka Fellows database as a sampling frame in November 2020 (n = 3352, health n = 129), we identified and reviewed the work of 21 organizations that implemented gender-responsive health-related programmes between 2000 and 2020. We applied the UNU-IIGH 6-I Analytic Framework to review the gender issues, interventions, included populations, investments, implementation, and impact in each organization. We found that a low proportion of fellows engage in gender-responsive health programming (< 1%). Many organizations operate in low-and middle-income countries (16/21). The gender-responsive programmes include established health sector practices, to address gendered-cultural dynamics and deliver people-centred resources and services. Interestingly, most organizations self-identify as NGOs and rely on traditional grant funding. Fewer organizations (6/21) adopt market-based and income-generating solutions a missed opportunity to actualise the potential of social entrepreneurship as an innovative health financing approach. There were few publicly available impact evaluations-a gap in practice established in social entrepreneurship. All organizations implemented programmes at community levels, with some cross-sectoral, structural, and policy-level initiatives. Most focused on sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence for predominantly populations of women and girls. Closer partnerships between social entrepreneurs and gender experts in the health sector can provide reciprocally beneficial solutions for cross-sectorally and community designed innovations, health financing, evidence generation and impact tracking that improve the gender-responsiveness of health programmes, policies, and systems.

J	Moe, FD; Berg, H				Moe, Fredrik D.; Berg, Henrik			Treating equivalent cases differently: A comparative analysis of substance use disorder and type 2 diabetes in Norwegian treatment guidelines	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						chronic illness; global policymaking; substance use disorder; treatment guidelines; type 2 diabetes	DRUG-USE; ADDICTION; DEPENDENCE; CONCORDANCE; MECHANISMS; INSURANCE; CRITIQUE; RECOVERY; OUTCOMES; JUSTICE	Background Substance use disorder (SUD) is often understood as a chronic illness. Aims: This paper investigates whether SUD is treated as a chronic illness. Method To this aim, we have used World Health Organizations (WHO's) definition of chronic illness to conduct a comparative analysis of SUD and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is another chronic illness. Results When analysing Norwegian treatment guidelines, we found that only the T2D guideline reflects the WHO's conceptualization of chronic illnesses. We argue that this discrepancy implies that SUD is understood as a moral and legal problem, while T2D is conceptualized as a somatic illness. We discuss how social, political and historical conditions of the possibility for understanding SUD are interwoven with normative presumptions about the clinician, patient, treatment guidelines and drug policies in a way that may impede the development of continuing care. Conclusion The paper concludes that the delivery of treatment services is inequitable as SUD is not treated as a chronic illness.

Africa has the smallest proportion of mental health service providers, and the highest rate of out-of-pocket expenditure for mental health service users. Poor mental health at work results in costs to workers, employers and the economy. This review aims to collaborate with stakeholders to identify literature on workplace-based occupational therapy interventions supporting the mental health of workers in Africa. Methods and analysis We will search Medline (PubMed), EBSCOhost (Academic Search Premier, AfricaWide Information, CINAHL, Health Source: Nursing/Academic), Scopus, Web of Science, Sabinet, Cochrane and OTSeeker for qualitative and quantitative primary research studies. Grey literature will be searched via Sabinet and ProQuest. No language or date restrictions will be applied. Title and abstract screening as well as full-text screening will be done independently by two reviewers. Data extracted will include information about the articles, characteristics of studies and interventions, and findings. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines will be used for reporting results. Three groups of stakeholders will be consulted during the review process: service users/workers, employers and service providers/occupational therapists. Ethics and dissemination This scoping review does not require ethics approval. Findings of the review will be disseminated through stakeholder engagements, peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

J	de Lima, KYN; Cancela, MD; de Souza, DLB				Nunes de Lima, Kalya Yasmine; Cancela, Marianna de Camargo; de Souza, Dyego Leandro Bezerra			Spatial assessment of advanced-stage diagnosis and lung cancer mortality in Brazil	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INEQUALITIES; TRENDS	The high incidence and mortality rates make lung cancer a global public health issue. Socioeconomic conditions and the provision of health services may be associated with this reality. This study investigates the spatial distribution of advanced-stage diagnosis and mortality due to lung cancer and its association with the healthcare services supply and demographic and socioeconomic indicators in Brazil. This is an ecological study with 161 Intermediate Regions of Urban Articulation. Mortality data were extracted from the Mortality Information System, and the cases of lung cancer were obtained from the Integrator of Hospital-Based Cancer Registries from 2011 to 2015. Analyses employed Moran's I, local indicators of spatial association, and the multivariable model. The proportion of advanced-stage diagnosis was 85.28% (95% CI 83.31-87.10) and was positively associated with the aging rate (Moran's I 0.11; p = 0.02), per capita income (Moran's I 0.05; p = 0.01) and negatively associated with Gini Index (Moran's I -0.16; p = 0.01). The mean age-adjusted mortality rates was 12.82 deaths/100,000 inhabitants (SD 5.12). The age-adjusted mortality rates for lung cancer presented a positive and statistically significant spatial association with all demographic, socioeconomic and healthcare services supply indicators, except for the "density of family health teams" (Moran's I -0.02 p = 0.28). The multivariable model for the mortality rates was constituted by the variables "Density of facilities licensed in oncology", "Per capita income", and "Health plan coverage". The per capita income presented positive association and health plan coverage negative association with age-adjusted mortality rates. Both associations were statistically significant. The variable density of facilities licensed in oncology showed no significant association with age-adjusted mortality rates. There is a high proportion of advanced-stage diagnosis across the Brazilian territory and inequalities in lung cancer mortality, which are correlated with the most developed areas of the country.

One step to developing this understanding of the internationalisation of social work education, including the student internship, is to incorporate supervision by local practitioners and educators. A qualitative interview study of fourteen social work students from Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the USA completing internships in the Southwest Indian state of Kerala revealed themes of increased practice knowledge, practice skills, understanding of cross-cultural values and ethics, critical reflection and research skills development as a result of reflexive supervision provided to them by practitioners in their internship agencies and faculty from their host and home institutions. This challenging of views within one's own culture, promoted by supervision, leads to increased capacity to engage in critical anti-oppressive practice amongst social workers. Summary in Plain English center dot Various social work institutions across the globe increasingly adopt international social work internships to equip their trainees to acquire global competencies. The internship experiences are reflected based on the competency guidelines proposed by various International Associations of Social Work. However, the international interns' cultural and academic experiences are often left undocumented. center dot This article attempts to articulate robust supervisory systems and processes to impart social and cultural competencies to interns for global practice. It guides agency and faculty supervisors in imparting culturally appropriate perspectives on human well-being, human distress, pain and suffering and designing culturally relevant assessments and interventions. Cultural exchange increases the capacity to engage in anti-oppressive practice amongst the social workers. center dot This article would potentially influence the purpose, context, content, structure and process of developing best practices in international social work education.

J	Maier, A; Fegert, JM; Hoffmann, U				Maier, Anna; Fegert, Joerg M.; Hoffmann, Ulrike			"An uncomfortable topic": Health professionals' perspectives on child protection capacities, training offers and the potential need for action in Germany	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Continuing medical education; Health inequalities; Child maltreatment; Health professionals; Health Service; Prevention	ABUSE; CONSEQUENCES; PREVENTION; STIGMA	Background Child maltreatment, due to its high prevalence and often long-lasting (health and/or psycho-social) consequences, is one of the main reasons for global health inequalities. The medical field offers many opportunities to support affected children. This gives physicians and other health professionals the opportunity to provide protective measures and therapies to affected children at an early stage. However, the level of training concerning child protection is often too low among health professionals. This can affect the quality of care as well as providing the appropriate treatment and thus, the long-term (health) burden. The present work aims to survey the state of knowledge and capacities of health professionals regarding child protection in medicine and elicit health professionals' perspectives who absolved a child protection online course on a potential need for action in Germany. Methods From June 2016 until February 2021, 3,360 health professionals were interviewed. Using quantitative and qualitative items, the questionnaire assessed demographic and professional background information as well as assessments regarding the awareness of child protection, abilities in child protection among health professionals and training offers in medicine. Results The analysis indicates that the topic of child protection in medicine is not as present as the high prevalence of child maltreatment would imply. The majority (94.0%; n = 3.159) of the health professionals stated that they need more knowledge and capacities regarding child protection in medicine. More than half of the health professionals assessed the importance of the issue of child protection as low among health professionals. The reasons cited included child protection as an uncomfortable topic, an unwillingness among managers, and a lack of training on the topic. Conclusions There is too little awareness and importance regarding child protection in the medical field in Germany. Hence, it is difficult to ensure adequate care for those affected. Child protection topics should be mandatory in the training curricula of all health professionals, and quality standards for prevention and intervention should be implemented in medical institutions. Furthermore, networking in child protection has to be improved, and medical campaigns should address the topic to sensitize health professionals and society to the issue and to destigmatize the topic.

J	Park, J; Xue, YX; Xue, RY; Felfeli, T				Park, Jeff; Xue, Yuanxin; Xue, Ryan; Felfeli, Tina			Representation of women on editorial boards of ophthalmology journals: protocol for a cross-sectional study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						OPHTHALMOLOGY; Quality in health care; MEDICAL ETHICS	LEADERSHIP; FACULTY	Introduction There is a notable under-representation of women in leadership positions in ophthalmology despite the increasing number of women as ophthalmologists. Gender inequality in editorial boards of ophthalmology journals has not been investigated on a global scale. This study will aim to evaluate the representation of women as editorial board members in ophthalmology journals across different regions, journal subspecialties and impact factors. Methods and analysis This will be a cross-sectional study describing the gender composition of editorial boards in ophthalmology journals globally. Ulrich's Periodicals Directory and SCImago Journal & Country Rank will be used to comprehensively identify journals indexed with the keyword, 'ophthalmology'. All journals with active websites and lists of editorial boards will be included. Journals will be categorised according to the World Bank's 2021 classification of countries by income and region, and classified into ophthalmology subspecialties based on publication scope. Impact factors will be obtained from Journal Citation Reports. The gender and academic degrees of each editorial board member will be determined based on journal profiles, institutional websites or name query feature on an online interface. The research impact of each editorial board member will be ascertained from the author records on Web of Science. The gender proportion will be presented for all journals combined, and then for journals grouped by regions, subspecialties and impact factors. Editorial board member characteristics including academic degrees and research productivity measures will be compared between men and women. These comparisons will be made using the chi(2) test for categorical variables and the independent samples t-test for continuous variables. Ethics and dissemination This study did not require research ethics approval given the use of publicly available data and lack of human subjects.

This is done both for the general population and across key-groups. We analyze longitudinal data for 15,147 respondents from three waves of the Eurofound- "Living, Working and COVID-19 " survey, covering the period April 2020-March 2021. MWB is measured by the WHO-5 index. Our evidence suggests that restriction on international travel, private gatherings, and contact tracing (workplace closures) were negatively (positively) associated with MWB by about, respectively,-0.63 [95% CI:-0.79 to-0.47],-0.24 [95% CI:-0.38 to-0.10], and-0.22 [95% CI:-0.36 to-0.08] (0.29 [95% CI: 0.11 to 0.48]) points. These results correspond to-3.9%,-1.5%, and-1.4% (+1.8%) changes compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, these findings mask important group-differences. Women compared to men fared worse under stay-at-home requirements, internal movement restrictions, private gatherings restrictions, public events cancellation, school closures, and workplace closures. Those residing with children below 12, compared to those who do not, fared worse under public events cancellation, school closures and workplace closures. Conversely, those living with children 12-17, compared to those who do not, fared better under internal movement re-strictions and public events cancelling. Western-Europeans vis -`a-vis Eastern-Europeans fared better under NPIs limiting their mobility and easing their debts, whereas they fared worse under health-related NPIs. This study provides timely evidence of the rise in inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic and offers strategies for mitigating them.

For this purpose, we rely on a new measure of health, which not only takes into account life expectancy, but also morbidity and allows us to evaluate both quality and length of life. We apply a new instrumental variable approach, based on the diffuse characteristic of globalization, to a panel of 143 countries over the period 1990-2019 and find an overall positive association of FDI with health. However, we also demonstrate that this positive relationship decreases with countries' per capita GDP. We reveal that developing economies have strongly benefited from inward FDI but, more developed economies less so. For the most-developed countries in our sample, the impact is even negative, but we demonstrate that higher employment protection, which is associated with a lower level of job insecurity, allows countries to decrease this pernicious effect.

J	Alava, JJ; Singh, GG				Alava, Juan Jose; Singh, Gerald G.			Changing air pollution and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic: Lesson learned and future equity concerns of post-COVID recovery	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						COVID-19; Atmospheric pollution; CO2 emissions; Pollutant management; Climate change mitigation; Solutions-oriented research; Environmental and justice; Indigenous people	LOCKDOWN; SURFACE; IMPACT	COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and quarantines have led to significant industrial slowdowns among the world's major emitters of air pollutants, with resulting decreases to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in nations such as China, India and US, deemed to be major sources of global CO2 emissions, as well. However, there are major concerns that these decreases in atmospheric pollution can be hampered as economies are reactivated. Historically, countries have weakened environmental legislations following economic slowdown to encourage renewed economic growth. Such a policy response now will likely have disproportionate impacts on global Indigenous people and marginalized groups within countries, who have already faced disproportionate impacts from COVID19 and environmental pollution. Our "new normal " remain nimble enough to allow us to fine-tune our interventions, research tools and solutions-oriented research to quickly enough to stay ahead of the pandemic trajectory in the face of air pollution and climate change. Societal and behavioral changes to reduce these anthropogenic cumulative stressors should be advocated, while prioritizing the public health of marginalized groups around the world, promoting new approaches to champion environmental health along with educational programs addressed to the population. Bold government decisions can restart economies while pre-empting future inequities and committing to environmental protection in an era of COVID-19 and global change.

The quantitative content analysis shows that most articles were written with a "consequence" or a "collective action" frame and portrayed the pandemic in a social and national context. Journalists used thematic and loss frames more often than episodic and gain frames. Framing differed between countries. Pakistani articles had a social justice perspective. South Korean and South African journalists employed the collective action frame more than other countries. German articles used gain more than loss frames. South Korean and Argentinian journalists used the individual action frame the least and focused stronger on the future than journalists in other countries. U.S. articles used the uncertainty frame more than articles from other countries. These differences might help understand the different approaches countries take in trying to manage the spread of the virus and give some insights into how people across the world take different actions.

J	Sajjad, M; Raza, SH; Shah, AA				Sajjad, Muhammad; Raza, Syed Hassan; Shah, Asad Abbas			Assessing Response Readiness to Health Emergencies: A Spatial Evaluation of Health and Socio-Economic Justice in Pakistan	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						COVID-19; Geographic information systems; Multivariate spatial clustering; Health policy; Community health resilience	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; POPULATION HEALTH; SENDAI FRAMEWORK; NATURAL HAZARDS; SYSTEMS; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; CITIES; MODEL	COVID19 pandemic has put the global health emergency response to the test. Providing health and socio-economic justice across communities/regions helps in resilient response. In this study, a Geographic Information Systems-based framework is proposed and demonstrated in the context of public health-related hazards and pandemic response, such as in the face of COVID19. Indicators relevant to health system (HS) and socio-economic conditions (SC) are utilized to compute a response readiness index (RRI). The frequency histograms and the Analysis of Variance approaches are applied to analyze the distribution of response readiness. We further integrate spatial distributional models to explore the geographically-varying patterns of response readiness pinpointing the priority intervention areas in the context of cross-regional health and socio-economic justice. The framework's application is demonstrated using Pakistan's most developed and populous province, namely Punjab (districts scale, n=36), as a case study. The results show that similar to 45% indicators achieve below-average scores (value <0.61) including four from HS and five from SC. The findings ascertain maximum districts lack health facilities, hospital beds, and health insurance from HS and more than 50% lack communication means and literacy-rates, which are essential in times of emergencies. Our cross-regional assessment shows a north-south spatial heterogeneity with southern Punjab being the most vulnerable to COVID-like situations. Dera Ghazi Khan and Muzaffargarh are identified as the statistically significant hotspots of response incompetency (95% confidence), which is critical. This study has policy implications in the context of decision-making, resource allocation, and strategy formulation on health emergency response (i.e., COVID19) to improve community health resilience.

J	Besson, ESK				Besson, Emilie S. Koum			How to identify epistemic injustice in global health research funding practices: a decolonial guide	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						public health	PERSPECTIVE; COLONIALITY; KNOWLEDGE; POWER	Epistemic injustice is a growing area of study for researchers and practitioners working in the field of global health. Theoretical development and empirical research on epistemic injustice are crucial for providing more nuanced understandings of the mechanisms and structures leading to the exclusion of local and marginalised groups in research and other knowledge practices. Explicit analysis of the potential role of epistemic injustice in policies and practices is currently limited with the absence of methodological starting points. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by providing a guide for individuals involved in the design and review of funding schemes wishing to conduct epistemic injustice analysis of their processes using a decolonial lens. Placing contemporary concerns in a wider historical, political and social context and building from the intertwined issues of coloniality of power, coloniality of knowledge and coloniality of being that systematically exclude non-Western epistemic groups, this practice paper presents a three-step decolonial approach for understanding the role and impact of epistemic injustices in global health research funding. It starts with an understanding of how power operates in setting the aim of a call for research proposals. Then, the influence of pose and gaze in the review process is analysed to highlight the presence of epistemological colonisation before discussing methods to address the current funding asymmetries by supporting new ways of being and doing focused on knowledge plurality. Expanding research on how epistemic wrongs manifest in global health funding practices will generate key insights needed to address underlying drivers of inequities within global health project conception and delivery.

J	Floridi, G				Floridi, Ginevra			Capacity or Necessity? Comparing the Socio-Economic Distribution of Productive Activities Between Italy and South Korea	RESEARCH ON AGING			English	Article						employment; long-term care; inequality; socio-economic status; international comparative study	WELFARE-STATE; INFORMAL CARE; OLDER-PEOPLE; HEALTH; AGE; ENGAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; CHALLENGES; EUROPE; WORK	Much productive ageing research aims to identify the conditions under which older adults engage in productive roles within and outside the family. This study conceptualises two individual-level explanations for productive participation: capacity and necessity. I hypothesise that whether capacity or necessity prevails across different socio-economic groups depends on the degree of social protection guaranteed by pensions and long-term care systems, which varies across countries. Drawing on data from the SHARE and KLoSA surveys, this study compares socio-economic gradients in full-time work and informal caregiving across cohorts of men and women aged 50-75 in Italy and South Korea in 2006/07 and 2014/15. In Italy, where later-life social protection is generous, productive engagement is more common among wealthier and higher-educated individuals, who have greater capacity to engage in productive roles. In Korea, where social protection is limited, working is more common among socio-economically disadvantaged women, who have higher necessity to remain economically productive.

The most severe cases may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with a risk of long-term repercussions on respiratory function and neuromuscular outcomes. The functional repercussions of severe forms of COVID-19 may have a major impact on quality of life, and impair the ability to return to work or exercise. Social inequalities in healthcare may influence prognosis, with socially vulnerable individuals more likely to develop severe forms of disease. We describe here the protocol for a prospective, multicentre study that aims to investigate the influence of social vulnerability on functional recovery in patients who were hospitalised in intensive care for ARDS caused by COVID-19. This study will also include an embedded qualitative study that aims to describe facilitators and barriers to compliance with rehabilitation, describe patients' health practices and identify social representations of health, disease and care. Methods and analysis The "Functional Recovery From Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Due to COVID-19: Influence of Socio-Economic Status" (RECOVIDS) study is a mixed-methods, observational, multicentre cohort study performed during the routine follow-up of post-intensive care unit (ICU) functional recovery after ARDS. All patients admitted to a participating ICU for PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and who underwent chest CT scan at the initial phase AND who received respiratory support (mechanical or not) or high-flow nasal oxygen, AND had ARDS diagnosed by the Berlin criteria will be eligible. The primary outcome is the presence of lung sequelae at 6 months after ICU discharge, defined either by alterations on pulmonary function tests, oxygen desaturation during a standardised 6 min walk test or fibrosis-like pulmonary findings on chest CT. Patients will be considered to be socially disadvantaged if they have an "Evaluation de la Precarite et des Inegalites de sante dans les Centres d'Examen de Sante" (EPICES) score >= 30.17 at inclusion. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and the informed consent form were approved by an independent ethics committee (Comite de Protection des Personnes Sud Mediterranee II) on 10 July 2020 (2020-A02014-35). All patients will provide informed consent before participation. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international congresses.

Climate change is already severely impacting people's health and threatening people's guaranteed fundamental rights, including those to life, health, self-determination, and education, among others. Across geographical regions, population groups and communities who are already marginalized due to age, gender, ethnicity, income, and other socioeconomic factors, are those who are disproportionately affected by climate impacts despite having contributed the least to global emissions. Although scholars have been calling for a human rights-based approach and a health perspective to climate action, the literature looking at this multidisciplinary intersection is still nascent, and governments have yet to implement such intersectoral policies. This commentary begins to reflect on the relationship between climate change, human rights, and public health from the perspective of young people engaged in climate action and discourse at the national and international levels. It presents a way forward on what we, as youth climate advocates and researchers, believe is a priority to bring intersectoral integration of human rights and public health approaches to climate change to fruition. First, scholars and practitioners should examine and support youth-led climate interventions that tackle human rights and public health violations incurred by the climate crisis. Second, participatory approaches to climate change must be designed by working synergistically with climate-vulnerable groups, including children and young people, practitioners and scholars in public health and human rights sectors to holistically address the social, health, and environmental impacts of the climate crisis and root causes of injustice. Finally, we recommend more holistic data collection to better inform evidence-based climate policies that operationalize human rights and public health co-benefits.

A scientometric analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; CITATION; PROGRESS; DISEASE; ACHIEVE; TRENDS; FUTURE; VALUES	Today, global challenges such as poverty, inequality, and sustainability are at the core of the academic debate. This centrality has only increased since the transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), whose scope is to shift the world on to a path of resilience focused on promoting sustainable development. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a critical yet comprehensive scientometric analysis of the global academic production on the SDGs, from its approval in 2015 to 2020, conducted using Web of Science (WoS) database. Despite it being a relatively short period of time, scholars have published more than five thousand research papers in the matter, mainly in the fields of green and sustainable sciences. The attained results show how prolific authors and schools of knowledge are emerging, as key topics such as climate change, health and the burden diseases, or the global governance of these issues. However, deeper analyses also show how research gaps exist, persist and, in some cases, are widening. Greater understanding of this body of research is needed, to further strengthen evidence-based policies able to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of the SDGs.

Barriers in accessing health care among reproductive-age women creates the first and the third delay for maternal mortality and leads to the occurrence of preventable complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. Studies revealed that barriers for accessing health care are concentrated among individuals with poor socioeconomic status which creates health inequality despite many international organizations top priority is enhancing universal health coverage. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the presence of socioeconomic inequality in barriers for accessing health care and its contributors in Sub-Saharan African countries. Methods The most recent DHS data of 33 sub-Saharan African countries from 2010 to 2020 were used. A total sample of 278,501 married reproductive aged were included in the study. Erreygers normalized concentration index (ECI) and its concentration curve were used while assessing the socioeconomic-related inequality in barriers for accessing health care. A decomposition analysis was performed to identify factors contributing for the socioeconomic-related inequality. Results The weighted Erreygers normalized Concentration Index (ECI) for barriers in accessing health care was - 0.289 with Standard error = 0.005 (P value < 0.0001); indicating that barriers in accessing health care was disproportionately concentrated among the poor. The decomposition analysis revealed that wealth index (42.58%), place of residency (36.42%), husband educational level (5.98%), women educational level (6.34%), and mass media exposure (3.07%) were the major contributors for the pro-poor socioeconomic inequalities in barriers for accessing health care. Conclusion In this study, there is a pro-poor inequality in barriers for accessing health care. There is a need to intensify programs that improve wealth status, education level of the population, and mass media coverage to tackle the barriers for accessing health care among the poor.

Solar geoengineering could redistribute malaria risk in developing countries	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISEASE; BURDEN; TRANSMISSION; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Solar geoengineering, an emergency climate intervention, could shift one billion people back into areas of malaria risk. Regional tradeoffs and potential adverse outcomes point to the need for health sector planning with Global South leadership. Solar geoengineering is often framed as a stopgap measure to decrease the magnitude, impacts, and injustice of climate change. However, the benefits or costs of geoengineering for human health are largely unknown. We project how geoengineering could impact malaria risk by comparing current transmission suitability and populations-at-risk under moderate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5) with and without geoengineering. We show that if geoengineering deployment cools the tropics, it could help protect high elevation populations in eastern Africa from malaria encroachment, but could increase transmission in lowland sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Compared to extreme warming, we find that by 2070, geoengineering would nullify a projected reduction of nearly one billion people at risk of malaria. Our results indicate that geoengineering strategies designed to offset warming are not guaranteed to unilaterally improve health outcomes, and could produce regional trade-offs among Global South countries that are often excluded from geoengineering conversations.

Companeros en Salud has been piloting a novel program, called Right to Healthcare (RTHC), to increase access to specialty care for the rural poor in Chiapas, Mexico. The RTHC program incorporates social work, patient navigation, referrals, direct economic support, and accompaniment for patients. Objectives: This study evaluates the effectiveness of the RTHC program. Primary outcomes analyzed included acceptance of any referral and attendance of any appointment. Secondary outcomes included acceptance of the first referral and rate of appointment attendance for patients with an accepted referral. Methods: Using referral process data for the years 2014 to 2019 from a public tertiary care hospital in Chiapas, 91 RTHC patients were matched using 2:1 optimal pair matching with a control cohort balancing covariates of patient age, sex, specialty referred to, level of referring hospital, and municipality. Findings: RTHC patients were more likely to have had an accepted referral (OR 17.42, 95% CI 3.68 to 414.16) and to have attended an appointment (OR 5.49, 95% CI 2.93 to 11.60) compared to the matched control group. RTHC patients were also more likely to have had their first referral accepted (OR 2.78.95% CI 1.29 to 6.73). Among patients with an accepted referral. RTHC patients were more likely to have attended an appointment (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.90 to 8.57). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the RTHC model is successful in increasing access to specialty care by both increasing referral acceptance and appointment attendance.

Our article draws from a research project that explored the everyday stories of ageing among 19 diverse immigrant older adults in Canada. To capture their experiences of loneliness and social isolation, we use four illustrative cases derived from a structural approach to life-story narrative. To these we apply the intersectional lifecourse analytical lens to examine how life events, timing and structural forces shape our participants' experiences of social isolation and loneliness. We further explore the global and linked lives of our participants as well as the categories of difference that influence their experiences along the continua of loneliness to belonging, isolation to connection. Finally, we discuss how an understanding of sources of domination and expressions of agency and resistance to these forces might lead us to solutions.

Global sharing of COVID-19 therapies during a "New Normal"	BIOETHICS			English	Article						allocation; COVID-19; ethics; global health; justice; solidarity	SOLIDARITY	This paper argues for global sharing of COVID-19 treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond based on principles of global solidarity. It starts by distinguishing two types of COVID-19 treatments and models sharing strategies for each in small-group scenarios, contrasting groups that are solidaristic with those composed of self-interest maximizers to show the appeal of solidaristic reasoning. It then extends the analysis, arguing that a similar logic should apply within and between nations. To further elaborate global solidarity, the paper distinguishes morally voluntary, sliding-scale, and mandatory versions. It argues for an all-hands-on-deck approach and gives examples to illustrate. The paper concludes that during the COVID-19 crisis, global solidarity is a core value, and global sharing of COVID-19 treatments should be considered a duty of justice, not of charity.

Objective In this study, we aimed to evaluate and compare the quality and equity of care concerning NRVHDs in terms of gender and sociodemographic index (SDI) using a newly proposed index. Methods We obtained the primary measures (e.g. incidence) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data about NRVHD from 1990 to 2017 to calculate the subsequent secondary indices (e.g. mortality-to-incidence ratio) with close association to quality of care. Then, using principal component analysis (PCA), quality of care index (QCI) was calculated as a novel index from the secondary indices, rescaled to 0-100. QCI was calculated for all age groups and both genders, globally, regionally and nationally between 1990 and 2017. Results Globally, the QCI for NRVHDs in 2017 was 87.3, and it appears that gender inequity was unremarkable (gender disparity ratio = 1.00, female QCI: 90.2, male QCI: 89.7) in 2017 similar to the past three decades. Among WHO world regions, the Western Pacific Region and Eastern Mediterranean Region showed the highest (90.1) and lowest (74.0) QCI scores. Regarding SDI, the high-middle-SDI quintile with a QCI of 89.4 and the low-SDI quintile with a QCI of 77.8 were the two extremes of healthcare quality in 2017. Conclusion Although global status regarding the NRVHD's quality of care is acceptable, higher attention is required for lower SDI countries.

Road sediment, an underutilized material in environmental science research: A review of perspectives on United States studies with international context	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS			English	Review						Road sediment; Road dust; Urban pollution; Heavy metals; Electron microscopy	HEALTH-RISK ASSESSMENT; BLOOD LEAD LEVELS; POLYCYCLIC-AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; HEAVY-METAL CONTAMINATION; URBAN STREET DUST; TECHNOGENIC MAGNETIC PARTICLES; POLLUTANT WASH-OFF; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; PARTICULATE MATTER; DEPOSITED SEDIMENT	Road sediment is a pervasive environmental medium that acts as both source and sink for a variety of natural and anthropogenic particles and often is enriched in heavy metals. Road sediment is generally understudied in the United States (U.S.) relative to other environmental media and compared to countries such as China and the United Kingdom (U.K.). However, the U.S. is an ideal target for these studies due to the diverse climates and wealth of geochemical, socioeconomic, demographic, and health data. This review outlines the existing U.S. road sediment literature while also providing key international perspectives and context. Furthermore, the most comprehensive table of U.S. road sediment studies to date is presented, which includes elemental concentrations, sample size, size fraction, collection and analytical methods, as well as digestion procedure. Overall, there were observed differences in studies by sampling time period for elemental concentrations, but not necessarily by climate in the U.S. Other key concepts addressed in this road sediment review include the processes controlling its distribution, the variety of nomenclature used, anthropogenic enrichment of heavy metals, electron microscopy, health risk assessments, remediation, and future directions of road sediment investigations. Going forward, it is recommended that studies with a higher geographic diversity are performed that consider smaller cities and rural areas. Furthermore, environmental justice must be a focus as community science studies of road sediment can elucidate pollution issues impacting areas of high need. Finally, this review calls for consistency in sampling, data reporting, and nomenclature to effectively expand work on understudied elements, particles, and background sediments.

J	Sunio, V; Cortes, RZ; Lactao, J				Sunio, Varsolo; Cortes, Robert Z.; Lactao, James			Rhetorical orientations for promoting sustainable travel behavior: A perspective	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Rhetoric; Orientation; Persuasion; Environmental communication; Global south	PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; TRANSPORT; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; TRANSITIONS; BELIEFS; ACCESS; VALUES; NORMS; MODEL	We introduce eleven orientations underpinning the rhetoric for promoting (or impeding) sustainable travel behavior. These orientations are: convenience, status, health, privacy, safety-security, economic, environmental, impact, justice-equity, geographical, and problem-solution. Using a novel and systematic method, we perform the study in three stages. First, using online media as data source, we apply concordance and Gioia methods to identify the rhetorical orientations underpinning these texts. Second, we cluster the orientations according to the direction (pro- or anti-sustainability) being generally pushed by each orientation. Convenience, status, health, privacy, safety-security orientations, in general, push towards anti-sustainability direction. On the other hand, economic, environmental, impact, justice-equity, and geographical orientations generally push towards pro-sustainability direction. Meanwhile, problem-solution orientation appears equally in both clusters. Finally, we extract the semantics of each rhetorical orientation using collocation analysis to differentiate their vocabularies. Our findings show the discursive struggle and contestation in relation to mobility, which manifest not only in the differences in rhetorical orientations appropriated but also the vocabularies deployed. One important implication is that any attempt to render the messages promoting sustainable travel behavior more persuasive necessitates the de-legitimation of contrary rhetorical orientations (convenience, status and health, privacy and safety-security) by addressing the issues associated with them.

The relative effectiveness of UCTs compared with conditional cash transfers (CCTs; provided only if recipients follow prescribed behaviours, e.g. use a health service or attend school) is unknown. Objectives To assess the effects of UCTs on health services use and health outcomes in children and adults in LMICs. Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of UCTs on social determinants of health and healthcare expenditure, and to compare the effects of UCTs versus CCTs. Search methods For this update, we searched 15 electronic academic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EconLit, in September 2021. We also searched four electronic grey literature databases, websites of key organisations and reference lists of previous systematic reviews, key journals and included study records. Selection criteria We included both parallel-group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (C-RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies, controlled before-andafter studies (CBA5), and interrupted time series studies of UCT interventions in children (0 to 17 years) and adults (>= 18 years) in LMICs. Comparison groups received either no UCT, a smaller UCT or a CCT. Our primary outcomes were any health services use or health outcome. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened potentially relevant records for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We obtained missing data from study authors if feasible. For C-RCTs, we generally calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes from crude frequency measures in approximately correct analyses. Meta-analyses applied the inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel method using a random-effects model. Where meta-analysis was impossible, we synthesised results using vote counting based on effect direction. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 34 studies (25 studies of 20 C-RCTs, six CBAs, and three cohort studies) involving 1,140,385 participants (45,538 children, 1,094,847 adults) and 50,095 households in Africa, the Americas and South-East Asia in our meta-analyses and narrative syntheses. These analysed 29 independent data sets. The 24 UCTs identified, including one basic universal income intervention, were pilot or established government programmes or research experiments. The cash value was equivalent to 1.3% to 81.9% of the annualised gross domestic product per capita. All studies compared a UCT with no UCT; three studies also compared a UCT with a CCT. Most studies carried an overall high risk of bias (i.e. often selection or performance bias, or both). Most studies were funded by national governments or international organisations, or both. Throughout the review, we use the words 'probably' to indicate moderate-certainty evidence, 'may/maybe' for low-certainty evidence, and 'uncertain' for very low-certainty evidence. Health services use We assumed greater use of any health services to be beneficial. UCTs may not have impacted the likelihood of having used any health service in the previous 1 to 12 months, when participants were followed up between I-2 and 24 months into the intervention (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.09; I-2 = 2%; 5 C-RCTs, 4972 participants; low-certainty evidence). Health outcomes At one to two years, UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, very large reduction in the likelihood of having had any illness in the previous two weeks to three months (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92; I-2 = 53%; 6 C-RCTs, 9367 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). UCTs may have increased the likelihood of having been food secure over the previous month, at 13 to 36 months into the intervention (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; I-2 = 85%; 5 C-RCTs, 2687 participants; low-certainty evidence). UCTs may have increased participants' level of dietary diversity over the previous week, when assessed with the Household Dietary Diversity Score and followed up 24 months into the intervention (mean difference (MD) 0.59 food categories, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.01; I-2 = 79%; 4 C-RCTs, 9347 participants; low-certainty evidence). Despite several studies providing relevant evidence, the effects of UCTs on the likelihood of being moderately stunted and on the level of depression remain uncertain. We found no study on the effect of UCTs on mortality risk. Social determinants of health UCTs probably led to a clinically meaningful, moderate increase in the likelihood of currently attending school, when assessed at 12 to 24 months into the intervention (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.09; I-2 = 0%; 8 C-RCTs, 7136 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). UCTs may have reduced the likelihood of households being extremely poor, at 12 to 36 months into the intervention (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97;I-2 = 63%; 6 C-RCTs, 3805 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was uncertain for whether UCTs impacted livestock ownership, participation in labour, and parenting quality. Healthcare expenditure Evidence from eight cluster-RCTs on healthcare expenditure was too inconsistent to be combined in a meta-analysis, but it suggested that UCTs may have increased the amount of money spent on health care at 7 to 36 months into the intervention (low-certainty evidence). Equity, harms and comparison with CCTs The effects of UCTs on health equity (or unfair and remedial health inequalities) were very uncertain. We did not identify any harms from UCTs. Three cluster-RCTs compared UCTs versus CCTs with regard to the likelihood of having used any health services or had any illness, or the level of dietary diversity, but evidence was limited to one study per outcome and was very uncertain for all three. Authors' conclusions This body of evidence suggests that unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) may not impact a summary measure of health service use in children and adults in LM ICs. However, UCTs probably or may improve some health outcomes (i.e. the likelihood of having had any illness, the likelihood of having been food secure, and the level of dietary diversity), two social determinants of health (i.e. the likelihoods of attending school and being extremely poor), and healthcare expenditure. The evidence on the relative effectiveness of UCTs and CCTs remains very uncertain.

LEGAL STUDIES			English	Article						patent law; corporate decision-making; engaged shareholders; licensing of health technologies; access to medicines; Covid-19	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; CORPORATE; ACCESS; COMPETITION; VACCINES; CONTEXT; TRADE	This paper focuses on the drivers steering companies' behaviour over uses of patented health technologies, taking Covid-19 as a case study. Global equitable access to health technologies is vital to bringing the pandemic under control. Reflecting this, global mechanisms for rightsholders to share intellectual property rights, data and know-how over such health technologies have been developed. Yet, to date, there is limited support from corporate rightsholders for such mechanisms. Instead, health technologies have been licensed largely based on bilateral deals, with vast global inequalities emerging. Given the traditional focus within company law on prioritising shareholders' short-term financial value, we argue that it is unsurprising that many corporate rightsholders adopt a protectionist approach to patents, even in the face of health crises. However, we argue that the tide may now be starting to shift, catalysed by an emergence of engaged shareholders petitioning for socially responsible corporate behaviour, including for uses of intellectual property over health technologies in a manner that more clearly aligns with public interests. If harnessed and encouraged, such engaged shareholder behaviour could present an opportunity to reframe the conception of shareholder value towards one that considers a long-term sustainable approach and ultimately to shift corporate behaviour around uses of intellectual property over health technologies to take public interests into account.

We present a theoretical framework rooted in Global North democracies' racial and ethnic legacies to analyze the health and economic disparities between these communities and the white majority population. Marshalling first-cut empirical evidence from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Sweden, we find patterns of the pandemic's distribution consistent with how the burden of racial and ethnic legacies endures: people from minority communities have worse health and economic outcomes under normal circumstances, inequalities the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated. The comparison shows that the impact of racial and ethnic discrimination on pandemic policy outcomes is not unique to the United States. Health inequalities stemming in part from patterns of institutional racism and discrimination perversely help reproduce these societal inequities. We find that governments' initial responses have failed to mitigate the disproportionate impact of this health and economic crisis on minority communities because they did not acknowledge or address the particular challenges that these groups face.

Globally, there is wide variation in how governments and jurisdictions implement and enforce mandatory vaccination as well as the financial and educational consequences to those who fail to comply. We explored the impact of mandate vaccination policies on Australian Immunization Specialists who work in Specialist Immunization Clinics (SIC) for approving vaccine exemptions outside of the mandated criteria. In particular, their interactions with patients and families. Methods: A national, prospective, mixed methods, survey-based study conducted with members of the Australian Adverse Event Following Immunisation Clinical Assessment Network between February 2020 and June 2020. Results: Sixteen Immunization physicians and nurse practitioner specialists working in a SIC completed the survey. All sixteen respondents had been requested by parents to provide a Medical Exemptions at least once. 88% of respondents felt pressure to provide an exemption that was not medically justified according to legislation. Seventy-five percent of SIC consultants felt that the "No Jab" policies created a moderate or extreme amount of stress to both themselves and parents. All respondents reported experiencing hostility from parents with three respondents having received threats of violence. Conclusions: Mandatory vaccination policies are associated with increased vaccination coverage but can result in widened financial and social inequity, and may harm families' relationships with health care providers. Countries considering the implementation of vaccination mandates should use the least restrictive health policies to ensure a balance between the public health and individual benefit whilst minimizing burdens on health care professionals, children and their parents.

Examining the Economic Costs of Crime in North America Attributable to People With Psychopathic Personality Disorder	PERSONALITY DISORDERS-THEORY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT			English	Article						psychopathic personality disorder; cost of illness; crime costs; violence; social burden	DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR-THERAPY; SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; GLOBAL BURDEN; OF-ILLNESS; PCL-R; GENDERED EXPRESSIONS; SOCIETAL COST; VIOLENCE RISK; HEALTH; CHECKLIST	Cost of illness research has established that mental disorders lead to significant social burden and massive financial costs. A significant gap exists for the economic burden of many personality disorders, including psychopathic personality disorder (PPD). In the current study, we used a top-down prevalence-based cost of illness approach to estimate bounded crime cost estimates of PPD in the United States and Canada. Three key model parameters (PPD prevalence, relative offending rate of individuals with PPD, and national costs of crime for each country) were informed by existing literature. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to provide bounded and central tendency estimates of crime costs, respectively. The estimated PPD-related costs of crime ranged from $245.50 billion to $1,591.57 billion (simulated means = $512.83 to $964.23 billion) in the United States and $12.14 billion to $53.00 billion (simulated means = $25.33 to $32.10 billion) in Canada. These results suggest that PPD may be associated with a substantial economic burden as a result of crime in North America. Recommendations are discussed regarding the burden-treatment discrepancy for PPD, as the development of future effective treatment for the disorder may decrease its costly burden on health and justice systems.

The choice of which measure to use to monitor and analyse health inequalities is thereby not trivial. This article explores a new measure of socioeconomic deprivation status (SDS) to monitor health inequalities. Methods The SDS measure was constructed using the Alkire-Foster method. It includes eight indicators across two equally weighted dimensions (education and living standards) and specifies a four-level gradient of socioeconomic deprivation at the household-level. We conducted four exercises to examine the value-added of the proposed SDS measure, using Demographic and Health Surveys data. First, we examined the discriminatory power of the new measure when applied to outcomes in four select reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health (RMNCH) indicators across six countries: skilled birth attendance, stunting, U5MR, and DTP3 immunisation. Then, we analysed the behaviour and association of the new SDS measure vis-a-vis the DHS Wealth Index, including chi-squared test and Pearson correlation coefficient. Third, we analysed the robustness of the SDS measure results to changes in its structure, using pairwise comparisons and Kendal Tau-b rank correlation. Finally, we illustrated some of the advantageous properties of the new measure, disaggregation and decomposition, on Haitian data. Results 1) Higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation are generally consistently associated with lower levels of achievements in the RMNCH indicators across countries. 2) 87% of all pairwise rank comparisons across a range of SDS measure structures were robust. 3) SDS and DHS Wealth Index are associated, but with considerable cross-country variation, highlighting their complementarity. 4) Haitian households in rural areas experienced, on average, more severe socioeconomic deprivation as well as lower levels of RMNCH achievement than urban households. Conclusions The proposed SDS measure adds analytical possibilities to the health inequality monitoring literature, in line with ethically and conceptually well-founded notions of absolute, multidimensional disadvantage. In addition, it allows for breakdown by its dimensions and components, which may facilitate nuanced analyses of health inequality, its correlates, and determinants.

Aspirin to target arterial events in chronic kidney disease (ATTACK): study protocol for a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint, parallel group trial of low-dose aspirin vs. standard care for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with chronic kidney disease	TRIALS			English	Article						Chronic kidney disease; Cardiovascular disease; Aspirin; Primary care; Primary prevention	GLOMERULAR-FILTRATION-RATE; STAGE RENAL-DISEASE; ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; SIMVASTATIN PLUS EZETIMIBE; ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME; COLLABORATIVE METAANALYSIS; ANTIPLATELET THERAPY; ALL-CAUSE; HIGHER ALBUMINURIA; REDUCING EVENTS	Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a very common long-term condition and powerful risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Low-dose aspirin is of proven benefit in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in people with pre-existing CVD. However, in people without CVD, the rates of MI and stroke are much lower, and the benefits of aspirin in the primary prevention of CVD are largely balanced by an increased risk of bleeding. People with CKD are at greatly increased risk of CVD and so the absolute benefits of aspirin are likely to be greater than in lower-risk groups, even if the relative benefits are the same. Post hoc evidence suggests the relative benefits may be greater in the CKD population but the risk of bleeding may also be higher. A definitive study of aspirin for primary prevention in this high-risk group, recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2014, has never been conducted. The question has global significance given the rising burden of CKD worldwide and the low cost of aspirin. Methods: ATTACK is a pragmatic multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint adjudication superiority trial of aspirin 75 mg daily vs. standard care for the primary prevention of CVD in 25,210 people aged 18 years and over with CKD recruited from UK Primary Care. Participants aged 18 years and over with CKD (GFR category G1-G4) will be identified in Primary Care and followed up using routinely collected data and annual questionnaires for an average of 5 years. The primary outcome is the time to first major vascular event (composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death [excluding confirmed intracranial haemorrhage and other fatal cardiovascular haemorrhage]). Deaths from other causes (including fatal bleeding) will be treated as competing events. The study will continue until 1827 major vascular events have occurred. The principal safety outcome is major intracranial and extracranial bleeding; this is hypothesised to be increased in those randomised to take aspirin. The key consideration is then whether and to what extent the benefits of aspirin from the expected reduction in CVD events exceed the risks of major bleeding. Discussion: This will be the first definitive trial of aspirin for primary CVD prevention in CKD patients. The research will be of great interest to clinicians, guideline groups and policy-makers, in the UK and globally, particularly given the high and rising prevalence of CKD that is driven by population ageing and epidemics of obesity and diabetes. The low cost of aspirin means that a positive result would be of relevance to low- and middle-income countries and the impact in the developed world less diluted by any inequalities in health care access.

It has been conspicuously absent from global reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (MNCAH) programming, despite increasing awareness of the intergenerational impact of common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs). However, the universal health coverage (UHC) movement and COVID-19 have brought mental health to the forefront, and the MNCAH community is looking to understand how to provide women effective, sustainable care at scale. To address this, MOMENTUM Country and Global Leadership (MCGL) commissioned a landscape analysis in December 2020 to assess the state of CPMDs and identify what is being done to address the burden in LMICs. Methods The landscape analysis (LA) used a multitiered approach. First, reviewers chose a scoping review methodology to search literature in PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychInfo, and Scopus. Titles and abstracts were reviewed before a multidisciplinary team conducted data extraction and analysis on relevant articles. Second, 44 key informant interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted with mental health, MNCAH, humanitarian, nutrition, gender-based violence (GBV), advocacy, and implementation research experts. Finally, reviewers completed a document analysis of relevant mental health policies from 19 countries. Results The LA identified risk factors for CPMDs, maternal mental health interventions and implementation strategies, and remaining knowledge gaps. Risk factors included social determinants, such as economic or gender inequality, and individual experiences, such as stillbirth. Core components identified in successful perinatal mental health (PMH) interventions at community level included stepped care, detailed context assessments, task-sharing models, and talk therapy; at health facility level, they included pre-service training on mental health, trained and supervised providers, referral and assessment processes, mental health support for providers, provision of respectful care, and linkages with GBV services. Yet, significant gaps remain in understanding how to address CPMDs. Conclusion These findings illuminate an urgent need to provide CPMD prevention and care to women in LMICs. The time is long overdue to take perinatal mental health seriously. Efforts should strive to generate better evidence while implementing successful approaches to help millions of women "suffering in silence."

The concept of power is not only useful in understanding the current situation, but it is also regularly mobilised in programmatic efforts that seek to change power relations. This paper uses summative content analysis to describe how sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programmes in low-income and middle-income countries explicitly and implicitly aim to alter relations of power. Methods Content analysis is a qualitative approach to analysing textual data; in our analysis, peer-reviewed articles that describe programmes aiming to alter power relations to improve SRH constituted the data. We searched three databases, ultimately including 108 articles. We extracted the articles into a spreadsheet that included basic details about the paper and the programme, including what level of the social ecological model programme activities addressed. Results The programmes reviewed reflect a diversity of priorities and approaches to addressing power, though most papers were largely based in a biomedical framework. Most programmes intervened at multiple levels simultaneously; some of these were 'structural' programmes that explicitly aimed to shift power relations, others addressed multiple levels using a more typical programme theory that sought to change individual behaviours and proximate drivers. This prevailing focus on proximate behaviours is somewhat mismatched with the broader literature on the power-related drivers of SRH health inequities, which explores the role of embedded norms and structures. Conclusion This paper adds value by summarising what the academic public health community has chosen to test and research in terms of power relations and SRH, and by raising questions about how this corresponds to the significant task of effecting change in power relations to improve the right to SRH.

Possible reasons for regional differences include a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, infrastructural deficits, different levels of healthcare quality or social determinants. We aim to study associations of social determinants and of rural infrastructure with the quality of medical care (eg, time to reperfusion or medication adherence) and on the long-term outcome after myocardial infarction. Methods and analysis We will employ a prospective cohort study design. Patients who are admitted with AMI will be invited to participate. We aim to recruit a total of 1000 participants over the course of 5 years. Information on outpatient care prior to AMI, acute healthcare of AMI, healthcare-related environmental factors and social determinants will be collected. Baseline data will be assessed in interviews and from the electronic data system of the hospital. Follow-up will be conducted after an observation period of 1 year via patient interviews. The outcomes of interest are cardiac and all-cause mortality, changes in quality of life, changes in health status of heart failure, major adverse cardiovascular events and participation in rehabilitation programmes. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Brandenburg Medical School (reference: E-01-20200923). Research findings will be disseminated and shared in different ways and include presenting at international and national conferences, publishing in peer-reviewed journals and facilitating dissemination workshops within local communities with patients and healthcare professionals.

Public health guidelines that were intended to reduce risk of exposure to the virus impacted vulnerability factors for IPV survivors and associated systems of services. We aimed to (1) explore the effect of COVID-19 on survivors of IPV; (2) assess the effect of COVID-19 on IPV-related service provisions and service providers; and (3) explore challenges and opportunities in the wake of COVID-19 on broader IPV services and advocacy. Method: Twelve directors of IPV shelter, criminal justice, and other advocacy services within a diverse, Midwestern metropolitan area were recruited to participate in in-depth, semi-structured interviews in June-August 2020. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Dedoose. Data were coded and analyzed through thematic analysis. Results: Four major themes, contextualized by COVID-19 and racial injustice, emerged from the data analysis: (1) IPV-related trends; (2) impact on IPV survivors, services, and agency morale; (3) inter-agency collaborations; and (4) future opportunities for innovative service delivery. Gaps and opportunities for developing culturally congruent, trauma-informed services were identified. Conclusion: Findings suggest that responsive and accessible IPV resources and associated advocacy services can make the difference between life and death for survivors.

However, environment justice research to date has given little attention to perceived fairness of environmental exposures as experienced by individuals. This study explored the feasibility of a bottom-up digital participatory (via mobile phones) approach using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture individuals' subjective experience of environmental exposures and the subjective evaluation of fairness by those affected in the context of Nepal. In total, 22 individuals participated in the study for 28 days. The results show high rates of study retention and adherence. Individuals' justice perception was found to vary within and between individuals, but also substantially depending on the types of environmental exposures. Nevertheless, the study indicates that uncertainties are inevitable as study design and timing may conflict participants' daily lives and priorities. The method allows us to consider multiple geographic contexts of individuals' everyday lives beyond residential environment. This pilot study proved the possibility to assess perceptions of environmental justice issues and demonstrated the necessary steps to using digital participatory method for assessing subjective perception of fairness of individuals.

The objective of this study was to describe the German health care landscape and to assess hospital utilization with respect to PAD and ALI. Methods: Secondary data analysis of diagnosis-related group statistics data (2009-2018) provided by the German Federal Statistical Office. Inclusion of cases encoded by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes for PAD and arterial embolism or thrombosis. Construction of line diagrams and choropleth maps to assess temporal trends and regional distributions. Results: A total of 2,589,511 cases (median age 72 years, 63% male) were included, of which 2,110,925 underwent surgical or interventional therapy. Overall amputation rate was 17%, with the highest rates of minor (28%) and major amputations (15%) in patients with tissue loss. In-hospital mortality (overall 4.1%) increased in accordance to Fontaine stages and was the highest in patients suffering arterial embolism or thrombosis (10%). Between 2009 and 2018, the annual number of PAD cases with tissue loss (Fontaine stage IV) increased from 97,092 to 111,268, whereby associated hospital utilization decreased from 2.2 million to 2.0 million hospital days. Hospital incidence and hospital utilization showed a clustering with the highest numbers in eastern Germany, while major amputation rate and mortality were highest in northern parts of Germany. Conclusions: Increased use of endovascular techniques was observed, while hospital utilization to treat PAD with tissue loss has decreased. This is despite an increased hospital incidence. Addressing socioeconomic inequalities and a more homogeneous distribution of dedicated vascular units might be advantageous in reducing the burden of disease associated with PAD and ALI.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Rohingya; refugee adolescents; Bangladesh; environmental risks; climate change; Cox's Bazar; adolescent capabilities	COXS BAZAR; REFUGEE CRISIS; MENTAL-HEALTH; CAPABILITIES; JUSTICE; STRESSORS; FRAMEWORK; CHILDREN	Integration of environmental, economic, and social approaches to development is crucial to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Global evidence reflects that this integration is often imbalanced, with development policies and programs in many low- and middle-income countries placing greater emphasis on economic needs than environmental vulnerabilities. Drawing on qualitative research undertaken in mid-2021, this article explores how limited integration of environmental, economic, and social aspects has affected the development of Rohingya refugee adolescents who were forcibly displaced from Myanmar to the Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh. Cox's Bazar is one of the most climate-vulnerable areas in Bangladesh and is subject to extreme rainfall, landslides, and flash floods. The article highlights the ways in which Rohingya adolescents are highly vulnerable to both the direct and indirect consequences of these environmental conditions due to poverty, and inadequate housing infrastructure and water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. It discusses the ways in which these environmental challenges intersect with socioeconomic disadvantage, especially limited education, skills development, and livelihood opportunities for young people, which are in turn compounded by limited voice and agency, and a dearth of security and protection measures. For some Rohingya adolescent girls and boys, the findings suggests that these multi-dimensional vulnerabilities place them at risk of exploitation by traffickers, smugglers, extremist groups, and criminals. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of explicitly integrating environmental aspects into policy and programs that support Rohingya adolescents to develop their full capabilities, and encouraging their meaningful participation in policy dialogues and accountability processes.

We used 2000-2019 household survey data from 154 surveys representing 89 low- and middle-income countries to assess within-country, economic-related inequality in the prevalence of one-year-old children with zero doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine. Zero-dose DTP prevalence data were disaggregated by household wealth quintile. Difference, ratio, slope index of inequality, concentration index, and excess change measures were calculated to assess the latest situation and change over time, by country income grouping for 17 countries with high zero-dose DTP numbers and prevalence. Across 89 countries, the median prevalence of zero-dose DTP was 7.6%. Within-country inequalities mostly favored the richest quintile, with 19 of 89 countries reporting a rich-poor gap of >= 20.0 percentage points. Low-income countries had higher inequality than lower-middle-income countries and upper-middle-income countries (difference between the median prevalence in the poorest and richest quintiles: 14.4, 8.9, and 2.7 percentage points, respectively). Zero-dose DTP prevalence among the poorest households of low-income countries declined between 2000 and 2009 and between 2010 and 2019, yet economic-related inequality remained high in many countries. Widespread economic-related inequalities in zero-dose DTP prevalence are particularly pronounced in low-income countries and have remained high over the previous decade.

J	Lv, MN; Jiang, SJ; Liao, DS; Lin, Z; Chen, HY; Zhang, JH				Lv, Meina; Jiang, Shaojun; Liao, Dongshan; Lin, Zhi; Chen, Haiyu; Zhang, Jinhua			Global burden of rheumatic heart disease and its association with socioeconomic development status, 1990-2019	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						Rheumatic heart disease; Global health; Global burden of diseases; Socioeconomics; Cardiology	INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION; HEALTH; WOMEN	Aims Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains an important health issue, yet global attention to RHD is diminishing. This study aimed to investigate the global burden of RHD and its relationship with socioeconomic development status. Methods and results Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 database. Incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and mortality numbers and rates for RHD were extracted and stratified by sex, level of socio-demographic index (SDI), country, and territory. In addition, the burden of RHD was compared across age groups. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates of RHD increased by 14.4% (11.2-17.0%) and 13.8% (11.0-16.0%), respectively. Incidence and prevalence rates showed an increasing trend in low SDI and low-middle SDI locations, while high-middle SDI and high SDI locations showed a decreasing trend. The age-standardized DALYs and mortality rates of RHD decreased by 53.1% (46.4-60.0) and 56.9% (49.8-64.7%), and this downward trend was more prominent in high-middle SDI and middle SDI locations. In addition, the age of incidence and prevalence rates were concentrated between 5-24 years and 15-49 years, predominantly in poor regions, and RHD appeared to be more common in women than in men. Conclusion The burden of RHD is negatively correlated with socioeconomic development status. In particular, the burden of RHD among children, adolescents, and women of childbearing age in poorer regions requires more attention. Policymakers should use the 2019 GBD data to guide cost-effective interventions and resource allocation for RHD.

Vegetables are low-energy, nutrient-dense foods that support health. Needs of populations differ by demographics; as such, there is a need to investigate vegetable intake in pregnant women of lower socioeconomic status (SES). The aim of this scoping review was (1) to describe vegetable intake during pregnancy in servings or grams and compare vegetable intake to recommendations and (2) to explore the relationship between vegetable intake during pregnancy and maternal SES character-istics. Using Arksey and O'Malley's framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-tematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews, studies were identified in a search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Global Health, and Scopus) published up to July 2021. All observational studies assessing vegetable intake in pregnancy, written in English, and conducted in an energy-replete context worldwide were included for review. Forty-seven publications met inclusion criteria. Although vegetable intake of pregnant women varies across populations, vegetable intake falls below recommendations worldwide. Studies investigating older age (n = 9), higher education (n = 7), higher income (n = 4), and vegetable intake consistently found a positive association, whereas a negative association with food insecurity (n = 4) was identified. Other variables explored that may influence vegetable intake was limited and too fragmented to generalize. Inconsistencies and possible inaccuracies in reporting vegetable intake may be related to the considerable variation in tools used for assessing vegetable intake. In conclusion, low vegetable intake in pregnancy needs to be addressed, with a particular focus on women of lower SES because of greater vulnerability to low vegetable intake.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Study quality was assessed using published criteria designed to identify sources of bias in studies reporting trends, and evidence summarised by narrative synthesis.FindingsTwenty-eight publications from 11 countries were included, covering periods from 6 to 40 years, between 1970 and 2017. In most countries, gains in healthy and disability-free life expectancy do not match the growth in total life expectancy. Exceptions were demonstrated for women in Sweden, where there were greater gains in disability-free years than life expectancy. Gains in healthy and disability-free life expectancy were greater for men than women in most countries except the USA (age 85), Japan (birth), Korea (age 65) and Sweden (age 77).ConclusionAn expansion of disability in later life is evident in a number of high-income countries, with implications for the sustainability of health and care systems. The recent COVID-19 pandemic may also impact health expectancies in the longer term.

During this transition, it is crucial that countries' strategies and activities remain guided by clear COVID-19 control objectives, which increasingly will focus on preventing and managing severe outcomes. Therefore, attention must be given to the groups that are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including individuals in congregate and healthcare settings. In this phase of pandemic management, a strong focus must remain on transitioning testing approaches and systems for targeted surveillance of COVID-19, capitalising on and strengthening existing systems for respiratory virus surveillance. Furthermore, it will be crucial to focus on lessons learned from the pandemic to enhance preparedness and to enact robust systems for the preparedness, detection, rapid investigation and assessment of new and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Filling existing knowledge gaps, including behavioural insights, can help guide the response to future resurgences of SARS-CoV-2 and/or the emergence of other pandemics. Finally, 'vaccine agility' will be needed to respond to changes in people's behaviours, changes in the virus, and changes in population immunity, all the while addressing issues of global health equity.

Referral for formal assessment of need (assessed using the 'international Resident Assessment Instrument' [interRAI]) is the first step to access publicly funded services in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). It is unclear whether ethnic access inequities present in other areas of the NZ health system occur in this referral process. This exploratory research aimed to explore ethnic variation in referrals for interRAI assessment, and associated factors. Methods A retrospective cohort study of all new referrals for aged care services for those 55-plus, received in 2018 by Waitemata District Health Board (WDHB), was conducted. The primary outcome was referral outcome (assessment and no assessment). Secondary outcomes included time from referral to assessment, reason for referral, mortality and, in the assessed cohort, assessment outcome. Results New referrals (n = 3263) were ethnically representative of the general older adult population in WDHB. Maori were younger and more likely to be referred for higher-level care needs than non-Maori, non-Pasifika (NMNP) (p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in referral outcome, time to assessment or mortality between ethnicities. NMNP were more likely to access lower-level care services than Maori or Pasifika older adults (p = 0.002). Conclusions Ethnicity was not associated with aged care service assessment access once people were referred for publicly funded services, nor was it associated with time to assessment or mortality in this exploratory study. Maori had higher care needs than NMNP at the time of referral.

J	Zhai, YS; Du, X				Zhai, Yusen; Du, Xue			Disparities and intersectionality in social support networks: addressing social inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond	HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								The COVID-19 pandemic has brought social injustice and inequalities to the forefront of global public health. Members of marginalised communities, such as racial/ethnic and sexual minorities, and persons with disabilities, have been shown to be more vulnerable to certain consequences of the pandemic. Research suggests a protective role of social support in health and wellness promotion, yet little is known about the disparities in specific social support sources (i.e., family, friends, and a significant other) between marginalised populations and their counterparts. Also unclear is the role of intersections of these marginalised identities in social support structures affected by the pandemic. Hence, it is crucial to capture and characterise such differences and intersectionality in order to address social inequalities in a time of global crisis. To that end, we surveyed U.S. adults across 45 states to examine their social support from family, friends, and a significant other. Results revealed the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on social support among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities and persons with disabilities. Additionally, we found that White individuals with a marginalised identity received less social support than their White counterparts but received a similar level of social support when compared with racial/ethnic minorities without additional marginalised identities. This article seeks to elucidate the social support disparities associated with disproportionately increased social isolation for marginalised populations due to socioeconomic disadvantages. Specific recommendations are provided for addressing issues around social disparities and inequalities. With the experience and awareness attained working with marginalised populations, mental health professionals, public health officials, and community stakeholders should be poised to attend to social capital inequalities for diversity, equity, and inclusion now and in the post-pandemic era.

Infrastructural Inequality and Household COVID-19 Vulnerability in a South African Urban Settlement	JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Built environment; Urban health; Social determinants of health; Epidemiology; Health inequality		COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of household infrastructure in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with Global South urban settlements particularly vulnerable. Targeted interventions have used area or dwelling type as proxies for infrastructural vulnerability, potentially missing vulnerable households. We use infrastructural determinants of COVID-19 (crowding, water source, toilet facilities, and indoor pollution) to create an Infrastructural Vulnerability Index using cross-sectional household data (2018-2019) from Mamelodi, a low-income urban settlement in South Africa. Households were stratified into vulnerability groups by index results; sociodemographic variables were assessed as predictors of index scores; and inequality analysis and decomposition were conducted. Thirty-three percent of households fell in the lowest risk group, 32% in the second, 21% in the third, and 14% in the highest. Dwelling type and geographical ward were associated with changes in index scores, with a shack (adjusted beta (a beta) = 3.45, CI = 3.39-3.51) associated with highest increase compared to a house. Wards in more developed areas were not consistently associated with lower index scores in the final regression model. The infrastructural vulnerability of the top 10% of households was greater than the bottom 40%, and inequality was predominantly within (80%) rather than between (20%) wards, and more between (60%) than within (40%) dwelling types. Our results show a minority of households account for the majority of infrastructural vulnerability, with its distribution only partially explained by area and dwelling type. Efforts to contain COVID-19 can be improved by using local-level data, and a vulnerability index, to target infrastructural support to households in greatest need.

Coronavirus, capitalism and a 'thousand tiny dis/advantages': a more-than-human analysis	SOCIAL THEORY & HEALTH			English	Article						Capitalism; Coronavirus; Dis; advantage; Inequalities; New materialism; Political economy	HEALTH; MATERIALIST; RETHINKING; SOCIOLOGY; FEMINISM; RACE	This paper establishes a relational, post-anthropocentric and materialist approach to the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. Analysis of the 'pandemic assemblage' reveals that the virus has subverted the social and economic relations of capitalism, enabling its global spread. This insight establishes a materialist framework for exploring socio-economic disparities in Covid-19 incidence and death rates, via a more-than-human and monist analysis of capitalist production and markets. Disparities derive from the 'thousand tiny dis/advantages' produced by people's daily interactions with human and non-human matter, making sense of the unequal occupational patterning of coronavirus incidence. This more-than-human approach supplies a critical alternative to the mainstream public health and scientific perspectives on the pandemic, with important implications for current and future policy to counter future microbiological outbreaks.

Current challenges and opportunities in the care of patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP): an international, multi-stakeholder perspective	ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES			English	Review						Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva; FOP; Unmet needs; Patient care; Diagnosis; Health policy; Rare disease	RARE DISEASE; CHILD	Background Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an ultra-rare, disabling genetic disorder characterized by congenital malformations of the great toes and progressive heterotopic ossification of soft and connective tissues. Assiduous attention to the unmet needs of this patient community is crucial to prevent potential iatrogenic harm and optimize care for individuals with FOP. Objective To gather international expert opinion and real-world experience on the key challenges for individuals with FOP and their families, highlight critical gaps in care, communication, and research, and provide recommendations for improvement. Methods An international group of expert clinicians, patients and patient advocates, caregivers and representatives from the international FOP community participated in a virtual, half-day meeting on 22 March 2021 to discuss the key unmet needs of individuals with FOP. Results Individuals with FOP often face the frustration of long diagnostic journeys, the burden of self-advocacy and the navigation of novel care pathways. Globally, patients with FOP are also confronted with inequities in access to diagnosis and specialist care, and consequently, unequal access to registries, clinical trials, and essential support from patient associations. Organizations such as the International FOP Association, the International Clinical Council on FOP, and national FOP organizations work to provide information, facilitate access to expert clinical guidance, nurture patient empowerment, fund FOP research and/or foster meaningful collaborations with the research community. The non-profit Tin Soldiers Global FOP Patient Search program aims to identify and provide a pathway to diagnosis and care for individuals with FOP, particularly in underserved communities. Such global initiatives and the increasingly widespread use of telemedicine and digital platforms offer opportunities to improve vital access to care and research. Conclusions This multi-stakeholder perspective highlights some of the unmet needs of individuals with FOP and their families. Regional and international organizations play an important role in improving the quality of life of those they reach in the global FOP community. However, globally, fundamental issues remain around raising awareness of FOP among healthcare professionals, identifying individuals with FOP, reducing time to diagnosis, and ensuring access to best practice in care, support, and clinical research.

In particular, we focus on examining the trajectory and insights of the partnership in light of ongoing educational, health, and sociopolitical crises during the pandemic and the racial uprisings against police violence. We sought to understand how the work shifted in response to these global crises and also what sustained our collaboration during these times. As we showcase through representative examples of our inquiries, members of different immigrant communities in our partnership drew on their individual and collective experiences to engage in research as an act of care, to address pragmatic and immediate needs in their schooling, and to contend with traumatic legacies of oppression. Expanding networks of care and the intellectual legacy of the collaboration itself-what we refer to as an intellectual commons-created the foundation to sustain and amplify our work together during a time of social transformation.

However, many countries in sub-Saharan Africa failed to achieve their national and international coverage targets repeatedly. The present study investigated trends of coverage and inequalities in coverage in Ethiopia. Methods This study used data from five rounds of the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in Ethiopia in 2000, 2005, 2011, 2016, and 2019. The surveys used a multistage cluster sampling procedure to obtain a nationally and sub-nationally representative data. The outcome variables included in the study were full immunization coverage and inequality. The World Health Organization's Health Equity Assessment Toolkit was used to conduct the inequality analysis. Projections for 2025 were based on smoothed averages generated using the demographic and health survey data from 2000 to 2019. Results The full (basic) immunization coverage in Ethiopia has increased steadily from 14.3% in 2000 to 44.1% in 2019. Based on the average past performance, the immunization coverage is projected to reach 53.6% by 2025, which will be short of the 75% national full (basic) immunization coverage target for the year 2025. Mothers with higher levels of education are more likely to get their children all basic vaccinations than those with lower levels of education. Similarly, the inequality gaps due to wealth and residency are significant; where children in the lowest wealth strata and those living in rural areas remained disadvantaged. Conclusion Despite a steady increase in immunization coverage in the past two decades the country is yet to achieve its immunization target. Thus, more efforts are needed to achieve the current and future national immunization targets. A more focused intervention targeting the disadvantaged groups could be an effective strategy to achieve coverage and minimize the inequality gaps in immunization.

J	Elbe, S				Elbe, Stefan			Who Owns a Deadly Virus? Viral Sovereignty, Global Health Emergencies, and the Matrix of the International	INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							AVIAN INFLUENZA; COLONIALITY; KNOWLEDGE; SECURITY; DISEASE	This article investigates the global inequities imbricated in the international response to lethal viruses. It does so by developing a virographic approach to the study of international relations that builds upon the matrix methods pioneered within black feminist thought for unraveling particularly complex forms of interlocking oppression. Performing such a virography of international relations exposes the multifaceted economic, racial, and epistemological disparities embedded in the international management of emergent viruses. It further demonstrates how those multiple axes of international inequality intersect during viral outbreaks to form a deadly matrix of global subjugation-vital abandonment-that repeatedly deprives the world's majority population from equitable access to life-saving biomedical interventions. It finally also reveals how diplomatic assertions of viral sovereignty, that is, claiming legal ownership of pathogens, are directly enrolling lethal viruses now in the political strategies of countries seeking to resist their vital abandonment. Overall, a virography thus contributes to the broader study of international relations by foregrounding the global salience of epidemiological injustices and positionalities, by capturing the actant power of lethal viruses in contemporary world politics, and by intimating that the "international" can itself be studied as a continually reconfiguring matrix of interlocking and historically conditioned global inequities.

However, these potential benefits may not impact everyone equally. We do not know how much they may address, or conversely widen, existing racial and socioeconomic health disparities. This study aims to review existing research that investigates the distribution of health impacts of active transportation interventions across indicators of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.Methods: We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature and other significant research to identify studies using a longitudinal design to evaluate the health outcomes of an active transportation intervention, and to compare differences between groups based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Transport Research International Documentation between January 1, 2000 and October 21, 2020.Results: Our search resulted in 7226 records that we screened for keyword relevance by title. We identified 3246 abstracts to review further but ultimately found only 10 studies meeting all our inclusion criteria. These 10 studies evaluated behavior change programs, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure improvements, and increased transit infrastructure or access. Eight of these studies found that the intervention had a positive impact on health outcomes overall. When compared across indicators of participant race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, nine found either no significant difference or a favorable impact of the intervention on the health outcome for disadvantaged groups studied.Conclusion: A significant gap in the literature persists, representing missed opportunities to further our understanding of how health inequities might be mitigated or addressed through changes in active transportation infrastructure, promotional campaigns, and policies. We call for researchers to include equity in the development of conceptual models, interventions, study design, and data analysis.

J	Fair, H; Klekociuk, S; Eccleston, C; Doherty, K; Farrow, M				Fair, Hannah; Klekociuk, Shannon; Eccleston, Claire; Doherty, Kathleen; Farrow, Maree			Interpersonal communication may improve equity in dementia risk education	HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article						dementia; dementia prevention; dementia risk reduction; information dissemination; risk reduction behavior	INTERVENTION; INFORMATION; PREVENTION; TRUST	Issue addressed Encouraging people to adopt life-long habits that reduce dementia risk is necessary to manage the growing global prevalence of this condition and is, therefore, a global health priority. Current initiatives promoting risk-reducing behaviour primarily attract participants from a limited range of backgrounds, even if widely available. This may inadvertently increase health inequities, as the people who are most likely to develop dementia are the people who are least involved in risk-reduction initiatives. Interpersonal communication can effectively disseminate health messages to demographically diverse populations and may, therefore, broaden the reach of dementia risk-reduction information. Methods Coding reliability thematic analysis was used to categorise reports of information sharing provided by participants from one global online dementia risk education initiative, the Preventing Dementia Massive Open Online Course, or MOOC. These reports of information sharing were provided in response to the feedback question: "If you have already applied your MOOC learning, please tell us how." Results Information was reportedly shared with a wide range of people, including those from demographic groups that are under-represented among Preventing Dementia MOOC participants. Information about specific risk factors was shared, along with general information about the course and/or dementia risk reduction. Some participants also reported that the people they shared information with were initiating risk-reducing behaviours. Conclusion Interpersonal communication has the potential to disseminate dementia risk reduction information to, and promote behaviour change among, a broad group of people at risk of dementia, thereby increasing equity in dementia risk education.

Methods The hepatitis virus screening data analyzed included the 5-year age group-specific number of participants aged 40 years or older, number of HBsAg-positive persons, and number of HCV carriers for each municipality from 2013 to 2017. Principal component analysis was used to derive a socioeconomic deprivation level using the socioeconomic characteristics of municipalities. Bayesian spatial Poisson regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association between the socioeconomic deprivation level and the results of screening. Data on 1,660 municipalities were used in the analysis. Results The data of 4,233,819 participants in the HBV screening and 4,216,720 in the HCV screening were used in the analysis. A principal component interpreted as level of rurality (principal component 1) and another principal component interpreted as level of low socioeconomic status among individuals (principal component 2) were extracted as the major principal components. Their principal component scores were used as the deprivation levels of municipalities. Spatial regression analysis showed that the deprivation level derived from the sum of the scores of principal components 1 and 2 was significantly and positively associated with HBsAg positivity and HCV prevalence. In addition, the deprivation level derived only from the score of principal component 2 was also significantly and positively associated with the outcomes. Conversely, the deprivation level derived only from the score of principal component 1 was not associated with the outcomes. Moreover, population density was significantly and positively associated with HBsAg positivity and HCV prevalence. Conclusions This study suggested that participation in hepatitis virus screening is important and meaningful, particularly for areas with a higher lower socioeconomic level in Japan.

Urban parks could alleviate the severe urban heating climate. However, due to the scarcity of urban land, it is impractical to plan and design urban parks by increasing the blue-green space without restriction. Few studies have focused on optimization and the equity of the parks' cooling service. This study quantifies four cooling indicators of urban parks in Wuhan city, park's cooling intensity (PCI), park's cooling area (PCA), park's cooling gradient (PCG), and park's cooling efficiency (PCE), analyze the drivers for four indicators, discuss different cooling bundles (urban parks with similar specific cooling ability are grouped into bundles) for the specific heat mitigation demands, and map the spatial accessibility for residents to parks' PCA using spatial network analysis. We find that 54 of 60 urban parks have significant cooling effect, with average PCI of 3.5 & PLUSMN; 0.2 ?, PCA of 131.6 & PLUSMN; 29.6 ha, PCG of 17.9 & PLUSMN; 1.5 ?/km, PCE of 4.5 & PLUSMN; 0.8. Blue and green infrastructure inside parks and impervious surface ratio surrounding the parks play significant roles in cooling service. Larger urban parks usually have larger PCA, but lower PCG and PCE. Five cooling bundles clustered with specific dominant cooling indicators could be references for the specific demand considering tradeoffs in urban parks' design and planning. Taking one step further, we unmask the unequal accessibility of the urban parks cooling service in one extreme heat day: 83.6% of the residents in the central area can enjoy the urban parks' cooling service within 30-min walk, while most residents (74.4%) in suburbs are not able to access to the cooling service within 30-min walk. Our study should be valuable for the urban planning and practice to find heat mitigation solutions and improve residents' heat comfort, also helpful for local municipalities to consider the urban parks' service provision for marginal groups.

Little is known about the types, ethos or distribution of secure beds in which they are detained. Aim This study aims to provide quantitative data with background information, to explore similarities and differences across jurisdictions, and to inform critical inquiry into key concepts and practices. Methods Data was obtained using an opportunistic sample of affluent countries, derived from an emerging academic/practice network of senior professionals. Depending on jurisdiction, data was already in the public domain or specifically requested. Data requests were related to the nature and size of health, welfare and criminal justice elements of secure beds and recent occupancy. Key professionals working in child secure settings, within jurisdictions, provided commentary on local approaches. Results Data was incomplete but allowed for comparisons between 10 jurisdictions. The proportions of the populations of children and young people detained varied by jurisdiction as did their distribution across variations of secure settings. Not all jurisdictions had all three kinds of secure settings. Definitions of secure beds varied depending on the use of relational, procedural or physical security. Conclusion Findings are tentative but suggestion solely considering numerical descriptions of children's detention is misleading; our study highlights ways in which comparative studies may be improved. Within reported jurisdictions, the framework of health, welfare and justice was meaningful but this may not hold true with a wider international application of this method. Open interrogation of this data would be enhanced by the inclusion of children's perspectives.

Association of COVID-19 and Endemic Systemic Racism With Postpartum Anxiety and Depression Among Black Birthing Individuals	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MENTAL-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; ALLOSTATIC LOAD; PUBLIC-HEALTH; CARE; RACE; DISCRIMINATION; DISPARITIES; PREGNANCY; DISORDER	IMPORTANCE The intersection of endemic structural racism and the global health crisis secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic represents a syndemic, defined as the aggregation of 2 or more endemic and epidemic conditions leading to adverse repercussions for health. Long-standing inequities have placed Black individuals at disproportionate risk for negative postpartum mental health outcomes. Studies are urgently needed to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has added to this risk (eg, syndemic associations). OBJECTIVE To examine the association between the syndemic and the postpartum mental health of Black birthing individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A longitudinal cohort of Black birthing individuals were followed up from pregnancy (April 17 to July 8, 2020) through the early postpartum period (August 11, 2020, to March 2, 2021) from urban university medical center prenatal clinics. Pregnant Black participants were recruited via email and completed 2 online surveys. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Composite variables capturing negative experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and racism (structural racism [general], structural racism [neighborhood], and interpersonal racism) were created. Logistic regressions examined main and interactive associations between these variables and postpartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale). RESULTS The mean (SD) age of 151 Black participants was 30.18 (5.65) years. The association between higher negative COVID-19 pandemic experiences and postpartum depression may be influenced by experiences of interpersonal racism and general systemic racism. Negative COVID-19 pandemic experiences were associated with greater likelihood of screening positive for depression only at higher levels of systemic racism (odds ratio, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.38-4.60) and interpersonal racism (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.04-3.48) but not at lower levels of systemic or interpersonal racism. Similarly, negative COVID-19 experiences were associated with anxiety only at higher levels of interpersonal racism (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 0.86-4.01) but not at lower levels of interpersonal racism. Overall, 44 (29%) met screening criteria for postpartum depression and 20 (13%) for postpartum anxiety. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this longitudinal cohort study of Black birthing individuals, the experience of the syndemic was associated with negative postpartum mental health. Associations between interpersonal racism, structural racism, and negative COVID-19 pandemic experiences were associated with greater risk for postpartum depression and anxiety. Research is needed to address how systemic racism perturbs biobehavioral pathways to magnify associations between acute stressors and mental health. Such research can inform the creation of effective, culturally informed preventive interventions to improve the postpartum mental health of Black individuals.	[Njoroge, Wanjiku F.

Incidence and outcomes of critical illness in Indigenous Peoples: a systematic review protocol	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Indigenous People; Critical illness; Critical care; Health outcomes; Epidemiology	CRITICAL-CARE; HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; ALBERTA; GRADE	Background: Indigenous Peoples experience health inequities across the continuum of health services. Improvements for Indigenous patients and their families during vulnerable experiences with the healthcare system may have a significant impact on the patient experience and outcomes. Improved understanding of the occurrence of critical illness in Indigenous Peoples and their use of critical care services, as a strategic priority, may aid in the development of initiatives for improving health equity. A global focus was selected to learn from Indigenous populations' experiences with critical care, as the understanding of critical illness among Indigenous Peoples in Canada is not well understood. This protocol outlines a systematic review focused on describing the incidence of critical illness and utilization of critical care services among Indigenous Peoples. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched. Relevant Canadian sites for gray literature (National Collaborating Centre for Indigenous Health, First Nations Health Authority, Canadian Institutes of Health Research Institute of Indigenous Peoples' Health, National Association of Friendship Centres, the Alberta First Nations Information Governance Centre, Metis Nation of Alberta) will also be searched. We will include studies of adults (>= 18 years) either without critical illness (i.e., general population) or with critical illness (i.e., admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU)). The exposure of interest will be Indigenous identity. Primary outcome measures are ICU admission and ICU mortality. Because heterogeneity in populations, comparisons, and outcome measures is anticipated, it is likely that the findings will be summarized using a narrative synthesis. A meta-analysis will be performed if there is sufficient evidence on one or more outcomes of interest. Discussion: This systematic review will provide a better understanding of the epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of critical illness and utilization of critical care services among Indigenous Peoples. The knowledge generated will be applied to a broader program of work designed to create ethical space to co-design, implement, and evaluate a culturally competent, safe, and innovative model for critical care services for Indigenous People.

Prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination efforts and dose allocation within Madagascar	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							NCOV-19 AZD1222 VACCINE; SEROPREVALENCE; SARS-COV-2; EFFICACY; MEASLES	Background: While mass COVID-19 vaccination programs are underway in high-income countries, limited availability of doses has resulted in few vaccines administered in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) is a WHO-led initiative to promote vaccine access equity to LMICs and is providing many of the doses available in these settings. However, initial doses are limited and countries, such as Madagascar, need to develop prioritization schemes to maximize the benefits of vaccination with very limited supplies. There is some consensus that dose deployment should initially target health care workers, and those who are more vulnerable including older individuals. However, questions of geographic deployment remain, in particular associated with limits around vaccine access and delivery capacity in underserved communities, for example in rural areas that may also include substantial proportions of the population. Methods: To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and simulated various vaccination allocation strategies for Madagascar. Simulated strategies were based on a number of possible geographical prioritization schemes, testing sensitivity to initial susceptibility in the population, and evaluating the potential of tests for previous infection. Results: Using cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 as the main outcome of interest, our results indicate that distributing the number of vaccine doses according to the number of elderly living in the region or according to the population size results in a greater reduction of mortality compared to distributing doses based on the reported number of cases and deaths. The benefits of vaccination strategies are diminished if the burden (and thus accumulated immunity) has been greatest in the most populous regions, but the overall strategy ranking remains comparable. If rapid tests for prior immunity may be swiftly and effectively delivered, there is potential for considerable gain in mortality averted, but considering delivery limitations modulates this. Conclusion: At a subnational scale, our results support the strategy adopted by the COVAX initiative at a global scale.

Closing the gap in malnutrition between children of different backgrounds aligns well with the tenet of this international agenda. To this end, high-quality evidence of the magnitude and trends of socioeconomic and geographic related existing inequalities in the childhood stunting among Sudanese children emanate from this study help for policy maker and planners to design and implement effective interventions to narrow down inequality. Methods We used the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) for our analysis of stunting inequality. Following standard equity analysis methods recommended by the WHO, we performed the disaggregated analysis of stunting across five equity stratifiers: Wealth, education, residence, sex, and sub-national regions. Then, we summarized stunting inequality through four measures of inequality: Difference, Ratio, Slope Index of Inequality (SII), and Relative Index of Inequality (RII). The point estimates of stunting were accompanied by 95% confidence intervals to measure the statistical significance of the findings. Results In this study, the national average childhood stunting prevalence was increased by 4% from 2010 to 2014. The findings revealed stark inequalities in stunting in all the studied dimensions of inequality. Huge inequality has existed along the wealth quintiles. Simple difference measure for education was increased by four points and simple relative measure decreased by one point for economic status. Conclusions Sex, residence and, geographically related inequalities remain unchanged over time, while economic status and educational inequality had seen a change by some inequality measures over the same time period.

In Iran, RTCs rank second in terms of mortality. To address this issue, there is a need for research-based interventions. Prioritizing researches using a variety of approaches and frameworks to determine the most effective interventions is a key nodal point in the RTCs' research policy planning cycle. Thus, this study aims to generate and prioritize research questions in the field of RTCs in Iran. Methods By adapting the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method, this study engaged 25 prominent Iranian academic leaders having role in setting Iran's long-term road safety goals, a group of research funders, and policymakers. The experts' proposed research questions were independently scored on a set of criteria: feasibility, impact on health, impact on the economy, capacity building, and equity. Following the prioritization of Research Questions (RQs), they were all classified using the 5 Pillar frameworks. Results In total, 145 Research Questions were systematically scored by experts against five criteria. Iran's top 20 road traffic safety priorities were established. The RQs related to "road safety management" and "road and infrastructure" achieved a high frequency. Conclusions The top 20 research questions in the area of RTCs in Iran were determined by experts. The majority of these RQs were related to "road safety management". The results of this study may contribute to the optimal use of resources in achieving long-term goals in the prevention and control of road traffic crashes and its related injuries. Considering these RQs as research investment options will improve the current status of Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) at a national level and further advance toward compliance with international goals. If these research priorities are addressed, and their findings are implemented, we can anticipate a significant reduction in the number of crashes, injuries, and deaths.

Integrating trauma-informed care into career counseling: A response to COVID-19 job loss for Black, indigenous, and people of color	JOURNAL OF EMPLOYMENT COUNSELING			English	Article						trauma-informed practice; COVID-19; equity; career disparities; social justice	DISPARITIES; HEALTH	The drastic increase among the U.S. unemployment rate led to increased trauma among those who lost their job as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Combined with racial and ethnic disparities, the culmination of these traumatic stressors creates unique challenges and barriers for individuals from historically marginalized populations and low socioeconomic backgrounds. In this article, we explore how trauma-informed care can be integrated into career development practices for career practitioners. We provide a conceptualization of trauma-informed practice, interventions, and practical implications for career practitioners to incorporate in their work with historically marginalized clients.

Many intervention programs have been introduced for IPV, with various target populations, purposes, designs, and outcomes. However, a consensus has not been reached regarding which type of program has the greatest impact. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of existing interventions on IPV risk and to compare the effects of the interventions based on their purposes and designs. Method: A systematic review and meta-analytic method were utilized in this study. Through a rigorous database search, 13 randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected and included in the analysis. Results: The included interventions had a small effect size, which was statistically significant. The couple interventions aiming to reduce the risk of IPV perpetration and victimization simultaneously showed the greatest impact, compared to bystander interventions and interventions targeting either perpetrators or victims. The interventions aiming to reduce the risk of IPV perpetration showed a significant impact on changing gender equality-related knowledge and attitudes, and those aiming to reduce the risk of IPV victimization were effective in increasing knowledge and changing attitudes related to traditional norms, empowerment, and health conditions. The interventions targeting bystanders showed significant effects on increasing bystander-related attitudes and behaviors. Conclusion: Our findings provide strong evidence for future intervention programs for IPV. Long-term research to follow-up actual IPV reductions after interventions will be needed to confirm the findings of this study.

A population-based study of homelessness, antisocial behaviour and violence victimisation among young adults in Victoria, Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES			English	Article						homelessness; longitudinal survey; physical violence; victimisation; young adult	PROTECTIVE FACTORS; SUBSTANCE USE; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; YOUTH HOMELESSNESS; WASHINGTON-STATE; ADOLESCENT RISK; HEALTH; CARE; ASSOCIATIONS; COMMUNITIES	Homeless young adults are at increased risk for contact with the police and are overrepresented in the justice system. This study explored associations between homelessness, antisocial behaviour and violence victimisation using longitudinal panel data gathered through young adulthood. Data were drawn from a state representative population-based sample of young adults from Victoria, Australia participating in the International Youth Development Study (IYDS; n = 2884, 54% female). Participants were surveyed at age 21 years, with follow-up at ages 23 and 25 years. We examined changes in the prevalence of homelessness and tested hypothesised directional relationships between young adult homelessness, antisocial behaviour and violence victimisation using longitudinal cross-lagged panel models. Multiple-group modelling was used to test whether these relationships were moderated by gender. The prevalence of young adult homelessness was highest at age 21 (6.5%), declining at ages 23 (3.9%) and 25 years (2.5%). Results showed that young adult homelessness, antisocial behaviour and victimisation were related cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Gender did not significantly moderate these associations. Findings suggest that the state of homelessness is associated with temporary vulnerability to potentially harmful and problematic situations involving antisocial behaviour and victimisation. These situations are likely to heighten risk for contact with the police and direct physical and psychological harm.

First, to better understand the emotional experiences of poverty, injustice and development, and second, to understand the ways that public policy can shape the capabilities for love. Following analysis of the importance of love for physical and mental health, the article examines areas of public policy in the global North and South that may undermine the capability to love and be loved. The article concludes by highlighting the ways that attention to love may help to humanize international development research and overcome "othering."

There are limited options to prevent or treat malaria in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, and existing ones may not work optimally in areas where the threat of drug resistance is rising. As malaria elimination is a key goal of the global health community, the inclusion of pregnant women in the adult population to protect from malaria will be key to achieving success. New, safe, and effective options are needed but it can take decades of evidence-gathering before a medicine is recommended for use in pregnancy. This is because pregnant women are typically not included in pre-registration clinical trials due to fear of causing harm. Data to support dosing and safety in pregnancy are subsequently collected in post-licensure studies. There have been growing calls in recent years that this practice needs to change, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing public awareness that newly developed medicines generally cannot be administered to pregnant women from the onset. The development of new anti-malarials should ensure that data informing their use in pregnancy and breastfeeding are available earlier. To achieve this, a mindset change and a different approach to medications for pregnant women are needed. Changes in non-clinical, translational, and clinical approaches in the drug development pathway, in line with recent recommendations from the regulatory bodies are proposed in this Comment. The new approach applies to any malaria-endemic region, regardless of the type of Plasmodium responsible for malaria cases. By incorporating intentional and systematic data collection from pre-registration stages of development through post-licensure, it will be possible to inform on the benefit/risk balance of a new anti-malarial earlier and help ensure that the needs of pregnant individuals are addressed in a more timely and equitable manner in the future.

J	Taylor, HR				Taylor, Hugh R.			The Peter Watson Memorial Lecture "Vision for the World"	EYE			English	Review							DISABILITY WEIGHTS; GLOBAL BURDEN; CATARACT-SURGERY; BLINDNESS; IMPAIRMENT; OUTCOMES	In the 1990s attention was drawn to the huge global problem of blindness and vision loss; most of which was unnecessary, being preventable or treatable. This led to the global initiative, Vision 2020. Over the last 30 years a lot of progress has been made in developing and implementing eye care programmes to address this and particularly to reach underserved populations. In 2019 the World Health Organisation produced the World Report on Vision that sets a clear pathway to develop Integrated Person-centred Eye Care. Indicators have been developed to track progress and national governments are to report on their progress. Data on eye health and vision loss have been collected from multiple population-based studies and analysed by the Vision Loss Expert Group. These data show that although the prevalence rates of vision loss and blindness are decreasing around the world, the actual number of people affected is slowly increasing. This is due to both population growth and the aging of the population. To provide the equity in eye care that is required, attention needs to be paid to integrating eye care into primary care and linking it with other specialist services. An important step is the training and development of coordinated eye care teams that are resourced to meet their population-based needs and to monitor the progress being made.

Despite increasing evidence that PDs are not as stable as previously assumed, the long-term stability of PDs remains under major debate. The aim of the current paper was to investigate the categorical and dimensional mean-level and rank-order stability of PDs from adolescence into young adulthood in a high-risk sample. MethodsIn total, 115 young adults with a history of residential child welfare and juvenile-justice placements in Switzerland were included in the current study. PDs were assessed at baseline and at a 10-year follow-up. On a categorical level, mean-level stability was assessed through the proportion of enduring cases from baseline to follow-up. Rank-order stability was assessed through Cohen's kappa and tetrachoric correlation coefficients. On a dimensional level, the magnitude of change between the PD trait scores at baseline and at follow-up was measured by Cohen's d. Rank-order stability was assessed through Spearman's rho. ResultsThe prevalence rate for any PD was 20.0% at baseline and 30.4% at follow-up. The most frequently diagnosed disorders were antisocial, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive PDs, both at baseline and at follow-up. On a categorical level, the mean-level stability of any PD was only moderate, and the mean-level stability of specific PDs was low, except of schizoid PD. Likewise, the rank-order stability of any PD category was moderate, while ranging from low to high for individual PD diagnoses. On a dimensional level, scores increased significantly for most PDs, except for histrionic traits, which decreased significantly from baseline to follow-up. Effect sizes were generally low. The rank-order stability for dimensional scores ranged from low to moderate. ConclusionThe findings indicate low to moderate stability of Pds and Pd traits from adolescence to adulthood, which supports the growing evidence that categorical diagnoses of Pds are quite unstable. This in turn, emphasizes the use of the upcoming ICD-11 that Acknowledgments Pds to be only "relatively" stable.

Especially in countries such as Ethiopia in the Global South, all three are impacted by, and in turn have bearing upon, social justice and equity. Combined, these spatial and social factors reduce wellbeing, leading to increasing urgency to create urban environments that are more livable, resilient, and adaptive. However, the impacts on, and of, non-human urban residents, particularly on the ecosystem services they provide, are often neglected. We review the literature using the One Health theoretical framework and focusing on Ethiopia as a case-study. We argue for specific urban strategies that benefit humans and also have spillover effects that benefit other species, and vice versa. For example, urban trees provide shade, clean the air, help combat climate change, create more livable neighborhoods, and offer habitat for many species. Similarly, urban neighborhoods that attract wildlife have characteristics that also make them more desirable for humans, resulting in improved health outcomes, higher livability, and enhanced real-estate values. After summarizing the present state of knowledge about urban ecology, we emphasize components relevant to the developing world in general and pre- COVID-19 pandemic Ethiopia in particular, then expand the discussion to include social justice and equity concerns in the built environment. Prior to the ongoing civil war, Ethiopia was beginning to invest in more sustainable urbanization and serve as a model. Especially in light of the conflict and pandemic, much more will need to be done.

In the context of COVID-19 in China, we explore China's control strategies and challenges. Our analysis examines seven strategies: digital technology pandemic prevention, zero-case policy, all-staff nucleic acid testing, all-staff vaccinations, the long-term quarantine system, and the official accountability system. Additionally, it considers three challenges: repeated pandemic waves, increased downward pressure on the economy and social exhaustion. We identify the causes of these challenges, including social and natural factors, and the controls put in place. We contend that China's control strategies slowed the spread of the global pandemic and that Chinese vaccines have promoted global vaccine equity.

The focus is on a sample of 140 countries around the globe for the period 2000-2019. The methodology involves the: (i) Fixed Effects estimator to control for individual heterogeneity, (ii) Driscoll and Kraay estimator to control for cross-section dependence between panels, (iii) the Mean Group estimator to take into account the averages between panel groups, (iv) the system GMM to correct for unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity bias and (v) the instrumental variable Fixed Effects Tobit to take in to account the limited range in our dependent variable. The results show that ICT has a positive and significant effect on sustainable development. Whereas overall net effects are positive, the findings are contingent on the choice of the ICT measurement, the geographical location of the economy and the income group category. The study recommends policy makers to take into account ICT and the advantages it offers in the elaboration of measures for the sustainable development agenda.

Yet there is limited evidence on whether and how CHW programmes achieve this. This systematic review aimed to synthesise research findings on the following questions: (1) How effective are CHW interventions at reaching the most disadvantaged groups in LMIC contexts? and (2) What evidence exists on whether and how these programmes reduce health inequities in the populations they serve? Methods: We searched six academic databases for recent (2014-2020) studies reporting on CHW programme access, utilisation, quality, and effects on health outcomes/behaviours in relation to potential stratifiers of health opportunities and outcomes (e.g., gender, socioeconomic status, place of residence). Quantitative data were extracted, tabulated, and subjected to meta-analysis where appropriate. Qualitative findings were synthesised using thematic analysis. Results: One hundred sixty-seven studies met the search criteria, reporting on CHW interventions in 33 LMIC. Quantitative synthesis showed that CHW programmes successfully reach many (although not all) marginalized groups, but that health inequalities often persist in the populations they serve. Qualitative findings suggest that disadvantaged groups experienced barriers to taking up CHW health advice and referrals and point to a range of strategies for improving the reach and impact of CHW programmes in these groups. Ensuring fair working conditions for CHWs and expanding opportunities for advocacy were also revealed as being important for bridging health equity gaps. Conclusion: In order to optimise the equity impacts of CHW programmes, we need to move beyond seeing CHWs as a temporary sticking plaster, and instead build meaningful partnerships between CHWs, communities and policymakers to confront and address the underlying structures of inequity.

This unprecedented crisis forces individuals to make considerable efforts to adapt and will have psychological and social consequences, mainly on vulnerable individuals, that will remain once the pandemic is contained and will most likely exacerbate existing social and gender health inequalities. This crisis also puts a toll on the capacity of our healthcare and social services structures to provide timely and adequate care. The MAVIPAN (Ma vie et la pandemie/ My Life and the Pandemic) study aims to document how individuals, families, healthcare workers and health organisations are affected by the pandemic and how they adapt. Methods and analysis MAVIPAN is a 5-year longitudinal prospective cohort study launched in April 2020 across the province of Quebec (Canada). Quantitative data will be collected through online questionnaires (4-6 times/year) according to the evolution of the pandemic. Qualitative data will be collected with individual and group interviews and will seek to deepen our understanding of coping strategies. Analysis will be conducted under a mixed-method umbrella, with both sequential and simultaneous analyses of quantitative and qualitative data.

Socioeconomic inequalities in adolescent health complaints: A multilevel latent class analysis in 45 countries	CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Multiple health complaints; Psychosomatic; Mental health; Socioeconomic position; Adolescents; HBSC	INCOME INEQUALITY; FAMILY AFFLUENCE; MENTAL-HEALTH; CHILDREN; BEHAVIORS; TRENDS; NEEDS	Our study evaluated the relationship between adolescent health complaints and socioeconomic position in 45 countries. Data are from the 2017/2018 international Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey which used proportionate sampling among adolescents aged 11 to 15 years old (n=228,979). Multilevel, multinomial regression analysis assessed the association between the multilevel latent classes with socioeconomic status (SES; at the household and country level). Three distinct latent classes were identified: No Complaints, Psychological Complaints, and a Physical and Psychological Complaints class; where, low household SES was highest for the physical and psychological complaints class. The findings suggest that health promotion policies and interventions among adolescents should consider the specific needs of adolescents living with low household SES as they report more subjective health complaints.

J	Jaime, G; Hobeika, A; Figuié, M				Jaime, Gloria; Hobeika, Alexandre; Figuie, Muriel			Access to Veterinary Drugs in Sub-Saharan Africa: Roadblocks and Current Solutions	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						access to medicines (ATM); animal health; international pharmaceutical market; supply chain; Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA); veterinary drugs	ANIMAL HEALTH-SERVICES; INTERNATIONAL HARMONIZATION; COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS; BOVINE TRYPANOSOMIASIS; EMPIRICAL APPLICATION; MEDICINAL PRODUCTS; DELIVERY; SYSTEMS; DISEASE	BackgroundAccess to veterinary drugs for livestock has become a major issue over the last decade. Analysis has tended to focus on the demand for these products, while studies looking at the drivers behind their use generally focus on farmer behavior and interactions between veterinarians and farmers. However, the use of drugs also depends on structural factors that determine the functioning of the drug supply chain and farmers' access to the drugs. This article presents an overview of the factors that limit access to veterinary drugs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as well as the international policy tools and arrangements that claim to improve it. MethodsWe have conducted a scoping review of the scientific and grey literature as well as the publicly-available data from both the animal health industry and international organizations. We aimed to gather information on the veterinary drugs market in SSA as well as on the international norms, recommendations, guidelines, and initiatives that impact SSA farmers' access to these drugs. FindingsWe highlight numerous barriers to veterinary drug access in SSA. The SSA market is highly dependent on imports, yet the region attracts little attention from the international companies capable of exporting to it. It suffers from a high level of fragmentation and weak distribution infrastructures and services, and is driven by the multiplication of private non-professional actors playing a growing role in the veterinary drug supply chain. The distribution system is increasingly dualized, with on the one hand the public sector (supported by development organizations) supplying small scale farmers in rural areas, but with limited and irregular means; and on the other side a private sector largely unregulated which supplies commercial and industrial farming systems. Different innovations have been developed at the international and regional levels to try to reduce barriers, such as homogenizing national legislations, donations, and vaccine banks. Alongside decades-old inter-state cooperation, many new forms of public-private partnerships and other hybrid forums continue to emerge, signaling the private sector's increasing influence in global governance. ConclusionsPolicies on animal health would be bolstered by a better understanding of the drivers behind and the components of access to veterinary drugs in different regional and national contexts. Inequalities in drug access need to be addressed and a market-driven approach adopted in order to strengthen our understanding of what determines veterinary drug use at the farm level. Policies should balance the interests of the various stakeholders, being careful not to reinforce bias toward certain diseases deemed "interesting" and neglect others that could prove to be highly important for veterinary public health.

Recognizing different COVID-19 subphenotypes-the division of populations of patients into more meaningful subgroups driven by clinical features-and their severity characterization may assist clinicians during the clinical course, the vaccination process, research efforts, the surveillance system, and the allocation of limited resources. Objective: We aimed to discover age-sex unbiased COVID-19 patient subphenotypes based on easily available phenotypical data before admission, such as pre-existing comorbidities, lifestyle habits, and demographic features, to study the potential early severity stratification capabilities of the discovered subgroups through characterizing their severity patterns, including prognostic, intensive care unit (ICU), and morbimortality outcomes. Methods: We used the Mexican Government COVID-19 open data, including 778,692 SARS-CoV-2 population-based patient-level data as of September 2020. We applied a meta-clustering technique that consists of a 2-stage clustering approach combining dimensionality reduction (ie, principal components analysis and multiple correspondence analysis) and hierarchical clustering using the Ward minimum variance method with Euclidean squared distance. Results: In the independent age-sex clustering analyses, 56 clusters supported 11 clinically distinguishable meta-clusters (MCs). MCs 1-3 showed high recovery rates (90.27%-95.22%), including healthy patients of all ages, children with comorbidities and priority in receiving medical resources (ie, higher rates of hospitalization, intubation, and ICU admission) compared with other adult subgroups that have similar conditions, and young obese smokers. MCs 4-5 showed moderate recovery rates (81.30%-82.81%), including patients with hypertension or diabetes of all ages and obese patients with pneumonia, hypertension, and diabetes. MCs 6-11 showed low recovery rates (53.96%-66.94%), including immunosuppressed patients with high comorbidity rates, patients with chronic kidney disease with a poor survival length and probability of recovery, older smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, older adults with severe diabetes and hypertension, and the oldest obese smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild cardiovascular disease. Group outcomes conformed to the recent literature on dedicated age-sex groups. Mexican states and several types of clinical institutions showed relevant heterogeneity regarding severity, potentially linked to socioeconomic or health inequalities. Conclusions: The proposed 2-stage cluster analysis methodology produced a discriminative characterization of the sample and explainability over age and sex. These results can potentially help in understanding the clinical patient and their stratification for automated early triage before further tests and laboratory results are available and even in locations where additional tests are not available or to help decide resource allocation among vulnerable subgroups such as to prioritize vaccination or treatments.

Design Epidemiological study. Design Epidemiological study. Setting Country-based data from publicly available online databases of international organisations. Participants The study involved 170 countries/territories, each of which had complete COVID-19 and tuberculosis data, as well as specific health-related estimators (obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia). Primary and secondary outcome measures The worldwide heterogeneity of the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths per million on 31 December 2020 was analysed by 17 macro-scale estimators around the health-related, socioeconomic, climatic and political factors. In 139 of 170 nations, the best subsets regression was used to investigate all potential models of COVID-19 variations among countries. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to explore the predictive capacity of these variables. The same analysis was applied to the number of deaths per hundred thousand due to tuberculosis, a quite different infectious disease, to validate and control the differences with the proposed models for COVID-19. Results In the model for the COVID-19 cases (R-2 =0.45), obesity (beta=0.460), hypertension (beta=0.214), sunshine (beta=-0.157) and transparency (beta=0.147); whereas in the model for COVID-19 deaths (R-2 =0.41), obesity (beta=0.279), hypertension (beta=0.285), alcohol consumption (beta=0.173) and urbanisation (beta=0.204) were significant factors (p<0.05). Unlike COVID-19, the tuberculosis model contained significant indicators like obesity, undernourishment, air pollution, age, schooling, democracy and Gini Inequality Index. Conclusions This study recommends the new predictors explaining the global variability of COVID-19. Thus, it might assist policymakers in developing health policies and social strategies to deal with COVID-19.

J	López, RN				Lopez, Raul Necochea			Development as Gender Equity: Women's Advocacy and Cancer Control at the Pan-American Health Organization, 1980-2000	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY			English	Article						development; Latin America; Pan-American Health Organization; women's health advocacy; cancer	PERU; HISTORY	Women's advocates' strategies to influence international health agencies offer a new way to think about development. This article deals with the vibrant growth of women's health initiatives at the Pan-American Health Organization during Latin America's financially turbulent years from the 1980s through the 1990s. The multi-faceted nature of this process was especially apparent in the case of cervical cancer, the illness that launched the organization's cancer control programs. Archived reports and interviews with former officers show how the Pan-American Health Organization's approach to women's health broadened in this period to include new actors in response to demands of women's health advocates from Latin America. These advocates advanced the position that gender inequality played a fundamental role in placing women at risk for lethal and preventable illnesses. They also challenged international health agencies such as the Pan-American Health Organization to prioritize redressing those gendered inequalities as integral to development, rather than define the latter solely in terms of the improvement of economic conditions.

Diversity Disparity Professional I	Consideration of sex and gender in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders from a global perspective	ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA			English	Article						Alzheimer's; ethnicity; gender; global health; risk factors; sex; sociocultural factors	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ANDROGEN-DEPRIVATION THERAPY; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; VERBAL-LEARNING TEST; BLOOD-PRESSURE; RISK-FACTORS; MEMORY COMPLAINT; OLDER-ADULTS; HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS	Sex or gender differences in the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) differ by world region, suggesting that there are potentially modifiable risk factors for intervention. However, few epidemiological or clinical ADRD studies examine sex differences; even fewer evaluate gender in the context of ADRD risk. The goals of this perspective are to: (1) provide definitions of gender, biologic sex, and sexual orientation. and the limitations of examining these as binary variables; (2) provide an overview of what is known with regard to sex and gender differences in the risk, prevention, and diagnosis of ADRD; and (3) discuss these sex and gender differences from a global, worldwide perspective. Identifying drivers of sex and gender differences in ADRD throughout the world is a first step in developing interventions unique to each geographical and sociocultural area to reduce these inequities and to ultimately reduce global ADRD risk. Highlights The burden of dementia is unevenly distributed geographically and by sex and gender. Scientific advances in genetics and biomarkers challenge beliefs that sex is binary. Discrimination against women and sex and gender minority (SGM) populations contributes to cognitive decline. Sociocultural factors lead to gender inequities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) worldwide.

Lack of access to efficacious medicines in LMICs further exacerbates this inequity. Addressing inequitable access to medicines and assuring their sustainable use is critical to the well-being of these populations. Whilst inadequate access to medicines in LMICs has drawn much attention, less is known about the sustainable use of available medicines, particularly to ensure their efficacy and mitigate harm to the population and the environment. Uganda has adopted various measures to ensure sustainable medicines use, including a national medicines policy, essential medicines list, medicines regulation framework and promotion of domestic medicines production. Despite progress, challenges remain to achieving sustainable medicines use in the country, including fragmented access, inappropriate use, poor quality and inappropriate disposal. There is a need to consolidate the globally embraced One Health approach (fostering collaboration between human, animal and environmental health sectors) to addressing these challenges as espoused in the country's One Health strategic plan. Medicines supply chain management in public sector health facilities needs to be strengthened to minimize inventory shortages (stock-outs). A strategy for universal health insurance can minimize economic barriers to medicines access. Enhanced professional and medicines regulation in the private health market needs to be implemented. There are opportunities to build further capacity in Uganda, particularly infrastructure for regulation of its healthcare systems, policy and governance, workforce capacity building, and population action and engagement.

In Thailand, though PA screening is provided under the universal health coverage, the service can be offered only at some centers. Hence, the service availability affects an accessibility of health care in patients. Our study aimed to evaluate the service utilization in PA screening and diagnosis in terms of geographical inequality in health resources in Southern Thailand. Methods Data of 688 patients who underwent PA screening from 2011 to 2017 were obtained from the electronic database of Songklanagarind Hospital, a super-tertiary center in this region. The patients' residence in the province, district and subdistrict were transformed to a 6-digit numbers corresponding to the global one (GADM (c)). The areas with PA screening and diagnosis were visualized by disease mapping procedures. A general log linear model was used to identify the factors affecting patient's service accessibility. Results From the geographic distribution, patients living in or near the area of the super-tertiary center (Songkhla) had high probability of receiving PA screening. The analysis of factors contributing to PA screening by multivariate log-linear model demonstrated that the distance from the super-tertiary center was a predictive factor for screening while the presence of endocrinologists and cultural differences were not. The chance of patients living in Songkhla, living less than 200 km, and more than 200 km from Songkhla to receive PA screening was 100, 82, and 66%, respectively. The crude incidence rate of PA in Southern Thailand was 1.66/10(6) person-years. The provinces located adjacent to the Andaman Sea had the highest incidences of PA (3.62-5.17 patients/10(6) person-years). Conclusions There is still geographical inequality and the strategy to decrease the barrier should be resolved. The policymaker should develop a transfer system of blood tests for PA investigation from the local hospital to reduce the burden such as transportation costs in patients who live far away from the super-tertiary hospital. In addition, PA screening should be implemented in hypertension care plan.

J	Solberg, CT; Tranvåg, EJ; Magelssen, M				Solberg, Carl Tollef; Tranvag, Eirik Joakim; Magelssen, Morten			Attitudes towards priority setting in the norwegian health care system: a general population survey	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Attitude survey; Empirical ethics; General population; Legitimacy; Norway; Priority setting	CRITERIA; PRIORITIZATION; PREFERENCES; EQUITY; NORWAY; VIEWS	Background In an ideal world, everyone would receive medical resources in accordance with their needs. In reality, resources are often scarce and have an alternative use. Thus, we are forced to prioritize. Although Norway is one of the leading countries in normative priority setting work, few descriptive studies have been conducted in the country. To increase legitimacy in priority setting, knowledge about laypeople's attitudes is central. The aim of the study is therefore to assess the general population's attitudes towards a broad spectrum of issues pertinent to priority setting in the Norwegian publicly financed health care system. Methods We developed an electronic questionnaire that was distributed to a representative sample of 2 540 Norwegians regarding their attitudes towards priority setting in Norway. A total of 1 035 responded (response rate 40.7%). Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Results A majority (73.0%) of respondents preferred increased funding of publicly financed health services at the expense of other sectors in society. Moreover, a larger share of the respondents suggested either increased taxes (37.0%) or drawing from the Government Pension Fund Global (31.0%) as sources of funding. However, the respondents were divided on whether it was acceptable to say "no" to new cancer drugs when the effect is low and the price is high: 38.6% somewhat or fully disagreed that this was acceptable, while 46.5% somewhat or fully agreed. Lastly, 84.0% of the respondents did not find it acceptable that the Norwegian municipalities have different standards for providing care services. Conclusion Although the survey suggests support for priority setting among Norwegian laypeople, it has also revealed that a significant minority are reluctant to accept it.

Health and access to healthcare in homeless people Protocol for a mixed-methods study	MEDICINE			English	Article						health; healthcare access; homeless persons; inequalities in health	PREVALENCE; QUESTIONNAIRE; TUBERCULOSIS; COVID-19	Background: Homelessness is a more complex problem than the simple lack of a place to live. Homeless people (HP) often suffer from poor health and premature death due to their limited access healthcare, and are also deprived of basic human and social rights. The study protocol described here aims to evaluate the complex relationship between homelessness and health, and identify the barriers and facilitators that impact access to healthcare by HP. Methods: This is a mixed-methods study that uses an explanatory sequential design. The first phase will consist of a cross-sectional study of 300 HP. Specific health questionnaires will be used to obtain information on health status, challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, self-reported use of healthcare, diagnoses and pharmacologic treatments, substance abuse (DAST-10), diet quality (IASE), depression (PHQ-9), and human basic needs and social support (SSQ-6). The second phase will be a qualitative study of HP using the "life story" technique with purposive sampling. We will determine the effects of different personal, family, and structural factors on the life and health status of participants. The interviews will be structured and defined using Nussbaum's capability approach. Discussion: It is well-known that HP experience poor health and premature death, but more information is needed about the influence of the different specific social determinants of these outcomes and about the barriers and facilitators that affect the access of HP to healthcare. The results of this mixed methods study will help to develop global health strategies that improve the health and access to healthcare in HP.

Walking the health geographers' talk: Aging and health inequalities in sub-Saharan Africa	CANADIAN GEOGRAPHIES-GEOGRAPHIES CANADIENNES			English	Article						health geography; inequality; aging; integrated knowledge translation; sub-Saharan Africa	KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION; PUBLIC-POLICY; CARE; EXPERIENCES; FRAMEWORK; JOURNEY; WATER	Although inequalities in the production, distribution, and determinants of health are central to health geographers, the discipline of health geography suffers from a "know-do" gap. These health inequalities are personified in aging populations; older adults in sub-Saharan Africa experience shorter life expectancies than in high-income countries and endure higher disability and disease rates in old age. Concomitantly, the region experiences resource shortages and competing population priorities. Evidence-informed knowledge and practice is imperative. Informed by the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research Principles, an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) case study with knowledge holders and users in the inception, implementation, and dissemination of research in Uganda was undertaken. This paper presents the capstone iKT event that shared research results with knowledge owners and users, addressed research implications and applications, and identified future research and policy agendas. Although vast contextual inequalities impede aging health disparity solutions, findings indicate that employing an iKT approach generates possibilities that not only support older adults, but also population health across the life course. Research incorporating iKT overcomes many contextual realities deemed to impede old age health equity. Incorporating iTK into health geography can reveal where inequality exists, expose how inequality is (re)produced, and suggest solutions that generates more equitable futures.

Psychiatric beds and prison populations in 17 Latin American countries between 1991 and 2017: rates, trends and an inverse relationship between the two indicators	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Deinstitutionalization; global health; health care reform; mental health services; prisoners	MENTAL-HEALTH-CARE; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; PENROSE HYPOTHESIS; HOSPITAL BEDS; ROBUST TEST; DETERMINANTS	Background In 1990, Latin American countries committed to psychiatric reforms including psychiatric bed removals. Aim of the study was to quantify changes in psychiatric bed numbers and prison population rates after the initiation of psychiatric reforms in Latin America. Methods We searched primary sources to collect numbers of psychiatric beds and prison population rates across Latin America between the years 1991 and 2017. Changes of psychiatric bed numbers were compared against trends of incarceration rates and tested for associations using fixed-effects regression of panel data. Economic variables were used as covariates. Reliable data were obtained from 17 Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, El Salvador, Uruguay and Venezuela. Results The number of psychiatric beds decreased in 15 out of 17 Latin American countries (median -35%) since 1991. Our findings indicate the total removal of 69 415 psychiatric beds. The prison population increased in all countries (median +181%). Panel data regression analyses showed a significant inverse relationship -2.70 (95% CI -4.28 to -1.11; p = 0.002) indicating that prison populations increased more when and where more psychiatric beds were removed. This relationship held up when introducing per capita income and income inequality as covariates -2.37 (95% CI -3.95 to -0.8; p = 0.006). Conclusions Important numbers of psychiatric beds have been removed in Latin America. Removals of psychiatric beds were related to increasing incarceration rates. Minimum numbers of psychiatric beds need to be defined and addressed in national policies.

In the present study, we investigated visual acuity and its influencing factors along with spectacle use of the Roma population in comparison with the general population in Hungary. A cross-sectional survey was carried out including 832 participants aged 20-64 years. We recorded the uncorrected visual acuity along with anthropometric, demographic, socioeconomic and health-related data of each individual. Although the average uncorrected visual acuity was somewhat higher, the use of a visual aid was significantly less frequent in the Roma population, especially in the group with a visual acuity below 0.5 in both eyes (14.3% vs. 77.1%, p < 0.001). Age, abdominal obesity and disturbances of carbohydrate metabolism had a negative impact on visual acuity in both populations; however, the latter was a much stronger risk factor in the Roma population (OR 5.789, 95% CI 2.239-14.964, p < 0.001) than in the general population (OR 2.075, 95% CI 1.097-3.926, p = 0.025). Our results show serious unmet health needs within the Roma population, which calls for public health programs to improve poor primary care indicators on regular eye examination and much more rigorous diabetes control.

Early in 2020, that complex ecosystem was further complicated by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. We address actions taken by care providers and systems during the initial phases of the pandemic, and how those actions preserved lifesaving and life-sustaining cancer care despite severely constrained resources. We outline cancer care principles and guidelines that were developed, shared, and adopted by cancer care organizations across the country. Care delivery concerns that arose during the pandemic, including equipment and personnel shortages, moral distress for care providers, and exacerbation of health care inequities are addressed. Process and operations changes taken by payers to serve their clients are described. Lessons learned are highlighted, along with a call to action that we learn from the experience, broaden our cancer care delivery mission, and commit to structural changes that will permanently improve the capacity of cancer care teams.

This commentary reviews the key points of the amendment and raises doubts as to one of its points. Specifically, we argue that the minimum education level required to take the physicians' licensing examination should be set to completion of a bachelor degree, instead of a vocational diploma or junior college graduation as in the 2021 amendment. China adopted a system of multi-tiered medical education more than 70 years ago. This policy has resulted in a threshold of entry-level medical education far below the global standards. The highly heterogeneous education background of physicians in China has led to low standards of practicing physicians, which in turn have significantly negative impacts on the health care market. We illustrate changes over time in the educational distribution and regional distribution of practicing physicians in China, and present reasons to improve entry-level educational standards, by setting the physician licensing threshold at an appropriate level. This will not only improve the overall quality of physicians but will also help address equity and efficiency issues in the health care market.

Children of more empowered women are less likely to be left without vaccination in low- and middle-income countries: A global analysis of 50 DHS surveys	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							ZERO-DOSE CHILDREN; HEALTH; IMMUNIZATION; INDIA; CARE; INEQUALITIES; AUTONOMY; MOTHERS	Background To help provide a global understanding of the role of gender-related bar-riers to vaccination, we have used a broad measure of women's empowerment and ex-plored its association with the prevalence of zero-dose children aged 12-23 months across many low-and middle-income countries, using data from standardized national house-hold surveys. Methods We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 50 countries with information on both women's empowerment and child immunisation. Zero-dose was operationally defined as the proportion of children who failed to receive any doses of the diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus containing vaccines (DPT). We measured wom-en's empowerment using the SWPER Global, an individual-level indicator estimated for women aged 15-49 years who are married or in union and with three domains: social independence, decision-making and attitude towards violence. We estimated two sum-mary measures of inequality, the slope index of inequality (SII) and the concentration index (CIX). Results were presented for individual and pooled countries. Results In the country-level (ecological) analyses we found that the higher the propor-tion of women with high empowerment, the lower the zero-dose prevalence. In the indi-vidual level analyses, overall, children with highly-empowered mothers presented lower prevalence of zero-dose than those with less-empowered mothers. The social indepen-dence domain presented more consistent associations with zero-dose. In 42 countries, the lowest zero-dose prevalence was found in the high empowerment groups, with the slope index of inequality showing significant results in 28 countries. When we pooled all countries using a multilevel Poisson model, children from mothers in the low and medium levels of the social independence domain had respectively 3.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.3, 4.7) and 1.8 (95% CI = 1.5, 2.1) times higher prevalence of zero-dose compared to those in the high level. Conclusions: Our country-level and individual-level analyses support the importance of women's empowerment for child vaccination, especially in countries with weaker rou-tine immunisation programs.

J	Nguyen, CP				Nguyen, Canh Phuc			Tourism and gender (in)equality: Global evidence	TOURISM MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						Tourism; Gender equality	CHINESE OUTBOUND TOURISM; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; WOMEN; INEQUALITY; EQUALITY; TRAVEL	This study investigates the nexus between tourism development and gender (in)equality in a global sample of 111 economies from 1995 to 2017. Notably, this study (i) examines mutual relationships between the two factors, and (ii) carries out a comprehensive and inclusive analysis of three kinds of tourism (domestic, outbound, and international), using two measures (spending, and number of tourists) and four dimensions of gender (in) equality (employment, education, health, and rights). First, there is a mutual relationship between tourism development and gender (in)equality. Second, domestic tourism spending, visitor spending, and number of tourist arrivals generally appear to improve gender equality in employment, education, and rights. However, outbound tourism spending seems to increase gender inequality in employment and rights. In turn, gender equality likely stimulates travel activities in terms of both spending and number of tourists.

Quality improvement in New Zealand pediatric anesthesia: National quality direction, patient experience, equity, and collaboration	PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA			English	Review						health equity; patient satisfaction; quality improvement; risk management		The current priorities of the quality and safety of patient care in New Zealand at a central government level are described, with a focus on equity and patient experience. Priorities between stakeholders differ. We report the current quality activities of New Zealand pediatric anesthetists in relation to these governance aims, seeking gaps and suggesting future directions to align governance priorities and local activities. International relevance is also outlined. New Zealand Maori experience health inequity. Complex systemic factors including those of systemic racism and prejudice contribute to the inequity. The specific contributions to health inequity from pediatric anesthetists are unknown but could include aspects of cultural safety, delays in treatment and treatment deficits. Patient experience is correlated positively with other quality domains. Peri-operative patient experience tools require outcomes of interest that matter to patients, including relevant cultural safety domains. Risk identification and critical event review contribute to local learnings in departments and institutions, and more widely to national and binational (with Australia) learnings. Several collaborative projects in Australia and New Zealand, whilst not primarily quality improvement projects, may improve pediatric anesthesia. These collaborations include a pediatric anesthesia professional network, a curriculum for a pediatric anesthetic fellowship, contributions to a document on standards for pediatric anesthesia, and a national quality group researching key performance indicators across New Zealand.

A multidimensional assessment framework for regulatory, policymaking, health technology assessment, and coverage purposes based on the MMA lifecycle is needed. A targeted review of relevant policy documents from international sources was conducted to map current MMA assessment frameworks, to formulate 10 recommendations, subsequently shared amongst an expert panel of key stakeholders. Recommendations go beyond economic dimensions such as cost and economic evaluation and also include MMA development and update, classification and evidentiary requirements, performance and maintenance monitoring, usability testing, clinical evidence requirements, safety and security, equity considerations, organizational assessment, and additional outcome domains (patient empowerment and environmental impact). The COVID-19 pandemic greatly expanded the use of MMAs, but temporary policies governing their use and oversight need consolidation through well-developed frameworks to support decision-makers, producers and introduction into clinical care processes, especially in light of the strong international, cross-border character of MMAs, the new EU medical device and health technology assessment regulations, and the Next Generation EU funding earmarked for health digitalization.

Reconsidering the Utility of Race-Specific Lung Function Prediction Equations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						respiratory function tests; racism; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; health disparities	ETHNICALLY SPECIFIC NORMS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; REFERENCE VALUES; HEALTH; ASSOCIATIONS; METAANALYSIS; EXPOSURES; ETHNICITY	Rationale: African American individuals have worse outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Objectives: To assess whether race-specific approaches for estimating lung function contribute to racial inequities by failing to recognize pathological decrements and considering them normal. Methods: In a cohort with and at risk for COPD, we assessed whether lung function prediction equations applied in a race-specific versus universal manner better modeled the relationship between FEV1, FVC, and other COPD outcomes, including the COPD Assessment Test, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, computed tomography percent emphysema, airway wall thickness, and 6-minute-walk test. We related these outcomes to differences in FEV1 using multiple linear regression and compared predictive performance between fitted models using root mean squared error and Alpaydin's paired F test. Measurements and Main Results: Using race-specific equations, African American individuals were calculated to have better lung function than non-Hispanic White individuals (FEV1, 76.8% vs. 71.8% predicted; P = 0.02). Using universally applied equations, African American individuals were calculated to have worse lung function. Using Hankinson's Non-Hispanic White equation, FEV1 was 64.7% versus 71.8% (P < 0.001). Using the Global Lung Initiative's Other race equation, FEV1 was 70.0% versus 77.9% (P < 0.001). Prediction errors from linear regression were less for universally applied equations compared with race-specific equations when examining FEV1% predicted with the COPD Assessment Test (P < 0.01), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (P < 0.01), and airway wall thickness (P < 0.01). Although African American participants had greater adversity (P < 0.001), less adversity was only associated with better FEV1 in non-Hispanic White participants (P for interaction = 0.041). Conclusions: Race-specific equations may underestimate COPD severity in African American individuals.

With the increasing availability of open remote-sensing data and open-source software packages, this research suggested the novelty integration of satellite data and spatial analytical methods, enabling a timely and costless framework for assessing the nationwide socioeconomic condition. Specifically, the spatial statistical and spatial econometrical methods were applied to geospatial data to identify the clustering patterns and the localized associations of inequality in Thailand. The spatial statistical results showed that Bangkok and its vicinity had been a cluster of high socioeconomic conditions, representing the spatial inequality of development. In addition, results of the spatial econometrical models showed that the satellite-based indicators could identify the socioeconomic condition (with p-value < 0.010 and R-squared ranging between 0.345 and 0.657). Inequality indicators (i.e., Gini, Thiel and Atkinson) were then constructed by using survey-based and satellite-based data, informing that spatial inequality has been slowly declining. These findings recommended the new establishment of polycentric growth poles that offer economic opportunities and reduce spatial inequality. In addition, in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 10 (reduced inequalities), this analytical framework can be applied to country-specific implications along with the global scale extensions.

The aims of this study were 1) to benchmark the implementation of Dutch government policies influencing food environments, and 2) to identify and prioritize actions to improve food environments in the Netherlands.Methods: The Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) was applied. The Food-EPI includes 46 indicators of food environment policy and infrastructure support. Independent experts (n = 28) rated the extent of implementation on these indicators against international best practices, and formulated and prioritized policy and infrastructure support actions to improve food environments.Results: Most policy indicators were rated as having a low (50%) or very low (41%) level of implementation. Most infrastructure support indicators were rated as having a fair (42%) or medium (42%) level of implementation. 18 policy and 11 infrastructure support actions were recommended by experts to improve food environments in the Netherlands.Conclusion: There is large potential for the Dutch national government to strengthen its policy action and infrastructure support in order to improve the healthiness of food environments in the Netherlands.

Previous research has shown positive relationships among metrics of health and happiness and economic indices such as income and gross domestic product and between energy use and human development. To our knowledge, however, no comprehensive assessment has examined to what extent energy use may limit national-level trends in such metrics. We analyze the maximum global performance of nine health, economic, and environmental metrics by country, determining which metrics increase with per capita energy use and which show thresholds or plateaus in maximum performance. Across the dataset, eight of nine metrics, including life expectancy, infant mortality, happiness, food supply, and access to basic sanitation services, improve steeply and then plateau at levels of average primary annual energy consumption between 10 and 75 GJ person(-1) computed nationally (five metrics plateau between 10 and 30 GJ person(-1)). One notable exception is air quality (energy threshold of 125 GJ person(-1) across 133 countries). Averaged across metrics, the 10 countries (with at least seven metrics) showing the best performance given their per capita primary energy use are Malta, Sri Lanka, Cuba, Albania, Iceland, Finland, Bangladesh, Norway, Morocco, and Denmark. If distributed equitably, today's average global energy consumption of 79 GJ person(-1) could, in principle, allow everyone on Earth to realize 95% or more of maximum performance across all metrics (and assuming no other limiting factors). Dozens of countries have average per capita energy use below this 79 GJ energy sufficiency threshold, highlighting the need to combat energy poverty. Surprisingly, our analysis also suggests that reduced per capita primary energy consumption could in principle occur in many higher energy-consuming countries with little or no loss in health, happiness, or other outcomes, reducing the need for global energy infrastructure and increasing global equity.

In this paper, we theorize digital wellbeing in a context characterized by a fast-growing number of mobile data users despite a historically low Internet penetration. It is focused on an ongoing ethnographic research on mobile users and digital inequalities in Africa, zooming in on results from an explorative study featuring 10 in-depth interviews with young adult heavy users (more than 4-5 hours a day) and seeking to understand strategies they use in attaining digital wellbeing. The findings show how the sampled young adults (18-30 years old) struggle with the daily realities of digital participation including addiction and generational conflict in technology use. Results also reveal ways through which electronic connectivity is perceived both be a tool of freedom as well as a subtle form of potential digital enslavering.

Objective: To evaluate the global needs and potential inequities as it relates to cardiac implantable electronic devices. Methods: ARROW (Assessment of Rhythm Resources arOund the World) is an online survey about cardiac implantable electronic devices, sent electronically to physicians within the field of Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiology, Electrophysiology and Pediatric Electrophysiology. Results: ARROW received 42 responders from 28 countries, 50% from low-/middle-income regions. The main differences between low-/middle- and high-income regions include availability of expertise on paediatric electrophysiology (50% versus 93%, p < 00.5) and possibility to perform invasive procedures (35% versus 93%, p < 0.005). Implant of devices in low-income areas relies significantly on patient's resources (71%). The follow-up of the devices is on the hands of paediatric cardiologist/electrophysiologist in higher resources centres (93% versus 50%, p < 0.05). Conclusions: The ARROW survey represents an initial assessment of the geographical characteristics in the field of Pediatric Electrophysiology. The next step is to make this "state of the art" more extensive to other aspects of the expertise. The relevance of collecting this data before the World Congress of Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery (WCPCCS) in 2023 in Washington DC was emphasised in order to share the resulting information with the international community and set a plan of action to assist the development of arrhythmia services for children within developing regions of the world.

To fulfill this vision, all involved need to be aware of the existing situation even in western European countries. Data from the European Atlas of Palliative Care and the Swedish Registry of Palliative Care are used to illustrate the present inequalities. The data illustrate the unequal provision of palliative care relating to level of care, place of residence, diagnoses, and age. The challenge of providing equal palliative care remains, even in Western European countries, in spite of all positive developments. Different approaches that may contribute to successful implementation of equal palliative care are discussed. The challenge is still there and will require some effort to resolve.

J	Istepanian, RSH				Istepanian, Robert S. H.			Mobile Health (m-Health) in Retrospect: The Known Unknowns	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						m-health; mHealth; mobile health; digital health; telemedicine; e-health; telehealth	COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES	For nearly two decades, mobile health or (m-Health) was hailed as the most innovative and enabling area for the digital transformation of healthcare globally. However, this profound vision became a fleeting view since the inception and domination of smart phones, and the reorientation of the concept towards the exclusivity of global smart phone application markets and services. The global consumerization of m-Health in numerous disciplines of healthcare, fitness and wellness areas is unprecedented. However, this divergence between 'mobile health capitalism' and the 'science of mobile health' led to the creation of the 'm-Health schism'. This schism was sustained by the continued domination of the former on the expense of the latter. This also led to increased global m-Health inequality and divide between the much-perceived health and patient benefits and the markets of m-Health. This divergence was more evident in low and middle income (LMIC) countries compared to the developed world. This powerful yet misguided evolution of the m-Health was driven essentially by complex factors. These are presented in this paper as the 'known unknowns' or 'the obvious but sanctioned facts' of m-Health. These issues had surreptitiously contributed to this reorientation and the widening schism of m-Health. The collateral damage of this process was the increased shift towards understanding 'digital health' as a conjecture term associated with mobile health. However, to date, no clear or scientific views are discussed or analyzed on the actual differences and correlation aspects between digital and mobile health. This particular 'known unknown' is presented in detail in order to provide a rapprochement framework of this correlation and valid presentations between the two areas. The framework correlates digital health with the other standard ICT for the healthcare domains of telemedicine, telehealth and e-health. These are also increasingly used in conjunction with digital health, without clear distinctions between these terms and digital health. These critical issues have become timelier and more important to discuss and present, particularly after the world has been caught off guard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The much hyped and the profiteering digital health solutions developed in response of this pandemic provided a modest impact, and the benefits were mostly inadequate in mitigating the massive health, human, and economic impact of this pandemic. This largely commercial reorientation of mobile health was unable not only to predict the severity of the pandemic, but also unable to provide adequate digital tools or effective pre-emptive digital epidemiological shielding and guarding mechanisms against this devastating pandemic. There are many lessons to be learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic from the mobile and digital health perspectives, and lessons must be learnt from the past and to address the critical aspects discussed in this paper for better understanding of mobile health and effective tackling of future global healthcare challenges.

Primary care teams have played a crucial role in disease surveillance and monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic through early detection, contact tracing, and isolation of positive cases. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care teams regarding their internal dynamics and their professional performance. Methods Qualitative study carried out between July and December 2020 in two large central and southern Spanish regions (Castilla la Mancha and Madrid). Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with primary care workers. Data was analysed using thematic content analysis. Participants were accessed using purposive sampling. Results A total of 53 primary care workers participated in the study, of which 38 were individually interviewed, and 15 participated in three focus groups.The analysis of their experiences revealed two main themes regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care teams: 1) The need to reorganise traditional roles: Primary care settings closed their doors to the public and their workers restructured their roles to ensure the delivery of essential services; 2) The need to implement a new primary care delivery model: Each primary care team had to self-organise, making sure their reference population was cared for and developing resource optimisation strategies. Conclusions Primary care teams have quickly adapted their roles and internal dynamics to respond to the demands generated by COVID-19. In the new delivery model, some positive aspects could be highlighted - such as increased communication between professionals and the use of telemedicine for some cases. However, it is important to address the negative impact that the COVID-19 crisis has had on of the main functions of primary care. These measures are necessary to promote well-being in primary care teams, and to provide quality care that addresses the complex and individual needs of each person and reduces inequalities in healthcare delivery.

J	Ratzmann, N				Ratzmann, Nora			"No German, No Service": EU Migrants' Unequal Access to Welfare Entitlements in Germany	SOCIAL INCLUSION			English	Article						discrimination; intra-EU migration; social administration; transnational social protection	STREET-LEVEL BUREAUCRATS; HEALTH-CARE; RIGHTS; CONDITIONALITY; DIVERSITY	While existing research has analysed the intersecting migration and social security law, which stratifies migrants' formal social entitlements, less work has been done on the informal stratifications beyond the law that determine substantive social rights. This article illustrates the informal barriers to de facto benefit receipt that intra-EU migrant citizens may experience when claiming social assistance in local German job centres, regardless of their manifest legal entitlements. Focussing on informal, yet commonly institutionalised practices of language discrimination, analysis of 103 qualitative, in-depth interviews reveal recurring patterns of administrative exclusion beyond individual instances of discriminatory behaviour. The unwritten rules and everyday practices shaping administrators' claims-processing routines often go against what the law or administrative procedures proscribe, and could be considered as forms of discrimination. The former may be explained by institutional constraints, such as a performance-oriented management culture, legalistic claims-processing, or superficial diversity policies. By shedding light on how inequalities in access are constructed in daily administrative practice, this article adds to existing empirical knowledge on how informal inequalities in access emerge at different stages of the benefit claiming process, in contrast to formal social rights on paper, as well as social administrations' handling of diversity in a context of transnational social protection.

Yet certain aspects of Swedish parental leave could also be responsible for the maintenance of (or even the increase in) health inequalities. Using a 'Health in All Policies' lens, this research project aims to assess the unintended health consequences of various components of Sweden's parental leave policy, including eligibility for and uptake of earnings based benefits. Methods and analysis We will use individual-level data from multiple Swedish registers. Sociodemographic information, including parental leave use, will be retrieved from the total population register, Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies and Social Insurance Agency registers. Health information for parents and children will be retrieved from the patient, prescribed drug, cause of death, medical birth and children's health registers. We will evaluate parents' mental, mothers' reproductive and children's general health outcomes in relation to several policy reforms aiming to protect parental leave benefits in short birth spacing (the speed premium) and to promote father's uptake (the father's quota) and sharing of parental leave days (the double days reform). We will also examine effects of increases in basic parental leave benefit levels. Using quasi-experimental designs, we will compare health outcomes across these reforms and eligibility thresholds with interrupted time series, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity approaches to reduce the risk of health selection and assess causality in the link between parental leave use and health.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is amplifying the problems and overwhelming already fragile health systems. Community health workers (CHWs) are increasingly being acknowledged as crucial members of the healthcare workforce in improving maternal and child health (MCH). However, evidence is limited on multilevel determinants of an effective CHWs programme using CHWs' perspective. The objective of this systematic review is to examine perceived barriers to and enablers of different levels of the determinants of the CHWs' engagement to enhance MCH equity and a resilient community health system in SSA. Methods We systematically conducted a literature search from inception in MEDLINE complete, EMBASE, CINAHL complete and Global Health for relevant studies. Qualitative studies that presented information on perceived barriers to and facilitators of effectiveness of CHWs in SSA were eligible for inclusion. Quality appraisal was conducted according to the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative study checklist. We used a framework analysis to identify key findings. Findings From the database search, 1561 articles were identified. Nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Using socio-ecological framework, we identified the determinants of CHWs' effectiveness at 4 levels: individual/CHWs, interpersonal, community and health system logistics. Under each level, we identified themes of perceived barriers such as competency gaps, lack of collaboration, fragmentation of empowerment programmes. In terms of facilitators, we identified themes such as CHW empowerment, interpersonal effectiveness, community trust, integration of CHWs into health systems and technology. Conclusion Evidence from this review revealed that effectiveness of CHW/MCH programme is determined by multilevel contextual factors. The socio-ecological framework can provide a lens of understanding diverse context that impedes or enhances CHWs' engagement and effectiveness at different levels. Hence, there is a need for health programme policy makers and practitioners to adopt a multilevel CHW/MCH programme guided by the socio-ecological framework to transform CHW programmes. The framework can help to address the barriers and scale up the facilitators to ensuring MCH equity and a resilient community health system in SSA.

Methods We conducted a systematic search in MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed, EconLit, Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Library, and the gray literature. Using a predefined checklist, we extracted the key features of economic evaluation and the general characteristics of EEGs. We conducted a comparative analysis, including a summary of similarities and differences across EEGs. Results Thirteen EEGs were identified, three pertaining to lower-middle-income countries (Bhutan, Egypt, and Indonesia), nine to upper-middle-income countries (Brazil, China, Colombia, Cuba, Malaysia, Mexico, Russian Federation, South Africa, and Thailand), in addition to Mercosur, and none to low-income countries. The majority (n = 12) considered cost-utility analysis and health-related quality-of-life outcome. Half of the EEGs recommended the societal perspective, whereas the other half recommended the healthcare perspective. Equity considerations were required in ten EEGs. Most EEGs (n = 11) required the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and recommended sensitivity analysis, as well as the presentation of a budget impact analysis (n = 10). Seven of the identified EEGs were mandatory for pharmacoeconomics submission. Methodological gaps, contradictions, and heterogeneity in terminologies used were identified within the guidelines. Conclusion As the importance of health technology assessment is increasing in LMICs, this systematic review could help researchers explore key aspects of existing EEGs in LMICs and explore differences among them. It could also support international organizations in guiding LMICs to develop their own EEGs and improve the methodological framework of existing ones.

Atiqul			Association of spousal violence and women's empowerment status among the rural women of sub-Saharan Africa	JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Spousal violence; Women empowerment; Sub-Saharan Africa	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; HEALTH; VALIDATION; INEQUALITY; COUNTRIES; CONFLICT; INDEX; RISK; CARE	Spousal violence (SV) is a global problem for women and its elimination is one of the prime targets of Sustainable Development Goal-5. Data from the Demographic and Health Surveys of seventeen countries, representing two sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) regions (East and Southern Africa [ESA] and West and Central Africa [WCA]), were used to examine the relationship between all types of SV and women's empowerment status among rural married women aged 15-49 years. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore adjusted associations, and a relative index of inequality (RII) and slope index of inequality (SII) were used to measure the inequality in experiencing SV by rural women based on their overall empowerment position. Within the period 2015-2019, the reported rate of SV was higher in the ESA (physical SV: 33.55%; sexual SV: 16.96%; any type of SV: 46.14%) than the WCA countries (physical SV: 27.80%; sexual SV: 7.63%; any type of SV: 40.83%), except for emotional SV (WCA: 31.28% vs ESA: 29.35%). In terms of overall empowerment status, rural WCA women were slightly ahead of their counterparts in the ESA region (46.09% and 44.64%, respectively). For both ESA and WCA countries, women who didn't justify violence and who had access to health care (except physical SV in WCA) showed negative but significant association with all types of SV in the adjusted analysis. Conversely, economic empowerment significantly increased the odds of experiencing physical and any type of SV in both regions. The significant risk ratios obtained from RII, for any SV were 0.83 and 1.09, and the beta-coefficients from SII were -0.082 and 0.037 units, respectively, in ESA and WCA. Multi-sectoral microfinance-based intervening programmes and policies should be implemented regionally to empower women, especially in the economic, socio-culture, health care accessibility dimensions, and this will eventually reduce all types of spousal violence in rural SSA.

Methods Data were obtained from the global burden of disease study 2019. The average annual percent change (AAPC) was calculated to reflect temporal trends, spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted to estimate the spatial characteristics, and spatial panel models were used to investigate the association between SDI and severe periodontitis burden. Results For Asia as a whole, the crude rates increased by 1.10% per year for incidence, 1.42% per year for prevalence, and 1.41% per year for DALY from 1990 to 2019. The age-standardized incidence, prevalence and DALY rates increased by 0.18%, 0.22%, and 0.23% per year, respectively. Spatially, the hot spots of age-standardized incidence, prevalence and DALY rates were located in Southern Asia, besides, these rates all showed increasing trends in most countries, and the increases were clustered in Southeastern Asia. Further, SDI showed a negative association with incidence (coef = -14.44; 95% CI: -24.63, -4.25) and prevalence (coef = -40.09; -51.81, -28.36), and a positive association with DALY rates (coef = 0.31; 0.23; 0.38). Conclusions Severe periodontitis poses a serious public health challenge in Asian countries with increasing temporal trends and substantial spatial inequalities. Effective geographically targeted public health interventions and strategies are needed to address the growing burden associated with severe periodontitis.

Methods The socioeconomic data to this study were collected at the 48-month follow-up and oral health studies of 1993, 2004 and 2015 Pelotas birth cohort studies. The outcome was untreated dental caries in children aged 6 (1993 cohort), 5 (2004 cohort) and 4 years (2015 cohort), dichotomized into absence/presence. Analyses were stratified by maternal skin colour/race, maternal education and family income. For statistical purposes, the prevalence difference, relative risk and absolute and relative indices of health inequality (Slope Index of Inequality-SII and Concentration Index-CIX) were used. Results The prevalence of untreated dental caries in primary dentition was 63.4%, 45.5% and 15.6%, in 1993, 2004 and 2015 cohorts, respectively. The prevalence of untreated dental caries was concentrated in the poorest quintile and lower maternal education group in both absolute (SII) and relative (CIX) measures of inequality, being characterized as a pro-poor event. A higher risk of untreated caries was found in the poorest quintile of family income compared with the richest quintile in the 1993 cohort (RR 1.44 [95% CI 1.05; 1.98]). That risk was higher considering the 2004 Cohort (RR 1.78 [95% CI 1.42; 2.23]) and 2015 cohort (RR 4.20 [95% CI 2.97; 5.94]) data. Conclusions Over the course of two decades, a higher prevalence of untreated dental caries is concentrated among the most socioeconomically deprived children.

We studied four states in India, assessing contributors to reductions in stunting between 2006 and 2016. Using public datasets, literature review, policy analyses and stakeholder interviews, we interpreted changes in the context of policies, programs and enabling environment. Primary contributors to stunting reduction were improvements in coverage of health and nutrition interventions (ranged between 11 to 23% among different states), household conditions (22-47%), and maternal factors (15-30%). Political and bureaucratic leadership engaged civil society and development partners facilitated change. Policy and program actions to address the multidimensional determinants of stunting reduction occur in sectors addressing poverty, food security, education, health services and nutrition programs. Therefore, for stunting reduction, focus should be on implementing multisectoral actions with equity, quality, and intensity with assured convergence on the same geographies and households.

J	Smith, MA; Smith, WT				Smith, Mary Atkinson; Smith, W. Todd			The Influence of Health Equity on Patient Outcomes in Orthopaedics	ORTHOPAEDIC NURSING			English	Article							DISPARITIES	Health equity has become both a national and international health priority when addressing health disparities that influence health outcomes across all patient populations. Orthopaedic nurses play a critical role in advancing health equity among orthopaedic patients when it comes to ensuring orthopaedic patients have fair and just opportunities to achieve their best state of musculoskeletal health. For health equity to be realized by the specialty of orthopaedics and the orthopaedic patient populations being served, it is important for the orthopaedic nurse to be involved in community-based partnerships, research opportunities, and health policy initiatives that focus on the advancement of health equity for all populations.

Methods We generate indicators of the cumulative prevalence of mothers who have had an infant, under-five-year-old or any-age child ever die by using publicly available survey data in 89 countries and an indirect approach that combines formal kinship models and life-table methods in an additional 81 countries. We label these measures the maternal cumulative prevalence of infant mortality (mIM), under-five mortality (mU5M) and offspring mortality (mOM) and generate prevalence estimates for 20-44-year-old and 45-49-year-old mothers. Results In several Asian and European countries, the mIM and mU5M are below 10 per 1000 mothers yet exceed 200 per 1000 mothers in several Middle Eastern and African countries. Global inequality in mothers' experience of child loss is enormous: mothers in high-mortality-burden African countries are more than 100 times more likely to have had a child die than mothers in low-mortality-burden Asian and European countries. In more than 20 African countries, the mOM exceeds 500 per 1000 mothers, meaning that it is typical for a surviving 45-49-year-old mother to be bereaved. Discussion The study reveals enormous global disparities in mothers' experience of child loss and identifies a need for more research on the downstream mental and physical health risks associated with parental bereavement.

Pandemics, past, and present: The role of biological anthropology in interdisciplinary pandemic studies	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article						1918 influenza; 2009 influenza; COVID-19; social inequalities; syndemics	INFLUENZA-A H1N1; UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; BLACK-DEATH; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; VIRUS-INFECTION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; SEASONAL INFLUENZA	Biological anthropologists are ideally suited for the study of pandemics given their strengths in human biology, health, culture, and behavior, yet pandemics have historically not been a major focus of research. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need to understand pandemic causes and unequal consequences at multiple levels. Insights from past pandemics can strengthen the knowledge base and inform the study of current and future pandemics through an anthropological lens. In this paper, we discuss the distinctive social and epidemiological features of pandemics, as well as the ways in which biological anthropologists have previously studied infectious diseases, epidemics, and pandemics. We then review interdisciplinary research on three pandemics-1918 influenza, 2009 influenza, and COVID-19-focusing on persistent social inequalities in morbidity and mortality related to sex and gender; race, ethnicity, and Indigeneity; and pre-existing health and disability. Following this review of the current state of pandemic research on these topics, we conclude with a discussion of ways biological anthropologists can contribute to this field moving forward. Biological anthropologists can add rich historical and cross-cultural depth to the study of pandemics, provide insights into the biosocial complexities of pandemics using the theory of syndemics, investigate the social and health impacts of stress and stigma, and address important methodological and ethical issues. As COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last global pandemic, stronger involvement of biological anthropology in pandemic studies and public health policy and research is vital.

Being More Educated and Earning More Increases Romantic Interest: Data from 1.8 M Online Daters from 24 Nations	HUMAN NATURE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY BIOSOCIAL PERSPECTIVE			English	Article						Mate choice; Sex differences; Education; Income; Cross-cultural analysis; Online dating	MATE PREFERENCES; CHILD-MORTALITY; CULTURAL-EVOLUTION; STEREOTYPE CONTENT; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MENTAL-HEALTH; INTELLIGENCE; SELECTION; MARRIAGE	How humans choose their mates is a central feature of adult life and an area of considerable disagreement among relationship researchers. However, few studies have examined mate choice (instead of mate preferences) around the world, and fewer still have considered data from online dating services. Using data from more than 1.8 million online daters from 24 countries, we examined the role of sex and resource-acquisition ability (as indicated by level of education and income) in mate choice using multilevel modeling. We then attempted to understand country-level variance by examining factors such as gender equality and the operational sex ratio. In every nation, a person's resource-acquisition ability was positively associated with the amount of attention they received from other site members. There was a marked sex difference in this effect; resource-acquisition ability improved the attention received by men almost 2.5 times that of women. This sex difference was in every country, admittedly with some variance between nations. Several country-level traits moderated the effects of resource-acquisition ability, and in the case of unemployment this moderating role differed by sex. Overall, country-level effects were more consistent with evolutionary explanations than sociocultural ones. The results suggest a robust effect of resource-acquisition ability on real-life mate choice that transcends international boundaries and is reliably stronger for men than women. Cross-cultural variance in the role of resource-acquisition ability appears sensitive to local competition and gender equality at the country level.

J	Lazaridou, F; Fernando, S				Lazaridou, Felicia; Fernando, Suman			Deconstructing institutional racism and the social construction of <i>whiteness</i>: A strategy for professional competence training in culture and migration mental health	TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						decoloniality; institutional racism; intersectionality; mental health; whiteness	INTERSECTIONALITY; DISCRIMINATION; ILLNESS; EXPERIENCES; POLITICS; STRESS; STIGMA; TRUTH; RACE; PSYCHOLOGY	The position presented in this article draws on the professional insights of the authors, reflecting on issues of global political importance in culture and migration mental health. As institutional theory perspectives continue to develop, solutions to complex social problems such as racism require embodied knowledge if the lines of authority and basic occupational routines are to be meaningfully renegotiated. Embodied knowledge is socially situated and self-reflexive and reflects cumulative and marginalized experiences that contribute to a better understanding of institutional racism and the social construction of whiteness. The authors foreground the development of critical consciousness and emotional literacy in order to be more professionally competent in institutional contexts of mental health training, education and practice. To this end, elements of due process, transparency, inclusiveness, community engagement and accountability are at the center of a political and intellectual movement towards epistemological justice to promote antiracism and social justice in culture and migration mental health. The authors define decolonial intersectionality as a clear philosophical vision outlining how best to respond to those at risk of experiencing racism and the associated mental health burdens.

Ethical Dilemmas in Global Plastic Surgery: Divergent Perspectives of Local and Visiting Surgeons	PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY			English	Article							PRINCIPLES; BURDEN	Background: As more of the world's resources are directed toward improving patient access to safe surgical and anesthesia care, there is a growing concern that volunteer surgeons' "desire to help" has numerous unintended consequences. The purpose of this study was to ask in-country, local surgeons and visiting volunteer plastic surgeons about the frequency of ethical dilemmas for different types of global surgery collaborations and to assess their perception of compliance with the concepts of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Methods: A cross-sectional email survey tool was sent to a representative sample of domestic American Society of Plastic Surgeons members, all international members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, and international partners of the Volunteers in Plastic Surgery committee of the Plastic Surgery Foundation. The survey response rate was 7.7 percent, with 356 respondents from 65 countries. Results: This survey data showed a statistically significant divergence of perspectives between local and visiting surgeons in regard to scope of practice, quality of patient care, impact on local health care systems, perception of the quality of care by local providers, the integrity of the informed consent, process, and photography in global plastic surgery collaborations. Though the short-term mission trip model was particularly polarizing when comparing the responses of local and visiting surgeons, educational and research exchanges may also significantly interrupt local health care and incite ethical lapses. Conclusion: This survey provides quantitative insight into the impact of current global plastic surgery collaborations and highlights ethical areas of disagreement between local and visiting surgeons.

This paper explores national drivers of the pandemic and the radically different epidemiology and response in the West and in the East. We studied coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mortality until 31st December 2020, using an ecological study design, considering baseline characteristics and responses that might account for the uneven impact of the pandemic. A multivariable regression model was developed to explore key determinants. Key variables in the West were contrasted with those in the East, and speed of response was examined. Worldwide, 2.24 million COVID-19 deaths were documented in 2020. Western countries reported a median mortality 114 times that of the East (684 vs. 6.0 per million). Significant correlates of mortality in countries with at least 1 million population were median age, obesity prevalence, and democracy index; political stability and experience of SARS in 2002-2003 were protective; health system variables and income inequality were not associated. Outputs of the model were consistent when adjusted for stringency index, timeliness of stay-at-home requirements, and geographical autocorrelation. The West experiences a much higher COVID-19 mortality than the East. Despite structural advantages in the West, delays in national responses early on resulted in a loss of control over the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Although the early success of the East was sustained in the second half of 2020, the region remains extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 until enough people are immunized.

Scaling Up Psychological Treatments: Lessons Learned From Global Mental Health	AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article						psychological treatments; depression; Global Mental Health; equity; access	PRIMARY-CARE; SEVERE DEPRESSION; UNITED-STATES; DISORDERS; INTERVENTION; DISPARITIES; THERAPY; PSYCHOTHERAPY; SERVICES; INCOME	Public Significance Statement This article highlights innovative, patient-centered solutions from the broader field of Global Mental Health to scale up evidence-based psychological treatments worldwide. Evidence-based psychological treatments are among the most effective interventions in medicine and are recommended as the first line of treatment to address the significant burden of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders worldwide. Despite this evidence, these treatments remain inaccessible for the great majority of the world's population. Global Mental Health (GMH) is an evolving discipline of research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide. Equity is a driving principle, and this recognizes that inequalities exist within all nations and between nations. At the heart of this equity, there is the need for person-centered care. This essay discusses how GMH has sought to address a range of barriers to scale up the delivery of psychological treatments for common mental disorders. While the initial focus of the field has been to address access to quality care in low- and middle-income countries, this article also draws attention to how similar strategies are being implemented at scale in some high-income countries, with appropriate modifications to suit the context. In considering some of these evidence-based, contextually driven strategies, psychological communities have potential to address the growing burden of depression and anxiety worldwide.

J	Sarfo, FS; Ovbiagele, B				Sarfo, Fred Stephen; Ovbiagele, Bruce			Utilizing Implementation Science to Bridge Cerebrovascular Health Disparities: a Local to Global Perspective	CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS			English	Review						Stroke; Implementation science; Health equity; Under-resourced settings; Outcomes	BLOOD-PRESSURE CONTROL; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; ETHNIC DISPARITIES; RACIAL-DIFFERENCES; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; RISK-FACTORS; PLASMINOGEN-ACTIVATOR; CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH; MORTALITY-RATES; UNITED-STATES	Purpose of Review Stroke is a prime example of a medical disorder whose incidence, prevalence, and outcomes are strongly characterized by health disparities across the globe. This scoping literature review seeks to depict how implementation science could be utilized to advance health equity in the prevention, acute treatment, and post-acute management of stroke in the underserved regions of high-income countries as well as in all low-income countries. Recent Findings A major reason for the persisting and widening cerebrovascular disease disparities is that evidence-based stroke prevention and treatment interventions have been differentially translated (if at all) to various populations and settings. The field of implementation science is endowed with frameworks, theories, methodological approaches, and outcome measures, including equity indices, which could be harnessed to facilitate the translation of evidence-based interventions into clinical practice for underserved and vulnerable communities. Encouragingly, there are several novel frameworks, which eminently merge implementation science constructs with health equity determinants, thereby opening up key opportunities to bridge burgeoning worldwide gaps in cerebrovascular health equity.

I establish that negative (positive) shocks to rainfall lead to an increase (drop) in child deaths overall. Low-income countries (LICs) and the group of countries reliant on agriculture are affected the most due to negative rainfall shocks. In LICs, the impact of negative rainfall shocks is mitigated by around 60% in districts located downstream to dams, an effect predominant among less affluent districts; in addition, the effect of rainfall fluctuations is persistent, lasting for up to three years following the shock. Results remain robust to the inclusion of relevant controls, to the consideration of relevant issues such as selective fertility and migration, and various other robustness tests.

Female genital mutilation and cutting in the Arab League and diaspora: A systematic review of preventive interventions	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Review						Arab diaspora; Arab League; female genital mutilation and cutting; FGM; C; interventions	CONFORMITY; ATTITUDES; SOMALI; GIRLS; WOMEN; RISK	Objectives Female Genital Mutilation and Cutting (FGM/C) is an act of gender-based violence (GBV) and a global public health issue with well-documented adverse outcomes. With the rise in global migration, there is an increasing prevalence of FGM/C among Arab diaspora living in the West and Global South. What remains unclear is how to reduce the practice. This study was designed to identify interventions exerting an effect on reducing the practice of FGM/C. Methods A systematic review of peer-reviewed articles was conducted on interventions targeting individuals and/or the broader community to prevent FGM/C within the Arab League and its diaspora, up to December 2021. Databases searched included PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, ASSIA and Scopus. Quality assessment used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018. Results Twelve of 896 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight interventions relied entirely on education with short-term gains but unchanged practices. Three interventions used social marketing and mixed media. Only one study took a multi-sectoral approach. Conclusions At a macro level, opportunities to reduce or to end the practice of FGM/C exist through legislation, policy, a public health approach grounded in gender equality and human rights. Using multi-sectoral actions that consider the social context and challenge social norms at macro, meso and micro levels appears more effective than individual-level interventions. Promoting advocacy and developing supportive environments to reduce GBV, enhance gender equality and empower communities is crucial for interventions to succeed and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of FGM/C abandonment by 2030.

J	Holland, BE; Rios, V				Holland, Bradley E.; Rios, Viridiana			Violence and Business Interest in Social Welfare: Evidence from Mexico	COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES			English	Article						violence; crime; welfare; business; Mexico	PREFERENCES; CONFLICT; POLITICS; INCOME; REDISTRIBUTION; INEQUALITY; COUNTRIES; ATTITUDES; SUPPORT; HEALTH	Countries in the Global South are particularly vulnerable to social and political violence. This paper suggests that such violence makes certain recalcitrant economic interests more open to taxes and spending on social welfare. Using results from a survey experiment of business owners and operators in Mexico, we show that relative to more innocuous institutional weaknesses, concerns over violence generally increase support for anti-poverty spending and decrease support for tax cuts. To build a theory, we explore heterogeneous effects and textual data. The findings suggest that business interests see anti-poverty spending as a tool for shoring up costs of violence in consumer markets, with some leaders even extending support to welfare-enhancing taxes. However, violence can create challenges in labor markets that increase operational costs, leading some business interests to resist tax policies that ask them to help fund social programs.

We searched CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science for observational studies published before August 2021. Outcomes included implantation, clinical pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, and live birth following in vitro fertilization in Black versus White patients. We used random-effects models for meta-analysis and the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between race and in vitro fertilization outcomes, comparing Black relative to White patients. We used the generic inverse variance method to calculate adjusted ORs. Nine observational studies met eligibility criteria, including 696 Black and 7,458 White patients. All were retrospective studies of US cohorts. In unadjusted meta-analyses, Black patients had a greater likelihood of spontaneous abortion (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.59-2.71) and lower likelihood of live birth (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.95) compared with White patients but no difference in implantation (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.32-2.77) or clinical pregnancy (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54-1.12). In adjusted meta-analyses, Black patients had lower odds of live birth (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.75) and no difference in clinical pregnancy (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.51-1.48). This meta-analysis suggests that in vitro fertilization services achieve similar pregnancy rates in Black and White patients. However, Black patients have more spontaneous abortions and fewer live births, suggesting there may be disparities in the quality of achieved pregnancies or other factors associated with pregnancy loss.

J	Lahelma, E; Rahkonen, O				Lahelma, Eero; Rahkonen, Ossi			The emergence of international comparisons of health inequalities as reflected in the <i>Scandinavian Journal of Public Health</i> during its five decades	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Comparative studies; health inequality; review; socioeconomic	BRITAIN; SWEDEN	Aims: We examined the development of research articles published in the Scandinavian Journal of Public Health and its predecessors Acta Socio-Medica Scandinavica and the Scandinavian Journal of Social Medicine from 1969 until 2020 to be able to identify the place of international comparisons of socioeconomic inequalities in health in the journal. Methods: Altogether 3237 research articles were screened to yield 126 comparative research articles. Examining full texts of the comparative articles led to 13 articles reporting comparisons of health inequalities. Results: The first one came out in 1972, but the rest only after the mid-1990s. The most common socioeconomic indicator was education, but also occupational class and income was used. The most common health indicator was self-rated health. The articles compared Nordic countries with each other, but also with non-Nordic countries. Although the number of comparative studies on health inequalities was relatively small, there were examples of well-designed studies using advanced methodology. We examined only published journal articles over the past five decades, not submitted but rejected papers. Conclusions: In the Scandinavian Journal of Public Health and its predecessors, comparisons of health inequalities were few and emerged relatively late, that is, during the past two decades.

It also exposed hundreds of millions of girls and women around the world to increased sexual exploitation. Open defecation is more practice in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries and is considered an indicator of low socioeconomic status. However, there is little evidence on the pooled prevalence and factors contributing to open defecation practice among households in SSA. Objectives This study aimed to assess the pooled prevalence, wealth-related inequalities, and other determinants of open defecation practice among households in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods Demographic and Health Survey data sets of 33 SSA countries with a total sample of 452,281 households were used for this study. Data were weighted, cleaned, and analyzed using STATA 14 software. Meta analyses were used to determine the pooled prevalence of open defecation practice among households in SSA. Multilevel analysis was employed to identify factors contributing to open defecation practice among households in SSA. Moreover, concentration index and graph were used to assess wealth-related inequalities of open defecation practice. The associations between dependent and independent variables were presented using adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals with a p value of < 0.05. Results The pooled prevalence of open defecation practice among households in sub-Saharan African countries was 22.55% (95%CI: 17.49%, 27.61%) with I-2 = 99.9% and ranges from 0.81% in Comoros to 72.75% in Niger. Individual level factors, such as age, educational attainment, media exposure, wealth status, and access to drinking water, as well community level factors, such as residence, country income status, and region in SSA, had a significant association with open defecation practice. The concentration index value [C = - 0.55; 95% CI: - 0.54, - 0.56] showed that open defecation practice was significantly disproportionately concentrated on the poor households (pro-poor distribution). Conclusions Open defecation practice remains a public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Individual level factors, such as age, educational attainment, media exposure, household wealth status, and access to drinking water had an association with open defecation practice. Moreover, community level factors such as residence, country income status and region in SSA have a significant effect on open defecation. There is a significantly disproportional pro-poor distribution of open defecation practice in SSA. Each country should prioritize eliminating open defecation practices that focused poorest communities, rural societies, and limited water access areas. Media exposure and education should be strengthened. Moreover, public health interventions should target to narrow the poor-rich gap in the open defecation practice among households including provisions of subsidies to the poor. Policymakers and program planners better use this evidence as preliminary evidence to plan and decide accordingly.

The scope of this study was to describe the changes in the prevalence of decayed permanent teeth in Brazil and in upper-middle income countries for the years 1990 and 2017. It is a descriptive study based on secondary data extracted from the Global Burden of Disease. The 53 countries included in the upper-middle income group were included. Caries prevalence estimates were collected for the years 1990 and 2017. The percentage change in prevalence was calculated between the two years. The values of the Human Development Index (HDI) for each country were also collected. The results show the trend of a reduction in the prevalence of decayed permanent teeth in Brazil and in most upper-middle income countries. The prevalence of untreated caries in Brazil was 38.17% in 1990 and 37.46% in 2017. Brazil occupies the 41st position in the ranking of the reduction in the prevalence of caries among the 53 countries evaluated. The countries that achieved the greatest reductions in the prevalence of caries were those with an improvement in their HDI. In this respect, the need to review public oral health policies is revealed, as well as a reflection on addressing the inequities present in the countries surveyed.

COVID-19 exposed existing shortfalls of Global Health Governance (GHG). A considerable amount of related literature is produced. This scoping review aims at mapping the present knowledge and at identifying research gaps. Methods: This scoping review is based on the Joanna Briggs Institute's guideline for standardized methods and PRISMA-ScR guidelines for reporting. Documents published from December 2019 to October 2021 were searched using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, World cat, and WHO-Global Index Medicus. Two reviewers screened and reviewed eligible studies in three stages: duplicates identification and elimination, title and abstract screening, and full-text assessment. Data was charted and results were classified into conceptual categories. Analysis was done in three stages: open descriptive coding, focused thematic analysis, and frequency, commonality and significance analysis. Results: forty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Areas of research were grouped into seven themes: "human rights and inequities", "solidarity, collaboration and partnership", "GHG structure change", "political and economic power and finance", "approaches to address inequity", "law and regulations", and "private investment and public-private partnerships (PPPs) in GHG". The highest number of papers were in the first theme, "human rights and inequities". However, the themes are interrelated. Authors who contributed to research were mostly affiliated to developed countries indicating a gap in knowledge and expertise in developing countries. Conclusion: Through this scoping review we found that the seven themes are interconnected. Disciplinary collaboration in research relating GHG to health inequities is solicited. Collaboration in research, information sharing, and research capacity development are in needed in developing countries.

Materials and methods: This study used the outpatient, emergency, and hospitalization data of 2 million people in the National Health Insurance sample from 2000 to 2015. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnostic N-codes 995.5 (child abuse) and 995.8 (adult abuse) or E-codes E960-E969 (homicide and intentional injury by others) were defined as the case study for this study, and the risks of first violent injury for boys and girls (0-17 years old), adults (18-64 years old), and elders (over 65 years old) were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used for risk comparison. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results: The proportion of women (12-17.9 years old) who were sexually assaulted was 2.71 times that of women under the age of 12, and the risk of sexual assault for girls and adult women was 100 times that of men. Girls who were insured as labor insurance, farmers, members of water conservancy and fishery associations, low-income households, and community insured population (public insurance as the reference group) were significantly more likely to seek medical treatment from sexual assault than adult women. Among them, the risk was greatest for girls from low-income households (odds ratio = 10.74). Conclusion: Women are at higher risk of sexual assault than men regardless of whether they are children or adults, and the highest risk is for women in senior high schools, especially for girls from low-income households. Therefore, the protection of women's personal autonomy is the direction that the government and people from all walks of life need to continue to strive for. Especially for high school students from low-income households, protection must be strengthened through education, social work, and police administration.

The aim of this study was to describe the quality of the implementation of Indonesia's Early Warning and Response Alert System (EWARS) for disease surveillance and to measure the burden of disease surveillance reporting quality before and during the COVID-19 epidemic in Indonesia. Methods: A mixed-method approach was used. A total of 38 informants from regional health offices participated in Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and In-Depth Interview (IDI) for informants from Ministry of Health. The FGD and IDI were conducted using online video communication. Yearly completeness and timeliness of reporting of 34 provinces were collected from the application. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically, and quantitative data were analyzed descriptively. Results: Major implementation gaps were found in poorly distributed human resources and regional infrastructure inequity. National reporting from 2017-2019 showed an increasing trend of completeness (55%, 64%, and 75%, respectively) and timeliness (55%, 64%, and 75%, respectively). However, the quality of the reporting dropped to 53% and 34% in 2020 concomitant with the SARS-CoV2 epidemic. Conclusions: Report completeness and timeliness are likely related to regional infrastructure inequity and the COVID-19 epidemic. It is recommended to increase report capacities with an automatic EWARS application linked systems in hospitals and laboratories.

More data on the PP is required from the Global South, where the quality and equitable distribution of UGSs are important considerations. This paper investigates the PP in Potchefstroom, South Africa following a quantitative approach, by statistically analyzing municipal property valuations in three districts differentiated according to their socioeconomic status (SES). Districts are divided into sample areas where three zones are demarcated according to their proximity to a UGS. The results show that property valuations are generally higher for properties in closer proximity to UGSs in lower- and higher-income samples, but are lower in middle-income areas. Neighborhood characteristics and SES, UGS amenity and maintenance, ecosystem services and disservices, domestic garden area and residential property size may be connected to the confirmation or rejection of the PR The rejection of the PP in middle-income areas indicates a need to improve public UGSs as amenity destinations. The results confirming the PP in low-income areas could incentivize expenditures to improve UGS area and quality to increase the willingness to pay for proximity to such spaces and, reciprocally, increase revenue from municipal property taxes.

Forced displacement due to disasters and conflict constantly disrupt the path to a sustainable and cohesive society. Displaced communities often struggle with a lack of access to livelihood and a lack of financial independence and social and family stability. With these challenges, a lack of provision of basic services and facilities will create a competition for housing, health, and education between the displaced and host communities. Additionally, the economic competition for jobs and the role of international aid in terms of fairness create social tension between the displaced and the host. Likewise, multiple aspects weaken the social cohesion between displaced and host communities. Within this context, we investigated approaches to enhance social cohesion following disaster-induced and conflict-induced displacement. With the identification of this research need, the research team of the project titled REGARD (REbuild-inG AfteR Displacement) conducted 47 in-depth interviews in four partner countries (U.K., Sweden, Estonia, and Sri Lanka) with community representatives, social support networks, agency networks, officials, etc. Moreover, focus group discussions were conducted with community members in Sri Lanka. The collected data were analysed through a qualitative data analysis procedure. The findings present eight approaches to strengthen the social cohesion between displaced and host communities. These eight approaches include the adequate provision of basic services and facilities without limiting the capacity of the host, support services aimed at local integration, economic integration between the displaced and host, and social cohesion through the built environment.

Despite the availability of highly efficacious treatment and prevention interventions, impact has fallen short of targets because these interventions are used with insufficient reach, consistency, sustainability and equity in diverse real-world settings. At present, substantial excitement for implementation science - defined as research methods and strategies to improve use of evidence-based interventions - has focused on developing and disseminating methods to conduct rigorous research. Yet, impactful answers depend on a sometimes less visible, but even more important, step: asking good questions about implementation. Discussion In this commentary, we offer several considerations for researchers formulating implementation research questions based on several distinctive features of the field. First, as findings are used not only by other researchers but by implementers, scientific questions must incorporate a range of stakeholder and community perspectives to be most relevant. Second, real-world settings are contextually diverse, and the most relevant scientific questions must position answers to make sense within these contexts (whether geographical, organizational and sociological), rather than apart from them. Third, implementation is complex and dynamic; consequently, research questions must make use of emerging standards in describing implementation strategies and their effects whenever possible. Finally, the field of implementation science continues to evolve, so framing problems with a diverse disciplinary lens will enable researchers to pose insightful and impactful questions. Conclusions We are now at a juncture marked by both rich evidence-based interventions and a persistent global pandemic. To achieve continued scientific progress against the HIV epidemic, asking the right questions might be part of the answer itself.

J	Wenham, C; Eccleston-Turner, M; Voss, M				Wenham, Clare; Eccleston-Turner, Mark; Voss, Maike			The futility of the pandemic treaty: caught between globalism and statism	INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article						global health; pandemic treaty; global governance	INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS; SECURITY	This article critically examines proposals for a pandemic treaty. It highlights the misalignment between the treaty proposal and the actual problems of global health governance by showing that the treaty can't solve the multiple problems of global health cooperation. In November 2021, the World Health Assembly (WHA) is hosting a special session to discuss the proposed plans for a pandemic treaty. Despite the fact that there are scant details concerning the treaty, the proposal has gained considerable support in both the academic community, and at the international level. While we agree that in the wake of the numerous governance failures during COVID-19, we need to develop appropriate global solutions to be able to prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from future global health crises-and that such mechanisms should be rooted in global equity-we disagree, however, that this pandemic treaty, currently, is the most appropriate way in which to achieve this. Indeed, notions of global community, solidarity, fairness are far removed from the reality that we have seen unfolding in the actions of states responding to the pandemic. This is the crux of the tension with the proposed treaty: the balance between the ideal cosmopolitan worldview held by those in power in global health, and the practice of national security decision-making witnessed in the last 18 months. Indeed, we do not believe that a pandemic treaty will deliver what is being extolled by its proponents, and it will not solve the multiple problems of global cooperation in global health that supporters believe it will.

The authors chose papers that represented research that could "move the needle" around the understanding of policing and intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. Findings The papers in this special issue reflect four thematic areas: (1) the nature of interactions between the police and individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities; (2) police interactions about individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities with criminal justice systems, social services and mental health services, (3) experiences of the police when encountering individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities and finally, (4) the experiences within police encounters of individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. Originality/value Research on intellectual and/or developmental disabilities is still in its infancy, particularly within the field of criminology and criminal justice. This special issue brings together innovative international research that adds critical information surrounding the nature of interactions between the police and individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities, the experience for both parties during that interaction and the context of these interactions in the larger organizational ecosystem of criminal justice organizations and social service agencies.

Updated IQ and Well-Being Scores for the 50 US States	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						state IQ; aggregate IQ; well-being; g nexus; PIAAC; NAEP	UNITED-STATES; ABILITY	At the level of the 50 U.S. states, an interconnected nexus of well-being variables exists. These variables strongly correlate with estimates of state IQ in interesting ways. However, the state IQ estimates are now more than 16 years old, and the state well-being estimates are over 12 years old. Updated state IQ and well-being estimates are therefore needed. Thus, I first created new state IQ estimates by analyzing scores from both the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competency (for adults), and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (for fourth and eighth grade children) exams. I also created new global well-being scores by analyzing state variables from the following four well-being subdomains: crime, income, health, and education. When validating the nexus, several interesting correlations existed among the variables. For example, state IQ most strongly predicted FICO credit scores, alcohol consumption (directly), income inequality, and state temperature. Interestingly, state IQ derived here also correlated 0.58 with state IQ estimates from over 100 years ago. Global well-being likewise correlated with many old and new variables in the nexus, including a correlation of 0.80 with IQ. In sum, at the level of the U.S. state, a nexus of important, strongly correlated variables exists. These variables comprise well-being, and state IQ is a central node in this network.

The political economy of health financing reforms in Zimbabwe: a scoping review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Review						Political economy; Health financing reforms; Universal health coverage; Health equity; Ideas; Institutions; Interests	PATH DEPENDENCY; CARE; COVERAGE; EQUITY; SERVICES; POLICIES; AIDS; IMPLEMENTATION; REFLECTIONS; COUNTRIES	Background Implementation of health financing reforms for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is inherently political. Despite the political determinants of UHC, health financing reform in Zimbabwe is often portrayed as a technical exercise with a familiar path of a thorough diagnosis of technical gaps followed by detailed prescriptions of reform priorities. In this study, we sought to understand the interaction between political and economic aspects of health financing reforms since the country got its independence in 1980. Methods We conducted a scoping review of health financing reforms in Zimbabwe and reviewed 84 relevant sources of information. We then conducted a thematic analysis using an adapted Fox and Reich's framework of ideas and ideologies, interests and institutions. Results We found that ideas, institutions and interests significantly influence health financing reforms in Zimbabwe with implications on health system performance. Reform priorities of the 1980s were influenced by socialist ideologies with an interest to address pervasive health inequities inherited from the colonial racial system. The progress in equity realized in the 1980s was severely disrupted from the 1990s partly due to neo-liberal ideologies which steered interests towards market-oriented reforms. The period from the 2000s is characterized by increasing donor influence on health financing and a cumulative socio-economic collapse that resulted in a sharp and protracted decline in health spending and widening of health inequities. Conclusion Health financing reform process in Zimbabwe is heavily influenced by political economy characteristics which favor certain financing arrangements over others with profound implications on health system performance. We concluded that the political economy factors that slow down UHC reforms are not rooted in the ambiguities of ideas on what needs to be done. Instead, the missing link is how to move from intention to action by aligning espoused ideas with interests and institutions which is an inherently political and redistributive process. International and domestic actors involved in UHC in Zimbabwe need to explicitly consider the politics of health financing reforms to improve the implementation feasibility of desired reforms.

Whilst individual risk factors are well-studied, less research has focussed on the structural and contextual drivers of IPV and how these co-occur to create contexts of high risk. Methods: We compiled IPV drivers from freely-accessible global country-level data sources and combined gender inequality, natural disasters, conflict, colonialism, socioeconomic development and inequality, homicide and social discrimination in a latent class analysis, and identified underlying 'risk contexts' based on fit statistics and theoretical plausibility (N=5,732 country-years; 190 countries). We used multinomial regression to compare risk contexts according to: proportion of population with disability, HIV/AIDS, refugee status, and mental health disorders; proportion of men with drug use disorders; men's alcohol consumption; and population median age (N=1,654-5,725 country-years). Finally, we compared prevalence of physical and/or sexual IPV experienced by women in the past 12 months across risk contexts (N=3,175 country-years). Results: Three distinct risk contexts were identified: 1) non-patriarchal egalitarian, low rates of homicide; 2) patriarchal post-colonial, high rates of homicide; 3) patriarchal post-colonial conflict and disaster-affected. Compared to non-patriarchal egalitarian contexts, patriarchal post-colonial contexts had a younger age distribution and a higher prevalence of drug use disorders, but a lower prevalence of mental health disorders and a smaller refugee population. IPV risk was highest in the two patriarchal post-colonial contexts and associated with country income classification. Conclusions: Whilst our findings support the importance of gender norms in shaping women's risk of experiencing IPV, they also point towards an association with a history of colonialism. To effectively address IPV for women in high prevalence contexts, structural interventions and policies are needed that address not only gender norms, but also broader structural inequalities arising from colonialism.

The objectives of the study were to conduct secondary analysis of the most recent Liberia Demographic and Health Survey (2019-2020) to determine the descriptive and analytical epidemiology of intimate partner violence (IPV) and its correlates in 15-49 year old ever-married women. Methods: Association of physical, emotional, sexual, and having experienced any type of IPV with 10 explanatory socio-demographic, attitudinal, and experiences were analyzed using simple and multiple logistic regression models. Results: 55.29% of women reported having ever experienced some form of IPV perpetrated by their current or most recent husband/partner, with the most common type being physical violence. Having been slapped, insulted, made to feel bad, and physically forced into unwanted sex were the most common types of physical, emotional, and sexual IPV. The multivariable analysis showed statistically significant association with IPV for number of living children, women's acceptance of IPV, husband/partner's use of alcohol, and having witnessed parental physical IPV. Conclusions: The prevalence of having experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence in Liberia was much higher than the prevalence for the WHO Africa region of 33%, highlighting the need for better women empowerment and gender equality in Liberia.				masoodalishaikh@gmail.com		Shaikh, Masood/0000-0003-0239-4464					24	8	8	3	8	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		1660-4601		INT J ENV RES PUB HE	Int.

Thus, routine assessments of financial risk protection, and equity in financing and service delivery are required in order to track country progress towards realising this universal coverage target. This study aims to undertake a system-wide assessment of equity in health financing and benefits distribution as well as catastrophic and impoverishing health spending by using the recent national survey data in Tanzania. We aim for updated analyses and compare with previous assessments for trend analyses. Methods and analysis We will use cross-sectional data from the national Household Budget Survey 2017/2018 covering 9463 households and 45 935 individuals cross all 26 regions of mainland Tanzania. These data include information on service utilisation, healthcare payments and consumption expenditure. To assess the distribution of healthcare benefits (and in relation to healthcare need) across population subgroups, we will employ a benefit incidence analysis across public and private health providers. The distributions of healthcare benefits across population subgroups will be summarised by concentration indices. The distribution of healthcare financing burdens in relation to household ability-to-pay across population subgroups will be assessed through a financing incidence analysis. Financing incidence analysis will focus on domestic sources (tax revenues, insurance contributions and out-of-pocket payments). Kakwani indices will be used to summarise the distributions of financing burdens according to households' ability to pay. We will further estimate two measures of financial risk protection (ie, catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishing effect of healthcare payments). Ethics and dissemination We will involve secondary data analysis that does not require ethical approval. The results of this study will be disseminated through stakeholder meetings, peer-reviewed journal articles, policy briefs, local and international conferences and through social media platforms.

Design A retrospective analysis of undergraduate medical student performance on written assessment, measured at the start and end of medical school. Setting Four Scottish medical schools (universities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow). Participants 1512 medical students who attempted (but did not necessarily pass) final written assessment. Main outcome measures The study modelled the change in attainment gap during medical school for four student demographical categories (white/non-white, international/Scottish domiciled, male/female and with/without a known disability) to test whether the attainment gap grew, shrank or remained stable during medical school. Separately, the study modelled the expected versus actual frequency of different demographical groups in the top and bottom decile of the cohort. Results The attainment gap grew significantly for white versus non-white students (t(449.39)=7.37, p=0.001, d=0.49 and 95% CI 0.34 to 0.58), for internationally domiciled versus Scottish-domiciled students (t(205.8) = -7, p=0.01, d=0.61 and 95% CI -0.75 to -0.42) and for male versus female students (t(1336.68)=3.54, p=0.01, d=0.19 and 95% CI 0.08 to 0.27). International, non-white and male students received higher marks than their comparison group at the start of medical school but lower marks by final assessment. No significant differences were observed for disability status. Students with a known disability, Scottish students and non-white students were over-represented in the bottom decile and under-represented in the top decile. Conclusions The tendency for attainment gaps to grow during undergraduate medical education suggests that educational factors at medical schools may-however inadvertently-contribute to DA. It is of critical importance that medical schools investigate attainment gaps within their cohorts and explore potential underlying causes.

Over 310 000 women died of this preventable disease in 2018, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) where screening and treatment are beyond the capacity of health systems. Immunisation against human papillomavirus (HPV) offers a primary prevention strategy, but rates of vaccination uptake are unclear. Understanding coverage levels and factors affecting uptake can inform immunisation strategies. Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate the status of HPV vaccination coverage from nationally reported indicators and to estimate global coverage in a single year cohort of vaccine-eligible girls. Design This study provides quantitative population-level estimates of important global health indicators. Using data from the Global Cancer Observatory and WHO/UNICEF, incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer and HPV vaccination coverage are described for countries, categorised by income group. Characteristics of LMICs achieving high coverage are explored using selected development indicators from World Bank sources. Global HPV immunisation coverage is calculated and its impact on cervical cancer mortality estimated. Results Incidence and mortality for cervical cancer correlate with poverty. Whilst all WHO member states report high infant measles vaccination rates, fewer than half report on HPV vaccination. Even amongst high-income countries, coverage varies widely. In upper-middle-income countries, there is a trend for higher coverage with increased health spending per capita. Four LMICs report good coverage levels, all associated with external funding. Global HPV immunisation coverage for 2018 is estimated at 12.2%. Of the global cohort of 61 million 15-year-old girls in 2018, 7000 are likely to die from cervical cancer, almost all in LMICs. Conclusions Countries in all income groups must devise strategies to achieve and maintain higher levels of HPV immunisation. For all but the richest, affordability remains a barrier.

Methods: The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey of 15- and 16-year-old students around the world included a 6-item measure of school loneliness in 2000, 2003, 2012, 2015, and 2018 (n = 1,049,784, 51% female) across 37 countries. Results: School loneliness increased 2012-2018 in 36 out of 37 countries. Worldwide, nearly twice as many adolescents in 2018 (vs. 2012) had elevated levels of school loneliness. Increases in loneliness were larger among girls than among boys and in countries with full measurement invariance. In multi-level modeling analyses, school loneliness was high when smartphone access and internet use were high. In contrast, higher unemployment rates predicted lower school loneliness. Income inequality, GDP, and total fertility rate (family size) were not significantly related to school loneliness when matched by year. School loneliness was positively correlated with negative affect and negatively correlated with positive affect and life satisfaction, suggesting the measure has broad implications for adolescent well-being. Conclusions: The psychological well-being of adolescents around the world began to decline after 2012, in conjunction with the rise of smartphone access and increased internet use, though causation cannot be proven and more years of data will provide a more complete picture.

The role of COVAX for low and middle-income countries	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						capacity building; COVAX; global vaccine access; patent waivers; vaccine equity	VACCINES; HEALTH	What has the past reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic taught us? We have seen that many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) still lack access to vaccines, and it seems little progress has been made in the last few months and year. This article discusses whether the current strategies, most notably, vaccine donations by the international community and the COVID-19 global access facility COVAX, offer meaningful solutions to tackle the problem. At the centre of our analysis, we compare the concepts of "donations" and "charity" with "vaccine equity" and the "empowerment" of poorer countries. We suggest that the achievement of fair global vaccine production requires that our global approach is supportive of the idea of empowerment. We, therefore, need structural reforms, which would most importantly include capacity building, to positively impact this goal and to take the interests of the global poor seriously.

Public health professionals and other experts broadly agree about actions needed to address such threats, but implementation of this advice is stymied by systemic factors such as prejudice, resource deficits, and high inequality. In these cases, crises like epidemics may be viewed as opportunities to spark structural changes that will improve future prevention efforts. However, crises can also weaken governance and reinforce systemic failures. In this paper, we use the concept of the governance treadmill to demonstrate cross-level dynamics that help or hinder the alignment of capacities toward prevention during public health crises. We find that variation in capacities and responses across local, national, and international levels contributes to the complex evolution of global and local health governance. Where capacities are misaligned, effective local prevention of global pandemic impacts tends to be elusive in the short term, and multiple cycles of crisis and response may be required before capacities align toward healthy governance. We demonstrate that this transition requires broader societal adaptation, particularly towards social justice and participatory democracy.	[Webster, D.

In this report, we focus on the cost of incarcerating adults convicted of sex crimes against children in the United States. Specifically, we summarize publicly available information on U.S. state and federal prison and sex offender civil commitment costs. Wherever possible, we used government data sources to inform cost estimates. Results indicate the annual cost to incarcerate adults convicted of sex crimes against children in the United States approaches $5.4 billion. This estimate does not include any costs incurred prior to incarceration (e.g., related to detection and prosecution) or post-release (e.g., related to supervision or registration). Nor does this estimate capture administrative and judicial costs associated with appeals, or administrative costs that cannot be extricated from other budgets, as is the case when costs per-prisoner are shared between prisons and civil commitment facilities. We believe information on the substantial funding dedicated to incarceration will be useful to U.S. federal, state, and local lawmakers and to international policymakers as they consider allocating resources to the development, evaluation and dissemination of effective prevention strategies aimed at keeping children safe from sexual abuse in the first place.

This article explores the tensions between health policy and systems research and practice on the one hand, and health equity-focussed activism on the other, as distinct yet interacting processes that have both been impacted by the shock effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. This extended commentary brings multidisciplinary voices seeking to look back at health systems history and fundamental social-institutional systems' behaviors in order to contextualize these current debates over how best to push social accountability efforts forward. Analysis There is a documented history of tension between long and short processes of international health cooperation and intervention. Social accountability approaches, as a more recent strategy to improve health systems performance, intersect with this overarching history of negotiation between differently situated actors both global and local on whether to pursue sustained, slow, often community-driven change or to focus on rapid, measurable, often top-down interventions. Covid-19, as a global public health emergency, resulted in calls for urgent action which have unsurprisingly displaced some of the energy and aspiration for systemic transformation processes. A combination of accountability approaches and mechanisms have their own legitimacy in fostering health systems change, demanding collaboration between those that move both fast and slow, top-down and bottom-up. Conclusion We argue that social accountability, much like all efforts to strengthen health systems, is "everybody's business" and that we must understand better the historical processes that have shaped the field of practice over time to move forward. These differences of perspective, knowledge-base and positioning vis-a-vis interventions or longer-term political commitment should not drive a conflict of legitimacy but instead be named, subsequently enabling the development of a shared code of conduct that applies to the breadth of actors involved in social accountability work. If we are concerned about the state of/status of social accountability within the context of "building back better" we must approach collaboration with a willingness to create dialogue across distinct disciplinary, technical and politically-informed ways of working.

Communication can involve a variety of discourses and languages and each of the stakeholders may employ diverging epistemologies to understand and explain experiences. These epistemologies may link to different sources of authority and be articulated using particular linguistic resources. Epistemic injustice can occur when stakeholders, intentionally or unintentionally, fail to recognise the validity of other stakeholders' ways of conceptualising and verbalising their experience of well-being and distress. Language lies at the heart of the risk of epistemic injustice involved in the process of expressing well-being and distress as seen in: 1) the interface between divergent discourses on well-being and distress (e.g., biomedical vs. spiritual); and 2) communications involving multiple linguistic resources, which can be subdivided into multi-language communications involving a) translation of assessment measures, and b) interpreted interactions. Some of the challenges of multi-language communication can be addressed by translators or interpreters who strive for conceptual equivalence. We argue, however, that all stakeholders have an important role as "epistemic brokers" in the languaging of possible epistemological differences. Effective epistemic brokering requires that all stakeholders are reflexively and critically aware of the risks of epistemic injustice inherent in multi-language communication. The article concludes with a set of prompts to help raise stakeholder awareness and reflexivity when engaging in communication about well-being and distress.

The persistence of the socioeconomic disparities is problematic, as the global community is currently advocating for not leaving anyone behind in attaining Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, health care facilities in developing countries continue to report high maternal deaths. Improved accessibility and strengthening of quality in the uptake of maternal health services (skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, and postnatal care) plays an important role in reducing maternal deaths which eventually leads to the attainment of SDG 3, Good Health, and Well-being. Methods This study used the Zimbabwe Demographic Health Survey (ZDHS) of 2015. The ZDHS survey used the principal components analysis in estimating the economic status of households. We computed binary logistic regressions on maternal health services attributes (skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, and postnatal care) against demographic characteristics. Furthermore, concentration indices were then used to measure of socio-economic inequalities in the use of maternal health services, and the Erreygers decomposable concentration index was then used to identify the factors that contributed to the socio-economic inequalities in maternal health utilization in Zimbabwe. Results Overall maternal health utilization was skilled birth attendance (SBA), 93.63%; antenatal-care (ANC) 76.33% and postnatal-care (PNC) 84.27%. SBA and PNC utilization rates were significantly higher than the rates reported in the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic Health Survey. Residence status was a significant determinant for antenatal care with rural women 2.25 times (CI: 1.55-3.27) more likely to utilize ANC. Richer women were less likely to utilize skilled birth attendance services [OR: 0.20 (CI: 0.08-0.50)] compared to women from the poorest households. While women from middle-income households [OR: 1.40 (CI: 1.03-1.90)] and richest households [OR: 2.36 (CI: 1.39-3.99)] were more likely to utilize antenatal care services compared to women from the poorest households. Maternal service utilization among women in Zimbabwe was pro-rich, meaning that maternal health utilization favoured women from wealthy households [SBA (0.05), ANC (0.09), PNC (0.08)]. Wealthy women were more likely to be assisted by a doctor, while midwives were more likely to assist women from poor households [Doctor (0.22), Midwife (- 0.10)]. Conclusion Decomposition analysis showed household wealth, husband's education, women's education, and residence status as important positive contributors of the three maternal health service (skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, and postnatal care) utilization outcomes. Educating women and their spouses on the importance of maternal health services usage is significant to increase maternal health service utilization and consequently reduce maternal mortality.

J	Kvæl, LAH; Helleso, R; Bergland, A; Debesay, J				Kvael, Linda Aimee Hartford; Helleso, Ragnhild; Bergland, Astrid; Debesay, Jonas			Balancing standardisation and individualisation in transitional care pathways: a meta-ethnography of the perspectives of older patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Meta-ethnography; Person-centred care; Transitional care; Older persons; Clinical work; Integrated care; Norway	NORWEGIAN HOME-CARE; READMISSIONS; QUALITY	Background Transitional care implies the transfer of patients within or across care settings in a seamless and safe way. For frail, older patients with complex health issues, high-quality transitions are especially important as these patients typically move more frequently within healthcare settings, requiring treatment from different providers. As transitions of care for frail people are considered risky, securing the quality and safety of these transitions is of great international interest. Nevertheless, despite efforts to improve quality in transitional care, research indicates that there is a lack of clear guidance to deal with practical challenges that may arise. The aim of this article is to synthesise older patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals' experiences of challenges to achieving high-quality transitional care. Methods We used the seven-step method for meta-ethnography originally developed by Noblit and Hare. In four different but connected qualitative projects, the authors investigated the challenges to transitional care for older people in the Norwegian healthcare system from the perspectives of older patients, informal caregivers and healthcare professionals. In this paper, we highlight and discuss the cruciality of these challenging issues by synthesising the results from twelve articles. Results The analysis resulted in four themes: i) balancing person-centred versus efficient care, ii) balancing everyday patient life versus the treatment of illness, iii) balancing user choice versus "What Matters to You", and iv) balancing relational versus practical care. These expressed challenges represent tensions at the system, organisation and individual levels based on partial competing assumptions on person-centred-care-inspired individualisation endeavours and standardisation requirements in transitional care. Conclusions There is an urgent need for a clearer understanding of the tension between standardisation and individualisation in transitional care pathways for older patients to ensure better healthcare quality for patients and more realistic working environments for healthcare professionals. Incorporating a certain professional flexibility within the wider boundary of standardisation may give healthcare professionals room for negotiation to meet patients' individual needs, while at the same time ensuring patient flow, equity and evidence-based practice.

CLINICAL ORAL INVESTIGATIONS			English	Article						Adolescence; Dental caries; Observational study; Residence characteristics; Neighborhood; Socioeconomic factors	GLOBAL BURDEN; ORAL-DISEASES; HEALTH; INEQUALITY; DETERMINANT; DEPRIVATION; RESIDENCE	Objective To assess the status of untreated dental caries in adolescents exposed to different conditions of family and neighborhood income. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study included a representative sample of 1197 15-19-year-old adolescents attending high schools from Santa Maria, southern Brazil. Data collection included a questionnaire and clinical examination (DMFT index). Neighborhood mean income was collected from official sources. The main predictor variable was a combination of household income and neighborhood mean income resulting in four categories: low household income/low neighborhood income, low household income/high neighborhood income, high household income/low neighborhood income, or high household income/high neighborhood income. The outcome was untreated caries (number of teeth with dentin cavities or residual roots). Multilevel Poisson regression analysis was used to assess the association between predictors and untreated caries. Rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Results The prevalence of untreated dental caries was 26% (n = 312), with a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 0.47 (+/- 1.05) teeth. Adolescents with low household income living in areas with low neighborhood income had the worse caries scenario. Compared with them, those classified as low-income households residing in high-income neighborhoods had 37% lower rate of untreated dental caries (adjusted RR = 0.63; 95%CI = 0.44-0.89). No neighborhood effect was detected among adolescents of more affluent families. Conclusions Neighborhood income contributed to the rate of untreated dental caries over and above household income among adolescents with low household income only.

J	Vyas, S; Hathi, P; Gupta, A				Vyas, Sangita; Hathi, Payal; Gupta, Aashish			Social disadvantage, economic inequality, and life expectancy in nine Indian states	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						social inequality; life expectancy; caste; religion; indigenous identity	MORTALITY; POPULATION; HEALTH	An extensive literature documents the contributions of discrimination and social exclusion to health disparities. This study investigates life expectancy differentials along lines of caste, religion, and indigenous identity in India, home to some of the largest populations of marginalized social groups in the world. Using a large, high-quality survey that measured mortality, social group, and economic status, we estimate and decompose life expectancy differences between higher-caste Hindus, comprising other backward classes and high-caste Hindus, and three of India's most disadvantaged social groups: Adivasis, Dalits, and Muslims. Relative to higher-caste Hindus, Adivasi life expectancy is more than 4 y lower, Dalit life expectancy is more than 3 y lower, and Muslim life expectancy is about 1 y lower. Economic status explains less than half of these gaps. The differences between the life expectancy of higher-caste Hindus and the life expectancies of Adivasis and Dalits are comparable to the Black-White gap in the United States in absolute magnitude. The differences are larger in relative terms because overall life expectancy in India is lower. Our findings extend the literature on fundamental causes of global health disparities. Methodologically, we contribute to the literature on mortality estimation and demographic decomposition using survey data from low-and middle-income contexts.

J	Pilkington, V; Keestra, SM; Hill, A				Pilkington, Victoria; Keestra, Sarai Mirjam; Hill, Andrew			Global COVID-19 Vaccine Inequity: Failures in the First Year of Distribution and Potential Solutions for the Future	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						manufacturing-R&D interface; pricing; vaccines; COVID-19; inequality		Within the first year of distribution of vaccines against COVID-19, high-income countries (HICs) have achieved vaccination rates of 75-80%, whilst low-income countries (LICs) vaccinated <10%. This disparity in access has been one of the greatest failures of international cooperation during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Global COVID-19 vaccine inequity affects us all, with ongoing risk of new variants emerging until global herd immunity is strengthened. The current model of global vaccine distribution is based on financial competition for limited vaccine supplies, resulting in HICs getting first access to vaccines, with LICs being forced to rely on voluntary donations through schemes like COVAX. Pharmaceutical companies own the intellectual property (IP) rights for COVID-19 vaccines, allowing them to control manufacturing, distribution, and pricing. However, the pharmaceutical industry did not develop these vaccines alone, with billions of dollars of public funding being instrumental in their discovery and development. Solutions to enable global equitable access already exist. The next step in scale up of manufacture and distribution worldwide is equitable knowledge sharing and technology transfer. The World Health Organization centralized technology transfer hub would facilitate international cooperation. Investments made into developing this infrastructure benefit the COVID-19 response whilst promoting future pandemic preparedness. Whilst globally there is majority support for waivers of IP to facilitate this next step, key opponents blocking this move include the UK and other European countries which host large domestic pharmaceutical industries. A nationalistic approach is not effective during a global pandemic. International cooperation is essential to achieve global goals against COVID-19.

Respectful care is an important component of this but is suboptimum in many low-income settings. A renewed energy among health professionals and academics is driving an international agenda to eradicate disrespectful health facility care around the globe. However, few studies have explored respectful care from different vantage points. Methods We used Strauss and Corbin's grounded theory methodology to explore intrapartum experiences in Tanzania and Zambia. In-depth interviews were conducted with 98 participants (48 women, 18 partners, 21 health-providers and 11 key stakeholders), resulting in data saturation. Analysis involved constant comparison, comprising three stages of coding: open, axial and selective. The process involved application of memos, reflexivity and positionality. Results Findings demonstrated that direct and indirect social discrimination led to inequity of care. Health-providers were believed to display manipulative behaviours to orchestrate situations for their own or the woman's benefit, and were often caring against the odds, in challenging environments. Emergent categories were related to the core category: respectful care, an added extra, which reflects the notion that women did not always expect or receive respectful care, and tolerated poor experiences to obtain services believed to benefit them or their babies. Respectful care was not seen as a component of good quality care, but a luxury that only some receive. Conclusion Both quality of care and respectful care were valued but were not viewed as mutually inclusive. Good quality treatment (transactional care) was often juxtaposed with disrespectful care; with relational care having a lower status among women and healthcare providers. To readdress the balance, respectful care should be a predominant theme in training programmes, policies and audits. Women's and health-provider voices are pivotal to the development of such interventions.

Sources of data Synthesis of ethical, scientific and clinical literature. Areas of agreement Ethical analyses have focused on the moral responsibilities of patients to complete antibiotic courses, resistance as a tragedy of the commons and attempts to limit use through antibiotic stewardship. Areas of controversy Each of these analyses has significant limitations and can result in self-defeating or overly narrow implications for policy. Growing points More complex analyses focus on ethical implications of ubiquitous asymptomatic carriage of resistant bacteria, non-linear outcomes within and between patients over time and global variation in resistant disease burdens. Areas timely for developing research Neglected topics include the harms of antibiotic use, including off-target effects on the human microbiome, and the lack of evidence guiding most antibiotic prescription decisions.

Does health-related poverty publication landscape reflect global needs in the light of the current poverty rebound?	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Impoverishment; Inequality; Malnutrition; Healthcare; Famines; Research patterns	MENTAL-DISORDERS; SCIENCE; COUNTRIES; INCOME; WEB	Background After nearly a quarter-century of declining poverty, the numbers are rising again significantly. This is due not only to effects of climate change but also to the COVID-19 pandemics and armed conflict. Combined with the enormous health impacts, that will cause misery and health care costs worldwide. Therefore, this study provides background information on the global research landscape on poverty and health to help researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers determine the best way to address this threat. Results The USA is the key player, dealing mainly with domestic issues. European countries are also involved but tend to be more internationally oriented. Developing countries are underrepresented, with Nigeria standing out. A positive correlation was found between publication numbers and economic strength, while the relationship between article numbers and multidimensional poverty was negatively correlated.

International Evidence	ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL			English	Article						perceived corruption; convergence; competitiveness		This article analyses the evolution over time of perceived corruption for a large set of countries worldwide. To proxy corruption, we use the recently proposed Bayesian Corruption Index (Standaert, S. (2015). Divining the level of corruption: A bayesian state space approach, Journal of Comparative Economics, 43(3), 782-803). We employ the test developed by (Phillips, P., & Sul, D. (2007). Transition modeling and econometric convergence tests. Econometrica, 75, 1771-1855) that enables the endogenous determination of convergence clubs for countries over time. Having divided countries into convergence clubs, we explore whether each club differs from the others in terms of their competitiveness ranking. In particular, drawing on the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report, we focus not only on the global competitiveness score, but also on the first and the fifth pillars of competitiveness: institutions and health, respectively. Mean and median scores for clubs confirm the general rule that low perceived corruption levels tend to be associated with high-income countries with established democracies, high-quality healthcare systems, and relatively low-income inequality. However, countries such as Spain and Italy, which are innovation-driven economies with excellent scores in the health pillar, are in the worst club for perceived corruption, suggesting there are additional idiosyncratic aspects that could drive perceived corruption levels.

One debate that has increasingly intensified in recent years is the democracy and health relationship in comparative international context. Scholars argue that democracy does affect country-level health outcomes in less-developed countries, while others argue democracy does not affect country-level health outcomes. I estimate the effect of numerous democracy indexes on child mortality and infant mortality in developing countries using fixed effects regression models with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered by country. I find that multiple aspects of democracy exert significant beneficial effects on child mortality and infant mortality in less-developed countries.

Developing Poetry as a Research Methodology with Rarer Forms of Dementia: Four Research Protocols	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS			English	Article						arts-based methods; young onset dementia; methods in qualitative inquiry; virtual environments; social justice	YOUNG-ONSET DEMENTIA; PEOPLE; EXPERIENCES; CARE; PERSONHOOD; WORKSHOPS; INQUIRY; ARTS; WELL	People living with rarer forms of dementia tend to have progressive cognitive symptoms affecting skills other than memory and/or onset before the age of 65 years. They are often misdiagnosed and due to symptom profile or age of onset, do not usually fit well with care pathways designed for older people with typical Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. Although the arts have been increasingly used as interventions to support people with dementia, there is very little attention given to rarer dementia forms in arts and health research or practice. The objective of the present international study seeks to systematically explore four diverse forms of poetry writing within this population through virtual and in-person small and large group formats. Our approach includes investigating poetic processes as methodology through the lens of an arts-based methodological approach in order to explore how poems construct knowledge and a felt experience. We will also use more traditional qualitative approaches to understand the experience of writing, reading and listening to poetry as an intervention that can be used with different rarer forms of dementia. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first study to explore poetry using multiple research protocols. The results will have implications for methodology development, co-constructed poetic inquiry and multiple opportunities for involving poetry in supporting people with dementia and family members.

Global surgery is an essential component of global health	SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND			English	Article						Global health; Global surgery; Health equity; Health systems strengthening; Low-and middle-income countries	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; POLITICAL PRIORITY; SURGICAL CARE; ANESTHESIA; GENERATION; FRAMEWORK; COVERAGE; DISEASE; BURDEN	Global surgery as an essential component of global health. Global surgery is the study and practice of improving access to timely, quality, and affordable surgical care. It emphasizes horizontal health systems strengthening through addressing a range of health challenges in surgical care that improve health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations. Global surgery specifically contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 (SDGs) by addressing the elimination of poverty (SDG 1), ensuring good health and well-being (SDG 3), promoting decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and reducing inequalities (SDGs 5 and 10). Global surgery issues transcend national boundaries and intersect with other global health issues such as migration and the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues are nested in a highly politicised environment, therefore power and politics should be considered when identifying problems and solutions. Despite evidence of its importance, the global surgery network has not generated substantial attention and resources compared to other global health networks. Global surgery can further increase its effectiveness through linking with health systems strengthening agendas, and identifying unified solutions to improve access to quality surgical care in low- and middle-income countries. Global surgery is indispensable in the achievement of health and well-being for all.

Global health engagement in the Scottish health service: A journey towards global citizenship	SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND			English	Article						Global health; Global health (history); Global citizenship; Health care systems; Healthcare systems; Health equity; Altruism; Scotland		A B S T R A C T For most of its history, the contribution of the Scottish health service towards health needs outside of Scotland has been informal, ad hoc, and viewed as incidental to its core func-tions. A more globalised view is emerging, and in recent years, NHS Scotland has begun formalising the principles and mechanisms by which it will contribute towards health and human flourishing around the world. This article provides a brief historical overview of how Scottish medical personnel became involved in the introduction of Western medicine and public health in less developed countries, originally in parallel with colonial expansion and Christian mission outreaches. Following devolution in 1999 of many political powers from the UK Parliament to a newly-formed Scottish Parliament, Scotland's own international development strategy has been evolving. In 2016, the Scottish Government articulated a commitment to 'global citizenship', a pan-governmental, pan-societal engagement towards domestic and inter-national achievement of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Following a consideration of the risks and benefits of international volunteering to the Scottish health service, an NHS Scotland Global Citizenship Programme was established, which has catalysed policy development, created networking opportunities, the promul-gation of best practice in international health work and the development of novel contracts which facilitate global health work in tandem with a Scottish employment contract. This article also outlines the various benefits of global health engagement for a health service in a high income country such as Scotland.

International collaboration in academic medicine is one of the most important ways by which research and innovation develop globally. However, the intersections among colonialism, academic medicine, and global health research have created a neocolonial narrative that perpetuates inequalities in global health partnerships. The authors critically examine the visa process as an example of a racist practice to show how the challenges of blocked mobility increase inequality and thwart research endeavors. Visas are used to limit mobility across certain borders, and this limitation hinders international collaborations in academic medicine. The authors discuss the concept of social closure and how limits to global mobility for scholars from low- and middle-income countries perpetuate a cycle of dependence on scholars who have virtually barrier-free global mobility-these scholars being mainly from high-income countries. Given the current sociopolitical milieu of increasing border controls and fears of illegal immigration, the authors' experiences expose what is at stake for academic medicine when the political sphere, focused on tightening border security, and the medical realm, striving to build international research collaborations, intersect. Creating more equitable global partnerships in research requires a shift from the current paradigm that dominates most international partnerships and causes injury to African scholars.

J	Sheikh, ZA				Sheikh, Zainab Afshan			Dealing with complicity in fieldwork: Reflections on studying genetic research in Pakistan	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS			English	Article						complicity; constructive complicity; ethnography; fieldwork; knowledge politics; methodology; Pakistan; power inequality	ETHICS; ETHNOGRAPHY; KNOWLEDGES; WORKERS	Health-related ethnography undertaken in a context marked by social inequalities and colonial legacies requires critical attention to power imbalances in the fieldwork. In this paper, I draw on my own experiences from studying genetic research in Pakistan. As a Danish-born female researcher with roots in Pakistan, I have followed genetic researchers and families dealing with genetic conditions in Pakistan. Through examples I unearth how encounters in the field were shaped by complicities of being in-between the Danish and the Pakistani, of studying and doing international research at the same time, and of my inaction towards suffering families. I base my analysis on the notion that complicity manifests in a generative, and unavoidable, engagement with both complex structures of inequality and interlocutors. We can never fully understand the specificities or consequences of complicity-whether moral or epistemic-when entering, engaging with or representing our fields. However, by staying constructively with the tensions, instead of attempting to move beyond the discomfort that they might create, we can learn how to deal with the consequences and in that, build further the value of ethnographic activity.

This study examined educational inequalities in epilepsy mortality in the general population in the Baltic countries and Finland in 2000-2015. Education-specific mortality estimates for individuals aged 30-74 in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were obtained from census-linked mortality datasets while data for Finland came from the register-based population and death data file of Statistics Finland. Trends and educational inequalities in epilepsy mortality were assessed using age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100,000 person years and age-adjusted mortality rate ratios (RRs) calculated using Poisson regression. ASMRs were higher in men than women in all countries. ASMRs reduced in 2000-2015 among all men and women except for Finnish women. Among men, an inverse educational gradient in epilepsy mortality in 2000-2007 widened in 2008-2015 with ASMRs falling among high and mid educated men in all countries but increasing among low educated men in three countries. An inverse educational gradient in female mortality remained in all countries throughout 2000-2015. Although epilepsy mortality fell in the Baltic countries and Finland (men only) in 2000-2015, this masked a clear inverse educational gradient in mortality that became steeper across the period.

Despite evidence in Ireland supporting the improvement in physical and mental health following access to gender care, little is known about the local healthcare navigation challenges. Internationally, research focuses primarily on the experience of service users and omits the perspective of other potential key stakeholders. Youth experiences are a particularly seldom-heard group. Methods and analysis This study will use a sequential exploratory mixed-methods design with a participatory social justice approach. The qualitative phase will explore factors that help and hinder access to gender care for young people in Ireland. This will be explored from multiple stakeholders' perspectives, namely, young people, caregivers and specialist healthcare providers. Framework analysis will be used to identify priorities for action and the qualitative findings used to build a survey tool for the quantitative phase. The quantitative phase will then measure the burden of the identified factors on healthcare navigation across different age categories and gender identities (transmasculine vs transfeminine vs non-binary). Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by St Vincent's Hospital Research Ethics Committee (RS21-019), University College Dublin Ethics Committee (LS-21-14Kearns-OShea) and the Transgender Equality Network Ireland's Internal Ethics Committee (TIECSK). We aim to disseminate the findings through international conferences, peer-review journals and by utilisation of expert panel members and strategic partners.

However, health outcomes or patterns are hardly measured in relation to land tenure security. There are no clear measures or indicators of if and how these two issues interrelate and which type of land tenure deficiency is likely to lead to which kind of health outcomes or patterns. To address this knowledge quandary, we reviewed literature to identify which characteristics of land tenure could relate to which types of health outcomes. The review found four specific land tenure security pathways which significantly influence health outcomes. For each of these, it is possible to identify a set of indicators which could measure the extent of interrelation between land tenure security and health. The result of this process is the design of a list of 46 land tenure-enabled indicators that can be applied empirically. The indicators demonstrate how to design a transdisciplinary approach that connects land management and global urban health knowledge spaces.

Here we explore spatial air pollution and human health disparities in the Coachella Valley with particular attention to disparities arising across population characteristics including both socioeconomic and demographic vulnerabilities. We use two different measures of respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes at the individual and census tract levels - one measure based on a randomly sampled telephone survey and the other measure based on emergency room visitation data - to investigate the degree to which these health outcomes are connected to air pollution and socioeconomic metrics. We further investigate biases and differences between the health outcome metrics themselves and suggest opportunities to address them in future analyses and survey efforts. We find that more vulnerable communities are associated with higher levels of fine particulates, but lower levels of ozone. While emergency visit rates show a significant positive correlation with both pollutants, no such association is found when using surveyed health outcome data. The ratio of emergency visits versus survey rates shows a positive relationship with socioeconomic and demographic vulnerability, indicating that vulnerable communities are less likely to self report diagnoses despite higher rates of respiratory or cardiovascular hospitalization. Additionally, survey respondents tend to show less vulnerability relative to their surrounding census-based demographics. These findings suggest the need for greater attention to health issues specifically within disadvantaged communities in the Coachella Valley, building upon and working within existing community networks and local resources, to better address current and projected health needs. Our findings also highlight disparities in air pollution exposure, health outcomes, and population characteristics in the Coachella Valley, providing context for crucial pollution reduction efforts in the face of increasing environmental threats.

To reduce inequalities in health, we have conducted a study on the impact of HBV in prisons located in the region of Tuscany by recording the results of serum screening in clin-ical medical records, the objective being to increase anti-HBV vaccination in subjects susceptible to infection by means of an accelerated schedule. To further advance disease prevention, we conducted health promotion and education activities prior to a screening/vaccination program in Tuscany prisons; both staff working in the pris -ons and the prisoners themselves were actively involved. The study started on 11 April 2016 and ended on 10 October 2017. In this paper, we report on the interventions carried out beforehand, such as training, informa-tion, and peer education. In addition to information, ina previous study on the overall rate of inmate screening and vaccination, this article incorporates supplemental analysis to differentiate the rate of screening and vacci-nation among inmates previously present in this setting and those having recently arrived. For health staff, six courses were conducted on Continuing Education in Medicine. A total of 138 inmates of the main nationalities present were selected by justice, health and education staff as peer educators. Out of the 15 prisons participating in the screening and vaccination program, courses for prisoners were conducted in 10 prisons by a medical doc-tor and the International Organization for Migration cultural mediators, taking into account the multi-ethnic ori-gins of the detainee population and applying a peer education approach. All prisoners received an HBV brochure in various languages. HBV screening was performed by the prisons' sanitary staffs. Out of the 1075 inmates who needed screening, 70.9% of those previously present and 93.6% of the recently arrived agreed to undergo screen-ing for HBV. Out of the 601 prisoners who required vaccination, 85.2% of those previously present and 72% of the recently arrived received the first dose. In conclusion, training, information, and a peer education approach could explain a high rate of adherence to a screening and vaccination program. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Vaccination is the primary means of controlling the infection, with elimination a possibility. However, the measles-containing vaccine coverage in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is 70% while that for Nigeria is 54% according to official estimates and 64.7% from household surveys. This review aims to identify factors that contribute to the poor coverage rate and proposes appropriate recommendations to address these factors. We conducted a comprehensive search of five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL Plus and PubMed) using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing, study type) framework. The search was conducted in September 2017 in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and inclusion criteria were studies conducted in SSA, that evaluated measles vaccine coverage gaps, evaluated strategies for improving measles vaccination coverage and were published in English. The database search yielded 23 publications. Several different factors influencing measles vaccine coverage were identified and were grouped into four main areas: immunization system, information and communication, family characteristics and parental attitudes and knowledge. Fears and misconceptions were common reasons for non-vaccination. Activities to improve vaccination coverage were identified, including structural reforms such as siting health centres within or proximal to target communities, improving female literacy and conducting measles vaccination campaigns. Multiple reasons for poor measles vaccination coverage were identified. Factors influencing the immunization system and information and communication factors can be fixed at the country level, but challenges relating to family characteristics and parental attitudes and knowledge require solutions adapted to the community of concern. However, vaccination campaigns are an effective means of improving vaccination coverage and they reduce geographic and socio-economic inequities.

We explore the equity of intervention reach and impact. Methods Intervention reach and primary outcomes of intermediate hyperglycaemia and T2DM were assessed through interview surveys and blood fasting glucose and 2--hour oral glucose tolerance tests among population-based samples of adults aged >= 30 years. Age-stratified, gender-stratified and wealth-stratified intervention effects were estimated using random effects logistic regression. Results PLA participants were similar to non-participants, though female participants were younger and more likely to be married than female non-participants. Differences including age, education, wealth and marital status were observed between individuals exposed and those not exposed to the mHealth intervention. PLA reduced the prevalence of T2DM and intermediate hyperglycaemia in all age, gender and wealth strata. Reductions in 2-year incidence of T2DM of at least 51% (0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.92) were observed in all strata except among the oldest and least poor groups. mHealth impact on glycaemic outcomes was observed only among the youngest group, where a 47% reduction in the 2-year incidence of T2DM was observed (0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.00). Conclusion Large impacts of PLA across all strata indicate a highly effective and equitable intervention. mHealth may be more suitable for targeting higher risk, younger populations.

Taking Systems Thinking to the Global Level: Using the WHO Building Blocks to Describe and Appraise the Global Health System in Relation to COVID-19	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE; WORLD; WILL; ORGANIZATION; GOVERNANCE; SECURITY; COVERAGE; TIME	Adequately preparing for and containing global shocks, such as COVID-19, is a key challenge facing health systems globally. COVID-19 highlights that health systems are multilevel systems, a continuum from local to global. Goals and monitoring indicators have been key to strengthening national health systems but are missing at the supranational level. A framework to strengthen the global system-the global health actors and the governance, finance, and delivery arrangements within which they operate-is urgently needed. In this article, we illustrate how the World Health Organization Building Blocks framework, which has been used to monitor the performance of national health systems, can be applied to describe and appraise the global health system and its response to COVID-19, and identify potential reforms. Key weaknesses in the global response included: fragmented and voluntary financing; non-transparent pricing of medicines and supplies, poor quality standards, and inequities in procurement and distribution; and weak leadership and governance. We also identify positive achievements and identify potential reforms of the global health system for greater resilience to future shocks. We discuss the limitations of the Building Blocks framework and future research directions and reflect on political economy challenges to reform.

J	Simon-Kumar, R				Simon-Kumar, Rachel			'Ecological determinants' of health in the global south: practising sustainable consumption in Kerala, India	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						global south; consumption; practice; Kerala; ecological determinants	INTEGRATION; INEQUALITY; GROWTH; TRUST	Health promotion has long recognized the ecological determinants of health, underscoring the interconnections between planetary health, economic systems and human health. Despite calls for synergy across them, these domains are governed by fundamentally divergent paradigms leading to unaddressed conceptual and institutional gaps. Sustainability, meanwhile, is reduced to personal responsibility and behaviour change. This qualitative research explores ecological determinants through a focus on sustainable consumption in the under-researched context of the global south where rapid modernization has profoundly impacted the natural environment. The article uses the theoretical framework of 'practice'-namely, the social routines, values, conventions and norms that drive consumption-to critically examine everyday household sustainable consumption in India's southern state of Kerala. The findings show that in most households, sustainability is a health promotion practice. People practice sustainability fundamentally for its beneficial health outcomes. However, the institutional structures set up in favour of economic development continue to dominate society and is the paradigm that contextualizes everyday social life for consumers. The findings suggest that the practice of sustainable consumption is complex and caught in the space that is neither 'upstream' or 'downstream'; instead, the focus on the 'mid-stream' reveals complex calculations that go into everyday negotiation of healthy living. Lay Summary Consumerism is rapidly spreading through the global south. While the conveniences associated with easily available goods are appreciated, population health has been adversely impacted by attendant decline in ecosystems through the increase in plastics, waste and toxicity in the food chain. Health promoters, for decades, have sought to draw attention to the misalignment between the values that govern environment, economy, and health policies. This article investigates policy misalignment through the experiences of everyday consumers. Set in the context Kerala, in south India, which has recently seen rapid consumerism, the study shows that everyday consumption, even unsustainable ones, are part of meaningful social practices actively negotiated around health. Thus, people buy goods wrapped in plastic, despite its environmental impacts, because it is perceived as safer. Individuals act 'unsustainably' largely because they have little control over systemic factors-like urbanization, changes in social life, lack of government regulation and infrastructure-that shape their consumption practices. The study shows that initiatives that focus on knowledge and behaviour modification are not sufficient to ensure sustainable consumption. Instead, what is needed are institutional convergences across environment, economy and health priorities so that individuals can create new consumption practices that are both sustainable and healthy.

HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY			English	Article						COVID and higher education; Education crisis; Inequalities in education; International students; Online learning; Pandemic; Remote teaching; Research; Technology	PRINCIPLES	Universities around the world are facing unprecedented challenges as a result of the corona virus. There has been global devastation of the entire education sector with long-term closure of schools. The health crisis and the accompanying education crisis continue, and the end of the crisis is not certain. The immediate response everywhere to the outbreak of the virus was closure of university campuses, disrupting almost all academic activities everywhere. After the immediate reaction, as a short-term response, universities began offering some core programmes in education and research by adopting digital technology. While some feel that online methods have improved overall access, many argue that they exacerbate existing inequalities in access to higher education and research among several groups of population. As the global health emergency is still continuing, it is widely noted that we need to develop, after initial immediate responses, short-term, medium- and long-term plans for developing robust higher education and research systems that contribute to knowledge development, reducing inequalities, and which can face future uncertain emergencies. The paper reviews some of the important developments that have taken place, and different perspectives that are emerging on the responses needed for the transformation of higher education in the post-COVID era.

Worldwide efforts have been made to lower ID burden, however, whether it decreased equally in different regions and sexes is unclear. This study is to examine regional and sex inequalities in global ID from 1990 to 2017. Methods We conducted a longitudinal, comparative burden-of-disease study. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of ID were obtained from Global Burden of Disease Report 2017. Human Development Index (HDI) data were obtained from Human Development Report 2017. Gini coefficient and the concentration index were calculated to assess the equities in global burden of ID. Results A downward trend of global ID burden (from 569.3 (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 387.8-815.6) to 403.0 (95% UI: 272.4-586.6), p < 0.001), age-adjusted DALYs per 100,000 population) but an uptrend of its inequalities (from 0.366 to 0.431, p < 0.001, Gini coefficients) was observed between 1990 and 2017. ID burden was heavier in women than that in men ([age-adjusted DALYs per 100,000 population from 742.2 to 514.3] vs [from 398.5 to 291.9]), but its inequalities were higher in men since 1990. The between-sex gap of ID burden was narrowed with higher HDI (beta = - 364.11, p < 0.001). East Asia & Pacific and South Asia regions made a big stride for ID control in both sexes over decades [age-adjusted DALYs per 100,000 population from 378.7 (95% UI: 255.8-551.7) in 1990 to 138.9 (95%UI: 91.8-206.5) in 2017], while a heavy burden among Sub-Saharan African men was persistent[age-adjusted DALYs per 100,000 population, 572.5 (95% UI: 385.3-815) in 1990 and 562.6 (95% UI: 367.9-833.3) in 2017]. Conclusions Redistributing attention and resources to help countries with low HDI, especially take care of women with low socioeconomic status (SES) and men under high ID burden may help hold back the expanding ID inequality.

The pursuit of justice is often related to efforts to attain personal as well as collective well-being. In this paper, we illustrate three exemplars of community psychologists' efforts to promote justice. Within each case study, we discuss the social and community context and examine how the researchers built partnerships and solidarity, developed ways of doing, and approached challenges and solutions. First, we present an example to promote economic justice through an entrepreneurship initiative developed in collaboration with young Black youth with disabilities in the United States. The second case illustrates an effort to promote reproductive justice in collaboration with Roma women and girls in Spain. The third exemplar depicts the use of life stories as a method to raise the voices of displaced, marginalized indigenous women in Peru. Based on these three case studies, we present a synthesis model of social justice. We also discuss implications for future studies emphasizing the importance of engaging community participants in research meaningful ways, developing sustainable partnerships, and decolonizing research.

Barriers to healthcare and self-reported adverse outcomes for autistic adults: a cross-sectional study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						primary care; adult psychiatry; health policy	SPECTRUM DISORDERS; EXPERIENCES; MORTALITY; NEEDS	Objectives Autistic people experience poor physical and mental health along with reduced life expectancy compared with non-autistic people. Our aim was to identify self-reported barriers to primary care access by autistic adults compared with non-autistic adults and to link these barriers to self-reported adverse health consequences. Design Following consultation with the autistic community at an autistic conference, Autscape, we developed a self-report survey, which we administered online through social media platforms. Setting A 52-item, international, online survey. Participants 507 autistic adults and 157 non-autistic adults. Primary and secondary outcome measures Self-reported barriers to accessing healthcare and associated adverse health outcomes. Results Eighty per cent of autistic adults and 37% of non-autistic respondents reported difficulty visiting a general practitioner (GP). The highest-rated barriers by autistic adults were deciding if symptoms warrant a GP visit (72%), difficulty making appointments by telephone (62%), not feeling understood (56%), difficulty communicating with their doctor (53%) and the waiting room environment (51%). Autistic adults reported a preference for online or text-based appointment booking, facility to email in advance the reason for consultation, the first or last clinic appointment and a quiet place to wait. Self-reported adverse health outcomes experienced by autistic adults were associated with barriers to accessing healthcare. Adverse outcomes included untreated physical and mental health conditions, not attending specialist referral or screening programmes, requiring more extensive treatment or surgery due to late presentations and untreated potentially life-threatening conditions. There were no significant differences in difficulty attending, barriers experienced or adverse outcomes between formally diagnosed and self-identified autistic respondents. Conclusions Reduction of healthcare inequalities for autistic people requires that healthcare providers understand autistic perspectives, communication needs and sensory sensitivities. Adjustments for autism-specific needs are as necessary as ramps for wheelchair users.

Intelligent Diagnostic Prediction and Classification Models for Detection of Kidney Disease	HEALTHCARE			English	Article						usability score artificial intelligence; medical information systems; image matching; machine learning algorithms; morphological operations	NEURAL-NETWORK; MACHINE; SEGMENTATION	Kidney disease is a major public health concern that has only recently emerged. Toxins are removed from the body by the kidneys through urine. In the early stages of the condition, the patient has no problems, but recovery is difficult in the later stages. Doctors must be able to recognize this condition early in order to save the lives of their patients. To detect this illness early on, researchers have used a variety of methods. Prediction analysis based on machine learning has been shown to be more accurate than other methodologies. This research can help us to better understand global disparities in kidney disease, as well as what we can do to address them and coordinate our efforts to achieve global kidney health equity. This study provides an excellent feature-based prediction model for detecting kidney disease. Various machine learning algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), naive bayes (NB), and others, as well as Re-cursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Chi-Square test feature-selection techniques, were used to build and analyze various prediction models on a publicly available dataset of healthy and kidney disease patients. The studies found that a logistic regression-based prediction model with optimal features chosen using the Chi-Square technique had the highest accuracy of 98.75 percent. White Blood Cell Count (Wbcc), Blood Glucose Random (bgr), Blood Urea (Bu), Serum Creatinine (Sc), Packed Cell Volume (Pcv), Albumin (Al), Hemoglobin (Hemo), Age, Sugar (Su), Hypertension (Htn), Diabetes Mellitus (Dm), and Blood Pressure (Bp) are examples of these traits.

Systemic Challenges in Internship Training for Health-Service-Psychology: A Call to Action From Trainee Stakeholders	CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Review						professional standards; public mental-health systems; health-service-psychology training; diversity equity and inclusion	COLLABORATIVE DECISION-MAKING; PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY; CLINICAL-PSYCHOLOGY; MENTAL-HEALTH; COMPETENCE; PROGRAMS; COVID-19; COST; SUPERVISION; DIVERSITY	The challenges observed in health-service-psychology (HSP) training during COVID-19 revealed systemic and philosophical issues that preexisted the pandemic but became more visible during the global health crisis. In a position article written by 23 trainees across different sites and training specializations, we use lessons learned from COVID-19 as a touchstone for a call to action in HSP training. Historically, trainee voices have been conspicuously absent from literature about clinical training. We describe long-standing dilemmas in HSP training that were exacerbated by the pandemic and will continue to require resolution after the pandemic has subsided. We make recommendations for systems-level changes that would advance equity and sustainability in HSP training. This article advances the conversation about HSP training by including the perspective of trainees as essential stakeholders.	[Palitsky, R.; Kaplan, D. M.; Anderson, M. R.; Egbert, A.; Hallowell, E.

We investigated measures taken by the top 35 publicly funded UK universities to ensure global equitable access to COVID-19 health technologies between January and end of October 2020. We sent Freedom Of Information (FOI) requests and analysed universities' websites, to (i) assess institutional strategies on the patenting and licensing of COVID-19-related health technologies, (ii) identify all COVID-19-related health technologies licensed or patented and (iii) record whether universities engaged with the Open COVID pledge, COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), or Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) COVID-19 licensing guidelines during the time period assessed. Except for the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, UK universities did not update their institutional strategies during the first year of the pandemic. Nine universities licensed 22 COVID-19 health technologies. Imperial College London disclosed ten patents relevant to COVID-19. No UK universities participated in the Open COVID Pledge or C-TAP, but discussions were ongoing in autumn 2020. The University of Bristol endorsed the AUTM guidelines. Despite important COVID-19 health technologies being developed by UK universities, our findings suggest minimal engagement with measures that may promote equitable access downstream. We suggest universities review their technology transfer policies and implement global equitable access strategies for COVID-19 health technologies. We furthermore propose that public and charitable funders can play a larger role in encouraging universities to adopt such practices by making access and transparency clauses a mandatory condition for receiving public funds for research.

J	Plamondon, K; Neufeld, V				Plamondon, Katrina; Neufeld, Vic			Are we there yet? Principles in advancing equity though global public health research	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article						Global public health; Global health research; Equity; Praxis; Practice; Decolonization; Power	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; INDIGENOUS PEOPLES; ETHICS; CANADA; CHALLENGES; GAP	Canadian engagement in global and public health includes a long history of centering issues of equity in practice, policy, and research. In 2015, through a series of deliberative dialogues about what ethical standards should guide how people engage in global health research, the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research (CCGHR) released a set of six equity-centred principles and critically reflective questions. These principles offered a platform for identifying equity implications and choices about theories, methods, approaches, partnerships, or practices in global and public health. In 2022, as questions of how to unsettle systems of power and move beyond rhetorical efforts to advance equity action continue to grow, Canada's global public health research community is turning a critically reflexive gaze at our own practices and ways of working, recognizing excellence as necessarily integrating equity in research pursuits, processes, and outcomes. In this commentary, we reflect on the contexts that led to the evolution of the CCGHR Principles for Global Health Research and highlight their current reach and impact, including their integration in the Canadian Institutes Framework for Action on Global Health Research. We invite others to embrace a lifelong commitment to equity work as an act of solidarity and investment in our collective futures.

The restrictions imposed to control the spread of the virus have upended our routines and forced us to reimagine our work structures, educational programming and delivery of patient care in ways that will likely continue to change how we live and work for the foreseeable future. Yet, despite these interruptions, the pandemic has additionally sparked a transformative impulse in some to actively engage in critical introspection around the future of their work, compelling us to consider what changes could (and perhaps should) occur after the pandemic is over. Drawing on key concepts associated with scholar Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy, this paper serves as a call to action, illuminating the critical imaginings that have come out of this collective moment of struggle and instability, suggesting that we can perhaps create a more just, compassionate world even in the wake of extraordinary hardship.

Achieving high and homogenous immunization coverage, which is all the more important within the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout, requires the strengthening of existing immunization activities and innovative approach to immunization promotion. This research applied a descriptive case study methodology to document the implementation of strategic multi-level alliances to promote equitable immunization access and demand in Colombia, Guyana, and Sucre, Bolivia. Data collection, carried out between September 2019 and March 2020, included documentary reviews, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and site visits accompanied by discussions with relevant stakeholders. Case studies provide valuable examples of people-centered, partnership-based, country-owned, and data-guided approaches to promoting equitable immunization coverage, including multi-level partnerships to build technical capacity for the identification and measurement of social inequalities impacting immunization in Colombia; intersectoral and community collaboration for pro equity emergency response to regional vaccine preventable disease outbreaks in Guyana; and strategic alliances with the education sector and civil society organizations for the introduction of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine in Sucre, Bolivia. Lessons learned highlight avenues for improving the impact of multi-level, equity-focused capacity building, particularly at the local level; optimizing the use of data and resources, partnerships, and community and stakeholder education and empowerment. While impact studies are needed to better understand the quantitative contributions of such strategic alliances, these case studies illustrate their practical significance and reinforce the value of multi-level, intersectoral collaboration for enhancing equitable immunization access and demand. The experiences of Colombia, Guyana, and Sucre, Bolivia provide evidence-based insight to support pro-equity immunization program planning to ensure that no one is left behind and that everyone, everywhere receives the benefits of vaccines, both routine and for COVID-19.

To examine their access to health services and social protection during the pandemic, we conducted an exploratory scoping review on experiences of migrant workers in three countries with comparable immigration, health, and welfare policies: Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. After screening 961 peer-reviewed and grey literature sources, five studies were included. Using immigration status as a lens, we found that despite more inclusive policies in response to the pandemic, temporary migrant workers, especially migrant farm workers and international students, remained excluded from health services and social protection. Findings demonstrate that exploitative employment practices, precarity, and racism contribute to the continued exclusion of temporary migrant workers. The interplay between these factors, with structural racism at its core, reflect the colonial histories of these countries and their largely neoliberal approaches to immigration. To address this inequity, proactive action that recognizes and targets these structural determinants at play is essential.

Approximately 40% of cancer survivors experience long-term effects of cancer which can lead to activity limitations and participation restrictions; yet discussions of disability are largely absent from clinical and research cancer health equity agendas. The purpose of this study was to explore how cancer survivors experience and make sense of the long-term disabling effects of cancer and its treatments. In this qualitative study, data were collected via in-depth semi-structured interviews with survivors of breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and sarcoma (n = 30). Data were analyzed thematically using a 2-phase iterative process proceeding from descriptive to conceptual coding. Survivors experienced a wide range of long-term physical, sensory, cognitive, and emotional effects, that intertwined to restrict their participation in self-care, work, leisure, and social roles. While the interaction between impairments and participation restrictions meets the definition of disability; participants articulated a range of responses when asked about their disability identity, including (1) rejecting, (2) othering, (3) acknowledging, and (4) affirming. Findings may be indicative of structural and internalized ableism which can impede cancer care and survivorship. To support cancer survivors' transition to post-treatment life, cancer care providers should implement anti-ableist practices and engage in frank discussions about cancer's long-term impacts.

J	Adekoya, OB; Oliyide, JA				Adekoya, Oluwasegun B.; Oliyide, Johnson A.			Commodity and financial markets' fear before and during COVID-19 pandemic: Persistence and causality analyses	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						Market fear; Commodity and financial markets; Persistence; COVID-19 pandemic; Causality	TIME-SERIES; TESTS; RETURNS; POWER	Commodity and financial markets are leading points of attraction to investors, but are very sensitive to external crises, such as financial and health crises. An example is the overwhelming plunge in the prices of the assets being traded in most of these markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has raised market fear beyond what is historically known, thus calling for an empirical assessment of its degree of persistence. Interestingly, the issue of persistence in financial and commodity markets has not even been generally explored in the literature. Using fractional integration approaches, our findings show that all the considered market fear indices exhibit mean reversion before COVID-19 pandemic, implying that the effect of shocks is transitory. However, persistence is higher during the pandemic period, with fear indices of the gold market (GVZ), energy sector (VXXLE) and Eurocurrency market (EVZ) reaching the unit root zone. The Granger-causality test also reveals that equity market fear due to infectious diseases (EMV-ID) and global market fear (VIX) are responsible for the fear in virtually all other markets during the current COVID-19 pandemic period. Strong policy implications are associated with these findings.

However, it also stressed the magnitude of inequalities regarding accessing digital health. Using a scoping review, this article explores the potential benefits of digital technologies for the global population, with particular reference to people living with disabilities, using the autism community as a case study. We ultimately explore policies in Sweden, Australia, Canada, Estonia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to learn how policies can lay an inclusive foundation for digital health systems. We conclude that digital health ecosystems should be designed with health equity at the forefront to avoid deepening existing health inequalities. We call for a more sophisticated understanding of digital health literacy to better assess the readiness to adopt digital health innovations. Finally, people living with disabilities should be positioned at the center of digital health policy and innovations to ensure they are not left behind.

The impact of housing on refugees: an evidence synthesis	HOUSING STUDIES			English	Article						Refugee; asylum-seeker; resettlement; integration; exclusion; migration	ASYLUM-SEEKERS; MENTAL-HEALTH; LIVING-CONDITIONS; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; INTEGRATION; UK; NEIGHBORHOOD; EXPERIENCES; IMMIGRANTS; SETTLEMENT	Housing has always had a close association with refugees but despite this, the knowledge base about housing and its impact in the lives of refugees lacks cohesion. The accommodation of refugees tends to be connected with broader neo-liberal trends, alongside a general animosity towards refugees, culminating in an overt, or implied, 'hostile environment'. This paper synthesises the available evidence to understand several key issues in the settlement of refugees, including: the role and impact of housing systems and policies, the impact of housing quality, tenure, housing support workers and how the diversity of the refugee population is reflected in the evidence. We also point towards gaps in the knowledge base and call for housing studies scholars to focus on the plight faced by refugees in order to help challenge the wider structural inequalities which constrain their lives. In this discussion, our focus is the United Kingdom (UK), although the paper draws on literature from a wider international perspective.

Trichomoniasis, a new look at a common but neglected STI in African descendance population in the United States and the Black Diaspora. A review of its incidence, research prioritization, and the resulting health disparities	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Review						Trichomonas vaginalis; Trichomoniasis; STDs; Structural racism; The Black community; And African American women	OF-CARE TESTS; VAGINALIS INFECTION; RACIAL DISPARITIES; WOMEN; PREVALENCE; INEQUITIES; CULTURE; RISK; RACE	Structural racism plays a significant role in limited access to higher education, financial resources, employment opportunities, and high-quality healthcare for African Americans. The lack of healthcare equity and infrastructure has directly contributed to overall poor healthcare outcomes for the Black community. Studies have shown that adverse health outcomes such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are more prevalent in African Americans, regardless of their socioeconomic factors and lifestyles. For example, trichomoniasis, transmitted sexually by its etiological agent, Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis), predisposes those infected to co-infections with other STDs, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes, and other related infections. Our review showcases the impact of trichomoniasis on the health of the Black community with an emphasis on African American women. A critical examination of the socio-demographic history of Black people in the United States (US) is vital to illustrate the origin of past and current racial health disparities. Further, we expand the complex and nuanced conversation on the intersectionality of racism, health equity, and innovative epidemiological and biomedical research strategies needed to eradicate this global public health threat.

Factors influencing the stewardship activities of Antimicrobial Management Teams: a national cross-sectional survey	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION			English	Article						Antimicrobial stewardship; Health service research; Public health; Resource allocation		Background: The link between inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and the global threat of antimicrobial resistance is well documented. International strategies recommend antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes, with improvement interventions to safeguard antibiotics. Aim: This study sought to systematically evaluate the impact of multi-professional Antimicrobial Management Team (AMT) staff resource availability on stewardship activities. Methods: We conducted an on-line, cross-sectional survey of AMTs in each regional Health Board and the national specialist hospital in Scotland (N = 15). Responses were analysed descriptively, exploring observed relationships between variables to identify patterns. Findings: Results highlighted apparent variation in the levels of AMT resource availability across Scotland, not directly influenced by Health Board size, with some larger Health Boards having proportionately poorer AMT resource allocation. However, the range and frequency of activities to support AMS was not directly linked to either Health Board size or staff resource allocation, indicating a more complex inter-relationship between factors. Conclusions: There is apparent inequity in staff resource available for AMTs across Scotland, with significantly lower resource allocation in comparison with recommendations from other international studies. However, considering these survey findings with our earlier qualitative research indicates that leadership style and team member enthusiasm may be as, if not more, influential than resource availability on the scope of AMT activities. These findings have international relevance for hospital service managers considering the recruitment, training and ongoing support of AMTs, in order to maximize impact from a limited resource.

Modern contraceptive use can avert unintended pregnancy and its related problems. In Cameroon, the prevalence of modern contraceptive use is low. Therefore, this study investigated the individual/household and community-level predictors for modern contraceptive use among married women in Cameroon. Methods Data for this study were derived from the nationally representative 2018-2019 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey. Analysis was done on 6080 married women in the reproductive age group (15-49 y) using Stata version 14 software. Pearson chi(2) test and multilevel logistic regression analysis were conducted to examine the individual/household and community-level predictors of modern contraceptive use. Descriptive results were presented using frequencies and bar charts. Inferential results were presented using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The results show only 18.3% (95% CI 16.8 to 19.8) of married women in Cameroon use modern contraceptives. Women's age (45-49 y; aOR 0.22 [95% CI 0.12 to 0.39]), education level (secondary education; aOR 2.93 [95% CI 1.90 to 4.50]), occupation (skilled manual; aOR 1.46 [95% CI 1.01 to 2.11]), religion (Muslim; aOR 0.63 [95% CI 0.47 to 0.84]), wealth quintile (richest; aOR 2.22 [95% CI 1.35 to 3.64]) and parity (>= 5; aOR 3.59 [95% CI 2.61 to 4.94]) were significant individual/household-level predictors. Region (East; aOR 3.63 [95% CI 1.97 to 6.68]) was identified as a community-level predictor. Conclusions Modern contraceptive use among married women in Cameroon is low. Women's education and employment opportunities should be prioritized, as well as interventions for married women, ensuring equity in the utilization of modern contraceptives across regions.

In this paper, we attempt to create awareness about this specific form of inequality by qualitatively analyzing the experiences of 30 international students from India, in community and private colleges located in the Greater Toronto Area. Our study demonstrates that most participants faced multiple food vulnerabilities. In this regard, in addition to their internal characteristics, external circumstances have had profound impacts on their food insecurity, particularly the geographical context of the city in which they live. In turn, their food insecurity has influenced various aspects of their everyday lives, including housing, employment, and overall health and well-being. From a policy perspective, various levels of government, and especially the Canadian post-secondary educational institutions, must take a greater responsibility for assessing the specific needs of this marginalized group and providing necessary services.

We sought to characterise what is known about FRP in the UHC context and to identify evidence gaps to prioritise in future research. Design Scoping overview of reviews using the Arksey & O'Malley and Levac & Colquhoun framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. Data sources MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL-Plus and PAIS Index were systematically searched for studies published between 1 January 1995 and 20 July 2021. Eligibility criteria Records were screened by two independent reviewers in duplicate using the following criteria: (1) literature review; (2) focus on UHC achievement through FRP; (3) English or French language; (4) published after 1995 and (5) peer-reviewed. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers extracted data using a standard form and descriptive content analysis was performed to synthesise findings. Results 50 studies were included. Most studies were systematic reviews focusing on low-income and middle-income countries. Study periods spanned 1990 and 2020. While FRP was recognised as a dimension of UHC, it was rarely defined as a concept. Out-of-pocket, catastrophic and impoverishing health expenditures were most commonly used to measure FRP. Pooling arrangements, expansion of insurance coverage and financial incentives were the main interventions for achieving FRP. Evidence gaps pertained to the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and equity implications of efforts aimed at increasing FRP. Methodological gaps related to trade-offs between single-country and multicountry analyses; lack of process evaluations; inadequate mixed-methods evidence, disaggregated by relevant characteristics; lack of comparable and standardised measurement and short follow-up periods. Conclusions This scoping overview of reviews characterised what is known about FRP as a UHC dimension and found evidence gaps related to the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and equity implications of FRP interventions.

J	Rishworth, A; Elliott, S				Rishworth, Andrea; Elliott, Susan			Global Discourses and Local Disconnects: Gender, Aging, Health, and Well-Being in Uganda	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						aging; gender; feminist political ecology; life course; well-being	LIFE-COURSE APPROACH; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHICAL GERONTOLOGY; CHILDRENS; MEN; INTERSECTIONALITY; ENVIRONMENT; RETHINKING; CHALLENGES; DIFFERENCE	Women comprise a larger share of the world's aging population. Because older women occupy two stigmatized statuses, they are deemed a particularly disadvantaged group requiring attention. International organizations claim that the feminization of population aging has the potential to become one of the biggest challenges to gender equality of the twenty-first century due to cumulative impacts of inequalities in later life. Yet, discussions uncritically assume that older women are a permanent minority, ignoring the possibility that the direction of gender inequality or its absence varies. This article engages with these contradictions by examining links between gender, aging, and inequalities. Drawing on human geography perspectives of gender, embodiment, and temporalities, interviews with elderly men and women (n = 53) and key informants (n = 34) in Uganda demonstrate that old age health and well-being is an amalgamation of gendered experiences and social dynamics (re)produced and (re)articulated across the life course. Illuminating how gender inequalities are embodied through diverse spatial and temporal relations exposes a counternarrative to global discourses, revealing that gender and aging are experienced and navigated in sometimes unexpected and contradictory ways. Putting forth a feminist political ecology life course perspective highlights needed geographic attention to antecedent place processes that relationally co-constitute gender - age inequalities.

Twenty-first century bioarchaeology: Taking stock and moving forward	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; ethics; graduate curriculum; identity; infectious disease; migration; violence	COVERAGE NEANDERTHAL GENOME; AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION; MEDIEVAL DANISH VILLAGE; HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS; HISTORY TRADE-OFFS; LATER STONE-AGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ANCIENT-DNA; DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS; LIFE-HISTORY	This article presents outcomes from a Workshop entitled "Bioarchaeology: Taking Stock and Moving Forward," which was held at Arizona State University (ASU) on March 6-8, 2020. Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the School of Human Evolution and Social Change (ASU), and the Center for Bioarchaeological Research (CBR, ASU), the Workshop's overall goal was to explore reasons why research proposals submitted by bioarchaeologists, both graduate students and established scholars, fared disproportionately poorly within recent NSF Anthropology Program competitions and to offer advice for increasing success. Therefore, this Workshop comprised 43 international scholars and four advanced graduate students with a history of successful grant acquisition, primarily from the United States. Ultimately, we focused on two related aims: (1) best practices for improving research designs and training and (2) evaluating topics of contemporary significance that reverberate through history and beyond as promising trajectories for bioarchaeological research. Among the former were contextual grounding, research question/hypothesis generation, statistical procedures appropriate for small samples and mixed qualitative/quantitative data, the salience of Bayesian methods, and training program content. Topical foci included ethics, social inequality, identity (including intersectionality), climate change, migration, violence, epidemic disease, adaptability/plasticity, the osteological paradox, and the developmental origins of health and disease. Given the profound changes required globally to address decolonization in the 21st century, this concern also entered many formal and informal discussions.

Globally, the occurrence of periodontal diseases such as gingivitis and chronic periodontitis is high among Indigenous people. This systematic review aims to quantify, at a global level, the prevalence of periodontal disease among Indigenous populations compared to non-Indigenous populations. Methods: This review will only consider studies that have reported the prevalence (%) of periodontal disease among Indigenous and compared against non-Indigenous populations. Studies that have no comparative population or data only on one particular population or lack of data on periodontal clinical assessment will be excluded. An electronic search will be conducted using keywords and appropriate MeSH terms across several databases capturing both published and unpublished articles. The search will be conducted from the time of database inception to February 2021. After the initial search, duplicates will be removed, and the remaining titles and abstracts will be assessed for eligibility. The full text of eligible studies will be assessed by two independent reviewers who will also complete the critical appraisals and data extraction. Outcomes measures would be the mean prevalence (%) and standard deviation of periodontal disease among Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. From the selected studies, we will conduct a random-effects meta-analysis using standardized mean difference as the effect measure. Forest plots will be used for the visualization of differences in the prevalence of periodontitis. A subgroup analysis will be conducted based on the definition of periodontitis, age, publication type, and geographical location. Heterogeneity among studies will be assessed by I-2 and chi-square test. Egger's test and funnel plots will be used to assess publication bias. Discussion: Our systematic review and meta-analysis will facilitate an increased understanding of the magnitude of periodontal disease inequalities that exist globally for Indigenous populations through pooled prevalence estimates. The findings will be helpful to design selective targeted preventive and interventional strategies for periodontal disease for reducing oral health inequalities at a global level.

High out-of-pocket medical expenditure contributes to under-five malaria mortality by discouraging care-seeking and use of effective anti-malarials in the poorest households. The significant inequity in child health outcomes in Nigeria stresses the need to evaluate the outcomes of potential interventions across socioeconomic lines. Methods Using a decision tree model, an extended cost-effectiveness analysis was done to determine the effects of subsidies covering the direct and indirect costs of case management of under-five malaria in Nigeria. This analysis estimates the number of child deaths averted, out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure averted, cases of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) averted, and cost of implementation. An optimization analysis was also done to determine how to optimally allocate money across wealth groups using different combinations of interventions. Results Fully subsidizing direct medical, non-medical, and indirect costs could annually avert over 19,000 under-five deaths, 8600 cases of CHE, and US$187 million in OOP spending. Per US$1 million invested, this corresponds to an annual reduction of 76 under-five deaths, 34 cases of CHE, and over US$730,000 in OOP expenditure. Due to low initial treatment coverage in poorer socioeconomic groups, health and financial-risk protection benefits would be pro-poor, with the poorest 40% of Nigerians accounting for 72% of all deaths averted, 55% of all OOP expenditure averted, and 74% of all cases of CHE averted. Subsidies targeted to the poor would see greater benefits per dollar spent than broad, non-targeted subsidies. In an optimization scenario, the strategy of fully subsidizing direct medical costs would be dominated by a partial subsidy of direct medical costs as well as a full subsidy of direct medical, nonmedical, and indirect costs. Conclusion Subsidizing case management of under-five malaria for the poorest and most vulnerable would reduce illness-related impoverishment and child mortality in Nigeria while preserving limited financial resources. This study is an example of how focusing a targeted policy-intervention on a single, high-burden disease can yield large health and financial-risk protection benefits in a low and middle-income country context and address equity consideration in evidence-informed policymaking.

A national-scale study from the Global South	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Criminology; Green infrastructure; Tree canopy; Urban parks; Violence	TREE CANOPY; INNER-CITY; URBAN; HEALTH; ENVIRONMENT; VIOLENCE; RATES; AGGRESSION; BALTIMORE; EXPOSURE	Assumptions about the link between green space and crime mitigation are informed by literature that overwhelmingly originates in the Global North. Little is known about the association between green spaces and crime in the Global South. We utilized 10 years of precinct-level crime statistics (n = 1152) over South Africa, a global crime hotspot, to test the hypothesis that green space is associated with reduced crime rates. We found that, after controlling for a number of socio-demographic confounders (unemployment, income, age, education, land use and population density), for every 1% increase in total green space there is a 1.2% (0.7 to 1.7%;95% confidence interval) decrease in violent crime, and 1.3% (0.8 to 1.8%) decrease in property crime, with no effect on sexual crimes. However, the direction of the association changed for property crimes when exploring the effect of green space characteristics including tree cover and park accessibility. Property crimes increase by 0.4% (0.1 to 0.7%) with a percentage increase in tree cover, and by 0.9% (0.5 to 1.3%) with every kilometer increase in proximity to a public park. Further research, including experimental studies, is needed to better isolate causal mechanisms behind crime-green space associations, especially considering that green space may map to race and income inequality and that there may be more crime reporting in affluent areas. Nevertheless, our results provide a complementary contribution to the evidence from the Global North, highlighting the need for more nuanced definitions of green space and its characteristics when considering links to crime. When viewed in light of the broader suite of ecosystem services provided by green space, our results support urban greening as a major strategy towards achieving just and sustainable cities and towns.

J	Pykett, J				Pykett, Jessica			Spatialising happiness economics: Global metrics, urban politics, and embodied technologies	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						cities; digital; emotions; governance; happiness economics; well-being	GREEN SPACE; MENTAL-HEALTH; HAPPY; STRESS; POLICY; NEUROSCIENCE; EXPERIENCE; CONTEXT; PLACE; APP	Happiness has become a high-profile goal for national governments, city authorities, and technology developers finding new ways to map and measure emotions through happiness economics, urban management, and digital emotion-sensing. This paper advances critical geographical analysis of the neglected rationales, mechanisms, and implications of promoting the emotion of happiness. Researchers, policy-makers, and publics alike are intrigued and troubled by how a growing concern with mapping and monitoring human happiness can co-occur with increasing levels of social inequality, human suffering, anxiety, and sadness. The paper outlines the intersection between three key trajectories (economisation, spatialisation, and technologisation) in order to demonstrate how particular assumptions about space, time, scale, and subjectivity are implied in the framing of happiness as an objective scientific construct to be measured, and as a problem of government. These trajectories combine to create what I term a new spatial science of emotions, which is yet to be defined, empirically documented, and critically analysed. It considers what kind of economic futures and contested knowledge practices are laid out by this new spatial science of emotions. By bringing together insights from critical economic geographies of neuroscientific and behavioural forms of governance, geographies of well-being, and social theories of embodied technologies, the paper challenges researchers to shift attention from subjective well-being to public well-being.

A scoping review of the guidance on North-South research partnerships	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Review						North-South research partnerships; principles; guidelines; scoping review	HEALTH RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS; ETHICS	At their best, research partnerships provide a mechanism to optimize each partner's strengths, make scientific discoveries and achieve development goals. Each partner stands to gain from the relationship and perceives it to be fair. However, partnerships between institutions in the global North and the global South have been beleaguered by structural inequalities and power imbalances, and Northern stakeholders have been criticized for perpetuating paternalistic or neo-colonial behaviours. As part of efforts to redress imbalances and achieve equity and mutual benefit, various principles, guidelines, frameworks and models for partnership have been developed. This scoping review maps the literature and summarizes key features of the guidelines for North-South research partnerships. The review was conducted between October 2020 and January 2021. Three academic journal databases and Google were searched, and additional resources were identified through a hand search of reference lists and expert recommendation. Twenty-two guidelines were identified published between 1994 and 2021 and originating predominantly in the fields of international development and global health. The themes addressed within the guidelines were aggregated using NVivo qualitative analysis software to code the content of each guideline. Topics featuring most prominently in the guidelines were: partner roles, responsibilities and ways of working; capacity strengthening; motivation and goals; resource contributions; agenda setting and study design; governance structures and institutional agreements; dissemination; respect for affected populations; data handling and ownership; funding and long-term commitments. The current study reinforces many of the themes from two recent scoping reviews specific to the field of global health, but gaps remain, which need to be addressed: Southern stakeholders continue to be under-represented in guideline development, and there is limited evidence of how guidelines are used in practice. Further exploration is needed of Southern stakeholder priorities and whether and how guidelines are operationalized.

Interactive visualization methods allow for multiple related facets such as numerous risk factors to be studied simultaneously, leading to data insights through exploring trends and patterns from complex big health care data. The technique presents a powerful tool that can be used in combination with statistical analysis for knowledge discovery, hypothesis generation and testing, and decision support. Objective: The primary objective of this scoping review is to describe and summarize the evidence of interactive visualization applications, methods, and tools being used in population health and health services research (HSR) and their subdomains in the last 15 years, from January 1, 2005, to March 30, 2019. Our secondary objective is to describe the use cases, metrics, frameworks used, settings, target audience, goals, and co-design of applications. Methods: We adapted standard scoping review guidelines with a peer-reviewed search strategy: 2 independent researchers at each stage of screening and abstraction, with a third independent researcher to arbitrate conflicts and validate findings. A comprehensive abstraction platform was built to capture the data from diverse bodies of literature, primarily from the computer science and health care sectors. After screening 11,310 articles, we present findings from 56 applications from interrelated areas of population health and HSR, as well as their subdomains such as epidemiologic surveillance, health resource planning, access, and use and costs among diverse clinical and demographic populations. Results: In this companion review to our earlier systematic synthesis of the literature on visual analytics applications, we present findings in 6 major themes of interactive visualization applications developed for 8 major problem categories. We found a wide application of interactive visualization methods, the major ones being epidemiologic surveillance for infectious disease, resource planning, health service monitoring and quality, and studying medication use patterns. The data sources included mostly secondary administrative and electronic medical record data. In addition, at least two-thirds of the applications involved participatory co-design approaches while introducing a distinct category, embedded research, within co-design initiatives. These applications were in response to an identified need for data-driven insights into knowledge generation and decision support. We further discuss the opportunities stemming from the use of interactive visualization methods in studying global health; inequities, including social determinants of health; and other related areas. We also allude to the challenges in the uptake of these methods. Conclusions: Visualization in health has strong historical roots, with an upward trend in the use of these methods in population health and HSR. Such applications are being fast used by academic and health care agencies for knowledge discovery, hypotheses generation, and decision support.

To identify factors correlated with the incidence and mortality from COVID-19 and investigate syndemic situations at the global level. Method. An ecologic study of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths was performed using information collected from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control in 2019 and 2020. World Bank indicators and information obtained from Worldometer Coronavirus were used to characterize the countries. Descriptive analyses and correlations between independent variables were performed, followed by multiple linear regression analysis to identify factors correlated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results. Data were obtained for 185 countries. Mean case incidence was 16 482/1,000 population, whereas mean COVID-19 mortality was 291/1,000 population, with the highest and lowest rates recorded in North America and East Asia and Pacific respectively. A positive correlation was identified between incidence rate and percent population aged 15 to 64 years, urban population, inequality measured by the Gini coefficient, and six out of the seven regions analyzed (except East Asia and Pacific). Mortality rate was negatively correlated with population aged 0 to 14 years and positively correlated with urban population, inequality measured by the Gini coefficient, and all regions analyzed except East Asia and Pacific. Conclusions. COVID-19 morbidity and mortality were correlated with the burden of chronic diseases, aging population, and low capacity of healthcare services for testing and providing hospital beds, a scenario complicated by social inequality in countries and regions, indicating a syndemic effect.

Study Design: This was a cross-sectional design. This study used the 2018 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN) public-use file to examine RN employment and earnings. Methods: Our study population included a sample of 15,373 RNs who were employed at least 1000 hours in nursing in the past year and active in patient care. Characteristics such as race/ethnicity, type of RN degree completed, census region, and union status were included. Multiple regression analyses examined the effect of these characteristics on wages. Logistic regression was used to predict RN employment in LTC settings. Results: RNs in LTC experienced lower wages compared with those in non-LTC settings, yet this difference was not associated with racial/ethnic or international educational differences. Among RNs working in LTC, lower wages were associated with part-time work, less experience, lack of union representation, and regional wage differences. Conclusion: Because RNs in LTC earn lower wages than RNs in other settings, policies to minimize pay inequities are needed to support the RN workforce caring for frail older adults.

Post pandemic, our vision for Exercise Science is one of a maturing scientific discipline reaching outwards from a base of strong empirical evidence to have a profound and sustained positive global impact on health. In each of the three main areas of the discipline - research, teaching, and professional practice - a new and distinctive approach is needed. We propose 12 points of action, in no particular order, for a). quality, rigour, and professional standing, and b). reach, relevance, and public engagement and make numerous suggestions for action and change. We encourage the teachers, researchers and practitioners of Exercise Science to consider and act on these recommendations. We hope that this manifesto can help create a shared sense of purpose amongst the global Exercise Science community and further the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion. To act on these principles, we need to cultivate a discipline that encourages more women, people who experience racism and other forms of discrimination, and people with a disability to become involved in the discipline.

If psychosocial processes at the individual and societal levels correspond, associations between SSS and SROH should be higher among adults in countries with higher income inequality, and psychosocial stress should be a more important mediator of these associations. We used multigroup structural equation models to analyse cross-sectional data from the International Food Policy Study of adults (n = 22,824) in Australia, Canada, Mexico, the UK and the United States. Associations between SSS and SROH were not higher in more unequal countries, nor was psychosocial stress a more important mediator of these associations. Inequities in SROH in more unequal countries may not predominantly reflect stress-related pathways of social status differentiation.	[Olstad, Dana Lee; Nejatinamini, Sara; Campbell, David J.

This study investigated whether the observed decreasing 28-day mortality following an incident AMI in Denmark from 1987 to 2016 varied geographically at municipality level after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics. Methods A register-based cohort study design was used to investigate 28-day mortality among individuals with an incident AMI. Global spatial autocorrelation (within sub-periods) was analysed at municipality level using Moran's I. Analysis of spatio-temporal autocorrelation before and after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics was performed using logistic regression and conditional autoregressive models with inference in a Bayesian setting. Results In total, 368,839 individuals with incident AMI were registered between 1987 and 2016 in Denmark; 128,957 incident AMIs were fatal. The 28-day mortality decreased over time at national level with an odds ratio of 0.788 (95% credible interval (0.784, 0.792)) per 5-year period after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. The decrease in the 28-day mortality was geographically unequally distributed across the country and in a geographical region in northern Jutland, the 28-day mortality decreased significantly slower (4-12%) than at national level. Conclusions During the period from 1987 to 2016, the 28-day mortality following an incident AMI decreased substantially in Denmark. However, in a local geographical region, the 28-day mortality decreased significantly slower than in the rest of the country both before and after adjusting for sociodemographic differences. Efforts should be made to keep geographical trend inequalities in the 28-day mortality to a minimum.

Difficulty and help with activities of daily living among older adults living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multi-country population-based study	BMC GERIATRICS			English	Article						Activities of daily living; Older adults; Live alone; COVID-19; Domiciliary care	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL SUPPORT; MENTAL-HEALTH; MORTALITY; PEOPLE	Background Older adults who live alone and have difficulties in activities of daily living (ADLs) may have been more vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about pandemic-related changes in ADL assistance (such as home care, domiciliary care) and its international variation. We examined international patterns and changes in provision of ADL assistance, and related these to country-level measures including national income and health service expenditure. Methods We analysed data covering 29 countries from three longitudinal cohort studies (Health and Retirement Study, English Longitudinal Study of Aging, and Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe). Eligible people were aged >= 50 years and living alone. Outcomes included ADL difficulty status (assessed via six basic ADLs and five instrumental ADLs) and receipt of ADL assistance. Wealth-related inequality and need-related inequity in ADL assistance were measured using Erreygers' corrected concentration index (ECI). Correlations were estimated between prevalence/inequality/inequity in ADL assistance and national health-related indicators. We hypothesized these measures would be associated with health system factors such as affordability and availability of ADL assistance, as well as active ageing awareness. Results During COVID-19, 18.4% of older adults living alone reported ADL difficulties (ranging from 8.8% in Switzerland to 29.2% in the USA) and 56.8% of those reporting difficulties received ADL assistance (ranging from 38.7% in the UK to 79.8% in Lithuania). Females were more likely to receive ADL assistance than males in 16/29 countries; the sex gap increased further during the pandemic. Wealth-related ECIs indicated socioeconomic equality in ADL assistance within 24/39 countries before the pandemic, and significant favouring of the less wealthy in 18/29 countries during the pandemic. Needs-related ECIs indicated less equity in assistance with ADLs during the pandemic than before. Our hypotheses on the association between ADL provision measures and health system factors were confirmed before COVID-19, but unexpectedly disconfirmed during COVID-19. Conclusion This study revealed an unequal (and in some countries, partly needs-mismatched) response from countries to older adults living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings might inform future research about, and policies for, older adults living alone, particularly regarding social protection responses during crises.

The 2nd Annual US Celebration of World Hospice and Palliative Care Day: A virtual coming together to support equity in palliative care access	PALLIATIVE & SUPPORTIVE CARE			English	Article						Global palliative care; Palliative care; Supportive care; Virtual conference; World Hospice and Palliative Care Day		Objective On October 5-6, 2021, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Supportive Care Service and Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences hosted the 2nd Annual United States (US) Celebration of World Hospice and Palliative Care Day (WHPCD). The purpose of this article is to describe the event within the broader context of the international WHPCD theme: "Leave No One Behind - Equity in Access to Palliative Care." We reflect on lessons learned in anticipation of the 3rd annual conference to be held October 3-4, 2022. Methods Description of the 2nd annual event, conference planning team reflection, and attendee evaluation responses. Results The Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance launched WHPCD in 2005 as an annual unified day of action to celebrate and support hospice and palliative care around the world. The 2021 US-based innovative virtual conference featured 37 interprofessional hospice and palliative care specialists and patient and family caregiver speakers across 11 diverse sessions with a focus on health equity and COVID-19 considerations. Two primary aims continue to guide the event: community building and wisdom sharing at the intersection of art and science. 278 registrants from at least 14 countries and 21 different states across the US joined the program, which served as a global debriefing for hospice and palliative care workers from diverse settings, contexts, and disciplines. Significance of results The US WHPCD Celebration creates a virtual coming together for collective reflection on hospice and palliative care delivery amid vast changes in clinical practice, research, and policy, both locally and globally. In addition, our goal to ensure an internationally relevant, culturally inclusive, and multidisciplinary agenda will continue to draw increased participation worldwide during future annual events.

Brandon			International migrants' right to sexual and reproductive health care	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						health care access; international migrants; migrant women; non-discrimination; right to life; sexual and reproductive health and rights		International migration puts people's sexual and reproductive health (SRH), particularly those of women and children, at increased risk. However, many international migrants are denied access to timely and adequate SRH information, goods, and services by governments and/or service providers. This article reviews relevant international human rights treaties to argue that the barriers faced by migrants in accessing SRH care constitute violations of international law. It is well established that migrants are guaranteed access to SRH care as a part of their right to health, as well as the rights enjoyed by vulnerable populations. Increasingly, hindrance of migrants' access to SRH care is also recognized as a threat to their rights to life and equality with non-migrants. The case of Toussaint v Canada illustrates how governments may be held accountable by human rights treaty monitoring bodies when they fail to respect and fulfill migrants' right to SRH care.

Structural racism, the reinforcement of racial and ethnic discrimination via policy, provides a framework for understanding disparities in health outcomes like COVID-19 infection. Residential racial and economic segregation is one indicator of structural racism. Little attention has been paid to the relationship of infection to relative overall concentrations of risk (i.e., segregation of the most privileged from the most disadvantaged). We used ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression models to evaluate the relationship between racial and economic segregation, measured by the Index of Concentration at the Extremes, and COVID-19 cases in Louisiana. We found a significant global association between racial segregation and cumulative COVID-19 case rate in Louisiana and variation across the state during the study period. The northwest and central regions exhibited a strong negative relationship indicating greater risk in areas with high concentrations of Black residents. On the other hand, the southeastern part of the state exhibited more neutral or positive relationships indicating greater risk in areas with high concentrations of White residents. Our findings that the relationship between racial segregation and COVID-19 cases varied within a state further support evidence that social and political determinants, not biological, drive racial disparities. Small area measures and measures of polarization provide localized information better suited to tailoring public health policy according to the dynamics of communities at the census tract level, which may lead to better health outcomes.

This study aimed to explore the temporal trend of and factors associated with access to residential toilets among the middle-aged and elderly in rural China from 2011 to 2018. Methods This study used the 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018 data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). CHARLS was conducted among adults aged >= 45 years in 28 provinces of China. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regressions for data analysis. Results We found that residential toilet coverage increased by about 6% among population aged >= 45 years in rural China from 2011 to 2018. The coverage of flushable toilets and toilets with seats among this sector of the population increased by more than 10% during this period. We also found that being female, higher levels of education, higher annual per capita household consumption, having running water in the residence, larger household size, and better health status were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of residential toilet ownership among population aged >= 45 years in rural China. Conclusions China made progress in sanitation improvement in rural areas from 2011 to 2018. However, considering the current coverage levels of residential toilets and the vulnerable subgroups who are more prone to toilet deprivation in rural areas, we suggest to the government to implement further targeted toilet improvement interventions to ensure universal coverage of sanitation facilities for the whole of the Chinese population.

Research education is a key site where more democratic and equitable processes of knowledge creation can take place. Drawing on de Sousa Santos' argument for epistemic justice, this article discusses research education as embedded in global knowledge relations, through introducing the concepthistories of knowledges. This concept interrogates the multiple sets of epistemic relations regarding the history of knowledge, the history of science, knowledge movements, and knowledge hierarchies and conditions. Data were collected through surveys, interviews and workshop observations with research candidates and supervisors from Australia, Africa, Asia and Latin America. Findings show that participants demonstrated boundary-crossing awareness of potential knowledge inclusion and creation in non-linear, multilingual and transcultural ways and from perspectives of the Global South. Extending de Sousa Santos' concept of ecologies of knowledges, we apply the conceptual dynamics of histories of knowledges to propose a micro-, meso- and macro-historical approach to research education that centres around reconceptualisation of epistemic relations and repositioning of research candidates and supervisors.

J	Philbin, MM; Perez-Brumer, A				Philbin, Morgan M.; Perez-Brumer, Amaya			Promise, perils and cautious optimism: the next frontier in long-acting modalities for the treatment and prevention of HIV	CURRENT OPINION IN HIV AND AIDS			English	Review						health equity; HIV prevention and care; long-acting antiretroviral therapy and preexposure prophylaxis; long-acting injectable; therapeutic innovation	DAPIVIRINE VAGINAL RING; PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; UNITED-STATES; OPEN-LABEL; TREATMENT ADHERENCE; VIRAL SUPPRESSION; WOMEN; INFECTION; MEN; HIV/AIDS	Purpose of review This paper provides a critical review of recent therapeutic advances in long-acting (LA) modalities for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment and prevention. Recent findings LA injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been approved in the United States, Canada and Europe; the United States also has approved LA injectable preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and the World Health Organization has recommended the vaginal PrEP ring. Current LA PrEP modalities in clinical trials include injections, films, rings, and implants; LA ART modalities in trials include subcutaneous injections and long-term oral pills. Although LA modalities hold incredible promise, global availability is inhibited by long-standing multilevel perils including declining multilateral funding, patent protections and lack of political will. Once available, access and uptake are limited by factors such as insurance coverage, clinic access, labor markets, stigma, and structural racism and sexism. These must be addressed to facilitate equitable access for all. There have been tremendous recent advances in the efficacy of LA ART and PrEP modalities, providing renewed hope that 'ending the HIV epidemic' is within reach. However, pervasive socio-structural inequities limit the promise of LA modalities, highlighting the need for cautious optimism in light of the embedded inequities in the trajectory of research, development, and population-level implementation.

A district-level analysis was conducted to identify socio-demographic risk factors that drive the large variations in COVID-19 mortality and related health outcomes, as of 22 January 2021. Data on COVID-19 extracted from relevant reports and websites of the Ministry of Health and Population of Nepal, and the National Population and Housing Census and the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey were the main data sources for the district-level socio-demographic characteristics. We calculated the COVID-19 incidence, recovered cases, and deaths per 100,000 population, then estimated the associations with the risk factors using regression models. COVID-19 outcomes were positively associated with population density. A higher incidence of COVID-19 was associated with districts with a higher percentage of overcrowded households and without access to handwashing facilities. Adult literacy rate was negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence. Increased mortality was significantly associated with a higher obesity prevalence in women and a higher smoking prevalence in men. Access to health care facilities reduced mortality. Population density was the most important driver behind the large variations in COVID-19 outcomes. This study identifies critical risk factors of COVID-19 outcomes, including population density, crowding, education, and hand hygiene, and these factors should be considered to address inequities in the burden of COVID-19 across districts.

J	Willemsen, MC; Mons, U; Fernandez, E				Willemsen, Marc C.; Mons, Ute; Fernandez, Esteve			Tobacco control in Europe: progress and key challenges	TOBACCO CONTROL			English	Review						public policy; global health; socioeconomic status	COUNTRIES	We discuss progress made with respect to reducing the burden of disease caused by tobacco use within the WHO European Region and outline major issues and challenges regarding ongoing implementation of tobacco control policy. Although 50 of 53 countries in the WHO European Region are parties to the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC), smoking prevalence varies tremendously between European countries. While smoking rates are decreasing slowly, faster declines among smokers with a higher socioeconomic status are leading to growing inequalities in tobacco use. Governments in Europe increasingly formulate visions of 'tobacco-free' societies and it is encouraging that the European Commission aims to achieve a tobacco-free Europe in 2040 as part of its Europe's Beating Cancer Plan. While core WHO FCTC measures still have to be fully implemented in many European countries, some countries are implementing more advanced measures such as plain packaging, banning of characterising flavours from tobacco products, tobacco retailer licensing and extensions of smoking bans into spaces such as cars, outdoor areas and public streets. Remaining challenges include protecting tobacco control policymaking from tobacco industry interference, insufficient dedicated budget for scientific research and the need for Europe-wide monitoring data on use of tobacco and nicotine products.

Recently, it has provided guidance for alternative tobacco products, such as the waterpipe. Waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) is prevalent worldwide and policies to address it need to take into consideration its specificities as a mode of smoking. In parallel, a growing body of literature points to the potential of evidence-based tobacco control policies to increase health inequities. This paper updates a previous global review of waterpipe tobacco policies and adds an equity lens to assess their impact on health inequities. Methods We reviewed policies that address WTS in 90 countries, including 10 with state-owned tobacco companies; 47 were included in our final analysis. We relied primarily on the Tobacco-Free Kids organisation's Tobacco Control Laws website, providing access to tobacco control laws globally. We categorised country tobacco policies by the clarity with which they defined and addressed waterpipe tobacco in relation to nine FCTC articles. We used the PROGRESS (Place of residence, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status and Social capital) framework for the equity analysis, by reviewing equity considerations referenced in the policies of each country and including prevalence data disaggregated by equity axis and country where available. Results Our results revealed very limited attention to waterpipe policies overall, and to equity in such policies, and highlight the complexity of regulating WTS. We recommend that WTS policies and surveillance centre equity as a goal. Conclusions Our recommendations can inform global policies to reduce WTS and its health consequences equitably across population groups.

J	Edwards, R; Hoek, J; Karreman, N; Gilmore, A				Edwards, Richard; Hoek, Janet; Karreman, Nancy; Gilmore, Anna			Evaluating tobacco industry 'transformation': a proposed rubric and analysis	TOBACCO CONTROL			English	Article						end game; tobacco industry; global health; electronic nicotine delivery devices	CIGARETTE-SMOKING; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; MENTHOL CIGARETTES; LOW-INCOME; INEQUALITIES; PREVALENCE; RATES; TAX; AGE	Some tobacco companies claim they are 'transforming' by adopting harm reduction goals or even seeking to achieve a 'smokefree' world. What characterises transformation and whether companies can or are transforming is unclear. Nevertheless, such claims are gaining traction. We critically investigated tobacco industry transformation by exploring the definition and criteria for evaluating transformation, and assessed whether transformation is occurring and feasible. Companies' transformation claims centre on increasing sales of new tobacco and nicotine products like e-cigarettes ('new products') with little attention to reducing sales of more hazardous smoked and oral products ('conventional products'). We define a transforming tobacco company as one demonstrating substantial, rapid and verifiable progress towards eliminating the production and sale of conventional tobacco products within 5 years in all markets where it operates. We found no evidence any tobacco company is meeting the three essential criteria of rapidly progressing towards eliminating conventional products, ceasing to obstruct effective tobacco control measures and taking action to minimise smoking uptake and disparities. While some companies are developing new product portfolios, their actions are more consistent with profit maximisation than eliminating conventional product use. This approach is best described as 'pseudo-transformation', designed to delay implementation of effective tobacco control policies. In addition, our analysis suggests replacing conventional products with new nicotine products is unlikely to be a viable long-term business model. Public health practitioners should not rely on tobacco industry claims but should lead the transformation debate, establish credible definitions and criteria, and monitor and assess whether transformation is occurring.

Tobacco control's experience in managing conflicts of interest is increasingly recognised as relevant for addressing other non-communicable disease epidemics. At the same time, the wider environmental and social harms of tobacco-and other unhealthy commodity industries-underline the potential for enhanced strategic collaboration across health, development and environmental agendas. Such collaboration is increasingly necessary to address key challenges shared across tobacco control and related policy spheres, including the extent to which the harms of tobacco (and other unhealthy commodities) are underpinned by economic and social inequities. Here we demonstrate the relevance of a commercial determinants of health perspective, both for advancing tobacco control and for linking it with health and development more broadly. This perspective is already evident in many areas of research, policy and advocacy, where innovative approaches support the development of closer links with actors in related fields. We draw on the concepts of policy coordination, coherence and integration to show how tobacco control can advance key strategic goals via information sharing, complementary approaches to common problems and collective action with other related movements. Embrace of a commercial determinants perspective will help in building on tobacco control's successes and reorienting strategies in other sectors to more effectively manage health risks and promote sustainable development.

J	Zyoud, S				Zyoud, Shaher			Mapping and Visualizing Global Knowledge on Intermittent Water Supply Systems	WATER			English	Article						intermittent water supply; sustainability; climate changes; transition; health risks; optimization	DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS; DRINKING-WATER; CONTAMINANT INTRUSION; SCIENTIFIC-RESEARCH; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DECISION-MAKING; GOOGLE-SCHOLAR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HUBLI-DHARWAD; HUMAN HEALTH	Intermittent water supply systems (IWSSs) are prevalent in most developing countries and some developed ones. Their usage is driven by necessity rather than as a principal objective, mostly due to technical and economic deficiencies. Major health risks and socio-economic inequities are associated with such systems. Their impacts are aggravated by climate changes and the COVID-19 crisis. These are likely to have profound implications on progress toward advancing sustainable development goals (SDGs). Motivated by providing a comprehensive overview of global knowledge on IWSSs, the present work proposed to track and analyze research works on IWSSs utilizing bibliometric techniques and visual mapping tools. This includes investigating the trends and growth trajectories of research works on IWSSs and analyzing the various approaches proposed to expand our understanding with respect to the management, modeling, optimization, and impacts of IWSSs. The national and international contributions and collaboration figures are further analyzed at country, institution, author, and source levels. This analysis indicates that research works conducted on IWSSs have certain expectations in terms of productivity (total global productivity; 197 documents). The United States was the best country in terms of productivity (58 documents; 29.4%), while the Water Switzerland journal was the most productive journal (19 documents; 9.6%). The impacts of IWSSs on health and well-being have attracted considerable attention. The outcomes showed deep and justified worries in relation to the transition from intermittent to continuous supply, equity, and mitigating the health risks associated with IWSSs in the foreseen future. The utilization of artificial intelligence techniques and expert systems will drive and shape future IWSS-related research activities. Therefore, investments in this regard are crucial.

To understand the perceived causes of SH in the Jordanian university context, we conducted focus groups (n = 6) and participatory data collection with students (n = 317) and interviews with staff and administrators (n = 5) at a public university.

We demonstrate that observed heatwave trends in the past four decades were most pronounced in the lowest-quartile income region of the world resulting in >40% higher exposure from 2010 to 2019 compared to the highest-quartile income region. Lower-income regions have reduced adaptative capacity to warming, which compounds the impacts of higher heatwave exposure. We also show that individual contiguous heatwaves engulfed up to 2.5-fold larger areas in the recent decade (2010-2019) as compared to the 1980s. Widespread heatwaves can overwhelm the power grid and nullify the electricity dependent adaptation efforts, with significant implications even in regions with higher adaption capacity. Furthermore, we compare projected global heatwave exposure using per-capita gross domestic product as an indicator of adaptation capacity. Hypothesized rapid adaptation in high-income regions yields limited changes in heatwave exposure through the 21st century. By contrast, lagged adaptation in the lower-income region translates to escalating heatwave exposure and increased heat-stress inequality. The lowest-quartile income region is expected to experience 1.8- to 5-fold higher heatwave exposure than each higher income region from 2060 to 2069. This inequality escalates by the end of the century, with the lowest-quartile income region experiencing almost as much heatwave exposure as the three higher income regions combined from 2090 to 2099. Our results highlight the need for global investments in adaptation capabilities of low-income countries to avoid major climate-driven human disasters in the 21st century.

Investigating inequalities in childhood wasting is essential for designing efficient programs and interventions, but no related evidence exists in Guinea. This study aimed to examine the trends in the prevalence of childhood wasting and the extent of sex, socio-economic and geographic-based disparities in Guinea. Methods Data from the 1999, 2005 and 2012 Guinea Demographic and Health Surveys and the 2016 Guinea Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, with a total of 16 137 children <5 y of age were included for analysis. For inequality analysis, we used the 2019 updated World Health Organization Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software. Inequality was measured using four summary measures (difference [D], population attributable risk [PAR], ratio [R] and population attributable fraction [PAF]) for five equity stratifiers (economic status, education, place of residence, sex and subnational region). We computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the points estimates to measure statistical significance. Results The findings revealed a pro-rich (R=1.68 [95% CI 1.11 to 2.24]), pro-urban (PAR=-1.04 [95% CI -1.90 to -0.18]) and subnational region (D=8.11 [95% CI 4.85 to 11.36]) inequalities in childhood wasting across all surveys. Except in 2005, education-based disparities (PAF=-18.2 [95% CI -36.10 to -0.26]) were observed across all survey years, but not sex-based disparities. An approximately constant inequality pattern was seen across all dimensions. Conclusions This study showed inequalities in childhood wasting in Guinea with a disproportionately higher risk of wasting among children from disadvantaged subpopulations/mothers, including uneducated, poorest/poor, rural residents and regions. Policies that target disadvantaged populations need to be considered in order to ensure social protection, access to a wholesome diet and universal and quality health services.

Given an emphasis on equity in access to diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in global health targets, evaluations of differences in tuberculosis burden by sex are crucial. We aimed to assess the levels and trends of the global burden of tuberculosis, with an emphasis on investigating differences in sex by HIV status for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Methods We used a Bayesian hierarchical Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) platform to analyse 21 505 site-years of vital registration data, 705 site-years of verbal autopsy data, 825 site-years of sample-based vital registration data, and 680 site-years of mortality surveillance data to estimate mortality due to tuberculosis among HIV-negative individuals. We used a population attributable fraction approach to estimate mortality related to HIV and tuberculosis coinfection. A compartmental meta-regression tool (DisMod-MR 2.1) was then used to synthesise all available data sources, including prevalence surveys, annual case notifications, population-based tuberculin surveys, and tuberculosis cause-specific mortality, to produce estimates of incidence, prevalence, and mortality that were internally consistent. We further estimated the fraction of tuberculosis mortality that is attributable to independent effects of risk factors, including smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes, for HIV-negative individuals. For individuals with HIV and tuberculosis coinfection, we assessed mortality attributable to HIV risk factors including unsafe sex, intimate partner violence (only estimated among females), and injection drug use. We present 95% uncertainty intervals for all estimates. Findings Globally, in 2019, among HIV-negative individuals, there were 1.18 million (95% uncertainty interval 1.08-1.29) deaths due to tuberculosis and 8.50 million (7.45-9.73) incident cases of tuberculosis. Among HIV-positive individuals, there were 217 000 (153 000-279 000) deaths due to tuberculosis and 1.15 million (1.01-1.32) incident cases in 2019. More deaths and incident cases occurred in males than in females among HIV-negative individuals globally in 2019, with 342 000 (234 000-425 000) more deaths and 1.01 million (0.82-1.23) more incident cases in males than in females. Among HIV-positive individuals, 6250 (1820-11 400) more deaths and 81 100 (63 300-100 000) more incident cases occurred among females than among males in 2019. Age-standardised mortality rates among HIV-negative males were more than two times greater in 105 countries and age-standardised incidence rates were more than 1.5 times greater in 74 countries than among HIV-negative females in 2019. The fraction of global tuberculosis deaths among HIV-negative individuals attributable to alcohol use, smoking, and diabetes was 4.27 (3.69-5.02), 6.17 (5.48-7.02), and 1.17 (1.07-1.28) times higher, respectively, among males than among females in 2019. Among individuals with HIV and tuberculosis coinfection, the fraction of mortality attributable to injection drug use was 2.23 (2.03-2.44) times greater among males than females, whereas the fraction due to unsafe sex was 1.06 (1.05-1.08) times greater among females than males. Interpretation As countries refine national tuberculosis programmes and strategies to end the tuberculosis epidemic, the excess burden experienced by males is important. Interventions are needed to actively communicate, especially to men, the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. These interventions should occur in parallel with efforts to minimise excess HIV burden among women in the highest HIV burden countries that are contributing to excess HIV and tuberculosis coinfection burden for females. Placing a focus on tuberculosis burden among HIV-negative males and HIV and tuberculosis coinfection among females might help to diminish the overall burden of tuberculosis. This strategy will be crucial in reaching both equity and burden targets outlined by global health milestones. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Silva, DS; Cook, VJ; Johnston, JC; Gardy, J				Silva, Diego S.; Cook, Victoria J.; Johnston, James C.; Gardy, Jennifer			Ethical challenges in the treatment of non-refugee migrants with tuberculosis in Canada	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						bioethics; high-income countries; immigration; justice	GLOBAL HEALTH; MIGRATION	While attention to the ethical issues that migrants face in accessing tuberculosis care has increased in the last few years, most of the attention has focused on challenges that refugees face when emigrating. Less attention has been given to ethical challenges that arise in the context of providing tuberculosis treatment and care to non-refugee migrants in high-income countries (HIC), particularly those that do not face immediate danger or violence. In this paper, we analyze some of the ethical challenges associated with treating migrants with tuberculosis in the Canadian context. In particular, we will discuss (i) inter- and intra-jurisdictional issues that challenge quotidian public health governance structures, and (ii) the ethical imperative for the Canadian government and its provinces to clearly differentiate access to healthcare from a person's immigration status to help overcome power imbalances that may exist between public health workers and their clients. The arguments presented herein could potentially apply to other HIC with some form of universal health coverage.

J	Gatto, A; Drago, C; Ruggeri, M				Gatto, Andrea; Drago, Carlo; Ruggeri, Matteo			On the Frontline-A bibliometric Study on Sustainability, Development, Coronaviruses, and COVID-19	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						COVID-19; Sustainability; Development; Coronavirus; Pandemics; Bibliometrics	VULNERABILITY; HIV/AIDS; FOOD	The COVID-19 pandemic has placed the world's population in a state of unprecedented public health and global health vulnerability. Risks to public and global health have escalated due to COVID-19 contamination. This has raised the statistics of inequity and environmental concerns. A possible outlook entails reducing the pandemic consequences by prioritizing development, biodiversity, and adaptability, offering buffer solutions. It contains vital methods for studying, comprehending, and unraveling events-examining early responses to COVID-19, sustainability, and development, relating them with overall Coronaviruses reaction. This study maps out environmental, socioeconomic, and medical/technological issues using as statistical techniques multiple correspondence analysis and validated cluster analysis. The findings encourage rapid, long-term development policy involvement to address the pandemic. The resulting crises have highlighted the necessity for the revival of health justice policies anchored in distinctive public health ethical patterns in response to them. As a general rule, resilience and preparedness will be targeted at developing and vulnerable nations and are prone to include access to vaccines, public health care, and health investment. Our findings show the relevance of innovating on sustainable development routes and yardsticks. Sustainable global health requires crucial measures in prevention, preparation, and response. Long-term policy recommendations are needed to address pandemics and their interrelated crises and foster sustained growth and socioecological protection.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on research and careers of early career researchers: a DOHaD perspective	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE			English	Article						Early career researchers; ECR; DOHaD; COVID-19		The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed several inequalities worldwide, including the populations' access to healthcare systems and economic differences that impact the access to vaccination, medical resources, and health care services. Scientific research activities were not an exception, such that scientific research was profoundly impacted globally. Research trainees and early career researchers (ECRs) are the life force of scientific discovery around the world, and their work and progress in research was dramatically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. ECRs are a particularly vulnerable group as they are in a formative stage of their scientific careers, any disruptions during which is going to likely impact their lifelong career trajectory. To understand how COVID-19 impacted lives, career development plans, and research of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) ECRs, the International DOHaD ECR committee formed a special interest group comprising of ECR representatives of International DOHaD affiliated Societies/Chapters from around the world (Australia and New Zealand, Canada, French Speaking DOHaD, Japan, Latin America, Pakistan and USA). The anecdotal evidence summarized in this brief report, provide an overview of the findings of this special interest group, specifically on the impact of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic on daily research activities and its effects on career development plans of ECRs. We also discuss how our learnings from these shared experiences can strengthen collaborative work for the current and future generation of scientists.

However, few studies have examined the multiple factors that may influence the mitigation of urban green spaces (UGS) inequity. This study reports the results of a systematic mapping of access inequity research through correspondence analysis (CA) to reveal critical trends, knowledge gaps, and clusters based on a sample of 49 empirical studies screened from 563 selected papers. Our findings suggest that although the scale of cities with UGS access inequity varies between countries, large cities (more than 1,000,000 population), especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), are particularly affected. Moreover, the number of cities in which high socioeconomic status (high-SES) groups (e.g., young, rich, or employed) are at an advantage concerning access to UGS is substantially higher than the number of cities showing better accessibility for low-SES groups. Across the reviewed papers, analyses on mitigating interventions are sparse, and among the few studies that touch upon this, we found different central issues in local mitigating strategies between high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs. An explanatory framework is offered, explaining the interaction between UGS access inequity and local mitigating measures.

J	Deb, N				Deb, Nikhil			Slow Violence and the <i>Gas Peedit</i> in Neoliberal India	SOCIAL PROBLEMS			English	Article						slow violence; Union Carbide; neoliberal India; Dow; Gas Peedit	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; METHYL ISOCYANATE; EXXON-VALDEZ; HUMAN HEALTH; BHOPAL; DISASTER; CONSEQUENCES; CONSTRUCTION; GENDER; CRIME	This article analyzes the ways in which slow violence and neoliberalism intertwine in the production of social and environmental destruction, evident in the lingering devastation from the 1984 Union Carbide catastrophe in Bhopal, India. Children are born with congenital abnormalities; women are plagued with reproductive health problems; and dangerous chemicals left in the abandoned factory continue to contaminate soil and groundwater. Yet Bhopal is remembered almost exclusively for the spectacle of its immediate aftermath. Drawing on 60 interviews with Bhopal victims and activists, field observations, archives, and official and independent reports, this paper examines how the neoliberal turn in Indian governance plays a role in the creation of slow violence. The paper advances our understanding of socioenvironmental destruction by tying slow violence to a temporal change in countries' governance in the Global South. The paper underscores the significance of considering political economic dynamics in the perpetration of slow violence. It also emphasizes how the neoliberal turn, now anchored in right-wing Hindutva politics in India, further constrains the possibilities for counter-measures that would address slow violence. The paper offers significant implications for analyzing the political economy of socioenvironmental and health disparities in the wake of corporate malfeasance.

A global cautionary tale: discrimination and violence against trans women worsen despite investments in public resources and improvements in health insurance access and utilization of health care	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Transgender women; Discrimination; Violence; Social determinants of health; Health disparities; Health inequities	TRANSGENDER WOMEN	Background To determine if improvements in social determinants of health for trans women and decreases in transphobic discrimination and violence occurred over three study periods during which extensive local programs were implemented to specifically address longstanding inequities suffered by the transgender community. Methods Interviewer-administered surveys from repeated cross-sectional Transwomen Empowered to Advance Community Health (TEACH) studies in 2010, 2013 and 2016-2017 in San Francisco collected experiences with transphobia violence and discrimination. Respondent-driven sampling was used to obtain a sample of participants who identified as a trans woman. Results Violence due to gender identity was prevalent; in each study period, verbal abuse or harassment was reported by over 83% of participants, and physical abuse or harassment was reported by over 56%. Adverse social determinants of health including homelessness, living below the poverty limit, methamphetamine use, depression, PTSD, and anxiety all significantly increased from 2010 to 2016. When testing for trends, housing discrimination and physical violence were both more likely in 2016-2017 compared to the two earlier study periods. Housing discrimination (aOR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00-1.98) and physical violence due to gender identity/presentation (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.00-1.92) both significantly increased from 2010 to 2016. Conclusion Our findings are particularly alarming during a period when significant public health resources and community-based initiatives specifically for trans women were implemented and could have reasonably led us to expect improvements. Despite these efforts, physical violence and housing discrimination among trans women worsened during the study periods. To ensure future improvements, research and interventions need to shift the focus and burden from trans people to cisgender people who are the perpetuators of anti-trans sentiment, stigma, discrimination and victimization.

Changing geographies of aging on a global scale: The knowledge to action gap	CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN			English	Article						aging; knowledge translation; global; knowledge to action	UNITED-STATES; HEALTH-CARE; ACCESS; INCOME; INEQUALITIES; CANADA	Health geographers have empathy for health inequities as evidenced in their corpus of work. In undertaking this work, we have borrowed theories from (related) disciplines, applied sophisticated spatial analytic quantitative tools, innovative qualitative approaches, kept up with cutting edge research in the areas of immunology and social epigenetics, and made substantial contributions to knowledge. The focus of this piece is the two (in my view) visible gaps remaining: the knowledge to action gap, and the limited (that is, less than global) gaze. These gaps are illustrated through an example from our research on aging in Uganda.

Evidence from cross-country micro data	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS			English	Article						Debt relief; Education; Financing for development	BIRTH-ORDER; INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY; EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; CHILD LABOR; FAMILY-SIZE; RELIEF; HOUSEHOLD; RELIGION; QUALITY; INCOME	Soaring levels of public debt in low-income countries are fuelling concerns about their ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, such as free access to primary education. In the late 1990s and 2000s, international financial institutions introduced a series of debt relief initiatives aimed to restore debt sustainability among highly indebted countries. This study examines the impact of these initiatives on primary school attendance. We exploit the temporal variation in the implementation of these policies, in combination with individual-level data from 177 Demographic and Health Surveys covering more than 1.5 million school-age children from 44 low-income countries to implement difference-in-differences and spatial difference-in-discontinuity estimators. Results suggest that debt relief initiatives, by freeing up additional public resources, have significantly contributed to increasing primary school attendance in heavily indebted countries. Impact heterogeneity analysis also shows that debt relief has been effective at reducing wealth-based, intergenerational, religious, ethnic and spatial inequalities in education. Our results provide robust evidence to assert that debt relief, in combination with other financing sources, can contribute to improving educational outcomes in highly indebted poor countries.

This is an important question because stress related unhealthy eating is often invoked as an explanation for diet-related health inequities, particularly among women, seemingly with no empirical justification. Objective This study examined whether psychosocial stress and diet quality jointly mediated associations between SEP and self-rated health in women and men. Design Multiple mediating pathways were modeled using data from the crosssectional International Food Policy Study. Participants and setting Data were collected from 5,645 adults (aged 18 years or older) in Canada during 2018 and 2019. Main outcome measures Participants reported SEP using indicators of materialist (educational attainment and perceived income adequacy) and psychosocial pathways (subjective social status), along with psychosocial stress, dietary intake (to assess overall diet quality via Healthy Eating Index-2015 scores), and self-rated health. Statistical analyses performed Structural equation modeling modeled pathways linking SEP (ie, educational attainment, perceived income adequacy, and subjective social status) with self-rated health mediated by psychosocial stress and diet quality, stratified by gender. Results There was no evidence that psychosocial stress and diet quality jointly mediated associations between SEP and self-rated health in women or men. Diet quality mediated associations between educational attainment and self-rated health in women and men, with some evidence that it mediated associations between subjective social status and self-rated health in men (P = 0.051). Psychosocial stress mediated associations between perceived income adequacy and self-rated health in women and men, and between subjective social status and self-rated health in women. Conclusions Although often invoked as an explanation for diet-related health inequities, stress-related poor diet quality did not mediate associations between SEP and self-rated health in women or men. Psychosocial stress and diet quality individually mediated some of these associations, with some differences by gender.

In the developed world, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a well-established non-invasive imaging modality in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. However, there is significant global inequality in availability and access to CMR due to its high cost, technical demands as well as existing disparities in healthcare and technical infrastructures across high-income and low-income countries. Recent renewed interest in low-field CMR has been spurred by the clinical need to provide sustainable imaging technology capable of yielding diagnosticquality images whilst also being tailored to the local populations and healthcare ecosystems. This review aims to evaluate the technical, practical and cost considerations of low field CMR whilst also exploring the key barriers to implementing sustainable MRI in both the developing and developed world.

Global disparities in public health guidance for the use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						vaccines; COVID-19; maternal health; health policy		Introduction Gaps in information about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy have led to substantial global variation in public health guidance regarding the use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy over the course of the pandemic. Methods We conducted systematic screenings of public health authorities' websites across 224 countries and territories every 3 weeks to track the development of policies on COVID-19 vaccine use in pregnancy. Policies were categorised using a 1-5 permissiveness scale, with 1 indicating policies that recommended use, and 5 indicating policies that recommended against use. Results As of 30 September 2021, 176 countries/territories had issued explicit guidance on COVID-19 vaccine use in pregnancy, with 38% recommending use, 28% permitting use, 15% permitting use with qualifications, 2% not recommending but with exceptions, and 17% not recommending use whatsoever. This represented a significant shift from May 2021, when only 6% of countries/territories with such policies recommended the use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy (p<0.001). However, no policy positions could be found for 21% of all countries and territories, the vast majority being low and middle income. Policy positions also varied widely by vaccine product, with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines being most commonly recommended or permitted. Conclusion Our study highlights the evolution of policies regarding COVID-19 vaccine use in pregnancy over a 5-month period in 2021, the role of pregnancy-specific data in shaping these policies and how inequities in access for pregnant people persist, both within countries and globally.

J	Jagric, T; Fister, D; Jagric, V				Jagric, Timotej; Fister, Dusan; Jagric, Vita			Reshaping the Healthcare Sector with Economic Policy Measures Based on COVID-19 Epidemic Severity: A Global Study	HEALTHCARE			English	Article						COVID-19 pandemic; healthcare sector transformation; research and development; artificial intelligence; economic development; health system resilience	AFFECT GROWTH; IMPACT; PROFESSIONALS	Governments around the world are looking for ways to manage economic consequences of COVID-19 and promote economic development. The aim of this study is to identify the areas where the application of economic policy measures would enhance the resilience of societies on epidemic risks. We use data on the COVID-19 pandemic outcome in a large number of countries. With the estimation of multiple econometric models, we identify areas being a reasonable choice for economic policy intervention. It was found that viable remediation actions worth taking can be identified either for long-, mid-, or short-term horizons, impacting the equality, healthcare sector, and national economy characteristics. We suggest encouraging research and development based on innovative technologies linked to industries in healthcare, pharmaceutical, and biotech, promoting transformation of healthcare systems based on new technologies, providing access to quality healthcare, promoting public healthcare providers, and investing in the development of regional healthcare infrastructure, as a tool of equal regional development based on economic assessment. Further, a central element of this study, i.e. the innovative identification matrix, could be populated as a unique policy framework, either for latest pandemic or any similar outbreaks in future.

We aimed to assess the accessibility of paediatric cardiac surgery (PCS) to children METHODS In Bogota, Colombia, a multi-national team used cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study designs to adapt and evaluate 4 health system indicators at the national level: first, the population with timely geographic access to an institution providing PCS; second, the number of paediatric cardiac surgeons; third, this specialized procedure volume and its national distribution; and fourth, the 30-day perioperative mortality rate after PCS in Colombia. RESULTS Geospatial mapping approximates 64% (n = 9 894 356) of the under-18 Colombian population lives within 2-h drivetime of an institution providing PCS. Twenty-eight cardiovascular surgeons report performing PCS, 82% (n = 23) with formal training. In 2016, 1281 PCS procedures were registered, 90% of whom were performed in 6 of the country's 32 departments. National non-risk-adjusted all-cause 30-day perioperative mortality rate after PCS was 2.73% (n = 35). CONCLUSIONS Colombia's paediatric population had variable access to cardiac surgery in 2016, largely dependent upon geography. While the country may have the capacity to provide timely, high-quality care to those who need it, our study enables future comparative analyses to measure the impact of health system interventions facilitating healthcare equity for the underserved populations across Colombia and the Latin American region.

J	Salm, M; Ali, M; Minihane, M; Conrad, P				Salm, Melissa; Ali, Mahima; Minihane, Mairead; Conrad, Patricia			Defining global health: findings from a systematic review and thematic analysis of the literature	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Review						health education and promotion; health policy; public health; qualitative study; systematic review	EDUCATION; DEFINITIONS; POWER; COMPETENCES; GOVERNANCE; GUIDELINES; POLITICS	Introduction Debate around a common definition of global health has seen extensive scholarly interest within the last two decades; however, consensus around a precise definition remains elusive. The objective of this study was to systematically review definitions of global health in the literature and offer grounded theoretical insights into what might be seen as relevant for establishing a common definition of global health. Method A systematic review was conducted with qualitative synthesis of findings using peer-reviewed literature from key databases. Publications were identified by the keywords of 'global health' and 'define' or 'definition' or 'defining'. Coding methods were used for qualitative analysis to identify recurring themes in definitions of global health published between 2009 and 2019. Results The search resulted in 1363 publications, of which 78 were included. Qualitative analysis of the data generated four theoretical categories and associated subthemes delineating key aspects of global health. These included: (1) global health is a multiplex approach to worldwide health improvement taught and pursued at research institutions; (2) global health is an ethically oriented initiative that is guided by justice principles; (3) global health is a mode of governance that yields influence through problem identification, political decision-making, as well as the allocation and exchange of resources across borders and (4) global health is a vague yet versatile concept with multiple meanings, historical antecedents and an emergent future. Conclusion Extant definitions of global health can be categorised thematically to designate areas of importance for stakeholders and to organise future debates on its definition. Future contributions to this debate may consider shifting from questioning the abstract 'what' of global health towards more pragmatic and reflexive questions about 'who' defines global health and towards what ends.

J	Tusalem, RF				Tusalem, Rollin F.			Gendered Governance: Examining the Relationship between Women Legislators and Effective Public Goods Provision from a Global Sample	POLITY			English	Article; Early Access						Women in Politics; Gender; Governance; Public Goods Provision; Legislatures	SUBSTANTIVE REPRESENTATION; POLITICAL REPRESENTATION; RURAL ELECTRIFICATION; CRITICAL MASS; DEMOCRACY; HEALTH; QUOTAS; INEQUALITY; GOVERNMENT; WELFARE	In the past two decades, women achieved significant gains in national legislatures by advocating for improvements in healthcare, welfare programs, and the promotion of civil rights. However, extant studies also find that women's increased representation in national legislatures have led to symbolic tokenism without any substantive gains in terms of policy outputs, signifying their continued marginalization. Utilizing a global sample, this panel study shows that female representation in legislatures are correlated with having better public goods provision in the context of tangible public services that are important to women constituents (i.e., women's issues). The results are consistent even when controlling for other variables that concern women's empowerment in society and government, regime type, levels of democracy, economic development, and disparate regional effects. Disaggregated results based on a developing world sample and states that experienced an authoritarian past also show how female representation in national legislatures leads to better infrastructure development. The implications suggest that women in legislatures improve access to basic infrastructure that concomitantly affects the quality of life of citizens, reflecting women's substantive representation.

To help reduce these health inequalities, dedicated senior mental and physical health nurses have been deployed to work within and alongside local statutory and voluntary organisations. This qualitative evaluation examined the impact of nurse-led homeless healthcare in Warwickshire, United Kingdom. During January and February 2021, online semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 professionals including the mental and physical homeless health nurses (n = 4), statutory health and local authority professionals (n = 4), and voluntary and community sector professionals (n = 9). Interviews were qualitatively analysed using inductive, reflexive thematic analysis. Data analysis identified three overarching themes related to the meaning, impact and future development of nurse-led homeless healthcare: (1) Nurse-led homeless healthcare and health inequalities, (2) The multi-agency approach of nurse-led homeless healthcare, and (3) Future development of nurse-led homeless healthcare. The findings confirm the benefits of homeless healthcare in reducing health inequalities and promoting a more accessible, flexible and person-centred approach to holistic care. Yet, prevailing organisational and system-level barriers were also identified as currently limiting the capacity, provision and practicalities of delivering nurse-led homeless healthcare. Recommendations were identified with international relevance and included: (i) continued implementation of person-centred healthcare for homeless individuals, (ii) strengthening of organisational collaboration and communication pathways to improve coordinated care, (iii) development of the managerial and structural aspects of provision, (iv) addressing limitations associated with scope and capacity to ensure that delivered healthcare is adequately intensive, (v) increased availability of clinical or therapeutic spaces, and (vi) implementation of long-term plans supported by evaluation and commissioning.

Drawing on cross-national panel data from Bangladesh and Jordan, this article explores diversity in child marriage experiences in contexts affected by forced displacement, highlighting how married girls' well-being differs from that of their unmarried peers, and how COVID-19 has reinforced these differences. Methods: We analyzed longitudinal survey data-collected pre- and post-COVID-19-from the Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence study with 293 ever-married and 1,102 never-married adolescent girls. Multivariate regression analysis assessed the well-being of married and unmarried girls across contexts and refugee status, both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These quantitative data are complemented by in-depth qualitative data from adolescents (n = 112), and key informant interviews with service providers and community leaders (n = 62). Results: Our findings highlight that married girls in contexts affected by displacement are disadvantaged in multiple ways, but that the patterning of disadvantage varies across contexts, and that marriage can also have protective effects in certain contexts. The COVID-19 pandemic has, however, served to exacerbate existing inequalities in all contexts.

Global Res Dev Disabilities Collab	Accelerating progress on early childhood development for children under 5 years with disabilities by 2030	LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							CARE	The likelihood of a newborn child dying before their fifth birthday (under-5 mortality rate) is universally acknowledged as a reflection of the social, economic, health, and environmental conditions in which children (and the rest of society) live, but little is known about the likelihood of a newborn child having a lifelong disability before their fifth birthday if he or she survives. Available data show that globally the likelihood of a child having a disability before their fifth birthday was ten times higher than the likelihood of dying (377 center dot 2 vs 38 center dot 2 per 1000 livebirths) in 2019. However, disability funding declined by 11 center dot 4% between 2007 and 2016, and only 2% of the estimated US$79 center dot 1 billion invested in early childhood development during this period was spent on disabilities. This funding pattern has not improved since 2016. This paper highlights the urgent need to prioritise early childhood development for the beneficiaries of global child survival initiatives who have lifelong disabilities, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, as envisioned by the Sustainable Development Goals agenda. This endeavour would entail disability-focused programming and monitoring approaches, economic analysis of interventions services, and substantial funding to redress the present inequalities among this cohort of children by 2030.

However, the factors influencing coordination among government entities in low-income and middle-income countries are not well known. Although theory building is well suited to explain complex social phenomena, theory-based health policy and systems studies are limited. This paper examined the factors influencing coordination among government entities at the central government level in Uganda. Methods This theory-based case study used a qualitative approach. Primary data were collected through 26 national-level key informant interviews supplemented with a review of 6 national strategic and policy documents. Data were analysed abductively using a multitheoretical framework combining the transaction cost economics theory, principal-agent theory, resource dependence theory and political economy perspective. Results Complex and dynamic interactions among different factors, both internal and external to the government, were found. Interdependencies, coordination costs, non-aligned interests, and institutional and ideational aspects were crucial factors. The power dynamics within the bureaucratic structures and the agency of the coordinated entities influence the effectiveness of coordination efforts. New public management principles promoted in the 1990s by donor institutional strengthening projects (characterised by agencification and setting up of independent agencies to circumvent ineffective big line ministries) created further fragmentation within the government. The donors and international agendas were occasionally supportive but sometimes counterintuitive to national coordination efforts. Conclusion The multitheoretical framework derives a deep analysis of the factors that influence organisational decision-making to coordinate with others or not. Achieving intragovernmental coordination requires more time and resources to guide the software aspects of institutional change-articulating a shared vision on coordination across government. Shaping incentives to align interests, managing coordination costs and navigating historical-institutional contexts are critical. Countervailing political actions and power dynamics should be judiciously navigated.

Setting and participants We used an existing dataset of 1 027 039 women which combines data from the Health Insurance information systems, with census data from Midi-Pyrenees, France. Primary and secondary outcome measures Our outcome was, for each woman, the uptake of the pap smear and the uptake of the mammography during the year. Results A social gradient of screening uptake was found in the recommended age groups. This gradient was stronger in large urban areas: (1) For mammography: decile 10 (the most deprived) vs 1 (the least deprived), adjusted OR 0.777, 95% CI (0.748 to 0.808) in large urban area; adjusted OR= 0.808 for decile 1 to 0.726 for decile 10 in other areas vs decile 1 in urban areas; (2) For pap smear: decile 10 vs 1 adjusted OR 0.66, 95%CI (0.642 to 0.679) in large urban areas; adjusted OR= 0.747 for decile 1 to 0.562 for decile 10 in other areas vs decile 1 in urban areas). Screening rates were globally higher in large urban areas. For mammography, the social and territorial disparities were higher outside the recommended age group. Conclusions Offering a universal approach to every woman, as it is often the case in nationally organised screening programmes, is likely to be insufficient to ensure real equity in access. Developing global dataset combining health data and diverse socioeconomic data, at individual and contextual levels, could enable a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this social gradient, and therefore, the development of targeted territorial actions to improve equity of access to healthcare.

Methods The following sources were searched for quality indicators or articles: Web of Science, MEDLINE, IBECS, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health, Academic Search Complete, SportDiscus, SciELO, PsychINFO, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, and Scopus databases; the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Health System Indicator Portal, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development websites; and the National Quality Forum's measures inventory tool. Search terms included "quality indicator," "quality measure," "physiotherapy," and "physical therapy." Inclusion criteria were articles written in English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese aimed at measuring the quality of care in hospital physical therapy units. Evidence-based indicators with an explicit formula were extracted by 2 independent reviewers and then classified using the structure-process-outcome model, quality domain, and categories defined by a consensus method. Results Of the 176 articles identified, only 19 met the criteria. From these articles and from the indicator repository searches, 178 clinical care indicators were included in the qualitative synthesis and presented in this paper. Process and outcome measures were prevalent, and 5 out of the 6 quality domains were represented. No efficiency measures were identified. Moreover, structure indicators, equity and accessibility indicators, and indicators in the cardiovascular and circulatory, mental health, pediatrics, and intensive care categories were underrepresented. Conclusions A broad selection of quality indicators was identified from international resources, which can be used to measure the quality of physical therapy care in hospital units. Impact This review identified 178 quality of care indicators that can be used in clinical practice monitoring and quality improvement of hospital physical therapy units. The results highlight a lack of accessibility, equity, and efficiency measures for physical therapy units.

However, the evidence is poor, and it is not clear whether the outcomes vary among sociodemographic groups. This study fills this gap by proposing a pan-European analysis of the effects of tourism stays per 1000 residents (as a measure of tourism pressure) on self-perceived health at a regional level, based on data from Eurostat, the EU-SILC (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey), and the LFS (Labor Force Survey). Multilevel models with random effects were used, including three levels: region, time, and region-time. Results show that tourism pressure may benefit self-reported health but only among residents aged over 50 years old living in rural contexts, or over 65 living in low density urban areas. As for younger groups (under 50) living in high density cities, tourism is longitudinally associated with worsened self-reported health. These results, which are supported by instrumental-variable estimations, suggest that urban residents and younger groups do not benefit from tourism. This might be due to a number of side effects related to increased living costs, precarious labour, and conflicts related to public space. Therefore, our findings challenge the narrative that urban tourism universally improves residents' quality of life. Considering the global urgency of creating healthier and more equitable post-COVID-19 cities and societies, tourism should be considered together with health and equity dimensions.

This study examines identity connection as a mediator of this relationship. Participants Undergraduates at a large, private university (n = 771), 59.4% racially minoritized American or international (RMA/I). Methods Measures included perception of value, perception of fair/equitable treatment, identity centrality (ie, significance of racial/ethnic identity), identity exploration, and flourishing. Structural equation models compared RMA/I vs. white American students. Results Among RMA/I students, flourishing was predicted by perception of value and identity centrality; identity centrality was positively predicted by perception of value and negatively predicted by perception of fair/equitable treatment.

Conclusions Identity centrality mediated the relationship between fair/equitable treatment and flourishing among these minoritized undergraduate students, supporting theory that identity may be formed in response to oppression.

How effects on health equity are assessed in systematic reviews of interventions	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Age Factors; Developing Countries; Ethnology; *Health Status Disparities; Racial Groups; Research Design [standards]; *Review Literature as Topic; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Humans	MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS; POPULATION-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS; COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS; COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; PROMOTING PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CHRONIC DISEASE; BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT	Background Enhancing health equity is endorsed in the Sustainable Development Goals. The failure of systematic reviews to consider potential differences in effects across equity factors is cited by decision-makers as a limitation to their ability to inform policy and program decisions. Objectives To explore what methods systematic reviewers use to consider health equity in systematic reviews of effectiveness. Search methods We searched the following databases up to 26 February 2021: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Methodology Register, CINAHL, Education Resources Information Center, Education Abstracts, Criminal Justice Abstracts, Hein Index to Foreign Legal Periodicals, PAIS International, Social Services Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Digital Dissertations and the Health Technology Assessment Database. We searched SCOPUS to identify articles that cited any of the included studies on 10 June 10 2021. We contacted authors and searched the reference lists of included studies to identify additional potentially relevant studies. Selection criteria We included empirical studies of cohorts of systematic reviews that assessed methods for measuring effects on health inequalities. We define health inequalities as unfair and avoidable differences across socially stratifying factors that limit opportunities for health. We operationalised this by assessing studies which evaluated differences in health across any component of the PROGRESS-Plus acronym, which stands for Place of residence, Race/ethnicity/culture/language, Occupation, Gender or sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital. "Plus" stands for other factors associated with discrimination, exclusion, marginalisation or vulnerability such as personal characteristics (e.g. age, disability), relationships that limit opportunities for health (e.g. children in a household with parents who smoke) or environmental situations which provide limited control of opportunities for health (e.g. school food environment). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data using a pre-tested form. Risk of bias was appraised for included studies according to the potential for bias in selection and detection of systematic reviews. Main results In total, 48,814 studies were identified and the titles and abstracts were screened in duplicate. In this updated review, we identified an additional 124 methodological studies published in the 10 years since the first version of this review, which included 34 studies. Thus, 158 methodological studies met our criteria for inclusion. The methods used by these studies focused on evidence relevant to populations experiencing health inequity (108 out of 158 studies), assess subgroup analysis across PROGRESS-Plus (26 out of 158 studies), assess analysis of a gradient in effect across PROGRESS-Plus (2 out of 158 studies) or use a combination of subgroup analysis and focused approaches (20 out of 158 studies). The most common PROGRESS-Plus factors assessed were age (43 studies), socioeconomic status in 35 studies, low- and middle-income countries in 24 studies, gender or sex in 22 studies, race or ethnicity in 17 studies, and four studies assessed multiple factors across which health inequity may exist. Only 16 studies provided a definition of health inequity. Five methodological approaches to consider health equity in systematic reviews of effectiveness were identified: 1) descriptive assessment of reporting and analysis in systematic reviews (140 of 158 studies used a type of descriptive method); 2) descriptive assessment of reporting and analysis in original trials (50 studies); 3) analytic approaches which assessed differential effects across one or more PROGRESS-Plus factors (16 studies); 4) applicability assessment (25 studies) and 5) stakeholder engagement (28 studies), which is a new finding in this update and examines the appraisal of whether relevant stakeholders with lived experience of health inequity were included in the design of systematic reviews or design and delivery of interventions. Reporting for both approaches (analytic and applicability) lacked transparency and was insufficiently detailed to enable the assessment of credibility. Authors' conclusions There is a need for improvement in conceptual clarity about the definition of health equity, describing sufficient detail about analytic approaches (including subgroup analyses) and transparent reporting of judgments required for applicability assessments in order to consider health equity in systematic reviews of effectiveness.

Given this context, we analyze 43 interviews with Black women aged 18-55 in rural South Africa to explore how the constitutional ideal of gender equality-or "50/50"-has been interpreted and applied in women's intimate relationships. Overall, we found that inequality and gender hierarchy were common in relationships. Women relied on two logics to explain the persistence of inequality in their relationships. First, women offered ideological support for gender norms supporting hierarchy by linking 50/50 to the abandonment of culture, tradition, and respect. Second, women viewed reaffirmation of gender inequality within relationships as a pragmatic way to avoid men's violence and infidelity, thus protecting women from abandonment and HIV. Women's views about equality in relationships were shaped by dominant gender norms, precarity in the local political economy, and the risks of violence and HIV/AIDS. Our findings expand theories of social change by highlighting how longstanding social norms, but also local political-economic and health conditions can influence views of equality and, ultimately, the local adoption or dismissal of international standards of rights and equality.

To address these inequities, it is critical to engage communities in identifying priorities and designing, implementing, and disseminating interventions. This issue of Stroke features health equity themed lectures delivered during the International Stroke Conference and Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-Solving meetings in 2021 as well as articles covering issues of disparities and diversity in stroke. Bruce Ovbiagele, MD, MSc, MAS, MBA, MLS, received the 2021 William Feinberg Award Lecture for his lifetime achievements in seeking global and local solutions to cerebrovascular health inequities. The second annual Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-Solving symposium, which took place the day before the International Stroke Conference in February 2021, focused on community-engaged research for reducing inequities in stroke. Phil Gorelick, MD was awarded the Edgar J. Kenton III Award for his lifetime achievements in using community engagement strategies to recruit and retain Black participants in observational studies and clinical trials. Walter Koroshetz, MD, Director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke delivered the keynote lecture on stroke inequities and Richard Benson, MD, PhD, Director of the Office of Global Health and Health Disparities at National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, gave a lecture focused on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke efforts to address inequities. Nichols et al highlighted approaches of community-based participatory research to address stroke inequities. Verma et al showcased digital health innovations to reduce inequities in stroke. Das et al showed that the proportion of underrepresented in medicine vascular neurology fellows has lowered over the past decade and authors provided a road map for enhancing the diversity in vascular neurology. Clearly, to overcome inequities, multipronged strategies are required, from broadening representation among vascular neurology faculty to partnering with communities to conduct research with meaningful impact.

In particular, the disproportionate burden of stroke in people of African ancestry compared to most other racial/ethnic groups around the world has been long standing, is expected to worsen, and so far, has defied solution, largely because conventional risk factors likely account for less than half of the Black versus White disparity in stroke outcomes. While hypotheses such as a differential impact or inadequate evaluation of traditional risk factors by race have been suggested as potentially key factors contributing to lingering racial/ethnic stroke disparities, relatively understudied novel risk factors such as psychosocial stress, environmental pollution, and inflammation; and influences of the social determinants of health are gaining the most attention (and momentum). Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that while there is a lot still to understand, there needs to be a major shift from incessantly studying the problem, to developing interventions to resolve it. Resolution will likely require targeting multilevel factors, considering contemporaneous cross-national and cross-continental data collection, creating scalable care delivery models, jointly addressing care quality and community drivers of stroke occurrence, incorporating policy makers in planning/dissemination of successful interventions, and investing in robust transdisciplinary research training programs that address the interrelated issues of health equity and workforce diversity, and regional capacity building. To this end, our international multidisciplinary team has been involved in conducting several epidemiological studies and clinical trials in the area of stroke disparities, as well as executing career enhancing research training programs in the United States and Africa. This award lecture paper shares some of the lessons we have learnt from previous studies, presents objectives/design of ongoing initiatives, and discusses plans for the future.

However in Ghana, there has been a slight increase in the fertility rate with little understanding of the reason for the increment. To understand this change, it is important to first examine the trend over a considerable period of time while taking into consideration some important inequality dimensions. This informed the need for this present study as we examined the trends in total fertility rate in Ghana by different inequality dimensions from 1993 to 2014. Methods Data from the 1993-2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys were used for the study, and we relied on the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software for the analysis. The analysis involved disaggregation of TFR by wealth index, education, place of residence and region. This was followed by the estimation of inequality by Difference, Population Attributable Risk, Ratio and Population Attributable Fraction. In the analysis, we set the statistical significance at a 95% confidence interval. Results For all surveys, the total fertility rate was consistently highest among the poorest women (7.00, 6.28, 6.77, 6.61 and 6.29 in 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2014, respectively). The highest total fertility rate was recorded among women with no formal education in all the survey years. For instance, in the 2014 survey, the total fertility rate for women with no formal education was 5.98 and those with secondary/higher had a total fertility rate of 3.40. Women in rural areas had a higher total fertility rate compared to those in urban areas (4.90 vs. 3.40 in 2014). In terms of sub-national regions, the Northern region was the region where women consistently had the highest total fertility rate. Conclusion There is a need for a collective effort to design interventions and policies to create awareness among the people of Ghana especially girls and women on the implications of high fertility.

Design/methodology/approach Cognisant of the visible (e.g., (APA 6.29) gender, age, race) and invisible (e.g., (APA 6.29) epistemology, experience, socioeconomic status) dimensions of diversity, this viewpoint focuses on one invisible dimension of diversity - epistemology. Using secondary data, an epistemological review of social marketing is undertaken by selecting five aspects that serve as potential indicators: professional associations, global conferences, education and training, research and publication and practice. Several recommendations are made to expand epistemological diversity in social marketing. Findings The epistemological review of diversity within social marketing reveals disparities between the Global North and South. These disparities are due to varying opportunities for participation in associations, conferences, education and training, and research and publication. In addition, there exist "hidden" social change practitioners who implement programmes in the Global South that are consistent with social marketing practice, but continue to be unchronicled and unheralded. Originality/value For many years, social marketing scholars and practitioners have been working to expand the boundaries of the discipline, with a focus on theory and application. Although the authors acknowledge that diversity and equity are inherently central to this discipline, epistemological diversity, specifically as linked to the geographies of the Global South, has been largely overlooked. Our viewpoint nudges the social marketing community into including epistemological diversity in the ongoing discourse around broadening and deepening the discipline of social marketing.

Current guidance about its management and prognosis stems from small studies, mostly from high-income countries. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical and genetic characteristics, as well as the impact, of current practice on health outcomes of HoFH patients globally. Methods The HoFH International Clinical Collaborators registry collected data on patients with a clinical, or genetic, or both, diagnosis of HoFH using a retrospective cohort study design. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04815005. Findings Overall, 751 patients from 38 countries were included, with 565 (75%) reporting biallelic pathogenic variants. The median age of diagnosis was 12.0 years (IQR 5.5-27.0) years. Of the 751 patients, 389 (52%) were female and 362 (48%) were male. Race was reported for 527 patients; 338 ( 64%) patients were White, 121 (23%) were Asian, and 68 (13%) were Black or mixed race. The major manifestations of ASCVD or aortic stenosis were already present in 65 (9%) of patients at diagnosis of HoFH. Globally, pretreatment LDL cholesterol levels were 14.7 mmol/L (IQR 11.6-18.4). Among patients with detailed therapeutic information, 491 (92%) of 534 received statins, 342 (64%) of 534 received ezetimibe, and 243 (39%) of 621 received lipoprotein apheresis. On-treatment LDL cholesterol levels were lower in high-income countries (3.93 mmol/ L, IQR 2.6-5.8) versus non-highincome countries (9.3 mmol/ L, 6.7-12.7), with greater use of three or more lipid-lowering therapies (LLT; highincome 66% vs non-high-income 24%) and consequently more patients attaining guideline-recommended LDL cholesterol goals (high- income 21% vs non-high- income 3%). A first major adverse cardiovascular event occurred a decade earlier in non-high-income countries, at a median age of 24.5 years (IQR 17.0-34.5) versus 37.0 years (29.0-49.0) in high-income countries (adjusted hazard ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.38). Interpretation Worldwide, patients with HoFH are diagnosed too late, undertreated, and at high premature ASCVD risk. Greater use of multi-LLT regimens is associated with lower LDL cholesterol levels and better outcomes. Significant global disparities exist in treatment regimens, control of LDL cholesterol levels, and cardiovascular event-free survival, which demands a critical re-evaluation of global health policy to reduce inequalities and improve outcomes for all patients with HoFH.

During the past several dec-ades, human-produced pollutant emissions have undergone drastic and regionally distinctive changes, yet it remains unclear about the resulting global transboundary health impacts. Here we show that between 1950 and 2014, global anthropogenic PM2.5 has led to 185.7 million premature deaths cumula-tively, including about 14% from transboundary pollution. Among four country groups at different afflu-ence levels, on a basis of per capita contribution to transboundary mortality, a richer region tends to exert severer cumulative health externality, with the poorest bearing the worst net externality after contrast-ing import and export of pollution mortality. The temporal changes in transboundary mortality and cross-regional inequality are substantial. Effort to reduce PM2.5-related transboundary mortality should seek international collaborative strategies that account for historical responsibility and inequality. (C) 2021 Science China Press.

This study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on routine immunisation using triangulated data from global, country-based, and individual-reported sources obtained during the pandemic period. Methods This report synthesised data from 170 countries and territories. Data sources included administered vaccine-dose data from January to December, 2019, and January to December, 2020, WHO regional office reports, and a WHO-led pulse survey administered in April, 2020, and June, 2020. Results were expressed as frequencies and proportions of respondents or reporting countries. Data on vaccine doses administered were weighted by the population of surviving infants per country. Findings A decline in the number of administered doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-containing vaccine (DTP3) and first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in the first half of 2020 was noted. The lowest number of vaccine doses administered was observed in April, 2020, when 33% fewer DTP3 doses were administered globally, ranging from 9% in the WHO African region to 57% in the South-East Asia region. Recovery of vaccinations began by June, 2020, and continued into late 2020. WHO regional offices reported substantial disruption to routine vaccination sessions in April, 2020, related to interrupted vaccination demand and supply, including reduced availability of the health workforce. Pulse survey analysis revealed that 45 (69%) of 65 countries showed disruption in outreach services compared with 27 (44%) of 62 countries with disrupted fixed-post immunisation services. Interpretation The marked magnitude and global scale of immunisation disruption evokes the dangers of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks in the future. Trends indicating partial resumption of services highlight the urgent need for ongoing assessment of recovery, catch-up vaccination strategy implementation for vulnerable populations, and ensuring vaccine coverage equity and health system resilience.

It is associated with an increase in the societal burden of delivering care to older adults with chronic conditions or frailty. How to integrate global population aging and technology development to help address the growing demands for care facing many aging societies is both a challenge and an opportunity for innovation. We propose a social technology approach that promotes use of technologies to assist individuals, families, and communities to cope more effectively with the disabilities of older adults who can no longer live independently due to dementia, serious mental illness, and multiple chronic health problems. The main contributions of the social technology approach include: (1) fostering multidisciplinary collaboration among social scientists, engineers, and healthcare experts; (2) including ethical and humanistic standards in creating and evaluating innovations; (3) improving social systems through working with those who deliver, manage, and design older adult care services; (4) promoting social justice through social policy research and innovation, particularly for disadvantaged groups; (5) fostering social integration by creating age-friendly and intergenerational programs; and (6) seeking global benefit by identifying and generalizing best practices. As an emergent, experimental approach, social technology requires systematic evaluation in an iterative process to refine its relevance and uses in different local settings. By linking technological interventions to the social and cultural systems of older people, we aim to help technological advances become an organic part of the complex social world that supports and sustains care delivery to older adults in need.

This study investigated how this trend in infections played out for deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by examining area-level socio-economic disparities in COVID-19-related mortality during the second pandemic wave in Germany. The analysis was based on nationwide data on notified deaths, which were linked to an area-based index of socio-economic deprivation. In the autumn and winter of 2020/2021, COVID-19-related deaths increased faster among residents in Germany's more deprived districts. From late 2020 onwards, the mortality risks of men and women in the most deprived districts were 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-1.82] and 1.44 (95% CI 1.19-1.73) times higher than among those in the most affluent districts, respectively, after adjustment for age, urbanization and population density.

Universal healthcare coverage, patients' rights, and nurse-patient communication: a critical review of the evidence	BMC NURSING			English	Review						Universal healthcare access; Patient-rights; The right to health; Sustainable development goals; Social determinants of health	ETHICS; PERSPECTIVES; TYPOLOGY; CODE	The Sustainable Development Goals adopted by world leaders on September 25, 2015, aimed to end poverty and hunger, promote gender equity, empower women and girls, and ensure human dignity and equality by all human beings in a healthy environment. These development goals were premised on international human rights norms and institutions, thereby acknowledging the relevance of human rights in achieving each goal. Particularly, sustainable development goal 3, whose objective is to achieve universal health coverage, enhance healthy lives, and promote well-being for all, implicitly recognizes the right to health as crucial. Our focus in this paper is to discuss how promoting patients' rights and enhancing effective nurse-patient communication in the healthcare setting is a significant and necessary way to achieve universal health coverage. Through a critical review of the empirical research evidence, we demonstrated that enhancing patients' rights and effect nurse-patient communication will promote people-centered care, improve patients' satisfaction of care outcomes, increase utilization of care services, and empower individuals and families to self-advocate for their health. These steps directly impact primary healthcare strategies and the social determinants of health as core components to achieving universal health coverage. We argue that without paying attention to the human rights dimensions or employing human rights strategies, implementing the other efforts will be inadequate and unsustainable in protecting the poorest and most vulnerable populations in the achievement of goal 3.

The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize epidemiology, clinical outcomes, and health service use reported for global populations with RA residing in rural and remote locations. Methods Medline, Embase, HealthStar, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to June 2019 using librarian-developed search terms for RA and rural and remote populations. Peer-reviewed published manuscripts were included if they reported on epidemiologic, clinical, or health service use outcomes. Results Fifty-four articles were included for data synthesis, representing studies from all continents. In 11 studies in which there was an appropriate urban population comparator, rural and remote populations were not at increased risk for RA; 1 study reported increased prevalence, and 5 studies reported decreased prevalence in rural and remote populations. Clinical characteristics of rural and remote populations in studies with an appropriate urban comparator showed no significant differences in disease activity measures or disability, but 1 study reported worse physical function and health-related quality of life in rural and remote populations. Studies reporting on health service use provided evidence that rural and remote residence adversely impacts diagnostic time, ongoing follow-up, access to RA-care-related practitioners and services, and variation in medication access and use, with prominent heterogeneity noted between countries. Conclusion RA epidemiology and clinical outcomes are not necessarily different between rural/remote and urban populations within countries. Rural and remote patients face greater barriers to care, which increases the risk for inequities in outcomes.

Research investigating how socioeconomic and residential factors impact outcomes in patients with fILD is lacking. Objectives: To determine the association between neighborhood-level disadvantage and presentation severity, disease progression, lung transplantation, and mortality in patients with fILD from the United States and Canada. Methods: We performed a multicenter, international, prospective cohort study of 4,729 patients with fILD from one U.S. and eight Canadian ILD registry sites. Neighborhood-level disadvantage was measured by the area deprivation index in the United States and the Canadian Index of Multiple Deprivation in Canada. Measurements and Main Results: In the U.S. but not in the Canadian cohort, patients with fILD living in neighborhoods with the greatest disadvantage (top quartile) experience the highest risk of mortality (hazard ratio = 1.51, P = 0.002), and in subgroups of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the top quartile of disadvantage experienced the lowest odds of lung transplantation (odds ratio = 0.46, P. 0.04). Greater disadvantage was associated with reduced baseline DLCO in both cohorts, but it was not associated with baseline FVC or FVC or DLCO decline in either cohort. Conclusions: Patients with fILD who live in areas with greater neighborhood-level disadvantage in the United States experience higher mortality, and patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis experience lower odds of lung transplantation. These disparities are not seen in Canadian patients, which may indicate differences in access to care between the United States and Canada.

J	Peacock, SJ				Peacock, Stuart J.			Vaccine nationalism will persist: global public goods need effective engagement of global citizens	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Covid-19; Vaccines; Vaccine nationalism; Global public goods; Governance; Citizen engagement; Public engagement		Covid-19 presents a unique opportunity to transform democratic engagement in the governance of global public goods. In this paper, I describe a global public goods framework and how it relates to Covid-19 vaccines, and summarize some of the global responses to Covid-19. I discuss some of the global threats to health and prosperity posed by the inequitable distribution of vaccines, and propose transformative thinking to democratically engage citizens in the governance of global public goods. In recent years, public-private partnerships and philanthropic organizations have successfully stepped in to help international organizations like the UN and WHO provide global public goods, but they are not democratically elected or publicly accountable. Global public goods are critical to addressing Covid-19, future pandemic preparedness, global health policy, health equity, and the unfolding climate crisis. To make us more resistant and resilient to future global health crises we need transformative thinking to democratically engage global citizens. We need to lay the foundations for a 'global social contract' on global public goods.

Our global descriptive study aims to inform policymakers on factors affecting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare workers (HCWs) in 12 countries, based on income index. We also looked for possible predictors of vaccine acceptance among the study sample. MethodsA structured questionnaire prepared after consultation with experts in the field and guided by the "Report of the SAGE working group on vaccine hesitancy" was administered among 2,953 HCWs. Upon obtaining informed consent, apart from demographic information, we collected information on trust in vaccines and health authorities, and agreement to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. ResultsAlthough 69% of the participants agreed to accept a vaccine, there was high heterogeneity in agreement between HCWs in low and lower-middle income countries (L-LMICs) and upper-middle- and high-income countries (UM-HICs), with acceptance rates of 62 and 75%, respectively. Potential predictors of vaccine acceptance included being male, 50 years of age or older, resident of an UM-HIC, updating self about COVID-19 vaccines, greater disease severity perception, greater anxiety of contracting COVID-19 and concern about side effects of vaccines. ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccine acceptance among HCWs in L-LMICs was considerably low as compared to those from UM-HICs. The lowest vaccine acceptance rates were among HCWs from the African continent. This underlines the need for the implementation of country-specific vaccine promotion strategies, with special focus on increasing vaccine supply in L-LMICs.

The aim of this study was to analyse policy strategies developed by the five Nordic countries during the first 3 months of the pandemic from a health promotion perspective in order to identify Nordic responses to the crisis. Although the Nordic countries have a long tradition of co-operation as well as similar social welfare policies and legislation, each country developed their own strategies towards the crisis. The strategies identified were analysed from a health promotion perspective emanating from five principles: intersectorality, sustainability, equity, empowerment and a lifecourse perspective. Denmark, Finland and Norway had lockdowns to varying degrees, whereas Sweden and Iceland had no lockdowns. Iceland implemented a test and tracking strategy from the very beginning. All countries based their recommendations and restrictions on appeals to solidarity and trust in institutions and fellow citizens. The analysis showed that the strategies in all countries could be related to health promotion principles with some differences between the countries especially regarding equity and sustainability. The Nordic governments took responsibility for protecting their citizens by developing policy strategies based on restrictions and recommendations congruent with the principles of health promotion. The findings also identified issues that will pose challenges for future pandemic strategies.

J	Puyvallée, AD; Storeng, KT				Puyvallee, Antoine de Bengy; Storeng, Katerini Tagmatarchi			COVAX, vaccine donations and the politics of global vaccine inequity	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Covid-19; Vaccine; Donation; Equity; Foreign policy; Diplomacy; Global health; Public-private partnership	HEALTH DIPLOMACY	Background In 2021, donor countries, the pharmaceutical industry, and the COVAX initiative promoted vaccine donation or "dose-sharing" as a main solution to the inequitable global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. COVAX positioned itself as a global vaccine-sharing hub that promised to share doses "equitably, effectively and transparently," according to rational criteria overseen by independent scientists. This article provides a critical analysis of the principles and practice of "dose-sharing," showing how it reveals the politics at play within COVAX. Results Donated doses were an important source of COVAX's vaccine supply in 2021, accounting for 60% of the doses the initiative delivered (543 million out of 910 million). However, donations could not compensate fully for COVAX's persistent procurement struggles: it delivered less than half of the two billion doses it originally projected for 2021, a fraction of the 9.25 billion doses that were administered globally in 2021. Donor countries and vaccine manufacturers systematically broke COVAX's principles for maximizing the impact of dose-sharing, delivering doses late, in smaller quantities than promised, and in ad hoc ways that made roll-out in recipient countries difficult. Some donors even earmarked doses for specific recipients, complicating and potentially undermining COVAX's equitable allocation mechanism. Conclusions COVAX's pivot from global vaccine procurement mechanism to dose-sharing hub can be seen as a "win-win-win" solution for COVAX itself (who could claim success by having access to more doses), for donor countries (who could rebrand themselves as charitable donors rather than "vaccine hoarders"), and for the pharmaceutical industry (maintaining the status quo on intellectual property rights and protecting their commercial interests). Although dose-sharing helped COVAX's vaccine delivery, its impact was undermined by donors' and industry's pursuit of national security, diplomatic and commercial interests, which COVAX largely accommodated. The lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms within COVAX's overly complex governance structure as a global public-private partnership enabled these practices.

Modeling comparative cost-effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose fractionation in India	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							IMPACT	A multi-scale model using population-level transmission and individual-level vaccination data suggests that vaccine dose fractionation could be a cost-effective strategy for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Given global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine shortages and inequity of vaccine distributions, fractionation of vaccine doses might be an effective strategy for reducing public health and economic burden, notwithstanding the emergence of new variants of concern. In this study, we developed a multi-scale model incorporating population-level transmission and individual-level vaccination to estimate the costs of hospitalization and vaccination and the economic benefits of reducing COVID-19 deaths due to dose-fractionation strategies in India. We used large-scale survey data of the willingness to pay together with data of vaccine and hospital admission costs to build the model. We found that fractional doses of vaccines could be an economically viable vaccination strategy compared to alternatives of either full-dose vaccination or no vaccination. Dose-sparing strategies could save a large number of lives, even with the emergence of new variants with higher transmissibility.	[Du, Zhanwei; Lim, Wey Wen; Lau, Eric H.

J	Stein, PJS; Stein, MA				Stein, Penelope J. S.; Stein, Michael Ashley			Disability, Human Rights, and Climate Justice	HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY			English	Article							HEALTH; MIGRATION	The universally dire threat of climate change disproportionately affects marginalized populations, including the over one billion persons with disabilities worldwide. States that disregard the Paris Agreement, or exclude disabled persons from climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, are violating agreed-upon human rights obligations. Notably, the rights contained in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, are threatened by climate change. To date, however, disability has largely been excluded from international climate change negotiations as well as national-level discharge of climate-related measures. By contrast, a disability human rights approach views disabled persons as disproportionately experiencing environmental threats and unnatural disasters due to their exclusion from state laws, policies, and services available to their non-disabled peers. Additionally, a disability human rights approach mandates the removal of exclusionary barriers and the implementation of positive measures to ensure the equitable treatment of individuals with disabilities. Achieving disability-inclusive climate justice requires "participatory justice"-empowering persons with disabilities to ascertain climate mitigation and adaptation approaches that are efficacious for, successfully implementable by, and accountable to disabled people. Disability-inclusive climate justice solutions are in synergy with universal climate justice goals and benefit entire societies, not "only" those with disabilities.	[Stein, Penelope J.

Community pharmacies are uniquely placed to help people affected by DSVA. We examined factors that impact pharmacists' engagement in response to DSVA when providing public health services. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews with community pharmacists (n = 20) were analyzed thematically, with inductive themes mapped to the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) model. Results Pharmacists were confident in providing public health services, but a lack of DSVA training meant there is a need to support their 'Capability' to respond to DSVA. Pharmacies were perceived as highly accessible healthcare providers on the high street, with sexual health consultations offering an ideal 'Opportunity' to enquire about DSVA in a private consultation room. Pharmacist's 'Motivation' to enquire about DSVA was driven by potential positive client outcomes and a desire to be more involved in public heath interventions, but organisation- and system-level support and remuneration is needed. Conclusions Community pharmacy offers opportunities for integrating DSVA work in existing public health services. Pharmacists need training on DSVA, ongoing support, allocated funding for DSVA work, and awareness raising campaign for the public on their extended public health role.

Investing in a better future: higher education and post-COVID Canada	FACETS			English	Article						higher education; research; equity; diversity; inclusion; internationalization; public policy	INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS; UNIVERSITIES; ASSOCIATION; EXPERIENCES; INEQUALITY; FACULTY; POLICY	Post-secondary education (PSE) is a vital part of civil society and any modern economy. When broadly accessible, it can enable socioeconomic mobility, improve health outcomes, advance social cohesion, and support a highly skilled workforce. It yields public benefits not only in improved well-being and economic prosperity, but also in reduced costs in health care and social services. Canada also relies heavily on the PSE sector for research. During the COVID-19 pandemic, PSE has supported research related to the pandemic response and other critical areas, including providing expert advice to support public health and government decision-making, while maintaining educational programs and continuing to contribute to local and regional economies. But the pandemic effort has stretched already strained PSE resources and people even further: for decades, declining public investment has driven increases in tuition and decreases in faculty complement, undermining Canada's research capacity and increasing student debt as well as destabilizing the sector through a growing reliance on volatile international education markets. Given the challenges before us, including climate change, reconciliation, and the pandemic, it is imperative that we better draw on the full range of experience, knowledge, and creativity in Canada and beyond through an inclusive, stable, and globally engaged PSE. Supporting PSE's recovery will be key to Canada's ongoing pandemic response and recovery. The recommendations in this report are guided by a single goal-to make the post-secondary sector a more effective partner and support in building a more equitable, sustainable, and evidence-driven future for Canada, through and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on the authors' medical social science research, health delivery practice and clinical work from multiple locations in Africa. Europe and the Americas, the article describes three clinical cases in which assumptions of deservingness have significant implications for the morbidity and mortality of migrant patients. The concept of deservingness allows us to maintain a critical awareness of the often unspoken presumptions of which categories of patients are more or less deserving of access to and quality of care, regardless of their formal legal eligibility. Many transnational migrants with ambiguous legal status who rely on public healthcare experience exclusion from care or poor treatment based on notions of deservingness held by health clinic staff, clinicians and health system planners. The article proposes several implications for clinicians, health professional education, policymaking and advocacy. A critical lens on deservingness can help global health professionals, systems and policymakers confront and change entrenched patterns of unequal access to and differential quality of care for migrant patients. In this way, health professionals can work more effectively for global health equity.

Despite international recommendations, countries should consider their context-specific situation and define local research priorities. We aimed to exercise a priority-setting activity to identify the knowledge gaps and suggest research priorities in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Methods First, we tried to identify the contextual knowledge gaps based on an online survey, performing key informant interviews (i.e. health professionals, policy-makers and managers) and media analysis. We also performed a literature review and considered international research priorities for COVID-19. Subsequently, we prepared a list of research questions and challenges to respond to the COVID-19 crisis in Iran using a systems approach. Then we mapped approved COVID-19 research projects in the country to research questions. Finally, we compared the identified research questions (not challenges) with the prioritized research from international organizations and then prioritized them for Iran. Results We found risk factors and epidemiological dissemination patterns of the virus and its consequences in an epidemiology domain, implementation of clinical and hygiene in a clinical management domain, genetic studies for targeting prevention and treatment in a candidate treatment and vaccine research and development (R&D) knowledge domain, examination of the manifestations of ethics in society instead of ethics in research in an ethics domain, "care, access and health system" and "public health and participation in response to public health and clinical research" as two sub-domains of a social sciences domain, and finally, no new questions in either the virology, transmission, diagnosis or animal and environmental domain. Conclusions In the event of global health crises like COVID-19, prioritization of research questions can be done globally, but some of the research priorities are context-specific and may vary by regional needs. To better manage research resources, researchers must respond to the challenges faced in each country based on its political, economic, social and cultural characteristics, and to make evidence-informed decisions, global knowledge gaps must be customized in each country.

Refugees have been shown to be particularly negatively impacted in many countries, with existing structures of violence and insecurity worsened by the immediate consequences of the pandemic through policy responses which largely ignore their needs whether by excluding them from targeted COVID-19 mitigation measures, or by imposing restrictions which directly impact on their well-being. Our research with refugee women in Durban, South Africa, illustrates the ways in which COVID-19 has exacerbated their insecurities and intensified structural violence which renders them vulnerable. More importantly, it seems that the impacts of COVID-19 are not just short term but will deepen the violence and insecurities experienced by these women in the longer term if these are not addressed by government and relevant NGOs and civil society organizations.

Innovations in vaccine delivery: increasing access, coverage, and equity and lessons learnt from measles and rubella elimination	DRUG DELIVERY AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Measles; Microneedles; Microarray; Immunizations; Vaccines	MICRONEEDLE PATCH; IMMUNIZATION; ERADICATION; WORLDWIDE; PROGRESS; CHALLENGES; SMALLPOX	Disease eradication and elimination programs drive innovations based on progress toward measurable objectives, evaluations of new strategies and methods, programmatic experiences, and lessons learned from the field. Following progress toward global measles elimination, reducing measles mortality, and increasing introductions of measles and rubella vaccines to national programs, the measles and rubella immunization program has faced setbacks in recent years. Currently available vaccine delivery methods have complicated logistics and drawbacks that create barriers to vaccination; innovations for easier, more efficient, and safer vaccine delivery are needed. Progress can be accelerated by new technologies like microarray patches (MAPs) that are now widely recognized as a potential new tool for enhancing global immunizations efforts. Clinical trials of measles-rubella vaccine MAPs have begun, and several other vaccine MAPs are in the pre-clinical development pathway. MAPs could significantly contribute to Immunization Agenda 2030 priorities, including reaching zero-dose children; increasing vaccine access, demand, coverage, and equity; and achieving measles and rubella elimination. With strong partnerships between public health agencies and biotechnology companies, translational novel vaccine delivery systems can be developed to help solve public health problems and achieve global health priorities.

Recognizing this, the Riyadh Declaration on Digital Health, formulated by an international interdisciplinary team of medical, academic, and industry experts at the Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit in August 2020, provided a set of digital health recommendations for the global health community to address the challenges of current and future pandemics. However, guidance is needed on how to implement these recommendations in practice. OBJECTIVE To develop guidance for stakeholders on how best to deploy digital health and data and support public health in an integrated manner to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics. EVIDENCE REVIEW Themes were determined by first reviewing the literature and Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit conference proceedings, with experts independently contributing ideas. Then, 2 rounds of review were conducted until all experts agreed on the themes and main issues arising using a nominal group technique to reach consensus. Prioritization was based on how useful the consensus recommendation might be to a policy maker. FINDINGS A diverse stakeholder group of 13 leaders in the fields of public health, digital health, and health care were engaged to reach a consensus on how to implement digital health recommendations to address the challenges of current and future pandemics. Participants reached a consensus on high-priority issues identified within 5 themes: team, transparency and trust, technology, techquity (the strategic development and deployment of technology in health care and health to achieve health equity), and transformation. Each theme contains concrete points of consensus to guide the local, national, and international adoption of digital health to address challenges of current and future pandemics. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The consensus points described for these themes provide a roadmap for the implementation of digital health policy by all stakeholders, including governments. Implementation of these recommendations could have a significant impact by reducing fatalities and uniting countries on current and future battles against pandemics.

Setting Two districts in three fragile countries. Sierra Leone-Kenema and Bonthe districts; Liberia-two districts in Grand Bassa county one with international support for CHW activities and one without: Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)-Aru and Bunia districts in Ituri Province. Participants and methods Qualitative interviews with decision-makers and managers working in community health programmes and managing CHWs (n=36); life history interviews and photovoice with CHWs (n=15, in Sierra Leone only). Results While policies were put in place in Sierra Leone and Liberia to attract women to the newly paid position of CHW after the Ebola outbreak, these good intentions evaporated in practice. Gender norms at the community level, literacy levels and patriarchal expectations surrounding paid work meant that fewer women than imagined took up the role. Only in DRC, there were more women than men working as CHWs. Gender roles, norms and expectations in all contexts also affected retention and progression as well as safety, security and travel (over long distance and at night). Women CHWs also juggle between household and childcare responsibilities. Despite this, they were more likely to retain their position while men were more likely to leave and seek better paid employment. CHWs demonstrated agency in negotiating and challenging gender norms within their work and interactions supporting families. Conclusions Gender roles and relations shape CHW experiences across multiple levels of the health system. Health systems need to develop gender transformative human resource management strategies to address gender inequities and restrictive gender norms for this critical interface cadre.

J	Kazemi, M; Bragazzi, NL; Kong, JD				Kazemi, Mehrdad; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Kong, Jude Dzevela			Assessing Inequities in COVID-19 Vaccine Roll-Out Strategy Programs: A Cross-Country Study Using a Machine Learning Approach	VACCINES			English	Article						COVID-19; pandemic; vaccine roll-out; cross-country analysis; machine learning; Random forest		After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and its spread across the world, countries have adopted containment measures to stop its transmission, limit fatalities, and relieve hospitals from straining and overwhelming conditions imposed by the virus. Many countries implemented social distancing and lockdown strategies that negatively impacted their economies and the psychological wellbeing of their citizens, even though they contributed to saving lives. Recently approved and available, COVID-19 vaccines can provide a really viable and sustainable option for controlling the pandemic. However, their uptake represents a global challenge due to vaccine hesitancy and logistic-organizational hurdles that have made its distribution stagnant in several developed countries despite several appeals by the media, policy- and decision-makers, and community leaders. Vaccine distribution is also a concern in developing countries, where there is a scarcity of doses. The objective of the present study was to set up a metric to assess vaccination uptake and identify national socio-economic factors influencing this indicator. We conducted a cross-country study. We first estimated the vaccination uptake rate across countries by fitting a logistic model to reported daily case numbers. Using the uptake rate, we estimated the vaccine roll-out index. Next, we used Random Forest, an "off-the-shelf" machine learning algorithm, to study the association between vaccination uptake rate and socio-economic factors. We found that the mean vaccine roll-out index is 0.016 (standard deviation 0.016), with a range between 0.0001 (Haiti) and 0.0829 (Mongolia). The top four factors associated with the vaccine roll-out index are the median per capita income, human development index, percentage of individuals who have used the internet in the last three months, and health expenditure per capita. The still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the disparity in vaccine adoption across low- and high-income countries, which represents a global public health challenge. We must pave the way for universal access to vaccines and other approved treatments, regardless of demographic structures and underlying health conditions. Income disparity remains, instead, an important cause of vaccine inequity, which restricts the functioning of the global vaccine allocation framework and, thus, the ending of the pandemic. Stronger mechanisms are needed to foster countries' political willingness to promote vaccine and drug access equity in a globalized society where future pandemics and other global health crises can be anticipated.

An ecological analysis of mortality records	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							HEALTH; WALES; DEPRIVATION; GEOGRAPHY; RISE; CUTS	Background Policy responses to the Global Financial Crisis emphasized wide-ranging fiscal austerity measures, many of which have been found to negatively impact health outcomes. This paper investigates change in patterns of mortality at local authority level in England (2010-11 to 2017-18) and the relation with fiscal austerity measures. Methods Data from official local authority administrative records are used to quantify the gap between observed deaths and what was anticipated in the 2010-based subnational population projections. Regression analyses are used to explore the relation between excess deaths, austerity and wider process of population change at local authority level. Results We estimate 231 707 total excess deaths, the majority of which occurred since 2014-15 (89%) across the majority of local authorities (91%). Austerity is positively associated with excess deaths. For working age adults, there is a clear gradient to the impact of austerity, whereas for older adults, the impact is more uniform. Conclusions Fiscal austerity policies contributed to an excess of deaths for older people and widened social inequalities for younger populations. These results call for an end to all austerity measures and require further research into areas with the highest total excess deaths as a priority following the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to measure the contribution of individual and socio-economic factors involved in PG risk among adolescents from 30 European countries. Design Multi-level logistic regression analysis of survey data from the 2019 European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) cross-sectional study using self-administered anonymous questionnaires. Setting Thirty European countries. Participants A representative cohort of 15-16-year-old students (n = 88 998 students; males = 49.2%). Measurements The primary outcome measure was adolescents' (low and high) risk of PG. Individual key predictors included self-report assessments of socio-demographic characteristics, time spent gaming and family variables (parental regulation and monitoring, family support). Main country-level predictors comprised Gini coefficient for economic inequalities and benefits for families and children (% gross domestic product), retrieved from international public data sets and national thematic reports. The data analysis plan involved multi-level logistic regression. Findings Participants who reported stronger parental regulation [odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.79-0.83] and higher family support (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.91-0.95) reported lower risk of PG. At the country-level, economic inequalities (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03-1.07) were positively associated with the risk of PG, while benefits for families and children (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.70-0.89) were negatively correlated with the risk of PG. Conclusions Supportive family environments, lower country-level economic inequalities and higher government expenditures on benefits for families and children appear to be associated with a lower risk of problematic gaming among European adolescents.

Population-wide contribution of medically assisted reproductive technologies to overall births in Australia: temporal trends and parental characteristics	HUMAN REPRODUCTION			English	Article						reproductive technologies; population-based studies; birth rate; parental characteristics; social inequality; Australia	IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION; SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITIES; CLOMIPHENE CITRATE; HUMAN EMBRYOS; INFERTILITY; CRYOPRESERVATION; VITRIFICATION; LETROZOLE; OUTCOMES; ACCESS	STUDY QUESTION In a country with supportive funding for medically assisted reproduction (MAR) technologies, what is the proportion of MAR births over-time? SUMMARY ANSWER In 2017, 6.7% of births were conceived by MAR (4.8% ART and 1.9% ovulation induction (OI)/IUI) with a 55% increase in ART births and a stable contribution from OI/IUI births over the past decade. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY There is considerable global variation in utilization rates of ART despite a similar infertility prevalence worldwide. While the overall contribution of ART to national births is known in many countries because of ART registries, very little is known about the contribution of OI/IUI treatment or the socio-demographic characteristics of the parents. Australia provides supportive public funding for all forms of MAR with no restrictions based on male or female age, and thus provides a unique setting to investigate the contribution of MAR to national births as well as the socio-demographic characteristics of parents across the different types of MAR births. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This is a novel population-based birth cohort study of 898 084 births using linked ART registry data and administrative data including birth registrations, medical services, pharmaceuticals, hospital admissions and deaths. Birth (a live or still birth of at least one baby of >= 400 g birthweight or >= 20 weeks' gestation) was the unit of analysis in this study. Multiple births were considered as one birth in our analysis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS This study included a total of 898 084 births (606 488 mothers) in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Australia 2009-2017. We calculated the prevalence of all categories of MAR-conceived births over the study period. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between parental characteristics (parent's age, parity, socio-economic status, maternal country of birth, remoteness of mother's dwelling, pre-existing medical conditions, smoking, etc.) and ART and OI/IUI births relative to naturally conceived births. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The proportion of MAR births increased from 5.1% of all births in 2009 to 6.7% in 2017, representing a 30% increase over the decade. The proportion of OI/IUI births remained stable at around 2% of all births, representing 32% of all MAR births. Over the study period, ART births conceived by frozen embryo-transfer increased nearly 3-fold. OI/IUI births conceived using clomiphene citrate decreased by 39%, while OI/IUI births conceived using letrozole increased 56-fold. Overall, there was a 55% increase over the study period in the number of ART-conceived births, rising to 56% of births to mothers aged 40 years and older. In 2017, almost one in six births (17.6%) to mothers aged 40 years and over were conceived using ART treatment. Conversely, the proportion of OI/IUI births was similar across different mother's age groups and remained stable over the study period. ART children, but not OI/IUI children, were more likely to have parents who were socio-economically advantaged compared to naturally conceived children. For example, compared to naturally conceived births, ART births were 16% less likely to be born to mothers who live in the disadvantaged neighbourhoods after accounting for other covariates (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 0.84 [95% CI: 0.81-0.88]). ART- or OI/IUI-conceived children were 25% less likely to be born to immigrant mothers than births after natural conception (aRR: 0.75 [0.74-0.77]). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The social inequalities that we observed between the parents of children born using ART and naturally conceived children may not directly reflect disparities in accessing fertility care for individuals seeking treatment. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS With the ubiquitous decline in fertility rates around the world and the increasing trend to delay childbearing, this population-based study enhances our understanding of the contribution of different types of MARs to population profiles among births in high-income countries. The parental socio-demographic characteristics of MAR-conceived children differ significantly from naturally conceived children and this highlights the importance of accounting for such differences in studies investigating the health and development of MAR-conceived children.

Drowning risk and climate change: a state-of-the-art review	INJURY PREVENTION			English	Review						policy; public health; disaster; immigrant; refugee; low-middle income country; exposure	FISHING COMMUNITIES; BANGLADESH; MORTALITY; DISASTER; DEATHS; CYCLONES; CHILDREN; CITIES; HEALTH	Drowning and climate change are both significant global health threats, yet little research links climate change to drowning risk. Research into the epidemiology, risk factors and preventive strategies for unintentional drowning in high-income and in low-income and middle-income countries has expanded understanding, but understanding of disaster and extreme weather-related drowning needs research focus. As nation states and researchers call for action on climate change, its impact on drowning has been largely ignored. This state-of-the-art review considers existing literature on climate change as a contributor to changes in drowning risks globally. Using selected climate change-related risks identified by the World Meteorological Organization and key risks to the Sustainable Development Goals as a framework, we consider the drowning risks associated with heat waves, hydrometeorological hazards, drought and water scarcity, damaged infrastructure, marine ecosystem collapse, displacement, and rising poverty and inequality. Although the degree of atmospheric warming remains uncertain, the impact of climate change on drowning risk is already taking place and can no longer be ignored. Greater evidence characterising the links between drowning and climate change across both high-income and low-income and middle-income contexts is required, and the implementation and evaluation of drowning interventions must reflect climate change risks at a local level, accounting for both geographical variation and the consequences of inequality. Furthermore, collaboration between the injury prevention, disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation sectors is crucial to both prevent climate change from stalling progress on preventing drowning and further advocate for climate change mitigation as a drowning risk reduction mechanism.

This study aims to explore whether the increase in female physicians has translated to increased female representation among surgical specialties in Brazil. Methods: Data on gender, years of practice, and specialty was extracted from Demografia Medica do Brasil, from 2015 to 2020. The percentage of women across 18 surgical, anesthesia, and obstetric (SAO) specialties and the relative increases in female representation during the study period were calculated. Results: Of the 18 SAO specialties studied, 16 (88%) were predominantly male (>50%). Only obstetrics/gynecology and breast surgery showed a female predominance, with 58% and 52%, respectively. Urology, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery and traumatology were the three specialties with the largest presence of men -and the lowest absolute growth in the female workforce from 2015 to 2020. Conclusions: In Brazil, where significant gender disparities persist, women are still underrepresented in surgical specialties. Female presence is predominant in surgical specialties dedicated to the care of female patients, while it remains poor in those with male patient dominance. Over the last 5 y, the proportion of women working in SAO specialties has grown, but not as much as in nonsurgical specialties. Future studies should focus on investigating the causes of gender disparities in Brazil to understand and tackle the barriers to pursuing surgical specialties. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, policy efforts and the monitoring of global goals and agendas such as the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and UN-Habitat New Urban Agenda are hindered by the unavailability of statistical and spatial data at metropolitan, city and sub-city scales. Deprivation is a complex and multidimensional concept, and presently, there is a strong focus within the existing literature on household-level (including individual) deprivation and less on area-level deprivation and this is problematic because deprivation at the area and household-level are known to interrelate and result in multiple challenges for individuals and communities. Within this scoping review, we build on existing literature that focuses on household-or area-level deprivation to arrive at a combined understanding of how urban deprivation is defined in relation to LMIC cities. The scoping review of existing literature was used in conjunction with local stakeholder workshops to produce a framework titled "Domains of Deprivation Framework". The Domains of Deprivation Framework conceptualizes urban deprivation at three different scales, including at the household scale, within the area scale and at the area connect scale. It includes nine domains, (1) Socio-Economic Status and (2) Housing Domains (Household scale); (3) Social Hazards & Assets, (4) Physical Hazards & Assets, (5) Unplanned Urbanization and (6) Contamination (Within Area scale); and (7) Infrastructure, (8) Facilities & Services and (9) City Governance (Area Connect scale). The Domains of Deprivation Framework is designed to support diverse urban, health, poverty, and development initiatives globally to characterize and address deprivation in LMIC cities from a holistic perspective, combining traditional data sources (e.g., surveys or census data) with new data sources (e.g., Earth Observation data).

The scientific evidence grounding sanitary and social distancing recommendations is embedded in conceptualisations of work as skilled jobs in the formal economy and of family as urban and nuclear. These are Global North rather than universal paradigms. We build on theories from the South and an intersectional analysis of gender and class inequalities to highlight contextual complexities currently neglected in responses to COVID-19. We argue that building on both science and local knowledge can help democratise workable solutions for a range of different work, family and employment realities in the Global South. Finally, we propose a research agenda calling for strengthened North-South dialogue to provincialise knowledge, account for differences in histories, locality and resource-availability, and foster greater local participation in policy formulation regarding sanitary measures and vaccination campaigns.

Yet the health effects of exposure to nano-and microplastics (NMPs) remain largely uninvestigated or unknown. Although plastic chemicals are a well-established research topic, the impacts of plastic particles are unexplored, especially with regard to early life exposures. OBJECTIVES: This commentary aims to summarize the knowns and unknowns around child-and pregnancy-relevant exposures to NMPs via inhalation, placental transfer, ingestion and breastmilk, and dermal absorption. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search to map the state of the science on NMPs found 37 primary research articles on the health relevance of NMPs during early life and revealed major knowledge gaps in the field. We discuss opportunities and challenges for quantifying child-specific exposures (e.g., NMPs in breastmilk or infant formula) and health effects, in light of global inequalities in baby bottle use, consumption of packaged foods, air pollution, hazardous plastic disposal, and regulatory safeguards. We also summarize research needs for linking child health and NMP exposures and address the unknowns in the context of public health action. DISCUSSION: Few studies have addressed child-specific sources of exposure, and exposure estimates currently rely on generic assumptions rather than empirical measurements. Furthermore, toxicological research on NMPs has not specifically focused on child health, yet children's immature defense mechanisms make them particularly vulnerable. Apart from few studies investigating the placental transfer of NMPs, the physicochemical properties (e.g., polymer, size, shape, charge) driving the absorption, biodistribution, and elimination in early life have yet to be benchmarked. Accordingly, the evidence base regarding the potential health impacts of NMPs in early life remains sparse. Based on the evidence to date, we provide recommendations to fill research gaps, stimulate policymakers and industry to address the safety of NMPs, and point to opportunities for families to reduce early life exposures to plastic.

Evidence from a quasi-longitudinal benefit incidence analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Benefit incidence analysis; health spending; inequality; health care utilization; Malawi	CARE; INCOME; POOR; EXPENDITURE; INEQUALITY; DEMAND; LEVEL	Background Malawi is one of a handful of countries that had resisted the implementation of user fees, showing a commitment to providing free healthcare to its population even before the concept of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) acquired global popularity. Several evaluations have investigated the effects of key policies, such as the essential health package or performance-based financing, in sustaining and expanding access to quality health services in the country. Understanding the distributional impact of health spending over time due to these policies has received limited attention. Our study fills this knowledge gap by assessing the distributional incidence of public and overall health spending between 2004 and 2016. Methods We relied on a Benefit Incidence Analysis (BIA) to measure the socioeconomic inequality of public and overall health spending on curative services and institutional delivery across different health facility typologies. We used data from household surveys and National Health Accounts. We used a concentration index (CI) to determine the health benefits accrued by each socioeconomic group. Results Socioeconomic inequality in both public and overall health spending substantially decreased over time, with higher inequality observed in overall spending, non-public health facilities, curative health services, and at higher levels of care. Between 2004 and 2016, the inequality in public spending on curative services decreased from a CI of 0.037 (SE 0.013) to a CI of 0.004 (SE 0.011). Whiles, it decreased from a CI of 0.084 (SE 0.014) to a CI of 0.068 (SE 0.015) for overall spending in the same period. For institutional delivery, inequality in public and overall spending decreased between 2004 and 2016 from a CI of 0.032 (SE 0.028) to a CI of -0.057 (SE 0.014) and from a CI of 0.036 (SE 0.022) to a CI of 0.028 (SE 0.018), respectively. Conclusions Through its free healthcare policy, Malawi has reduced socioeconomic inequality in health spending over time, but some challenges still need to be addressed to achieve a truly egalitarian health system. Our findings indicate a need to increase public funding for the health sector to ensure access to care and financial protection.

Newer variants of interest and concern have continued to emerge, placing the need for policymakers to rethink prevention strategies to end the pandemic. The approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for public health use in December 2020 was seen as a significant development towards pandemic control and possibly ending the pandemic. However, breakthrough infections have continued to be observed among the 'fully vaccinated', and the duration and sustainability of vaccine-induced immunity has remained a topical public health discourse. In the absence of accurate public health communication, the breakthrough infections and waning immunity concepts have potential to further compound vaccine hesitancy. With this viewpoint, we discuss breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections, waning immunity, the need for COVID-19 booster shots, vaccine inequities, and the need to address vaccine hesitancy adequately to propel global vaccination programs forward.

Tools assessing attitudes about poverty have been used in nursing education studies to examine the beliefs of nursing students. Design An integrative literature review was carried out in five international databases in the areas of health and nursing and in four Latin American and Caribbean databases. Results Four tools were identified, with Attitude Toward Poverty Short Form and Attitudes about Poverty and Poor People being the most used in the studies. Items from tools measured attitudes negative, prejudiced, and stigmatizing about the population living in poverty. In addition, items from tools measured a range of concepts from poverty to social inequality and disenfranchisement. Conclusion The identification of poverty is a critical strategy for tackling poverty. In this sense, poverty assessment tools have the potential to recognize poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon.

The objective of this study was to compare the burden and the quality-of-care of liver cancer by causes among different countries and regions in both sexes and various age groups 1990-2019. Data of liver cancer and underlying causes, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol use, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other causes were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases 2019. Incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were assessed. Principal component analysis was used to combine age-standardized mortality-to-incidence ratio, DALY-to-prevalence ratio, prevalence-to-incidence ratio, and years of life lost-to-years lived with disability into a single proxy named Quality of Care Index (QCI). Globally, the age-standardized incidence, DALYs, and death rates decreased from 1990 to 2019, while the QCI scores increased by 68.5%. The QCI score of liver cancer was from as high as 83.3 in high Sociodemographic Index (SDI) countries to values as low as 26.4 in low SDI countries in 2019. Japan had the highest QCI score (QCI = 100). The age-standardized death rates of liver cancer due to all underlying causes were decreasing during the past 30 years, with the most decrease for HBV. Consistently, the global QCI scores of liver cancer due to HBV, HCV, alcohol use, NASH, and other causes reached 53.5, 61.8, 54.3, 52.9, and 63.7, respectively, in 2019. Conclusion: Although the trends in burden are decreasing and the QCI improved from 1990 to 2019 globally, there is a wide gap between countries. Given the inequities in health care quality, there is an urgent need to address discrimination and bridge the gap.

The pandemic health crisis is bound to an economic and social crisis marked by an increase in unemployment and a decrease in income with a consequent growth of food and nutritional insecurity. The impacts are felt worldwide, although the situation in each country, with regard to the conditions of social inequality and access to food, influences the magnitude of the pandemic consequences. At the same time, we are aware that food and nutritional insecurity is associated with low food quality and higher rates of obesity, which impairs the immune response and predisposes to worse prognosis. Thus, more economically vulnerable populations must face poorer disease outcome, besides the worsening of the economic situation and food and nutritional insecurity and the increase in obesity rates.

This review systematically reviewed 57 articles and extended the developmental outcome to six key impact themes, with some articles identifying more themes than others: behavioral (n = 34), mental health (n = 26), social relationships (n = 17), academic performance (n = 17), substance use (n = 10), and short-term and long-term physical health (n = 6). To provide a global review, this study examined research across nations from Western to Eastern countries, consisting of 126,690 children and adolescents with incarcerated parents against 577,445 peers with no parents of such histories. Most children and adolescents exposed to parental incarceration are vulnerable to mental health impacts including anxiety, behavioral issues and school performance. The earlier the exposure to parental incarceration, the greater the risk of marijuana use, sexually transmitted infection and multiple partnerships in adolescence. These challenges often continue into emerging adulthood. This review found that the well-being of parents, positive family relationships and successful co-parenting can offset some adverse impacts. Future research lines and implications for preventive support to such children, adolescents and families are discussed.

Emerging empirical evidence suggests a decline in certain crimes (e.g., theft, robbery, and assault) but also proliferation of different violent behaviors and cybercriminal activity during the pandemic. To explain those trends, we draw on existent theories and elaborate on how crime and violence have been affected by the changes in people's daily routines and accumulated stressful conditions. However, as recent crime trends appear to be largely inconsistent and vary across social groups and contexts, we argue that social scientists need to pay particular attention to the differential experiences related to crime and violence during this global crisis. Specifically, because of the disproportionate experience of violence by vulnerable groups including minorities and women as well as the unique cross-national variations in deviance, more nuanced approaches to understanding causes of crime are warranted. We also discuss the limitations of present research and provide recommendations for the development of comparative and multi-disciplinary studies on criminal and deviant behaviors that are influenced by human crisis situations.

However, many high-income countries have adopted a "me first" approach, proceeding to offer COVID-19 booster doses to their entire populations, including those at least risk of severe illness, whilst the rest of the world is left unvaccinated or partially vaccinated with one dose for even their most vulnerable communities. Main body COVID-19 vaccine inequity places the health of the global population at risk and exacerbates socio-economic repercussions, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Initiatives launched to combat vaccine inequity such as the Fair Allocation Framework for the COVID-19 Vaccines (COVAX) have been unsuccessful as several governments, primarily from high-income countries, have scaled down their contributions to the initiative. Furthermore, COVAX has not seriously engaged with the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Health Systems Connector, as was originally intended, leading to crucial health systems components critical to vaccine delivery to be overlooked. Several strategies can be employed to help achieve the desired global immunization goals, such as Intellectual Property waivers, increased donations, and activation of new COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing hubs. In addition, continued advocacy for vaccine equity by all involved and affected stakeholders, as well as critical amendments to existing or upcoming legislation and funding mechanisms will help address the shortcomings of current inequitable vaccine distribution. Conclusions Global solidarity and collective action through pandemic governance mechanisms are urgently needed to ensure vaccine equity. These interventions are vital to rapidly mitigate ongoing health and humanitarian crises and ultimately curb the pandemic, sooner rather than later.

This study used body mapping, a visual participatory research method, to learn from adolescents ages 15 to 17 living in Lucknow slums about how gender norms affect their daily experiences. Forty adolescents participated in body mapping. Their body maps and narratives about those maps demonstrate that starting in adolescence, family and community members strongly enforce divergent gender norms for girls and boys. Girls face restrictions on their clothing, mobility, and education, whereas boys have comparative freedom in these domains. Girls experience persistent public harassment by boys and men, severely constraining their ability to move freely in public spaces. In contrast, the school was a setting where adolescent girls and boys experience more relaxed gender norms. Overall, this study describes the link between gender norms, health, and well-being for adolescents. It also illustrates the value of participatory and adolescent-friendly research methods for exploring gender norms among adolescent boys and girls in India. Finally, it indicates that multi-system approaches are needed to address gender-related inequalities in health and well-being.

Yet, our systematic review of the business-health literature reveals that business research focuses primarily on occupational health and safety, health care organizations, and health regulations. To embrace the health externalities generated by business activities, we propose that future research should investigate the conditions under which business (a) articulates and participates in health challenges, (b) engages in multilevel actions toward tackling health challenges, and (c) improves health outcomes and its impact on the health of external stakeholders, including customers and local communities. We also urge business scholars to engage with the public health research community to increase impact.

Lack of basic epidemiologic understanding of the disease burden in these regions poses a significant knowledge gap as solutions can only be developed and sustained if the scope of the problem is accurately defined. Congenital heart disease (CHD), for example, is the most common birth defect in children. The prevalence of CHD from 1990 to 2017 has progressively increased by 18.7% and more than 90% of children with CHD are born in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). If diagnosed and managed in a timely manner, as in high-income countries (HICs), most children lead a healthy life and achieve adulthood. However, children with CHD in LMICs have limited care available with subsequent impact on survival. The large disparity in global health research focus on this complex disease makes it a solid paradigm to shape the debate. Despite many challenges, an essential aspect of improving research in LMICs is the realization and ownership of the problem around paucity of local evidence by patients, health care providers, academic centers, and governments in these countries. We have created a theory of change model to address these challenges at a micro- (individual patient or physician or institutions delivering health care) and a macro- (government and health ministries) level, presenting suggested solutions for these complex problems. All stakeholders in the society, from government bodies, health ministries, and systems, to frontline healthcare workers and patients, need to be invested in addressing the local health problems and significantly increase data to define and improve the gaps in care in LMICs. Moreover, interventions can be designed for a more collaborative and effective HIC-LMIC and LMIC-LMIC partnership to increase resources, capacity building, and representation for long-term productivity.

Objective To develop a conceptual ICD-10 taxonomic framework for population health surveillance across all-phases of spinal cord injury and disorders (SCI/D). Setting Public Hospital Admitted Patient Care (APC) collection, South Australian Dept. Health, South Australia, Australia. Methods A core ICD-10-Australian Modification (AM) coded dataset was retrieved from the APC hospital patient admission collection (2012-2017). Search filters and key words referenced to the National Library of Medicine thesaurus identified and quantified incident SCI/D cases. Incident SCI/D case data held in the Australian Spinal Cord Injury Registry (ASCIR) of South Australia (2012-2017) tested fidelity. Data linkage to the South Australian Death Registry controlled for cohort attrition. Both unadjusted and case-mix adjusted core data set yields were evaluated. Outcomes were assessed in terms of APC frequency difference (Delta%) versus ASCIR. Results 3,504 APC cases were extracted, of which 504 (mean, SD age 55 +/- 20 yrs; 348 [69%] male, 202 [39%] traumatic; 135 [32%]) cervical; 51 [10.1%] thoracic and (16 [3.2%]) lumbar met criteria. Comparator data were 385 ASCIR new index cases mean, SD age 56 +/- 19 yrs, 229 [75%] male, 162 [42%] traumatic. Case-mix adjusted analysis yielded 336 (APC Delta 33%) all-cause incident cases (vs. ASCIR -13 Delta%) and 131 incident cases of traumatic aetiologies (vs. ASCIR -19 Delta%). Conclusions The ICD-10 core "Health Condition" data-set assembled extends our understanding of SCI/D epidemiology and with further development may create a cost-efficient and sustainable framework that will improve health system performance and equity within and between countries.

A comparative analysis of the financial and health support in eleven countries	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						COVID-19; Pandemic; Communication; Travel	MENTAL-HEALTH; READABILITY; INFORMATION; IMPACT; DISASTER; EXPOSURE	Background In response to the continuing threat of importing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many countries have implemented some form of border restriction. A repercussion of these restrictions has been that some travellers have found themselves stranded abroad unable to return to their country of residence, and in need for government support. Our analysis explores the COVID-19-related information and support options provided by 11 countries to their citizens stranded overseas due to travel restrictions. We also examined the quality (i.e., readability, accessibility, and useability) of the information that was available from selected governments' web-based resources. Methods Between June 18 to June 30, 2021, COVID-19-related webpages from 11 countries (Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Canada, United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (UK), France, Spain, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand) were reviewed and content relating to information and support for citizens stuck overseas analysed. Government assistance-related data from each webpage was extracted and coded for the following themes: travel arrangements, health and wellbeing, finance and accommodation, information needs, and sources. Readability was examined using the Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) and the Flesch Kincaid readability tests; content 'accessibility' was measured using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.1; and content 'usability' assessed using the usability heuristics for website design tool. Results Ninety-eight webpages from 34 websites were evaluated. No country assessed covered all themes analysed. Most provided information and some level of support regarding repatriation options; border control and re-entry measures; medical assistance; and traveller registration. Only three countries provided information or support for emergency housing while abroad, and six provided some form of mental health support for their citizens. Our analysis of the quality of COVID-19-related information available on a subset of four countries' websites found poor readability and multiple accessibility and usability issues. Conclusion This study uniquely analyses government support for citizens stuck abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic. With large variance in the information and services available across the countries analysed, our results highlight gaps, inconsistencies, and potential inequities in support available, and raise issues pertinent to the quality, accessibility, and usability of information. This study will assist policymakers plan and communicate comprehensive support packages for citizens stuck abroad due to the COVID-19 situation and design future efforts to prepare for global public health emergencies.

Using a nationally representative sample of U.S. incarcerated adults (N = 1,319) from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies, we examine patterns in health information seeking behavior. We find incarcerated persons report television (72.9%) and social contacts (61.8%) as their most common sources of health information and use of magazines and books/brochures is significantly related to better health. We argue that asking incarcerated patients how they get health information and using this knowledge to provide them with health information in formats they will use are important steps toward reducing incarcerated individuals' health disparities.

This human rights violation is disproportionately experienced by HIV key populations including female sex workers (FSW), people who inject drugs (PWID), and men who have sex with men (MSM). Consequently, addressing GBV is a global priority in HIV response. There is limited consensus about optimal interventions and little known about effectiveness. Our systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. Peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed literature were searched for articles that described a GBV prevention or response intervention specifically for key populations including FSW, PWID, and MSM. Results were organized by level(s) of implementation and pillars of a comprehensive GBV response: prevention, survivor support, and accountability/justice. Of 4,287 articles following removal of duplicates, 32 unique interventions (21 FSW, seven PWID, and nine MSM, not mutually exclusive) met inclusion criteria, representing 13 countries. Multisectoral interventions blended empowerment, advocacy, and crisis response with reductions in violence. Individual-level interventions included violence screening and response services. Violence-related safety promotion and risk reduction counseling within HIV risk reduction programming reduced violence. Quantitative evaluations were limited. Violence prevention and response interventions for FSW, PWID, and MSM span individual, community, and multisectoral levels with evidence of promising practices at each level. The strongest evidence supported addressing violence in the context of sexually transmitted infection/HIV risk reduction. As interventions continue to emerge, the rigor of accompanying evaluations must simultaneously advance to enable clarity on the health and safety impact of GBV prevention and response programming.

Scaling Up Patient-Centered Psychological Treatments for Perinatal Depression in the Wake of a Global Pandemic	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						task sharing; perinatal depression; health equity; telemedicine; psychotherapy	CULTURAL COMPETENCE; DISPARITIES; CARE; INTERVENTION	There is a call to action to reduce the public health burden of perinatal depression worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted significant gaps in perinatal mental health care, especially among women who identify as Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC). While psychotherapeutic (cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal) interventions are endorsed for perinatal mood disorders, barriers to access and uptake contribute to inequitable access to treatment at the population level. To effectively address these barriers and increase the scalability of psychotherapy among perinatal women, we suggest four pragmatic questions to be answered from a patient-centered lens; namely, "who," "what," "how," and "when." Promising avenues include task-sharing among mental health non-specialists, an emphasis on culturally sensitive care, web-based delivery of psychotherapy with some caveats, and a lifespan approach to perinatal mental health. Innovative research efforts are seeking to validate these approaches in diverse contexts across North America and the UK, lending optimism toward scalable and long-term solutions for equitable perinatal mental health care.

Public health responses to these events focused on discrimination by police and structural racism in broader society. However, police violence is but one of many forms of racialized violence propagated by structural racism and anti-Black racism in particular. We aim to expand the current public health dialogue by describing how structural racism and structural violence are deeply interrelated; embedded in institutions, systems, and processes; and threaten health, safety, and well-being across the life course for racialized minority groups. Structural racism and structural violence are threats to health equity and anti-racist public health work.

Methods: Four repeated population-based surveys were carried out. PA was collected using a questionnaire proposed by the authors and an adapted version of the leisure-time section of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The sociodemographic variables were sex, age, skin color, and education level. The participants also answered questions regarding social distancing measures compliance. Descriptive analyses based on proportions and their respective P values for categorical variables were presented. The chi-square test for heterogeneity and linear trend was used. Results: The sample is composed of 1556 individuals (66.1% female). Overall, between rounds 1 and 2. PA prevalence declined, followed by a gradual increase thereafter. PA practice during the pandemic was higher among men, individuals with higher education level, and individuals with white skin color in all rounds. In rounds 2, 3, and 4, PA was lower among individuals who were practicing more social distancing. Conclusion: To tackle the PA inequalities, policymakers and stakeholders need to confront disparities, defending greater availability of public policies that are attentive to inequalities, especially regarding gender, skin color, and educational level, to promote PA as a human right.

Global Trends of Mean and Inequality in Multidimensional Wellbeing: Analysis of 1.2 Million Individuals From 162 Countries, 2009-2019	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						human flourishing; multidimensional wellbeing; life evaluation; inequality; epidemiology	HEALTH; LIFE; PURPOSE; MORTALITY	IntroductionHuman flourishing is a multidimensional concept characterized by a state of complete wellbeing. However, much of the prior research on wellbeing has principally focused on population averages assessed using a single item of wellbeing. This study examined trends in population averages and inequalities for a multidimensional index of wellbeing and compared emergent patterns with those found for Cantril's ladder, a measure of life satisfaction commonly used as a unidimensional index of wellbeing. MethodsData were from the Gallup World Poll from the years 2009 to 2019, a repeated cross-sectional survey of nationally representative samples comprising ~1.2 million individuals from 162 countries. We assessed five domains of flourishing: (1) happiness, (2) health, (3) purpose, (4) character, and (5) social relationships. We used the Gini Index to estimate inequalities in wellbeing within populations. We examined and compared country ranking, global and region-specific trajectories of mean and inequality, and relationships with age for flourishing and Cantril's ladder. ResultsAlthough all trends were highly correlated across the two metrics of wellbeing, we identified distinct patterns in flourishing concerning geography, time, and age relationships that were not observed for Cantril's ladder. Temporal trends and age relationships were different across domains of flourishing. Evidence of changing inequalities in wellbeing was also found, even when population averages were high or stable over time. ConclusionComprehensive measures of wellbeing are needed to capture the complex and changing patterns of wellbeing both within and across populations.

J	Phelan, A; Ross, H; Adhuri, DS; Richards, R				Phelan, Anna (Anya); Ross, Helen; Adhuri, Dedi S.; Richards, Russell			Equity in a sea of debt: how better understanding of small-scale fisheries can help reel in sustainable seafood	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						fishing communities; fisheries value chains; poverty trade dynamic; small-scale fisheries; socially responsible seafood; sustainability of fisheries	FAIR TRADE; MANAGEMENT; ARCHIPELAGO; LIVELIHOODS; NETWORKS; BUSINESS; IMPACTS; FUTURE; MARKET	Small-scale fisheries are globally important to food security, nutrition, culture, ecosystem health, and livelihoods for millions of people. They also face considerable ecological, and economic pressures, including climate change, privatization, and top-down decision-making. Historically, processes of exclusion (e.g. industrialization, market forces, and settler colonialism) have persisted in the global food system. To mitigate against such processes and protect the livelihoods and human rights of small-scale fishers, the socially responsible seafood movement has emerged. This paper examines the local relationships in a seafood value chain in Indonesia, which extends from village fishers to international export markets. We present a case study from Sumbawa Indonesia, where a foreign direct seafood exporter is focused on sourcing socially responsible seafood from waters worked by small-scale fishers. Applying a systems lens, we analyse how a system driven by market forces and underpinned by western values can integrate with a system driven by traditional customs, social ties, and trust. The findings demonstrate that social connections and feedbacks within the value chain play a key role. Systems thinking reveals pathways to help synergize the two systems. This research shows that to deliver on the promise of socially responsible seafood, better understanding is needed of the interconnected social, cultural, and economic ties of small-scale fishers.

Assessing the social patterning and magnitude of inequalities in sexual violence among young women in Uganda: Findings from 2016 demographic and health survey	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Abuse; adolescents; women; inequity; Africa	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES; EARLY MARRIAGE; HIV-INFECTION; SOUTH-AFRICA; RISK; MALTREATMENT; GENDER; ABUSE; YOUTH	Sexual violence (SV) is a significant global public health problem. To develop effectively targeted interventions to prevent SV and allocate resources equitably requires identifying the most vulnerable groups and the magnitude of these social inequities. However, these data are currently lacking. Using the Uganda Demographic and Health Survey, we examined SV among all young women and ever-married young women. We conducted univariate and bivariate analyses to characterise the prevalence and social patterning of SV, and then utilised the World Health Organization Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) to assess the magnitude of social inequities in SV. At the national level, 5.5% among all young women and 20.5% of ever-married young women had experienced SV. For all young women, the largest inequities in SV were based on sub-national region of residence. Among the ever-married young women, we found profound education, wealth and place-based inequities in SV, which favoured young women with higher education, in wealthier households, and within central regions of Uganda. Our findings suggest a need for regionally targeted multi-sectoral interventions that take into consideration that multiple intersecting social dimensions such as education, poverty and the safe built environment, to address young women's risk for SV.

Whilst there are global efforts to promote benefit sharing when using non-human biological resources, benefit sharing plans and implementation do not yet feature prominently in research programmes, funding applications or requirements by ethics review boards. Whilst many research stakeholders may agree with the concept of benefit sharing, it can be difficult to operationalise benefit sharing within research programmes. We present a framework designed to assist with identifying benefit sharing opportunities in research programmes. The framework has two dimensions: the first represents microlevel, mesolevel and macrolevel stakeholders as defined using a socioecological model; and the second identifies nine different types of benefit sharing that might be achieved during a research programme. We provide an example matrix identifying different types of benefit sharing that might be undertaken during genomics research, and present a case study evaluating benefit sharing in Africa during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This framework, with examples, is intended as a practical tool to assist research stakeholders with identifying opportunities for benefit sharing, and inculcating intentional benefit sharing in their research programmes from inception.

As a result of the pressures of communicable diseases and malnutrition, mental health services in Africa have always been poorly resourced. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a spiralling global pandemic; the collateral effects of COVID-19 may even cause greater inequalities in maternal mental health services in Africa. The first objective of this article is to provide a brief overview on the importance of the first 1000 days of life and the impact of maternal mental health disorders on nurturing care and the neurodevelopment of infants. The second objective is to advocate prioritising research on the impact of COVID-19 on maternal mental health and infant neurodevelopment in Africa.

The World Health Organization (WHO) set an ambitious target to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030, but significant challenges remain. These include inequalities in access to healthcare, reaching at risk populations and providing access to screening and effective treatment. Stigma around viral hepatitis persists and must be addressed. The WHO goal of global elimination by 2030 is a worthy aim, but remains ambitious and the coronavirus 2019 pandemic undoubtedly has set back progress. This review article will focus on hepatitis A to E, highlighting problems that have been resolved in the field over the past decade, those that remain to be resolved and suggest directions for future problem solving and research.

J	Bhakuni, H; Abimbola, S				Bhakuni, Himani; Abimbola, Seye			Epistemic injustice in academic global health	LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE; JUSTICE; POWER	This Viewpoint calls attention to the pervasive wrongs related to knowledge production, use, and circulation in global health, many of which are taken for granted. We argue that common practices in academic global health (eg, authorship practices, research partnerships, academic writing, editorial practices, sensemaking practices, and the choice of audience or research framing, questions, and methods) are peppered with epistemic wrongs that lead to or exacerbate epistemic injustice. We describe two forms of epistemic wrongs, credibility deficit and interpretive marginalisation, which stem from structural exclusion of marginalised producers and recipients of knowledge. We then illustrate these forms of epistemic wrongs using examples of common practices in academic global health, and show how these wrongs are linked to the pose (or positionality) and the gaze (or audience) of producers of knowledge. The epistemic injustice framework shown in this Viewpoint can help to surface, detect, communicate, make sense of, avoid, and potentially undo unfair knowledge practices in global health that are inflicted upon people in their capacity as knowers, and as producers and recipients of knowledge, owing to structural prejudices in the processes involved in knowledge production, use, and circulation in global health.

J	Adebomi, OO				Adebomi, Oluwayemisi Olusola			Language in a pandemic: A multimodal analysis of social media representation of COVID-19	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN MEDIA STUDIES			English	Article						social media; COVID-19; pandemic; linguistic representation; multimodal analysis	MEMES	Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020, it has become a source of worry across countries within the global space. It has posed not only a health challenge but also an economic and a linguistic burden. Linguistic burden because many efforts are being made by stakeholders to appropriately represent or codify the manifestations of the disease in unambiguous and understandable terms. Hence, one of the major platforms where COVID19 has been variously represented is the social media. This study, therefore, focuses on a multimodal analysis of the representation of the COVID-19 pandemic on two social media platforms: Facebook and WhatsApp. The study adopts Kress's social semiotic model as theoretical framework. This model explains the meaning affordances of verbal and non-verbal semiotic resources. It examines communicators' intentions and makes meanings through multiple semiotic modes. This model is adopted because it offers a sociological perspective to the interpretation of visual texts. Twenty-five semiotic resources comprising memes and flash headlines, which were purposively sourced from Facebook and WhatsApp over a period of twelve weeks between April and July 2020, were analysed in the study. The data were subjected to both pictorial and simple descriptive linguistic analysis. The study reveals that COVID-19 memes extend economic and social concerns in Nigeria. The semiotic resources expose social problems such as poverty, insecurity and inequality in the Nigerian society which pose a threat to strict adherence to safety measures; and establish the manifestation of religion and gender issues in COVID-19 debates. Furthermore, it provides informative-cum-instructional functions in the fight against COVID-19. The study suggests that the deployment of appropriate linguistic and extralinguistic codes could guarantee effective and targeted public health enlightenment on COVID-19.

The 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) includes a comprehensive classification of chronic pain. The aim of this ecological implementation field study was to evaluate the classification's interrater reliability and clinical utility in countries with different income levels. The study was conducted in 4 pain clinics in Cuba, India, and New Zealand. Twenty-one clinicians used the ICD-11 to diagnose and code n = 353 patients with chronic pain. Of these, 111 were assessed by 2 clinicians, and Fleiss' kappa was calculated to establish interrater reliability for any diagnosis assigned to >= 15 patients. The clinicians rated the clinical utility of all diagnoses. The interrater reliability could be calculated for 11 diagnoses. It was substantial for 10 diagnoses and moderate for 1 (kappa: 0.596-0.783). The mean clinical utility of the ICD-11 chronic pain diagnoses was rated as 8.45 +/- 1.69/10. Clinical utility was rated higher for ICD-11 than for the commonly used classification systems (P < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.25) and differed between all centers (P < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.60). The utility of the ICD-11 diagnoses was rated higher than the commonly used diagnoses in Dunedin and Havana, and no difference was found in Kolkata and Hyderabad. The study showed the high interrater reliability of the new chronic pain diagnoses. The perceived clinical utility of the diagnoses indicates their superiority or equality compared with the classification systems currently used in pain clinics. These results suggest the global applicability of the classification in specialized pain treatment settings.

J	Wang, TX; Wong, JYH; Fong, DYT				Wang, Tingxuan; Wong, Janet Yuen Ha; Fong, Daniel Yee Tak			Subjective socioeconomic status: An indicator of intimate partner violence in middle-aged adults in Hong Kong	HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY			English	Article						Chinese adults; intimate partner violence; middle age; risk factor; subjective socioeconomic status	RISK-FACTORS; SOCIAL-STATUS; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; INEQUALITY; ABUSE	Intimate partner violence (IPV) has recently been recognised as a global public health issue that can cause various kinds of long-lasting physical, sexual and psychological health problems. Limited studies are available concerning the relationship between objective and subjective socioeconomic status (SES) and IPV, and the impact of experiencing IPV on health consequences. This is a cross-sectional study aiming to examine the association between objective and subjective SES as risk factors of IPV, and further investigate how they affect health status in adults who experienced IPV. A total of 400 participants were recruited from June to September 2016 among 18 districts in Hong Kong. Results from multiple linear regression showed that having a higher education (adjusted B [aB] = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.45), having lower levels of subjective SES (aB = -0.08, 95% CI = -0.15, -0.01), experiencing childhood stress (aB = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.89) and being married (aB = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.01, 1.19) were significantly associated with IPV. While employment and household income were not associated with IPV. Participants with higher levels of subjective SES were more likely to report somatic symptom (aB = -0.44, 95% CI = -0.87, -0.02), anxiety (aB = -0.38, 95% CI = -0.72, -0.04) and depressive symptom (aB = -0.52, 95% CI = -0.94, -0.10). Low subjective SES, instead of low objective SES, was found associated with IPV in Chinese adults. A priority for future studies is the confirmation and expansion of subjective SES and its function in clinical measures. Programmes instilling hope and optimism will be helpful to enhance subjective SES and boost physical and mental well-being in IPV survivors.

J	Thompson, D; Brewster, S				Thompson, D.; Brewster, S.			Inclusive placement learning for diverse higher education students: anxiety, uncertainty and opportunity	EDUCATIONAL REVIEW			English	Article						Diversity; inclusion; disability; higher education; placement; work-based learning	DISABLED STUDENTS; WORK EXPERIENCE	There is an increasing policy emphasis on supporting diversity and inclusive practice, as well as graduate employability for higher education students. Work-based learning (WBL), placement learning, or work integrated learning (WIL) is a key component of many undergraduate degree programmes. However, for many students, factors such as disability, ill-health, caring or work responsibilities can impact on their placement experience. This paper presents research based upon students' experiences and staff members' views of placement learning. It offers a wider discussion of inclusion and inclusive practice that goes beyond a single focus on disability. Firstly, the paper addresses the challenges that a diverse range of students face when considering placement and then discusses the experiences of staff in support of this activity. These are conceptualised within the three themes of anxiety, uncertainty, but also opportunity. As researchers and reflective practitioners, the authors present discussion that aims to develop our understanding of inclusive practice, inclusive placement learning, and meeting the needs of diverse groups of students. These are universal requirements, relating to themes of social justice, reaching across different institutions, subject disciplines, and international boundaries.

J	Fan, SQ; Koski, A				Fan, Suiqiong; Koski, Alissa			The health consequences of child marriage: a systematic review of the evidence	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						Child marriage; Social determinants of health; Systematic review	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CARE SERVICES; UNMET NEED; ASSOCIATION; OUTCOMES; CONTRACEPTION; BANGLADESH; ADOLESCENT; FERTILITY	Background: Child marriage, defined as marriage before 18 years of age, is a violation of human rights and a marker of gender inequality. Growing attention to this issue on the global development agenda also reflects concerns that it may negatively impact health. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize existing research on the consequences of child marriage on health and to assess the risk of bias in this body of literature. Methods and findings: We searched databases focused on biomedicine and global health for studies that estimated the effect of marrying before the age of 18 on any physical or mental health outcome or health behaviour. We identified 58 eligible articles, nearly all of which relied on cross-sectional data sources from sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia. The most studied health outcomes were indicators of fertility and fertility control, maternal health care, and intimate partner violence. All studies were at serious to critical risk of bias. Research consistently found that women who marry before the age of 18 begin having children at earlier ages and give birth to a larger number of children when compared to those who marry at 18 or later, but whether these outcomes were desired was not considered. Across studies, women who married as children were also consistently less likely to give birth in health care facilities or with assistance from skilled providers. Studies also uniformly concluded that child marriage increases the likelihood of experiencing physical violence from an intimate partner. However, research in many other domains, including use of contraception, unwanted pregnancy, and sexual violence came to divergent conclusions and challenge some common narratives regarding child marriage. Conclusions: There are many reasons to be concerned about child marriage. However, evidence that child marriage causes the health outcomes described in this review is severely limited. There is more heterogeneity in the results of these studies than is often recognized. For these reasons, greater caution is warranted when discussing the potential impact of child marriage on health. We provide suggestions for avoiding common biases and improving the strength of the evidence on this subject.

A Global Perspective of Racial-Ethnic Inequities in Dental Caries: Protocol of Systematic Review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						cultural; dental caries; ethnicity; inequalities; minority; oral health; race	ORAL-HEALTH INEQUITIES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; RACE; QUALITY; EQUITY; ADULTS; BIAS	Though current evidence suggests that racial-ethnic inequities in dental caries persist over time and across space, their magnitude is currently unknown from a global perspective. This systematic review aims to quantify the magnitude of racial/ethnic inequities in dental caries and to deconstruct the different taxonomies/concepts/methods used for racial/ethnic categorization across different populations/nations. This review has been registered in PROSPERO; CRD42021282771. An electronic search of all relevant databases will be conducted until December 2021 for both published and unpublished literature. Studies will be eligible if they include data on the prevalence or severity of dental caries assessed by the decayed, missing, filled teeth index (DMFT), according to indicators of race-ethnicity. A narrative synthesis of included studies and a random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted. Forest plots will be constructed to assess the difference in effect size for the occurrence of dental caries. Study quality will be determined via the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the GRADE approach will be used for assessing the quality of evidence. This systematic review will enhance knowledge of the magnitude of racial/ethnic inequities in dental caries globally by providing important benchmark data on which to base interventions to mitigate the problem and to visualize the effects of racism on oral health.

Comparative evidence from five international Agriculture, Nutrition and Health Academy Week conferences	LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; TRAVEL; SOCIETY	The advancement of science and evidence-based solutions for planetary health increasingly require interdisciplinary and international learning and sharing. Yet aviation travel to academic conferences is carbon-intensive and expensive, thus perpetuating planetary health and equity challenges. Using data from five annual international Agriculture, Nutrition and Health Academy Week conferences from 2016 to 2020, we explore whether moving to virtual conferencing produced co-benefits for climate, participation, attendee interaction, and satisfaction. We report on: absolute number of attendees, proportion of attendees from countries of different income levels, number of participants at social events, aviation CO2 emissions, and overall ratings of the event by participants. Transitioning online resulted in large reductions in travel-related aviation CO2 emissions, alongside increased attendance-including among attendees from low-income and middle-income countries. This was achieved without a major change in the participant rating of the event. However, the online format resulted in lower participation in conference social events. The urgency of reducing CO2 emissions in pursuit of planetary health and improving equity in scientific exchange requires new modalities of academic conferencing. This study indicates that co-benefits can be achieved when transitioning online. Challenges exist for virtual events, such as emulating the intangible facets of in-person interactions, overcoming time-zone limitations, and digital divides.

According to agroecological studies, a key factor for the food system to change is a stronger connection between farmers and consumers and the implementation of Food Citizenship. In this paper, we present the results of preliminary research on the consumer approach to vegetable and fruit purchase in Italy. Our main aim was to group consumers according to the major criteria guiding their food purchase patterns, to outline the main criteria underpinning their choices and assess their degree of environmental, economic and social awareness. Cluster analysis was able to pick out two groups with significant statistical differences, i.e., 55.4% of the sample showed, through their consumption patterns, deeper environmental and social concerns. Specifically, when comparing food purchasing patterns, ethical choices, biodiversity and global warming were the most influential factors to discriminate the two clusters. Moreover, organic food consumption confirmed its status as an acknowledged way to reduce the environmental impact of the modern agrifood system for which respondents are willing to pay a higher price compared to conventional food. Nonetheless, the whole sample of respondents perceived organic food as expensive and not good for value.

Given the scarcity of resources available to address global health challenges and respiratory medicine being relatively under-invested in, it is important to define research priorities for COPD globally. In this paper, we aim to identify a ranked set of COPD research priorities that need to be addressed in the next 10 years to substantially reduce the global impact of COPD. Methods We adapted the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) methodology to identify global COPD research priorities. Results 62 experts contributed 230 research ideas, which were scored by 34 researchers according to six pre-defined criteria: answerability, effectiveness, feasibility, deliverability, burden reduction, and equity. The top-ranked research priority was the need for new effective strategies to support smoking cessation. Of the top 20 overall research priorities, six were focused on feasible and cost-effective pulmonary rehabilitation delivery and access, particularly in primary/community care and low-resource settings. Three of the top 10 overall priorities called for research on improved screening and accurate diagnostic methods for COPD in low-resource primary care settings. Further ideas that drew support involved a better understanding of risk factors for COPD, development of effective training programmes for health workers and physicians in low resource settings, and evaluation of novel interventions to encourage physical activity. Conclusions The experts agreed that the most pressing feasible research questions to address in the next decade for COPD reduction were on prevention, diagnosis and rehabilitation of COPD, especially in low resource settings. The largest gains should be expected in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) settings, as the large majority of COPD deaths occur in those settings. Research priorities identified by this systematic international process should inform and motivate policymakers, funders, and researchers to support and conduct research to reduce the global burden of COPD.

Since then, advances in genome technologies have resulted in whole-genome sequencing and microarray-based genotyping of millions of human genomes. However, genetic and genomic studies are predominantly based on populations of European ancestry. As a result, the potential benefits of genomic research-including better understanding of disease etiology, early detection and diagnosis, rational drug design and improved clinical care-may elude the many underrepresented populations. Here, we describe factors that have contributed to the imbalance in representation of different populations and, leveraging our experiences in setting up genomic studies in diverse global populations, we propose a roadmap to enhancing inclusion and ensuring equal health benefits of genomics advances. Our Perspective highlights the importance of sincere, concerted global efforts toward genomic equity to ensure the benefits of genomic medicine are accessible to all. Based on their experience of setting up genomic studies in underrepresented populations, the authors propose a roadmap to enhancing inclusion and ensuring that the health benefits of genomics advances are accessible to all.

Health economic evaluation: cost-effective strategies in humanitarian and disaster relief medicine	BMJ MILITARY HEALTH			English	Review						health economics; telemedicine; international health services; organisation of health services; public health	HURRICANE KATRINA EVACUEES; CARE; TELEMEDICINE	The health economic evaluation is a tool used in disaster relief medicine to generate a cost-benefit analysis. Like all areas of healthcare, disaster relief operations must use finite financial resources, much of which comes from charitable donations and foreign aid. Interventions can be assessed using cost-effectiveness tools and equity assessments. Through these tools, interventions that maximise benefit for a given cost are highlighted in the immediate rapid response phase where food, clean water and shelter are prioritised, often with military support. Beyond this, applications of technology and pre-response training are discussed as cost-effective investments made in anticipation of a disaster. In particular, novel technology-based approaches are being explored to deliver medical advice remotely through telemedicine and remote consulting. This strategy allows medical specialists to operate remotely without the logistical and financial challenges of forward basing at the disaster site. Interventions in disaster relief medicine are often expensive. A specific and regularly reviewed health economic assessment ensures that healthcare interventions yield a maximal impact while limiting waste and working within the budgetary constraints of a disaster medicine response. This is a paper commissioned as part of the humanitarian and disaster relief operations special issue of BMJ Military Health.

The risk and protective factors for suicidal burden among 251 763 school-based adolescents in 77 low- and middle-income to high-income countries: assessing global, regional and national variations	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Adolescents' suicidal behaviours; bullying victimisation; parental and peer supports; psychological factors; sedentary behaviours; violence and unintentional injury	INTERPERSONAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY; PARENTAL MENTAL-ILLNESS; FOOD INSECURITY; HEALTH OUTCOMES; FAMILY SUPPORT; SELF-HARM; IDEATION; BEHAVIOR; ASSOCIATION; DEPRESSION	Background Adolescent suicide is a global public health concern and the second leading cause of adolescent death worldwide. This study aimed to estimate the burden of adolescent suicidal behaviours and its association with violence and unintentional injury, psychosocial, protective, lifestyle and food security-related factors amongst school-based adolescents across 77 countries in the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. Methods This study comprised a sample of 251 763 adolescents drawn from the latest Global School-based Student Health Survey of school-based adolescents, aged 11-17 years, across 77 countries. Logistic regression analyses were employed to estimate the adjusted effect of independent factors on adolescent suicidal behaviours. Results The population-weighted 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI), suicidal planning (SP) and suicidal attempts (SA) amongst school-based adolescents was 18, 18 and 16%, respectively. Adolescent suicidal behaviours (i.e. SI, SP and SA) were respectively associated with being physically attacked, physical fighting, high levels of anxiety, feeling lonely, being bullied, lack of parental support, poor peer support, not having close friends and high levels of sedentary behaviours. Overall, these associations also extended to the context of food insecurity across regions and country income groups, where the magnitude of association slightly varied from odds ratios of 1.25 times to 3.13. Conclusions The burden of school-going adolescent suicidal thoughts, suicide planning and suicide attempts is of particular concern in low-resource countries. Comprehensive suicide prevention programmes for school-going adolescents in LMICs are needed that address socio-cultural inequities related to violence and unintentional injury, social support and psychological factors, protective, and lifestyle-related factors.

J	Flear, ML				Flear, Mark L.			Expectations as techniques of legitimation? Imagined futures through global bioethics standards for health research	JOURNAL OF LAW AND THE BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						expectations; imaginaries; legitimation; bioethics; social justice; risk	INTERNATIONAL HARMONIZATION; SOCIOLOGY; SCIENCE; POWER; RISK; LAW; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; WORK; PHARMACEUTICALS	I argue that expectations or strong beliefs about what can occur, and the imaginaries they construct, can be shaped by organizations and used by them as techniques for public legitimation of their governance and regulatory activities. I advance this argument by reference to the International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The expectations and imaginary flowing from the ICH's mission and framing, 'harmonisation for better health', support a focus on technological development for the production of safe, quality, and effective pharmaceuticals and individual ethical conduct to achieve it. The expectations also marginalize wider systemic issues relating to social justice, particularly those affecting the global South. The central role of scientific-technical knowledge and expertise to harmonization abets the latter by minimizing the value to governance of public knowledges on systemic issues. Instead of ensuring the contribution of these knowledges to governance through public participation, there is an attempt to bolster legitimation through communication of expectations and transparency to show practices are in accordance with them (ie expectations are met).

This accompanying research aimed to understand the telehealth model and structures that would sustain an engaged community of practice and support the development of professional networks across the Pacific. Method Quantitative and qualitative feedback was analyzed to understand participation and self-rated measures of skills, knowledge, and confidence in providing health care for children and young people, as well as experiences of training, including access, engagement, and applicability of the initiative to the Pacific Islands health care organizations. Results Ophelia Training was able to meet the stated learning objectives. The data from all stakeholders identifies the value of a telehealth initiative incorporating training, technical assistance, knowledge networks, and professional coaching as a capacity building approach. Conclusion This program offers an integration of research and practice. This regional approach to understanding telehealth capacity for Pacific Island mental health services is valuable for informing decision-making with respect to clinical care, management, workforce training and policy. It also provided an opportunity to improve health inequalities, by improving access to CAMH training via telehealth.

In this article, we investigate the effect of EBOV and COVID-19 outbreaks on stock market indices. We employ time-varying and constant bivariate copula methods to measure the dependence structure between the infectious disease equity market volatility index (IEMV) and the stock market indices of several sectors. The results show that the financial and communication services sectors have the highest and the lowest negative dependency on IEMV during the Ebola virus (EBOV) pandemic, respectively. However, the health care and energy sectors have the highest and lowest negative dependency on IEMV during the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. Therefore, the results confirm the heterogeneous time-varying dependency between infectious diseases and the stock market indices. The finding of our study contributes to the ongoing literature on the impact of disease outbreaks, especially the novel coronavirus outbreak on global large-cap companies in the stock market.

A total of twenty-nine indicators for the process (four-indicators), economic (five-indicators), environmental (eight-indicators) and social global (five-indicators) and local (seven-indicators) aspects have been analysed for sustainability. These are technological: biomass throughput, electricity and steam generations and CHP efficiency; economic: internal rate of return, capital, operating and feedstock costs and cost of production; environmental: global warming, fossil, land and water use, acidification, urban smog, eutrophication and ecotoxicity potentials; social (global): labour rights and decent work, health & safety, human rights, governance and community infrastructure; social (local): total forest land, direct/indirect jobs, gender equality and energy-water-sanitation access for communities, from biomass characteristics (carbon and hydrogen contents), energy demands and economic parameters. This paper applies the developed methodology to a case study in Mexico. From 12.47 kt/year forestry residue, 1 MWe is generated with an associated low-pressure steam generation of 50 kt/year, at the cost of production of $0.023/ kWh. This makes the energy provision "affordable and clean" for marginalised/poor communities (the UN Sustainable Development Goals, SDG7). Bioenergy can curb > 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy use, 6 kt CO2 eq and 74 TJ annually. Bioenergy reduces other environmental impacts considerably, water consumption, acidification and eutrophication by 87-53%, and urban smog and ecotoxicity by 29-18%. Bioenergy can improve all five social themes in the Central American cluster countries. In addition to the SDG7, the forestry-based bioenergy system can also achieve the SDG6: "clean water and sanitation for all". [GRAPHICS] .

We aimed to investigate the quality of care of PC globally and to report its current burden. Methods: The Quality of Care Index (QCI) was achieved by performing a Principal Component Analysis utilizing the results of the GBD study 2017. The QCI was defined as a range between 0 and 100, in which higher QCIs show higher quality of care. Possible gender- and age-related inequalities in terms of QCI were explored based on WHO world regions and the sociodemographic index (SDI). Results: In 2017, Japan had the highest QCI among all countries (QCI = 99/100), followed by Australia (QCI = 83/100) and the United States (QCI = 76/100). In Japan and Australia, males and females had almost the same QCIs in 2017, while in the United States, females had lower QCIs than males. In contrast to these high-QCI nations, African countries had the lowest QCIs in 2017. Besides, QCI increased by SDI, and high-SDI regions had the highest QCIs. Regarding patients & rsquo; age, elderly cases had higher QCIs than younger patients globally and in high-SDI regions. Conclusion: This study provides clinicians and health authorities with a wider vision around the quality of care of PC worldwide and highlights the existing disparities.

How public health crises expose systemic, day-to-day health inequalities in low- and-middle income countries: an example from East Africa	ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE AND INFECTION CONTROL			English	Article						Health inequities; Antimicrobial resistance; Qualitative data; East Africa; One Health	DETERMINANTS; TANZANIA; VIOLENCE	Background The current Coronavirus disease pandemic reveals political and structural inequities of the world's poorest people who have little or no access to health care and yet the largest burdens of poor health. This is in parallel to a more persistent but silent global health crisis, antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We explore the fundamental challenges of health care in humans and animals in relation to AMR in Tanzania. Methods We conducted 57 individual interviews and focus groups with providers and patients in high, middle and lower tier health care facilities and communities across three regions of Tanzania between April 2019 and February 2020. We covered topics from health infrastructure and prescribing practices to health communication and patient experiences. Results Three interconnected themes emerged about systemic issues impacting health. First, there are challenges around infrastructure and availability of vital resources such as healthcare staff and supplies. Second, health outcomes are predicated on patient and provider access to services as well as social determinants of health. Third, health communication is critical in defining trusted sources of information, and narratives of blame emerge around health outcomes with the onus of responsibility for action falling on individuals. Conclusion Entanglements between infrastructure, access and communication exist while constraints in the health system lead to poor health outcomes even in 'normal' circumstances. These are likely to be relevant across the globe and highly topical for addressing pressing global health challenges. Redressing structural health inequities can better equip countries and their citizens to not only face pandemics but also day-to-day health challenges.

J	Ibrahim, M; Rizwan, H; Afzal, M; Malik, MR				Ibrahim, M.; Rizwan, H.; Afzal, M.; Malik, Mamunur Rahman			Mental health crisis in Somalia: a review and a way forward	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS			English	Review						Somalia; Conflict; Humanitarian crisis; Mental health; Community Mental Health	TRAUMATIC EVENTS; DISORDERS; BURDEN	Background Somalia has been without an effective government since the collapse of the military regime in 1991. Years of conflict, disasters, and insecurity have all contributed to very low scores for most health indicators due to poor governance, protracted conflict, underdevelopment, economic decline, poverty, social and gender inequality, and environmental degradation. The three-decade long protracted conflict has led to widespread psychosocial trauma, social deprivation and substance abuse with devastating consequences on mental health. A WHO study showed Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world. The main aim of this study is to assist policy makers in setting priorities for the design and delivery of interventions to promote mental health and psychosocial wellbeing in Somalia. Methods The study uses a systematic mapping technique (from January 1991 to May 2020) and data collected from public domain, to collect, collate, and present mental health data mainly from WHO's Global Health Observatory. Since there is no primary database for Somalia's public health research, the bibliographic databases used for mental health in this study included Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. Data were extracted using techniques for web data mining for public health. Results Systematic mapping of mental health-related issues in Somalia showed that policy-related determinants and mental health services dominated (74.4%), followed by the disaster-related determinants and women's health consequences (39.3%). The ratio of the number of beds for mental health in general hospitals (per 100,000 population) in Somalia in 2017 is 0.5 compared to the Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) at 6.4 and globally at 24. One of the biggest casualties of the civil war was loss of essential human resources in healthcare as most either fled the country or were part of the victims of the war. Conclusions The vast scale of the mental health problems in Somalia and the priority setting guidelines for interventions to address the issues outlined in this paper, prompt a dire need that the Somali government and its national/international partners should prioritize and emphasize the need to invest in the prevention and the treatment of mental illness across the country.

WOMEN AND BIRTH			English	Article						Midwifery and nursing leaders; Respectful maternity care; Disrespect and abuse during childbirth; Obstetric violence; India	RIGHTS	Background: Disrespect and abuse during childbirth can result in fear of childbirth. Consequently, women may be discouraged to seek care, increasing the likelihood for women to choose elective cesarean section in order to avoid humiliation, postnatal depression and even maternal mortality. This study investigates the causes underlying mistreatment of women during childbirth by health care providers in India, where evidence of disrespect and abuse has been reported. Methods: Qualitative research was undertaken involving 34 in-depth interviews with midwifery and nursing leaders from India who represent administration, advocacy, education, regulation, research and service provision at state and national levels. Data are analysed thematically with NVivo12. The analysis added value by bringing an international perspective from interviews with midwifery leaders from Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Findings: The factors leading to disrespect and abuse of women relate to characteristics of both women and their midwives. Relevant woman-related attributes include her age, gender, physical appearance and education, extending to the social environment including her social status, family support, culture of abuse, myths around childbirth and sex-based discrimination. Midwife-related factors include gender, workload, medical hierarchy, bullying and powerlessness. Discussion: The intersectionality of factors associated with mistreatment during childbirth operate at individual, infrastructural, social and policy levels for both the women and nurse-midwives, and these factors could exacerbate existing gender-based inequalities. Maternal health policies should address the complex interplay of these factors to ensure a positive birthing experience for women in India. Conclusion: Maternal health interventions could improve by integrating women-centred protocols and monitoring measures to ensure respectful and dignified care during childbirth.

This study analyzes 2282 papers on COVID-19-related health disparities that have been retrieved from the WOS database, with 58,413 references. Using bibliometric analysis and knowledge mapping visualizations, the paper focuses on the academic structure and research trends by examining the research distribution of countries, journals and authors, keywords, highly cited articles, and reference co-citation. The results show that the United States has contributed the most, and the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health has published the largest number of papers on this topic. As for the core authors, Michael Marmot is the most productive. Issues such as racial health, mental health, and digital health disparities have been the trending topics of the COVID-19-related health disparities. The research directions include the features, factors, and interventions of health disparities under the influence of COVID-19. As such, this study provides literature support and suggestions to investigate COVID-19-related health disparities. The findings of the paper also remind public health regulators to consider factors of health disparities when developing long-term public health regulatory policies related to the pandemic.

Such models have played a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic, with transmission models-and, by consequence, modelers-guiding global, national, and local responses to SARS-CoV-2. However, these models have largely not accounted for the social and structural factors, which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. In this piece, we raise and attempt to clarify several questions relating to this important gap in the research and practice of infectious disease modeling: Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections typically ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of a framework focused primarily on aggregate outcomes on infection equity? What should be done to develop a more holistic approach to modeling-based decision-making during pandemics? In this review, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as "equal opportunity infectors " despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) and successes in including social inequity in models of acute infection transmission as a blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework. We conclude by outlining principles to guide modeling of emerging infections in ways that represent the causes of inequity in infection as central rather than peripheral mechanisms.

J	Mintrom, M; True, J				Mintrom, Michael; True, Jacqui			COVID-19 as a policy window: policy entrepreneurs responding to violence against women	POLICY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						policy window; multiple streams model; policy entrepreneurs; COVID-19; violence against women	PATH DEPENDENCE; FRAMEWORK; DIFFUSION; SCIENCE	Policy windows emerge through alignment among specific policy problems, political forces, and proposed policy responses. During policy windows, it becomes possible for change to occur, driven by the agenda-setting of policy entrepreneurs. We consider how the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) created a significant policy window. As we do so, we seek to advance theorization of the conditions under which policy change occurs and when it sticks. We ground this discussion in exploration of a salient policy matter: responding to violence against women (VAW). Shortly after the World Health Organization declared the spread of COVID-19 a global pandemic, in April 2020, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuke, Executive Director of United Nations (UN) Women-the entity of the UN dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women-coined VAW the "shadow pandemic" and launched a global public awareness campaign. We review the advocacy work that led in 2020 to broader recognition of VAW as a significant policy problem. That advocacy has driven policy changes at local and national levels that are intended to have long-term, trajectory-altering impacts on reducing violence. We conclude by drawing insights to guide theory-driven empirical analysis of other policy windows.

J	Amri, M; Chatur, A; O'Campo, P				Amri, Michelle; Chatur, Ali; O'Campo, Patricia			Intersectoral and multisectoral approaches to health policy: an umbrella review protocol	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Review						Health in All Policies; HiAP; Healthy cities; One Health; Multisectoral; Intersectoral; Health; Governance; Healthy public policy; Implementation	IMPLEMENTATION	Background It is widely recognized that one's health is influenced by a multitude of nonmedical factors, known as the social determinants of health (SDH). The SDH are defined as "the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, and which are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels". Despite their influence on health, most of the SDH are targeted through government departments and ministries outside of the traditional health sector (e.g. education, housing). As such, the need for intersectoral and multisectoral approaches arises. Intersectoral and multisectoral approaches are thought to be essential to addressing many global health challenges our world faces today and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. There are various ways of undertaking intersectoral and multisectoral action, but there are three widely recognized approaches (Health in All Policies [HiAP], Healthy Cities, and One Health) that each have a unique focus. However, despite the widespread acceptance of the need for intersectoral and multisectoral approaches, knowledge around how to support, achieve and sustain multisectoral action is limited. The goal of this study is to assemble evidence from systematic approaches to reviewing the literature (e.g. scoping review, systematic review) that collate findings on facilitators/enablers and barriers to implementing various intersectoral and multisectoral approaches to health, to strengthen understanding of how to best implement health policies that work across sectors, whichever they may be. Methods An umbrella review (i.e. review of reviews) is to be undertaken to collate findings from the peer-reviewed literature, specifically from Ovid MEDLINE and Scopus databases. This umbrella review protocol was developed following the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P), and study design informed by the PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Discussion Countries that employ multisectoral approaches are better able to identify and address issues around poverty, housing and others, by working collaboratively across sectors, with multisectoral action by governments thought to be required to achieve health equity.

Exploring the victim offender overlap among people with an intellectual disability	JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES			English	Article						crime; victimisation; victim-offender overlap	MENTAL-HEALTH; LIFE-STYLES; VICTIMIZATION; PREVALENCE; ADULTS; RISK; CRIME; VULNERABILITY; BEHAVIOR; VIOLENCE	Background While there is growing international evidence pointing to the increased risks of crime perpetration and victimisation for some people with an intellectual disability, the overlap between offending and victimisation (the victim-offender overlap) remains unclear. Method This study utilised a data linkage methodology of 2600 people with an intellectual disability, exploring their contacts with public mental health services and the police in Victoria, Australia. Results Victim-offenders accounted for a small proportion of the sample (n = 148, 5.7%). The victim-offender overlap was evident for both violent and nonviolent nonsexual crimes, particularly for theft, burglary, and threat-related crimes. Key differences were also noted between males and females. Conclusions People with an intellectual disability who are both victim and offenders comprise a small but particularly complex justice-involved population. Future research should explore the victim offender overlap for males and females separately, as well as any additional risks and vulnerabilities associated with specific mental health diagnoses.

Drawing on interviews with key stakeholders, this paper applies an energy justice framework in overviewing energy realities and policies in Malawi, where electricity access remains among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The use of woodfuel remains high for meeting cooking, heating, and lighting needs leading to indoor air pollution, with serious health consequences, and widespread deforestation. Responses to these dual challenges, a lack of electricity access and ongoing woodfuel use, must be rooted in notions of equity, fairness, and justice. Application of energy justice theorising provides insights into how policy stakeholders are responding to complex and interconnected issues of energy generation and access in low-income settings. Overall, a just response to these energy challenges is possible, but only if it is built on local inclusive governance with fairer and effective systems of investment.

J	de Hoop, E; Loeber, A; Essink, D				de Hoop, Evelien; Loeber, Anne; Essink, Dirk			Exploring, Diversifying and Debating Sustainable Health (Care) Approaches	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						health; sustainability; planetary health; sustainable healthcare systems; healthcare system transformation; inclusion	INNOVATION; SYSTEM; PERSPECTIVES; CALL	Today's sustainability challenges have major implications for human health and health care. At the same time, the way health care is organized and conducted has major sustainability implications. Sustainable health and sustainable health care approaches in research, which engage with health and sustainability as intertwined phenomena, feature increasingly prominently in various literatures, i.e., (i) literature based on the premise of '(un)healthy environments result in (un)healthy people' (e.g., planetary health); (ii) literature on the implications of ecological change for the sustainability of healthcare systems; and (iii) literature on healthcare systems' sustainability in view of a range of socio-economic factors. However, an integrative elaboration of the manifold relationships between health and sustainability challenges in these literatures is currently lacking. This review paper therefore maps how these three literatures represent intertwinements between health and sustainability challenges, as well as their suggestions to address these challenges. In addition, we explore which themes and questions are pertinent, meaning they have remained largely unaddressed. By performing a qualitative mapping review, we find that calls for structural attention to inequality, to in-and exclusion, and to stakeholder needs and perspectives cut across these three literatures. Furthermore, we identify three cross-cutting key questions that require future research attention. First, how do divergent ideas on what is and divergent ideas on how can that be known give rise to different health- and sustainability visions and pathways? Second, what do abstract problem statements and solutions presented in agenda-setting work look like in practice in specific and diverse empirical contexts across the globe? And third, how are diverse health and sustainability dynamics historically and spatially interconnected? Moreover, we observe that some voices have so far remained largely silent in scientific debates on health and sustainability intertwinements, namely non-expert voices such as patients and citizens, voices from a variety of social scientific and humanities disciplines, voices from relevant domains beyond (environmental) health, and voices from the global South (from non-experts, social scientific and humanities researchers and domains beyond health). We conclude that a focus on inclusive and equitable engagement with intertwined health- and sustainability challenges is imperative. This requires moving away from developing universal knowledge to address generic problems, to foregrounding plurality in terms of problem statements, knowledge, solutions, and the values embedded therein.

Association of Medicaid Reimbursement for Immediate Postpartum Long-acting Reversible Contraception With Infant Birth Outcomes	JAMA PEDIATRICS			English	Article							PRETERM BIRTH; UNITED-STATES; PREGNANCY; EXPANSION; QUALITY; WOMEN	IMPORTANCE Together, preterm birth and low birth weight are the second-leading cause of infant mortality in the US and occur disproportionately among Medicaid-paid births and among the infants of Black birthing persons. In 2012, South Carolina's Medicaid program began to reimburse hospitals for immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) separately from the global maternity payment. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between South Carolina's policy change and infant health. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study using a difference-in-differences analysis included individuals with a South Carolina Medicaid-paid childbirth between January 2009 and December 2015. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to July 2021. EXPOSURES Medicaid-paid childbirth after March 2012 in South Carolina hospitals that had implemented the policy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Immediate postpartum LARC uptake, subsequent birth within 4 years, subsequent short-interval birth, days to subsequent birth, subsequent preterm, and low-birth-weight birth within 4 years. RESULTS The study sample included 186 953 Medicaid-paid births between January 2009 and December 2015 in South Carolina (81 110 births from 2009 to 2011, 105 843 births from 2012 to 2015, and 46 414 births in exposure hospitals). The policy was associated with an absolute 5.6-percentage point (95% CI, 3.7-7.4) increase in the probability of receiving an immediate postpartum LARC overall, with significantly larger effects for non-Hispanic Black individuals than non-Hispanic White individuals (difference in coefficients 3.54; 95% CI, 1.35-5.73; P =.002). The policy was associated with a 0.4-percentage point (95% CI, -0.7 to -0.1) decrease in the probability of subsequent preterm birth and a 0.3-percentage point (95% CI, -0.7 to 0) decrease in the probability of subsequent low birth weight. No significant difference in the association between the policy and preterm birth or low-birth-weight birth between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White individuals was found. The policy was associated with a 0.6-percentage point (95% CI, -1.2 to -0.1) decrease in the probability of short-interval birth and a 27-day (95% CI, 11-44) increase in days to next birth among non-Hispanic Black individuals. The policy was associated with a significant decrease in the probability of a subsequent birth overall; however, confidence in this result is attenuated somewhat by nonparallel trends for this outcome before the policy change. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Findings of this cohort study suggest policies increasing access to immediate postpartum LARC may improve birth outcomes but should be accompanied by other policy efforts to reduce inequity in these outcomes.

This is so from an ethical perspective and because greater inequality is perceived to be detrimental to key socioeconomic and political outcomes. Still, informed debate requires clear evidence. This article contributes by taking stock and providing an up-to-date overview of the current knowledge on the impact of income inequality, specifically on three important outcomes: (1) economic growth; (2) human development, with a focus on health and education as two of its dimensions; and (3) governance, with emphasis on democracy. With particular attention to work in economics, which is especially developed on these topics, this article reveals that the existing evidence is somewhat mixed and argues for further in-depth empirical work across disciplines. It also points to explanations for the lack of consensus embedded in data quality and availability, measurement issues, and shortcomings of the different methods employed. Finally, we suggest promising future research avenues relying on experimental work for microlevel analysis and reiterate the need for more region- and country-specific studies and improvements in the availability and reliability of data.

J	Fallah, PN; Jayaram, A; Hauser, BM				Fallah, Parisa N.; Jayaram, Anusha; Hauser, Blake M.			Moving the Needle on Global Surgery Education in the US	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						global surgery; global health; global surgical education; health equity; public health; medical students; residents		OBJECTIVE: Interest in global surgery continues to increase among students and trainees in the U.S. pursuing fields that provide perioperative care, including surgery, anesthesia, and OB/GYN. While some students and trainees successfully engage in global surgery-related research, advocacy, and clinical work, many individuals face gaps in global surgery education and opportunities. A lack of access to mentorship and resources can limit engagement with the shift from pursuing clinically-oriented experiences, such as short-term trips, to focusing on long-term models emphasizing equity. To address these challenges, motivated students and trainees have formed networks of future global surgery providers. DESIGN: Within the U.S., the Global Surgery Student Alliance (GSSA) has constructed a network reaching students and trainees at 75 medical schools. GSSA is able to connect American students and trainees with resources and mentors, as well as emphasizing the importance of equitable engagement in the global surgery field. GSSA also serves as the National Working Group for the International Student Surgical Network (InciSioN). RESULTS: Since launching in January 2017, GSSA has constructed a national leadership team that supports chapters at individual medical schools in addition to hosting nationwide events and producing resources. Using the global surgery education needs identified in the NextGen study, GSSA has authored toolkits aimed at guiding students towards ethical and equitable opportunities to engage in global surgery research, education, and advocacy. GSSA also hosts numerous events to help students prepare for potential careers in global surgery, including annual national symposia and frequent webinars. Additionally, GSSA has created a freely accessible database to connect students with peers and mentors within global surgery worldwide. CONCLUSION: Students have created a national organization that connects future perioperative care providers with resources to engage in equitable global surgery advocacy, education, and research. GSSA helps bridge the gaps between interest, opportunity, and equity in global surgery work. ((C) 2021 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.)

J	Murthy, GVS				Murthy, G. V. S.			Situational analysis of diabetic retinopathy screening in India: How has it changed in the last three years?	INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Review						Diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; India; review; screening	PREVALENCE; MODEL; MELLITUS; CARE	Of all the eye conditions in the contemporary Indian context, diabetic retinopathy (DR) attracts the maximum attention not just of the eye care fraternity but the entire medical fraternity. Countries are at different stages of evolution in structured DR screening services. In most low and middle income countries, screening is opportunistic, while in most of the high income countries structured population-based DR screening is the established norm. To reduce inequities in access, it is important that all persons with diabetes are provided equal access to DR screening and management services. Such programs have been proven to reverse the magnitude of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in countries like England and Scotland. DR screening should not be considered an endpoint in itself but the starting point in a continuum of services for effective management of DR services so that the risk of vision loss can be mitigated. Till recently all DR screening programs in India were opportunistic models where persons with diabetes visiting an eye care facility were screened. Since 2016, with support from International funders, demonstration models integrating DR screening services in the public health system were initiated. These pilots showed that a systematic integrated structured DR screening program is possible in India and need to be scaled up across the country. Many DR screening and referral initiatives have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and advocacy with the government is critical to facilitate continuous sustainable services.

J	Reis, LA; Drouet, L; Tavoni, M				Reis, Lara Aleluia; Drouet, Laurent; Tavoni, Massimo			Internalising health-economic impacts of air pollution into climate policy: a global modelling study	LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH			English	Article							CO-BENEFITS; QUALITY; EMISSIONS	Background Climate change and air pollution are two major societal problems. Their complex interplay calls for an advanced evaluation framework that can support decision making. Previous assessments have looked at the cobenefits of climate policies for air pollution, but few have optimised air pollution benefits. In our study, we lay out a modelling framework that internalises air pollution's economic impacts on human mortality, while considering climate constraints and aerosol feedback. Methods We developed a modelling framework based on an integrated assessment model (World Induced Technical Change Hybrid [WITCH]) designed to assess optimal climate change mitigation policies. We included structural and end-of-pipe measures in a detailed process integrated assessment model, that is hard-linked to air pollution and climate models. We analysed a large set of baseline scenarios, including five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). SSP scenarios were also tested with three different levels of value per statistical life, and were combined with the Paris Agreement temperature targets (TM), focusing on the 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C TTs by the end of the century. Findings We found that, in the baseline scenarios, where no policies are applied, the number of annual premature deaths grew before declining slightly to 4.45 (range 3.86-6.11) million annual premature deaths by 2050. Reaching the Paris Agreement TT decreases mortality by approximately 0.47 million premature deaths by 2050 (up to 1.28 million premature deaths in SSP3-1.5 degrees C) with respect to the baseline. We showed that welfare-maximising policies accounting for air pollution benefits reduces premature mortality by 1.62 million deaths annually. This is three times greater than the co-benefits of climate policies. China is the region where most of the avoided mortality is possible, whereas the reforming economies (ie, non-EU eastern European countries, including Russia) region has the greatest welfare benefits. We find that global and regional welfare increases when air pollution impacts are internalised, with no negative repercussions on global inequality. Interpretation Air pollution control strategies are found to be an important complement to structural emission reductions. Accounting for air pollution impacts reduces climate mitigation costs and inequality and increases global and regional welfare. Results are robust to a broad set of scenarios and assumptions, including debated normative choices on how to value improved health. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this article is to analyze the experience of popular surveillance of fishermen and fisher-women's health through daily reports produced at the Observatory. It is a monitoring process that allowed broadening the recognition of the diversity of vulnerable populations' ways of life that intertwine health, environment and work. The study used a qualitative, horizontal and emancipatory methodology and sought approaches to the practice of the ecology of knowledges, with the following results: shared construction of information and knowledges based on heterogeneous social experiences; practice of collective ombudsman with the appreciation of knowledges built in social struggles); joint assessment of public health inequities, territorial conflicts, and environmental, structural, and institutional racism; guidance of social leaders and fundraising through public notices. Thus, the dynamics and horizontality of learning based on solidarity and social emancipation from inter-knowledge are revealed.

J	Knoll, EM				Knoll, Eva-Maria			The 'other' within: Striving for health equity in the Maldives	ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL			English	Article						archipelago; mobility; relationality; blood disorder; Maldives; thalassaemia	THALASSEMIA; ISLAND; PERCEPTIONS; PREVENTION; REMOTENESS	Relations within are quintessential in anthropological fieldwork - and in archipelagos in particular. The domestic sea is incorporated in the national consciousness connecting an archipelagic nation but distinguishing individual islands with a strong emphasis on the centre. The Maldivian archipelago displays this spatial organization of a socio-political and economic centre and a dependent island periphery. In the national consciousness, the capital island, Male', contrasts with "the islands" - a distinction which is particularly evident in the public health sphere, where striving for health equity encounters geographical and socio-political obstacles. Using the topic of the inherited blood disorder thalassaemia as a magnifying lens, this paper asks how different actors are making sense of health inequities between central and outer islands in the Maldivian archipelago. Intra-archipelagic and international mobilities add to the complexities of topological relations, experiences, and representations within this multi-island assemblage. Yet, my study of archipelagic health relations is not confined to a mere outside look at the construction of the 'island other' within the archipelagic community. It is a situated investigative gaze on disjunctures, connections, and entanglements, reflecting my methodological-theoretical attempt to unravel my own involvement in island-island relations and representations - my being entangled while investigating entanglements.

Through reductions in trade and international tourism, the pandemic has particularly affected rural economies of tropical low- and middle-income countries where biodiversity is concentrated. As this adversity is exacerbating poverty in these regions, it is important to examine the relationship between poverty and wildlife crime in order to better anticipate and respond to the impact of the pandemic on biodiversity. To that end, we explore the relationship between poverty and wildlife crime, and its relevance in the context of a global pandemic. We examine literature from conservation, criminology, criminal justice, and social psychology to piece together how the various dimensions of poverty relate directly and indirectly to general criminal offending and the challenges this poses to conservation. We provide a theoretical framework and a road map for understanding how poverty alleviation relates to reduced wildlife crime through improved economic, human, socio-cultural, political, and protective capabilities. We also discuss the implications of this research for policy in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude that multidimensional poverty and wildlife crime are intricately linked, and that initiatives to enhance each of the five dimensions can reduce the poverty-related risks of wildlife crime.

J	Cheng, JL; Dibble, EH; Baird, GL; Gordon, LL; Hyun, H				Cheng, Jocelyn L.; Dibble, Elizabeth H.; Baird, Grayson L.; Gordon, Leonie L.; Hyun, Hyewon			Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Academic Nuclear Medicine: National Survey of Nuclear Medicine Residency Program Directors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						diversity; women; underrepresented in medicine; nuclear medicine; training	DISPARITIES; CARE; CONCORDANCE; RADIOLOGY; WORKFORCE; GENDER; HEALTH; WOMEN	A diverse health-care workforce is a necessary component of equitable care delivery to an increasingly diverse U.S. population. In nuclear medicine (NM), there is a paucity of data on the numbers of women and members of racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in medicine in the United States (URiMs). This study sought to characterize the current state of women and URiMs in academic NM, describe the demographics of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited NM residency program faculty and trainees, and assess the extent of NM exposure during medical school. Methods: This study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board and deemed exempt. In this cross-sectional study, a link to an online 15-item survey was emailed to 41 ACGME-accredited NM residency program directors (PDs) in the United States. Data were collected between September 2018 and December 2018 using a secure web application that serves as an electronic data capture tool for research studies. Results: 23 of 41 (56.1%) PDs responded to the survey, 18 of 23 (78.3%) of whom were men and 5 of 23 (21.7%) women. Three of 23 (13.0%) PDs reported being URiMs. Of the 60 residents in the 23 NM residency programs whose PDs responded, 37 of 60 (61.7%) were men (7/37 [18.9%] URiMs) and 23 of 60 (38.3%) women (5/23 [21.7%] URiMs). Fourteen of 60 (23.3%) residents were U.S. medical school graduates (U.S. grads). PDs described demographics of 121 current NM faculty members: 86 of 121 (71.1%) were men (8/121 [6.6% URIMs] and 35 of 121 (28.9%) women (7/121 (5.8% URiMs). Sixty-five of 121 (53.7%) were U.S. grads. Sixteen of 23 (69.6%) divisional chiefs were men, and 7 of 23 (30.4%) were women. Four of 23 (17.4%) divisional chiefs were URiMs, and 7 of 20 (35.0%) NM PDs reported that NM was part of the medical school curriculum. Conclusion: Women and URiMs are underrepresented in NM training programs. This diversity gap is more pronounced among NM faculty and to an even greater extent in leadership positions. A greater proportion of NM trainees are international medical graduates compared with NM faculty members, suggesting declining NM recruitment among U.S. grads. NM is included in the medical school curriculum at fewer than one third of academic centers with NM residency programs, typically toward the end of medical school. Increased and earlier exposure to NM, especially for women and URiMs, may improve recruitment and mitigate diversity gaps.

HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						COVID-19; health promotion; public policy; vulnerable communities	HEALTH-PROMOTION	By 30 May 2021, Brazil had 16 471 600 COVID-19 cases and 461 142 deaths, ranking second in the world in number of deaths and third in number of cases. Preliminary research results in Brazil and around the world show the impact of COVID-19 on more vulnerable communities. However, despite the adverse circumstances of their territories, leaders have mobilized to face the challenges. Between April and June 2020, the authors of this article interviewed informants in eight Brazilian state capitals, addressing the five points of discussion (intersectoriality, sustainability, empowerment and public participation, equity and the life cycle perspective) recently presented by EUPHA-HP, IUHPE and UNESCO Chair Global Health & Education. Official actions and documents from the Ministry of Health and Municipal Health Departments (SMS) of each capital were also analyzed. No records were found of official actions aimed at COVID-19 that addressed the territories' specificities. In total, 15 promotional actions by the communities were identified. The selection of local actors to take on specific responsibilities during the pandemic is highlighted as a relevant action. This action alone weaves together at least three of the five HP principles (equity, life cycles and empowerment). We consider that previous forms of political empowerment, such as the recognition of territories and educational initiatives, have contributed to the subjects who are leading these inventive initiatives. However, although there is scope for promotional actions, there are infrastructural limitations that only public policies could mitigate. Such actions would demand deliberate coordination between the government and social movements, which is absent in the current context of national governance.

J	Plamondon, KM				Plamondon, Katrina M.			Equity at a time of pandemic	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						health equity; social determinants of health; health policy; political economy; health inequities	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; HEALTH; COVID-19; RACISM; POLICY	Health promotion has long aspired for a world where all people can live to their full potential. Yet, COVID-19 illuminates dramatically different consequences for populations bearing heavy burdens of systemic disadvantage within countries and between the Global South and Global North. Many months of pandemic is entrenching inequities that reveal themselves in the vastly differential distribution of hospitalization and mortality, for example, among racialized groups in the USA. Amplified awareness of the intimate relationship between health, social structures, and economy opens a window of opportunity to act on decades of global commitments to prioritize health equity. Choices to act (or not act) are likely to accelerate already vast inequities within and between countries as rapidly as the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Recognizing the inherently global nature of this pandemic, this article explores how determinants of equity are embedded in global responses to it, arguing that these determinants will critically shape our global futures. This article aims to stimulate dialogue about equity-centered health promoting action during a pandemic, using the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research (CCGHR) Principles for Global Health Research to examine equity considerations at a time of pandemic. Attentiveness to power and the relationship between political economy and health are argued as central to identifying and examining issues of equity. This article invites dialogue about how equity-centered planning, decision-making and action could leverage this massive disruption to society to spark a more hopeful, just, and humane collective future.

This is because such emergencies compete with routine programmes for the available health resources, strain health systems and shift health-care attention and resources towards containing the spread of the epidemic and treating those that fall seriously ill. This paper is part of a larger global study, the aim of which is to evaluate the degree to which national COVID-19 preparedness and response plans incorporated priority setting concepts. It provides important insights into what and how priority decisions were made in the context of a pandemic. Specifically, with a focus on a sample of 18 African countries' pandemic plans, the paper aims to: (1) explore the degree to which the documented priority setting processes adhere to established quality indicators of effective priority setting and (2) examine if there is a relationship between the number of quality indicators present in the pandemic plans and the country's economic context, health system and prior experiences with disease outbreaks. All the reviewed plans contained some aspects of expected priority setting processes but none of the national plans addressed all quality parameters. Most of the parameters were mentioned by less than 10 of the 18 country plans reviewed, and several plans identified one or two aspects of fair priority setting processes. Very few plans identified equity as a criterion for priority setting. Since the parameters are relevant to the quality of priority setting that is implemented during public health emergencies and most of the countries have pre-existing pandemic plans; it would be advisable that, for the future (if not already happening), countries consider priority setting as a critical part of their routine health emergency and disease outbreak plans. Such an approach would ensure that priority setting is integral to pandemic planning, response and recovery.

Perspective Piece Exploring Challenges to COVID-19 Vaccination in the Darfur Region of Sudan	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE			English	Article								The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ability of health systems to provide essential services globally. The Darfur region, located in the western part of Sudan, has been largely devastated by the war that began in 2003 and has been drawing considerable attention from the international community. The war, which erupted as a result of environmental, political, and economic factors, has led to tragic outcomes. Collapsing health-care infrastructures, health workforce shortages, lack of storage facilities for medicines and medical products, and inadequate access to health services are some of the effects of the war. After Sudan received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access facility, significant challenges have been implicated in the delivery, storage, and use of the vaccine in the Darfur region. Lack of vaccine storage and transportation facilities, vaccination hesitancy, inequity in the distribution to health facilities, and shortage of health-care professionals resulting from insecurity and instability have added an extra layer of burden on local authorities and their ability to manage COVID-19 vaccinations in the region adequately. Addressing the impact of COVID-19 requires an effectively managed vaccination program. In the face of current challenges in Darfur, ensuring a fully vaccinated population might remain far-fetched and improbable if meaningful efforts are not put in place by all stakeholders and actors to address some of the challenges identified.

Furthermore, tobacco has a heavy social gradient, as the consequences are even worse among disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. To reduce tobacco-related inequity in health, those most in need should be offered the most effective tobacco cessation intervention. The aim of this study is to facilitate and improve the evaluation of already implemented national tobacco cessation efforts, focusing on 10 disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of tobacco users. Methods and analysis This is a prospective cohort study. Data will be collected by established tobacco cessation counsellors in Sweden. The study includes adult tobacco or e-cigarette users, including disadvantaged and vulnerable patients, receiving in-person interventions for tobacco or e-cigarette cessation (smoking, snus and/or e-cigarettes). Patient inclusion was initiated in April 2020. For data analyses patients will be sorted into vulnerable groups based on risk factors and compared with tobacco users without the risk factor in question. The primary outcome is continuous successful quitting after 6 months, measured by self-reporting. Secondary outcomes include abstinence at the end of the treatment programme, which could be from minutes over days to weeks, 14-day point prevalence after 6 months, and patient satisfaction with the intervention. Effectiveness of successful quitting will be examined by comparing vulnerable with non-vulnerable patients using a mixed-effect logistic regression model adjusting for potential prognostic factors and known confounders. Ethics and dissemination The project will follow the guidelines from the Swedish Data Protection Authority and have been approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority before patient inclusion (Dnr: 2019-02221). Only patients providing written informed consent will be included. Both positive and negative results will be published in scientific peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. Information will be provided through media available to the public, politicians, healthcare providers and planners as these are all important stakeholders.

Methods Patients with axial SpA (axSpA), peripheral SpA (pSpA) or PsA from the ASAS-perSpA study (in 23 countries) were included. The effect of individual-level (age, gender, education and marital status) and country-level [e.g. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)] SE factors on health outcomes [Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) >= 2.1, ASDAS, BASFI, fatigue and the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society Health Index (ASAS-HI)] was assessed in mixed-effects models adjusted for potential confounders. Interactions between SE factors and disease phenotype were tested. A mediation analysis was conducted to explore whether the impact of country-level SE factors on ASDAS was mediated through biologic/targeted synthetic (b/ts) DMARD uptake. Results In total, 4185 patients (61% males, mean age 45) were included (65% axSpA, 25% PsA, 10% pSpA). Female gender [beta= 0.14 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.23)], lower educational level [beta = 0.35 (0.25, 0.45)) and single marital status [beta = 0.09 (0.01, 0.17)] were associated with higher ASDAS. Living in lower GDP countries was also associated with higher ASDAS [beta = 0.39 (0.16, 0.63)], and 7% of this association was mediated by b/tsDMARD uptake. Higher BASFI was similarly associated with female gender, lower education and living alone, without the effect of country-level SE factors. Female gender and lower educational level were associated with worse ASAS-HI, while more fatigue was associated with female gender and higher country-level SE factors [lower GDP, beta = -0.46 (-0.89 to -0.04)]. No differences across disease phenotypes were found. Conclusions Our study shows country-driven variations in health outcomes in SpA, independently influenced by individual-level and country-level SE factors and without differences across disease phenotypes.

Geospatial distribution and bypassing health facilities among National Health Insurance Scheme enrollees: implications for universal health coverage in Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						bypassing; geospatial mapping; health insurance; healthcare access; Nigeria; universal health coverage	CARE; DISTANCE	Background This study was carried out to enable an assessment of geospatial distribution and access to healthcare facilities under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) of Nigeria. The findings will be useful for efficient planning and equitable distribution of healthcare resources. Methods Data, including the distribution of selected health facilities, were collected in Ibadan, Nigeria. The location of all facilities was recorded using Global Positioning System and was subsequently mapped using ArcGIS software to produce spider-web diagrams displaying the spatial distribution of all health facilities. Results The result of clustering analysis of health facilities shows that there is a statistically significant hotspot of health facility at 99% confidence located around the urban areas of Ibadan. The significant hotspot result is dominated by a feature with a high value and is surrounded by other features also with high values. Away from the urban built-up area of Ibadan, health facility clustering is not statistically significant. There was also a high level (94%) of bypassing of NHIS-accredited facilities among the enrollees. Conclusions Lopsided distribution of health facilities in the study area should be corrected as this may result in inequity of access to available health services.

Global adoption of personal and social mitigation behaviors during COVID-19: The role of trust & confidence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PUBLIC TRUST; PERCEPTION; HEALTH; GOVERNMENT; KNOWLEDGE; OUTBREAK; CRISIS; SARS	What influences the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation behaviors-both personal, such as mask wearing and frequent handwashing, and social, such as avoiding large gatherings and physical contact-across countries? Understanding why some individuals are more willing to change their behavior to mitigate the spread of a pandemic will not only help us to address the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic but also to respond to future ones. Researchers have pointed to a variety of factors that may influence individual adoption of personal and social mitigation behaviors, including social inequality, risk perception, personality traits, and government policies. While not denying the importance of these factors, we argue that the role of trust and confidence has received insufficient attention to date. Our study explores whether there is a difference in the way trust and confidence in particular leaders and organizations affect individual compliance and whether this effect is consistent across different types of mitigation behaviors. Specifically, we utilize an original cross-national survey conducted during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (May-June 2020) to investigate how trust in scientists, medical professionals, politicians, and religious leaders and confidence in global, national, and local health organizations affects individual compliance in 16 countries/territories across five world regions. Our analyses, which control for the aforementioned factors as well as several others, suggest that trust in politicians and confidence in national health ministries have the most consistent influence on whether individuals adopt both personal and social mitigation behaviors. Across our sample, we find that greater trust in politicians is associated with lower levels of individual compliance with public health directives, whereas greater confidence in the national health ministry is associated with higher levels of individual compliance. Our findings suggest the need to understand trust and confidence as among the most important individual level characteristics driving compliance when developing and delivering messaging about the adoption of mitigation behaviors. The content of the message, it seems, will be most effective when citizens across countries trust its source. Trusted sources, such as politicians and the national health ministry, should thus consider working closely together when determining and communicating recommended health behaviors to avoid contradicting one another.

In Mauritania, where one-fifth of children are underweight, there is a dearth of evidence on socio-economic, sex and geographic disparities in childhood underweight. As a result, this study aimed at investigating the socio-economic, sex and geographic disparities in childhood underweight in Mauritania. Methods Using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software, data from the Mauritania Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICSs) conducted between 2007 and 2015 were analysed. Childhood underweight was disaggregated by five equity stratifiers: education, wealth, residence, region and sex. In addition, absolute and relative inequality measures, namely difference (D), population attributable risk (PAR), ratio (R) and population attributable fraction (PAF) were calculated to understand inequalities from wider perspectives. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to measure statistical significance. Results Substantial absolute and relative socio-economic, sex and geographic disparities in underweight were observed from 2007 to 2015. Children from the poorest households (PAR=-12.66 [95% CI -14.15 to -11.16]), those whose mothers were uneducated (PAF=-9.11 [95% CI -13.41 to -4.81]), those whose mothers were rural residents (R=1.52 [95% CI 1.37 to 1.68]), residents of HodhCharghy (PAF=-66.51 [95% CI -79.25 to -53.76]) and males (D=4.30 [95% CI 2.09 to 6.52]) experienced a higher burden of underweight. Education-related disparities decreased from 2007 to 2015. The urban-rural gap in underweight similarly decreased over time with the different measures showing slightly different reductions. Wealth-driven disparities decreased marginally from 2011 to 2015. The sex-based and regional disparities increased, at least on average, over the 8-y intersurvey period. Conclusions The burden of underweight was significantly higher among children from disadvantaged subpopulations, those with uneducated and poorest/poor mothers, those living in rural areas and those living in HodhCharghy. Special nutrition intervention and efforts focused on these deprived subpopulations are required to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality associated with underweight and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

This review aimed to explore the complexity of migrated older adults' lives and analyze how their multiple identity markers interweave and affect their lived experiences. Research Design and Methods This review is a qualitative systematic review. Intersectionality was applied as a theoretical scaffold to inform the qualitative thematic synthesis of the data. Results A total of 29 studies in the period 2000-2020 were included. Three themes, language barriers, racism and discrimination, and negotiating cultural influences, were identified as common challenges faced by migrated older adults. However, the degree of these challenges and the resources to buffer their effects vary dramatically given the significant differences in migrated older adults' gender, socioeconomic status (SES), cultural backgrounds, and migration pathways. Discussion and Implications Rather than focusing on any single factor, it is required to consider the intersection of age, race, ethnicity, gender, SES, and migration status to understand and address inequality not only between migrated older adults and native older adults, among different migrated older adult groups but also within any certain group.

Patient/Consumer Codesign and Coproduction of Medical Curricula: A Possible Path Toward Improved Cultural Competence and Reduced Health Disparity	SAGE OPEN			English	Article						cultural competence; medical education; curriculum; CALD; indigenous; LGBT; Black Lives Matter; bias; codesign; coproduction	UNCONSCIOUS BIAS; IMPLICIT BIAS; CARE; PATIENT; PERSPECTIVES; INTERVENTION; STUDENTS; STORIES; SAFETY; BLACK	There is often a sociocultural distance between medical practitioners and patients. We bridge that gap in the therapeutic alliance via improved cultural competence and an understanding of the person in their context. The traditional approach in medical education has been of learning via expert-designed curricula, which may tend to mirror the knowledge and needs of the experts. This places individuals at risk who come from culturally and linguistically diverse groups (CALD) with known health disparities: minority groups (e.g., African American); First Nations' people; immigrants and refugees; people who speak nondominant languages; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender people. The authors briefly review the complex area of cultural competency and teaching delivery. The authors survey the Australian population to provide a tangible example of complex cultural diversity amid curriculum challenges. An evidence-based approach that recognizes specific health inequity; the inclusion of CALD stakeholders, students, care professionals, and education professionals; and codesign and coproduction of curriculum components is recommended. This method of people's own stories and collaboration may be applied in any international context, correctly calibrating the learning experience. The aim is for medical students to improve their knowledge of self, others, others within groups, and recognition of unconscious biases to achieve better health outcomes within their specific communities.

Given that action against climate change is primarily taken via energy choices, limiting the use of fossil fuels and promoting renewable sources, an effective strategy is one in which interventions are designed to prevent diseases and jointly mitigate climate change, the so-called cobenefits. For policies capable of producing relevant co-benefits we focus on three categories of interventions, urban planning, diet and transport that are of special importance. For example, policies promoting active transport (cycling, walking) have the triple effect of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, preventing diseases related to atmospheric pollution, and increasing physical activity, thus preventing obesity and diabetes. In particular, we propose that for 2025 the following goals are achieved: reduce the prevalence of smokers by 30%, with particular emphasis on young people; reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity by 20%; reduce the proportion of calories obtained from ultraprocessed foods by 20%; reduce the consumption of alcohol by 10%; reduce the consumption of salt by 30%; reduce the consumption of sugary drinks by 20%; reduce the average consumption of meat by 20%; increase the weekly hours of exercise by 10%. The aim is to complement individual health promotion with structural policies (such as urban planning, taxation and incentives) which render the former more effective and result in a reduction in inequality. We strongly encourage the inclusion of primary prevention in all policies, in light of the described cobenefits. Italy's role as the cohost of the 2020 (now 2021) UN climate negotiations (COP26) presents the opportunity for international leadership in addressing health as an integral component of the response to climate change.

To date, however, this new attention has failed to yield a clear and consistent definition, well-defined metrics for quantifying its impact, or coherent directions for research and intervention. By tracing the origins of this concept over 2 centuries of interactions between market forces and public health action and research, we propose an expanded framework and definition of CDoH. This conceptualization enables public health professionals and researchers to more fully realize the potential of the CDoH concept to yield insights that can be used to improve global and national health and reduce the stark health inequities within and between nations. It also widens the utility of CDoH from its main current use to study noncommunicable diseases to other health conditions such as infectious diseases, mental health conditions, injuries, and exposure to environmental threats. We suggest specific actions that public health professionals can take to transform the burgeoning interest in CDoH into meaningful improvements in health.

Especially the great powers and middle powers have provided different kinds of assistance to countries in need and utilized health diplomacy as an opportunity to construct, reconstruct or consolidate their role in regional and global politics. Turkey was no exception with its assertive and ambitious health diplomacy, of which the Balkans were central. Crisis periods have proved critical junctures for Turkish decision-makers to assert their ambitions in the Balkans. This article examines Turkish diplomacy towards the Balkan countries during the CoViD-19 pandemic and examines how Turkish decision-makers reconstructed a 'regional power' identity. Informed by the constructivist theory, the paper critically investigates how Justice and Development Party tried to consolidate Turkey's identity as a regional power in the Balkans. It delves into the following questions: What are the main reasons for Turkey's coronavirus diplomacy towards the Balkans? How are Turkish decision-makers trying to reconstruct Turkey's role as a regional power during the pandemic?

This conference yielded the Ottawa Charter which defined health promotion as the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. A series of conferences followed and in 2005, WHO convened the Sixth Global Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, which yielded the Bangkok Charter for Health Promotion. This Charter for the first time expanded the role of health promotion to include addressing social determinants of health. Ministers of Health from 47 countries of the WHO Regional Office for Africa in 2012 endorsed the Health Promotion: Strategy for the African Region. This Strategy highlighted eight priority interventions required to address health risk factors and their determinants. In 2011, the Rio Political Declaration on Addressing Social Determinants of Health was adopted by Health Ministers and civil society groups to address inequalities and inequities within and between populations. The main action areas were good governance to tackle the root causes of health inequities; promoting participation and ownership; community leadership for action on social determinants; global action on social determinants to align priorities and stakeholders; and monitoring progress on implementation of policies and strategies. Health promotion has been prominent as part of disease outbreak response, including for Ebola and COVID-19. It has been an integral part of improving maternal and child health mortality and morbidity as well as TB, HIV/AIDS and malaria; and lately reducing the impact of noncommunicable diseases, namely diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer. While challenges continue in strengthening health promotion, there have been concerted efforts to place health promotion on the development agenda in countries through Health in All Policies (HiAP), capacity strengthening, monitoring and evaluation, and innovative financing policy options using dedicated tax from tobacco and alcohol, and road use.

Primary care, where the role of social workers is continuing to grow, is a central location for integrating the treatment of medical, social, and behavioral problems. In these settings, social workers can take the lead to meet community needs, assist in public health efforts, and bolster the frontline medical workforce. The following article reflects upon what we as social workers have learned a year into the global pandemic and how we can apply this knowledge to shaping the future of social work in primary care. Authors consider how the multiple medical and psychosocial needs of patients affected by COVID-19 are addressed in primary care through three core functions of social work: providing behavioral healthcare, coordinating care, and undertaking population health-based interventions. Article ends with a discussion about how social work can respond to the urgent task of transforming health within the context of social work practice, policy, and education for the next generation of healthcare social workers.

B.; Pratt, Bridget; de Vries, Jantina			Considering equity in global health collaborations: A qualitative study on experiences of equity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOUTH; PERSPECTIVES; PARTNERSHIP; GOVERNANCE; LESSONS; DUTIES; NORTH	International collaborations have become the standard model for global health research and often include researchers and institutions from high income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While such collaborations are important for generating new knowledge that will help address global health inequities, there is evidence to suggest that current forms of collaboration may reproduce unequal power relations. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative study with scientists, researchers and those involved in research management, working in international health collaborations. Interviews were conducted between October 2019 and March 2020. We conducted 13 interviews with 15 participants. From our findings, we derive three major themes. First, our results reflect characteristics of equitable, collaborative research relationships. Here we find both relational features, specifically trust and belonging, and structural features, including clear contractual agreements, capacity building, inclusive divisions of labour, and the involvement of local communities. Second, we discuss obstacles to develop equitable collaborations. These include exclusionary labour practices, donor-driven research agendas, overall research culture, lack of accountability and finally, the inadequate financing of indirect costs for LMIC institutions. Third, we discuss the responsibilities for promoting science equity of funders, LMIC researchers, LMIC institutions, and LMIC governments. While other empirical studies have suggested similar features of equity, our findings extend these features to include local communities as collaborators in research projects and not only as beneficiaries. We also suggest the importance of funders paying for indirect costs, without which the capacity of LMIC institutions will continually erode.

Among pastoralists in Kenya, child marriage is believed to be higher compared to the national average. This paper explores how social norms and contextual factors sustain child marriage in communities living in conflict-affected North Eastern Kenya. In-depth interviews were carried out with nomadic and semi-nomadic women and men of reproductive age in Wajir and Mandera counties. Participants were purposively sampled across a range of age groups and community types. Interviews were analysed thematically and guided by a social norms approach. We found changes in the way young couples meet and evidence for negative perceptions of child marriage due to its impact on the girls' reproductive health and gender inequality. Despite this, child marriage was common amongst nomadic and semi-nomadic women. Two overarching themes explained child marriage practices: 1) gender norms, and 2) desire for large family size. Our findings complement the global literature, while contributing perspectives of pastoralist groups. Contextual factors of poverty, traditional pastoral lifestyles and limited formal education opportunities for girls, supported large family norms and gender norms that encouraged and sustained child marriage.

J	Kapiriri, L; Razavi, SD				Kapiriri, Lydia; Razavi, S. Donya			Equity, justice, and social values in priority setting: a qualitative study of resource allocation criteria for global donor organizations working in low-income countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Equity; Social justice; Social values; Development assistance partners (DAP); Health systems; Low-income countries; Priority setting; Resource allocation	HEALTH-CARE; HUMAN-RIGHTS	Background There is increasing acceptance of the importance of social values such as equity and fairness in health care priority setting (PS). However, equity is difficult to define: the term means different things to different people, and the ways it is understood in theory often may not align with how it is operationalized. There is limited literature on how development assistance partner organizations (DAP) conceptualize and operationalize equity in their health care prioritization decisions that affect low-income countries (LIC). This paper explores whether and how equity is a consideration in DAP priority setting processes. Methods This was a qualitative study involving 38 in-depth interviews with DAPs involved in health-system PS for LICs and a review of their respective webpages. Results While several PS criteria were identified, direct articulation of equity as an explicit criterion was lacking. However, the criterion was implied in some of the responses in terms of prioritizing vulnerable populations. Where mentioned, respondents discussed the difficulties of operationalizing equity as a PS criterion since vulnerability is associated with several varying and competing factors including gender, age, geography, and income. Some respondents also suggested that equity could be operationalized in terms of an organization not supporting the pre-existing inequities. Although several organizations' webpages identify addressing inequities as a guiding principle, there were variations in how they spoke about its operationalization. While intersectionalities in vulnerabilities complicate its operationalization, if organizations explicitly articulate their equity focus the other organizations who also have equity as a guiding principle may, instead of focusing on the same aspect, concentrate on other dimensions of vulnerability. That way, all organizations will contribute to achieving equity in all the relevant dimensions. Conclusions Since most development organizations support some form of equity, this paper highlights a need for an internationally recognized framework that recognizes the intersectionalities of vulnerability, for mainstreaming and operationalizing equity in DAP priority setting and resource allocation. Such a framework will support consistency in the conceptualization of and operationalization of equity in global health programs. There is a need for studies which to assess the degree to which equity is actually integrated in these programs.	[Kapiriri, Lydia; Razavi, S.

This study aimed to investigate socio-economic inequality in the dental self-care status (DSS) of Iranian households and decompose the measured inequality into its contributors. Method In this cross-sectional study, pooled data were extracted from Households Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIESs) conducted in Iran from 2012 to 2017. The index of socio-economic status (SES) for each household was constructed using principal components analysis (PCA). We used Wagstaff normalized concentration index as a measure of socio-economic inequality in dental self-care. Decomposition analysis was applied to determine the main factors contributed to the measured inequality. Results The prevalence of dental self-care in the whole population was 40.56%. The total concentration index was 0.271 (CI: 0.266, 0.275). The results of decomposition analysis for the measured inequality showed that SES, was the highest positive contributors (90.19%) followed by sex of household's head (12.15%), place of residence (11.79%) and education level of household's head (11.71%). Furthermore, the province of residence had the highest negative contribution (-11.37) to the inequality. Conclusion The findings of this study showed that a huge portion of the observed inequality was explained by SES that might give us a policy recommendation: There is room for improving dental health and reducing inequality in dental self-care by paying more attention to SES-disadvantaged households.

For ethnic minority and immigrant women these barriers are significantly exacerbated. This metasynthesis explored barriers to help-seeking as experienced by Black, Asian, minority ethnic and immigrant women with experience of intimate partner violence. A review of worldwide literature published in English in peer-reviewed journals on this topic from 2000 to July 2020 produced 2597 relevant articles. After removing duplicates and applying the exclusion criteria, a total of 47 articles were selected for inclusion in the review. The synthesis found that these women faced additional barriers as a result of institutional racism, immigration laws, culture and religion, and issues of cultural competence, and lack of diversity within frontline services. Such barriers, from a range of formal and informal resources, services and other mechanisms of support, served to exacerbate feelings of fear, threat, isolation and powerlessness. The barriers were also further weaponised by perpetrators in order to extend their reign of terror and control. As a result, women were caught in a double-bind - stay in an abusive relationship or face further threats and consequences if they attempted to leave. Whilst our search criteria focused on barriers to help-seeking, many of the papers included in our synthesis also explored facilitators to help-seeking, which are included in our findings and overwhelmingly relate to informal support from females.

J	Ned, LY				Ned, Lieketseng Yvonne			African Renaissance as a Premise for Reimagined Disability Studies in Africa	JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES			English	Review						disability studies; African renaissance; hegemony; epistemic vulnerability; Africa; Global South	GLOBAL SOUTH; HEALTH; REHABILITATION; REFLECTIONS; COMMUNITY; PEOPLE	Disability studies globally is concerned, in various ways, with questions of systemic injustices and inequities that persons with disabilities are subjected to. Persons with disabilities are often positioned as the objects of research rather than equal thinkers and knowledge bearers in their own right. These issues are amplified in the context of African societies, where access is even more challenging than in wealthier countries, and many persons with disabilities are excluded from education altogether. This situation reinforces their epistemic vulnerability. As such, there is limited work on doing disability research from the frame of reference of those in these African societies. This article operates at the nexus of two scholarly traditions. The first of these is the field of disability studies, which is generally dominated by Global North thinking than ideas and experiences from the Global South, and which has addressed questions of knowledge and participation quite extensively, but most commonly in high-income countries. The second is the long-standing political and epistemological African Renaissance lens for understanding and rebelling against imperialism and neo-colonial advances in formerly colonized African societies. I integrate and engage these two scholarly traditions to contribute to charting possibilities of what critical disability studies might look like and mean, from the premise of an African Renaissance. Central to this discussion is building on African theorization while also challenging the dominating and hegemonic white-centric theorization that dominates the field and epistemology in general.

This cross-sectional study analyzed the baseline data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), a population-based cohort study of persons aged 50 years or older. Data was collected using a household and an individual questionnaire at participants' households. Self-rated health was assessed by a global self-rating item. Three socioeconomic indicators were assessed: individual income, per capita household income, and wealth index. Poisson regression models were performed to estimate the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of self-rated health and each socioeconomic indicator, adjusting for covariates. In total, 9,390 older adults answered the outcome question. Whilst for the individual income indicator only the richest quintile showed a statistically significant association with the outcome (PR: 0.90; 95%CI: 0.87; 0.93), for the per capita household income, the fourth (PR: 95; 95%CI: 0. 91; 98) and the fifth quintiles (PR: 0. 90; 95%CI: 86; 0. 94) remained associated with the outcome. Regarding the wealth index, only the second quintile was not associated with the outcome, with lower prevalence of poor self-rated health as richer was the quintile, showing a social gradient. The wealth index seems to be a more adequate indicator, as it reflects resources accumulated over the life course.

Some found novel ways to join efforts to respond to the pandemic. Georgetown University School of Medicine medical students created Medical Supply Drive (MSD or MedSupplyDrive), a 501(c)(3), on March 17, 2020, in response to the national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). This article reviews the formation of a national response to the pandemic, the methods employed to distribute PPE, and the results of MSD's work from March 17, 2020, through June 20, 2020. A focus was placed on equitable distribution, both within local regions and on the national scale, by distinguishing COVID-19 hotspots, including Native American reservations. As of June 20, 2020, over half a million items were donated, with 1,001 deliveries made to 423 hospitals, 182 clinics, 175 long-term care facilities, 25 homeless shelters, 32 public health departments, and 164 other facilities. From 46 states and the District of Columbia, 1,514 individuals volunteered, and 202 signed up as regional coordinators. MSD formed 2 international organizations, MedSupplyDrive UK and MedSupplyDrive Scotland, and established U.S.-based partnerships with 19 different PPE and aid organizations. MSD gained local, national, and international media attention with over 45 interviews conducted about the organization. While the pandemic temporarily disrupted formal medical education, MSD empowered medical students to actively learn about the needs of their communities and organize ways to address them while incorporating these values into their professional identities. The framework that this organization employed also provides a potential model for future disaster relief efforts in times of crisis. MSD hopes to motivate budding physicians to collaborate and play an active role in tackling public health inequities beyond hospitals and within the communities students will one day serve.

The aim of our article is to demonstrate the value of expanding from a social model of health to a sociolegal model of health and empowering health actors to use the law more strategically in the pursuit of health equity. Methods: We propose a modified version of the framework for the social determinants of health (SDoH) equity developed by the 2008 World Health Organization Commission on the Social Determinants of Health by conceptually integrating the functions of the law as identified by the 2019 Lancet-O'Neill Institute Commission on Global Health and Law. Findings: Access to justice provides a critical intersection between social models of public health and work in the justice fields. Addressing the inequities produced through the policies and institutions governing society unites the causes of those seeking to enhance access to justice and those seeking to reduce health inequities. Health justice partnerships (HJPs) are an example of a sociolegal model of health in action. Through the resolution of health issues with legal solutions at the individual level, the dismantling of service silos at the institutional level, and policy and law reform at the systemic level, HJPs demonstrate how the law can be used as a tool to reduce social and health inequities. Conclusions: Greater attention to law as a tool for health creates space for increased collaboration among legal and health scholars, practitioners, and advocates, particularly those working in the areas of the social determinants of health and access to justice, and a promising avenue for reducing health inequities.

Prospective Analysis of Minimum Pricing Policies to Reduce Excessive Alcohol Use and Related Harms in US States	JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS			English	Article							COMPARATIVE COST-EFFECTIVENESS; UNITED-STATES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; TAX INCREASE; CONSUMPTION; INTERVENTIONS; MORBIDITY; DRINKING; IMPACT	Objective: Increasing the price of alcohol is an effective strategy for reducing excessive consumption and alcohol-related harms. Limited research is available on how the establishment of a minimum price for alcoholic beverages might be an effective strategy to reduce this health risk behavior and what impact that might have in the United States. This study describes alcohol minimum pricing (MP) policy options for consideration in the United States, assesses implementation feasibility and effectiveness. and discusses implications for implementation. Method: Three alcohol pricing policy options for reducing excessive drinking were compared in this prospective analysis: alcohol taxation (status quo in states), minimum unit pricing (MUP) by unit of alcohol (e.g., 0.6 oz. [14 g] of pure alcohol), and MP by specified amount of an alcoholic beverage type (e.g., liter of beer). For each policy, five implementation-related domains were analyzed: political feasibility, public acceptability. implementation cost, health equity. and legal feasibility. Effectiveness was also evaluated based on literature. Results: Alcohol MP policies, particularly MUP, could be feasible to implement and cost-efficient for reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms in the United States. MP policies are likely to have modest public acceptability in the United States. Although the political feasibility of MP policies is uncertain and would likely vary across states, international research suggests that MP might be a feasible pricing strategy that can be used in conjunction with alcohol taxes. Conclusions: Alcohol MP can be part of a comprehensive approach for reducing excessive drinking and related harms; however, factors such as state-level differences in alcohol control regulation may influence policy implementation.

We conducted a scoping review to map published interventions aimed at improving access to eyecare for non-Indigenous, non-dominant ethnic groups residing in high-income countries. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health for studies that described an intervention to promote access to eyecare for the target population. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts followed by review of the full text of potentially relevant sources. For included studies, data extraction was carried out independently by two authors. Findings were summarised using a combination of descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results We screened 5220 titles/abstracts, of which 82 reports describing 67 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in the USA (90%), attempted to improve access for Black (48%) or Latinx (28%) communities at-risk for diabetic retinopathy (42%) and glaucoma (18%). Only 30% included the target population in the design of the intervention; those that did tended to be larger, collaborative initiatives, which addressed both patient and provider components of access. Forty-eight studies (72%) evaluated whether an intervention changed an outcome measure. Among these, attendance at a follow-up eye examination after screening was the most common (n=20/48, 42%), and directly supporting patients to overcome barriers to attendance was reported as the most effective approach. Building relationships between patients and providers, running coordinated, longitudinal initiatives and supporting reduction of root causes for inequity (education and economic) were key themes highlighted for success. Conclusion Although research evaluating interventions for non-dominant, non-Indigenous ethnic groups exist, key gaps remain. In particular, the paucity of relevant studies outside the USA needs to be addressed, and target communities need to be involved in the design and implementation of interventions more frequently.

Previous work has covered stakeholder group identification. Objective We aimed to develop factors for health research teams to consider during identification and invitation of individual representatives in a multi-stakeholder research partnership, with the aim of forming equitable and informed teams. Design Consensus development. Participants We involved 16 stakeholders from the international Multi-Stakeholder Engagement (MuSE) Consortium, including patients and the public, providers, payers of health services/purchasers, policy makers, programme managers, peer review editors, and principal investigators. Approach We engaged stakeholders in factor development and as co-authors of this manuscript. Using a modified Delphi approach, we gathered stakeholder views concerning a preliminary list of 18 factors. Over two feedback rounds, using qualitative and quantitative analysis, we concentrated these into ten factors. Key Results We present seven highly desirable factors: 'expertise or experience', 'ability and willingness to represent the stakeholder group', 'inclusivity (equity, diversity and intersectionality)', 'communication skills', 'commitment and time capacity', 'financial and non-financial relationships and activities, and conflict of interest', 'training support and funding needs'. Additionally, three factors are desirable: 'influence', 'research relevant values', 'previous stakeholder engagement'. Conclusions We present factors for research teams to consider during identification and invitation of individual representatives in a multi-stakeholder research partnership. Policy makers and guideline developers may benefit from considering the factors in stakeholder identification and invitation. Research funders may consider stipulating consideration of the factors in funding applications. We outline how these factors can be implemented and exemplify how their use has the potential to improve the quality and relevancy of health research.

The world is rapidly warming, and the consequences of climate change include an increase and intensification in flooding, droughts, wildfires, and other traumatic exposures. Although countries in the Global South have contributed least to global warming, they are the most vulnerable owing to historical inequities. The concept of 'climate justice' recognises that historical racial discrimination, class disenfranchisement, political misrecognition, and other social injustices make surviving climate change and thriving within it more challenging. This narrative review considers the psychological consequences of the climate emergency through a climate justice lens. The article discusses the unequal exposures to psychological adversities, socio-historical barriers to adaptations and, finally, institutional betrayal that complicates the experience of psychological distress. The review concludes by pragmatically discussing how psychology could support climate justice ends.

Militarization and Gender Inequality: Exploring the Impact	JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS & POLICY			English	Article						Militarization; military expenditure; gender inequality; patriarchy; social reproduction	MILITARY EXPENDITURES; POLITICAL REGIMES; WOMEN LEGISLATORS; CONFLICT; SECURITY; WELFARE; HEALTH; PANEL; REPRESENTATION; ESTIMATORS	Feminist scholars have long argued that militarism and patriarchy are linked. To date, however, the relationship between militarization and gender inequality has not been empirically tested. Using the Gender Inequality Index and the Global Militarization Index for the period of 1990-2017 for 133 countries, we put the spotlight on militarization to show how it reflects and contributes to gender inequality (in terms of health, education, political representation, and labor force participation). Our article shows that higher militarization is significantly correlated with higher gender inequality, controlling for major variables such as the military in politics, the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women, conflict, democracy level, and regime type. Among other results, we find that higher representation of women in parliament correlates with less military spending. The results are significant in the case of Muslim majority countries and MENA countries, and with respect to countries with different income levels.

Expanding Global Health Engagement through Fogarty Fellowship Programs	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE			English	Article							CLINICAL-RESEARCH SCHOLARS; INTERNATIONAL CENTER; WORKFORCE; IMPACT	Training the next generation of global health researchers is vital for sustainable research partnerships and global health equity. The Fogarty International Center (National Institutes of Health) supports postdoctoral fellows and professional/graduate students in long-term, hands-on mentored research in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). We surveyed 627 alumni (58% from the United States, 42% from LMICs) from three sequential Fogarty-sponsored global health research training programs (response rate: N = 257, 41%). Publications in the Index Medicus were used to ascertain scholarly output. Most alumni (63%) reported remaining engaged in LMICs and/or worked in academic/research careers (70%). Since completing their Fogarty fellowship, 144 alumni (56%) had received 438 new grants as principal investigator (PI), co-/multi-PI, or site PI.

Comprehensive evaluation of disparities in cardiometabolic and reproductive risk between Hispanic and White women with polycystic ovary syndrome in the United States: a systematic review and meta-analysis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY			English	Review						blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; diversity; dyslipidemias; hyperandrogenism; insulin; metabolic syndrome; minority; obesity; polycystic ovary syndrome	NUTRITION EXAMINATION SURVEY; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; MEXICAN-AMERICAN; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; DIABETES-MELLITUS; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; ETHNIC-DIFFERENCES; METABOLIC SYNDROME; HEALTH-CARE; GENETIC ARCHITECTURE	OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively compare cardiometabolic and reproductive health risk between Hispanic and White women with polycystic ovary syndrome in the United States in response to the call by the international guideline for polycystic ovary syndrome to delineate health disparities. DATA SOURCES: Databases of MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus were initially searched through October 25, 2020, and confirmed on February 1, 2021. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Observational studies comparing glucoregulatory, lipid profile, anthropometric, blood pressure, androgen, ovarian morphology, oligoanovulation, and infertility status between Hispanic and White women with polycystic ovary syndrome were included. The primary outcome was metabolic syndrome risk. Furthermore, major cardiovascular events (stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure) and mortality rate (cardiovascular death and total mortality) data were evaluated. Studies on adolescents (<2 years after menarche), pregnant, or menopausal-aged women (>50 years) were excluded. METHODS: Data were pooled by random-effects models and expressed as mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies (n=2267; 589 Hispanic and 1678 White women) were eligible. All studies, including both White and Hispanic women, had high-quality assessment (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score of >= 8). Hispanic women exhibited comparable metabolic syndrome prevalence (7% [95% confidence interval, -1 to 14]; P=.06; I-2=0%); however, Hispanic women exhibited higher modified Ferriman-Gallwey score (0.60 [95% confidence interval, -0.01 to 1.21]; P=.05; I-2=0%), fasting insulin (5.48 mu U/mL [95% confidence interval, 3.11-7.85]; P <=.01; I-2=40.0%), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (1.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.50-1.89]; P <=.01; I-2 =43.0%) than White women. The 2 groups had comparable glucose, lipid profile, waist circumference, blood pressure, and androgen status (all P >=.08). Findings about group differences in certain reproductive outcomes (ie, ovarian dysmorphology and infertility) were contradictory and described only narratively as inclusion in the metaanalyses was not possible. No study reported on cardiovascular events or mortality. CONCLUSION: Hispanic women with polycystic ovary syndrome exhibited greater impairments in glucoregulatory status than White women. Disparities in reproductive risks could not be concluded. The degree to which glucoregulatory aberrations translate into patientpressing diseases (diabetes mellitus and infertility) remains a major roadblock given the paucity of available evidence. Our observations have supported the consideration of these disparities in the diagnostic, monitoring, and management practices for polycystic ovary syndrome and reinforced the need to elucidate mechanisms that account for the observed disparities to foster equity in polycystic ovary syndrome care.

The design of active ageing policies intersects with different overarching societal challenges, especially ageing populations, social rights and sustainability. However, there are no previous attempts to review active ageing policies in the light of these challenges and the international policy objectives and targets that are guiding the international community. The aim of this study is to systematically identify, review and analyse all national and regional policies on active ageing adopted in Italy, by applying a conceptual framework derived from main international policy initiatives in the three areas. The research was conducted in two stages. First, a case study analysis was carried out per each relevant national institution and regional government. Standardised interviews were combined with policy document search, selection and analysis. Second, we performed a policy analysis in the light of a conceptual framework adopted. This latter was composed by nine policy domains, selected and integrated from principles and objectives of three overarching international frameworks on ageing-i.e., the Regional Implementation Strategy (RIS) commitments of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (MIPAA), social rights-i.e., the European Pillar of Social Rights and sustainability-i.e., the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. Results pointed out that out of the identified nine policy fields, the major intervention areas by Italian policy makers concerned labour market participation, life-long learning, social and economic inequalities, health and well-being. Less attention had been given to issues such as gender and equal opportunities and sustainable cities. This systematic policy review is a milestone for understanding how active ageing policies contribute to address major societal challenges and what domains need further policy development.

Despite this, the ever increasing obesity rates among Emirati youth, higher than international standards, is alarming. This research aims at identifying how different perceptions of the built environment by parents and adolescents are likely to affect physical activity (PA) choices among male and female Emirati youth. This can help inform better health and education policies to achieve three of the interconnected UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely good quality health and well-being, quality education, and gender equality, that the UAE strives to achieve. Responses from 335 students (aged 14-20) from six schools and 250 parent responses in the Al Ain region of Abu Dhabi Emirate were used to understand the mean variation in perception of five built environment constructs. Further, multinomial logit regression was used to assess the health condition using the perception, behavior, and built environment measures. Results indicate that Emirati males perceive the built environment factors as barriers more than female adolescents. Parents perceive street crossing (p < 0.016) and sidewalk characteristics (p < 0.020) to be more of a hindrance. Traffic exposure, self-reported physical activity, and walkability near homes and schools significantly affect Emirati adolescents' health conditions. Recommendations are made for various stakeholders including parents, school authorities, Abu Dhabi Municipality and Transportation, and the Urban Planning department on ways to enhance the built environment and encourage PA and well-being of Emirati adolescents.

J	Macdonald, M				Macdonald, Mia			Emerging from COVID-19: A New, Rights-Based Relationship with the Nonhuman World?	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							FUTURE	This essay argues that the global response to COVID-19 should lead to new thinking and action, and specifically, a new relationship with the nonhuman world that is centered on mutuality and respect, not commodification and exploitation. Such a response would acknowledge and embed concepts like ecological justice and One Welfare in policy and practice, particularly regarding the consequences of intensive animal agriculture and production of monocultures of feedstock for the billions of farmed animals used in food production each year. Drawing on examples from the Global South and Global North, the essay suggests ways forward that provide opportunities for new thinking, research, and action, with the COVID-19 crisis contextualized by the urgency of the climate and biodiversity crises. With deep inequalities and infringement of rights embedded in each of these global challenges, successfully addressing them likely depends on useful disruptions in, and a bridging of, the divides that have separated human and nonhuman rights and have limited the intersections between public health, the environment, and animal welfare and rights.

Karim			Climate Justice, Humans Rights, and the Case for Reparations	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								The global community is facing an existential crisis that threatens the web of life on this planet. Climate change, in addition to being a fundamental justice and ethical issue, constitutes a human rights challenge. It is a human rights challenge because it undermines the ability to promote human flourishing and welfare through the implementation of human rights, particularly the right to life and the right to health. It is also a human rights challenge because climate change disproportionately impacts poor and the vulnerable people in both low-income and high-income countries. Those living in many lowincome countries are subject to the worst impacts of climate change even though they have contributed negligibly to the problem. Further, low-income countries have the fewest resources and capabilities at present to adapt or cope with the severe, long-lasting impacts of climate change. Building on human rights principles of accountability and redress for human rights violations, this paper responds to this injustice by seeking to make long-neglected societal amends through the implementation of the concept of climate reparations. After discussing the scientific evidence for climate change, its environmental and socioeconomic impacts, and the ethical and human rights justifications for climate reparations, the paper proposes the creation of a new global institutional mechanism, the Global Climate Reparations Fund, which would be linked with the United Nations Human Rights Council, to fund and take action on climate reparations. This paper also identifies which parties are most responsible for the current global climate crisis, both historically and currently, and should therefore fund the largest proportion of climate-related reparations.

J	Viveros-Uehara, T				Viveros-Uehara, Thalia			Health Care in a Changing Climate: A Review of Climate Change Laws and National Adaptation Plans in Latin America	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Review							DRIVERS	Given that the health-related impacts of climate change in Latin America disproportionately affect the most marginalized sections of the population, there is a need to enhance countries' adaptive capacity through improved health systems. Though public health institutions have delineated guidelines to enhance health care systems' preparedness for climate change, embedding a human rights perspective in their translation into laws and policies further adds important value. Crucially, a rights-based approach strengthens health responses to climate change by calling attention to how climate law and policy fail to account for persistent and interlocking socioeconomic inequalities. This is an area that has not been fully present in the provision of health services in Latin America, which rely almost exclusively on a conventional epidemiological perspective and do not consider the historical and sociocultural nature of health challenges. Hence, this paper draws on two case studies-Brazil and Colombia-to identify the extent to which their national climate change laws and adaptation plans incorporate a human rights-based approach in their tasks to enhance their adaptive capacity through the expansion of affordable and quality health care. With respect to the countries' laws, the absence of explicit references to the right to health exemplifies the fragmentation between the international human rights framework and international climate change law. Further, both countries' adaptation plans hold considerable room for improving their engagement with the human rights framework, particularly by establishing mechanisms to promote transparency, monitoring, and the participation of marginalized groups.

Crises as Catalyst: A New Social Contract Grounded in Worker Rights	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							ECONOMIC-GROWTH; DECENT WORK; HEALTH	Three crises-climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and extreme economic and social inequality intersect and have had devastating impacts on workers' rights to health, as well as the right to decent work, an underlying determinant of health. Yet these crises may act as catalysts, as responses present opportunities for transformation. Indeed, multiple international governance institutions and nongovernmental organizations have proposed new social contracts that aim to address the multiple challenges facing workers today. These initiatives promise to transform society to make workers and their families healthier and the planet more sustainable. They join and supplement earlier efforts at transformation, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This article critiques (1) the market-fundamentalist neoliberal social contract, which gave rise to, or exacerbated, the three crises, and (2) the 2030 agenda and recent International Labour Organization proposals, which are all built on this neoliberal platform. Finally, the article argues for a social contract that is grounded in human rights-specifically worker rights-to address these crises and ensure greater protection of the health	[Frey, Diane F.] San Francisco State Univ, Labor Studies, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Macnaughton, Gillian] Social & Econ Rights Associates, Montpelier, VT 05602 USA; [Kaur, Andjela H.] Univ North Dakota, Educ Hlth & Behav, Grand Forks, ND USA; [Kaur, Andjela H.] Univ North Dakota, Rehabil & Human Serv Program, Grand Forks, ND USA; [Taborda, Elena K.] Social & Econ Rights Associates, Boston, MA USA	California State University System; San Francisco State University; University of North Dakota Grand Forks; University of North Dakota Grand Forks	Macnaughton, G (corresponding author), Social & Econ Rights Associates, Montpelier, VT 05602 USA.	gillian@SERAglobal.org							47	0	1	0	4	HARVARD UNIV PRESS	CAMBRIDGE	79 GARDEN ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA	1079-0969	2150-4113		HEALTH HUM RIGHTS	Health Hum.

HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS; RESIDENTS; TORONTO; REFUGEE; ACCESS	The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for reflection on universal health coverage. We look at the case of the province of Ontario, Canada, which expanded health care entitlement during the pandemic to people not normally eligible for coverage, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. We use the concept of health-related deservingness to examine why certain groups of people are deemed undeserving and are excluded in ordinary times but included in extraordinary times. We argue that tying health-related deservingness to citizenship or immigration status creates problematic inequities in health care access and outcomes and that entitlement to health care should be based instead on a person's right to health. A right to health approach could make health care systems truly universal and comprehensive. We recommend that expanded entitlement to care should be sustained, both in Ontario and elsewhere, beyond the COVID-19 crisis.

Ensuring Rights while Protecting Health: The Importance of Using a Human Rights Approach in Implementing Public Health Responses to COVID-19	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							LOCKDOWN; ABUSE	In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world have implemented public health policies that limit individual freedoms in order to control disease transmission. While such limitations on liberties are sometimes necessary for pandemic control, many of these policies have been overly broad or have neglected to consider the costs for populations already susceptible to human rights violations. Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated preexisting inequities based on health care access, poverty, racial injustice, refugee crises, and lack of education. The worsening of such human rights violations increases the need to utilize a human rights approach in the response to COVID-19. This paper provides a global overview of COVID-19 public health policy interventions implemented from January 1 to June 30, z0z0, and identifies their impacts on the human rights of marginalized populations. We find that over 7096 of these public health policies negatively affect human rights in at least one way or for at least one population. We recommend that policy makers take a human rights approach to COVID-19 pandemic control by designing public health policies focused on the most marginalized groups in society. Doing so would allow for a more equitable, realistic, and sustainable pandemic response that is centered on the needs of those at highest risk of COVID-19 and human rights violations.

Determinants of inequalities in years with disability: an international-comparative study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							CHILDHOOD SOCIOECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES; ACTIVITY LIMITATION; SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; LIFE EXPECTANCY; HEALTH; MORTALITY; EUROPE; RISK; SMOKING; OBESITY	Background: Persons with a lower socioeconomic position spend more years with disability, despite their shorter life expectancy, but it is unknown what the important determinants are. This study aimed to quantify the contribution to educational inequalities in years with disability of eight risk factors: father's manual occupation, low income, few social contacts, smoking, high alcohol consumption, high body-weight, low physical exercise and low fruit and vegetable consumption. Methods: We collected register-based mortality and survey-based disability and risk factor data from 15 European countries covering the period 2010-14 for most countries. We calculated years with disability between the ages of 35 and 80 by education and gender using the Sullivan method, and determined the hypothetical effect of changing the prevalence of each risk factor to the prevalence observed among high educated ('upward levelling scenario'), using Population Attributable Fractions. Results: Years with disability among low educated were higher than among high educated, with a difference of 4.9 years among men and 5.5 years among women for all countries combined. Most risk factors were more prevalent among low educated. We found the largest contributions to inequalities in years with disability for low income (men: 1.0 year; women: 1.4 year), high body-weight (men: 0.6 year; women: 1.2 year) and father's manual occupation (men: 0.7 year; women: 0.9 year), but contributions differed by country. The contribution of smoking was relatively small. Conclusions: Disadvantages in material circumstances (low income), circumstances during childhood (father's manual occupation) and high body-weight contribute to inequalities in years with disability.

Assessing the indirect effects of COVID-19 on healthcare delivery, utilization and health outcomes: a scoping review	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							IMPACT; ASSOCIATION; SURGERY; DISEASE	Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and global efforts to contain its spread, such as stay-at-home orders and transportation shutdowns, have created new barriers to accessing healthcare, resulting in changes in service delivery and utilization globally. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the literature published thus far on the indirect health effects of COVID-19 and to explore the data sources and methodologies being used to assess indirect health effects. Methods: A scoping review of peer-reviewed literature using three search engines was performed. Results: One hundred and seventy studies were included in the final analysis. Nearly half (46.5%) of included studies focused on cardiovascular health outcomes. The main methodologies used were observational analytic and surveys. Data were drawn from individual health facilities, multicentre networks, regional registries, and national health information systems. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries with only 35.4% of studies representing low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Conclusion: Healthcare utilization for non-COVID-19 conditions has decreased almost universally, across both high- and lower-income countries. The pandemic's impact on non-COVID-19 health outcomes, particularly for chronic diseases, may take years to fully manifest and should be a topic of ongoing study. Future research should be tied to system improvement and the promotion of health equity, with researchers identifying potentially actionable findings for national, regional and local health leadership. Public health professionals must also seek to address the disparity in published data from LMICs as compared with high-income countries.	[Roy, Charlotte M.; Bollman, E.

BLACK URBAN ECOLOGIES AND STRUCTURAL EXTERMINATION	HARVARD ENVIRONMENTAL LAW REVIEW			English	Article							POLITICAL-ECONOMY; FOOD JUSTICE; PROPERTY; GENTRIFICATION; GROWTH; FARMS; CITY	Residents of low-income, metropolitan communities across the United States frequently live in "food apartheid" neighborhoods-areas with limited access to nutrient-rich and fresh food. Local government law scholars, poverty law scholars, and political theorists have long argued that structural racism embedded in America's political economy influences the uneven development of such Black urban ecologies. Accordingly, food justice scholars have called for local governments to develop urban agricultural markets that combat racism in global corporatized food systems by localizing food development. These demands have only amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has ravaged Black communities where residents suffer from preexisting health conditions and weakened immune systems associated with food insecurity. However, while local governments are increasing development of urban agriculture in Black urban spaces, in some instances, this has only driven Black and minoritized residents to compete against one another for access to healthy food and scarce farmland. Thus, the development of urban agriculture may function to recreate the very problems of racial capitalism and neoliberalism embedded in America's political economy that animate food insecurity in the first place. This Article argues that urban agriculture imbued with racial capitalist norms and neoliberal politics-e.g., "neutral" and "colorblind" policies that ignore historic state-sponsored racial discrimination, limit governmental market interventions, and promote individualistic competition and private ownership-will fail to mitigate the structural oppression that drives food insecurity in Black urban landscapes marred by environmental degradation, or Black urban ecologies. Instead, such forces distort urban agriculture into a weapon of exploitation, expropriation, and erasure, each foundational elements of a social theory of ecological systems change this Author calls structural extermination. This Article illustrates the theory of structural extermination, which has broad explanatory power, by examining Washington, D.C.'s history of urban farming legislation, beginning with the passage of the Food Production and Urban Gardens Program Act of 1986 and continuing, most recently, with the Urban Farming Land Lease Amendment Act of 2019. By documenting a visible shift in political discourse about Washington, D.C.'s urban farming program, from a community-oriented initiative for gardening and food donation to a market-centered program for land leasing and tax abatement, this analysis reveals how decontextualized and dehistoricized urban agriculture risks legitimating and rationalizing competitive market structures that enact violence upon the poor, and push low-income residents out of the city altogether. Finally, this Article calls for the democratization of ecological placemaking in Black urban geographies, a decolonial praxis that would embrace a justice-based vision of community economic development premised upon the principles of social solidarity, economic democracy, and solidarity economy.

Progress Toward Rubella and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Control and Elimination - Worldwide, 2012-2020	MMWR-MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT			English	Article								What is already known about this topic? Congenital rubella syndrome, a devastating constellation of birth defects, is caused by rubella infection during pregnancy. Since 2012, rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) introduction efforts have accelerated worldwide, and a 2020 global policy update recommended that introduction efforts use a strategy that leads to elimination. What is added by this report? By 2020, 173 (89%) of 194 countries had introduced RCVs, and 93 (48%) had been verified as having eliminated rubella transmission. Vaccination introduction equity improved substantially among lower income countries, but vaccination coverage remains a concern. What are the implications for public health practice? To further progress, it is important the 21 remaining countries introduce rubella vaccine and that all countries enhance vaccination coverage and surveillance to achieve and maintain elimination.

As of 12 January 2022, there were over 314 million cases and over 5.5 million deaths notified since the start of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic takes variable shapes and forms, in terms of cases and deaths, in different regions and countries of the world. The objective of this study is to analyse the variable expression of COVID-19 pandemic so that lessons can be learned towards an effective public health emergency response. Methods We conducted a mixed-methods study to understand the heterogeneity of cases and deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Correlation analysis and scatter plot were employed for the quantitative data. We used Spearman's correlation analysis to determine relationship strength between cases and deaths and socio-economic and health systems. We organized qualitative information from the literature and conducted a thematic analysis to recognize patterns of cases and deaths and explain the findings from the quantitative data. Results We have found that regions and countries with high human development index have higher cases and deaths per million population due to COVID-19. This is due to international connectedness and mobility of their population related to trade and tourism, and their vulnerability related to older populations and higher rates of non-communicable diseases. We have also identified that the burden of the pandemic is also variable among high- and middle-income countries due to differences in the governance of the pandemic, fragmentation of health systems, and socio-economic inequities. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that every country remains vulnerable to public health emergencies. The aspiration towards a healthier and safer society requires that countries develop and implement a coherent and context-specific national strategy, improve governance of public health emergencies, build the capacity of their (public) health systems, minimize fragmentation, and tackle upstream structural issues, including socio-economic inequities. This is possible through a primary health care approach, which ensures provision of universal and equitable promotive, preventive and curative services, through whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches.

However, international marketing scholars have yet to address the societal costs of the use of social media, even as academics in other disciplines and business leaders are raising alarm that social media has created a digital ecosystem that may harm individuals within the global market. The objective of this research is to examine the generalizability of the relationship between the use of social media and the prevalence of depression across countries. Design/methodology/approach Employing social cohesion theory and the social network approach of the strength of ties, this work examines the relationship between the use of social media and time spent on social media at the country level and the prevalence of depression. The authors examine this issue within a 28-country, eight-year, unbalanced panel dataset, accounting for cultural, economic and structural factors. Findings The authors find that as more people within a country use social media, the prevalence of depression in that country increases. However, the authors also find that as the average time spent on social media in a country increases the deleterious relationship between the use of social media and the prevalence of depression diminishes. Originality/value Answering the calls in the international marketing literature for a greater understanding of the externalities (i.e. consumer well-being effects) of marketing activities of multinational companies, this study demonstrates the varying relationships of the use of and time spent on social media and the prevalence of depression at the population level, across a wide variety of countries, thus also contributing to the effort to improving generalizations from multi-country comparisons in international research.

However, there is currently no published literature on whether there is a need for neurosurgical equipment donations or how to design equipment donation programmes that meet the needs of LMIC neurosurgeons. The primary aims of this study were to explore: (1) the need for the donation of neurosurgical equipment from the UK and Ireland to LMICs within the African continent, and (2) the ways through which neurosurgical equipment donations could meet the needs of LMIC neurosurgeons.Methods: This was a qualitative study using semi-structured, one-on-one, audio-recorded interviews. Purposive sampling was used to recruit and interview consultants or attending neurosurgeons from Ireland, the UK and LMICs in Africa in a continuous process until data saturation. Interviews were conducted by members of the Association of Future African Neurosurgeons during March 2021. Qualitative analysis used a thematic approach using open and axial coding.Results: Five HIC and 3 LMIC neurosurgeons were interviewed. Five overarching themes were identified: (1) inequality of access to neurosurgical equipment, (2) identifying specific neurosurgical equipment needs, (3) importance of organisations, (4) partnerships between LMIC and HIC centres, and (5) donations are insufficient in isolation.Conclusion: There is a need for greater access to neurosurgical equipment in LMICs. It is unclear if neurosurgical equipment donations are the optimal solution to this issue. Other solutions that are not linked to dependency need to be explored and executed. Collaborative relationships between LMICs and HICs better ensures that neurosurgical equipment donations meet the needs of the recipients. These relationships may be best created within an organisation framework that has the logistical capabilities of coordinating international equipment donation and providing a quality control measure.

AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article						UN Security Council; Human rights; global health; health security; HIV/AIDS; COVID-19	PUBLIC-HEALTH	This article examines how the 'health security' paradigm positions health-related human rights as subordinate to national security concerns. As a consequence, health is viewed instrumentally, shifting the global health response towards maintaining national security rather than upholding human rights. We trace here how both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Security Council have approached global health crises, evolving across infectious disease responses to HIV/AIDS, SARS, Ebola and COVID-19. While the Security Council has come to address human rights in select public health contexts, we see that the securitisation of human rights in times of crisis can pose severe limits on individual rights, failing to develop global health solidarity through a commitment to broader health objectives such as Universal Health Coverage. We conclude that the Security Council and the WHO should collaborate towards a rights-based response to COVID-19 that prioritises individual human rights alongside national security concerns, addressing underlying inequities in the global response to infectious disease.

Design A population-based observational study. Setting The prevalence of blindness and vision loss due to glaucoma were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 database. The Human Development Index (HDI), inequality-adjusted HDI and other socioeconomic data were acquired from international open databases. Main outcome measures The prevalence of blindness and vision loss due to glaucoma by age, gender, subregion and Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) levels. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the associations between the prevalence and socioeconomic indicators. Results The overall age-standardised prevalence of blindness and vision loss due to glaucoma worldwide was 81.5 per 100 000 in 1990 and 75.6 per 100 000 in 2017. In 2017, men had a higher age-standardised prevalence than women (6.07% vs 5.42%), and the worldwide prevalence increased with age, from 0.5 per 100 000 in the 45-49 year age group to 112.9 per 100 000 among those 70+. Eastern Mediterranean and African regions had the highest prevalence during the whole period, while the Americas region had the lowest prevalence. The prevalence was highest in low-SDI and low-income regions while lowest in high-SDI and high-income regions over the past 27 years. Multiple linear regression showed cataract surgery rate (beta=-0.01, p=0.009), refractive error prevalence (beta=-0.03, p=0.024) and expected years of schooling (beta= -8.33, p=0.035) were associated with lower prevalence, while gross national income per capita (beta=0.002, p<0.001) was associated with higher prevalence. Conclusions Lower socioeconomic levels and worse access to eyecare services are associated with higher prevalence of glaucoma-related blindness and vision loss. These findings provide evidence for policy-makers that investments in these areas may reduce the burden of the leading cause of irreversible blindness.

Ischemic Heart Disease in Nigeria: Exploring the Challenges, Current Status, and Impact of Lifestyle Interventions on Its Primary Healthcare System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						behavioural change; cardiovascular diseases; diet; health promotion; Nigeria; lifestyle; physical activity; Universal Health Coverage; sub-Saharan Africa	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; GLOBAL BURDEN; RISK; MORTALITY; BEHAVIOR; FOCUS	The burden of ischemic heart disease in Nigeria calls for an evidence-based, innovative, and interdisciplinary approach towards decreasing health inequalities resulting from individual lifestyle and poor socioeconomic status in order to uphold the holistic health of individuals to achieve global sustainability and health equity. The poor diagnosis and management of ischemic heart disease in Nigeria contributes to the inadequate knowledge of its prognosis among individuals, which often results in a decreased ability to seek help and self-care. Hence, current policies aimed at altering lifestyle behaviour to minimize exposure to cardiovascular risk factors may be less suitable for Nigeria's diverse culture. Mitigating the burden of ischemic heart disease through the equitable access to health services and respect for the autonomy and beliefs of individuals in view of achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) requires comprehensive measures to accommodate, as much as possible, every individual, notwithstanding their values and socioeconomic status.

We used publicly available data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses to estimate the national and provincial-level prevalence of child marriage across mainland China. Between 2000 and 2010, the prevalence of child marriage rose from 2.41 percent to 2.85 percent among women and from 0.54 percent to 0.77 percent among men. The 2010 estimates are equivalent to roughly 1.8 million women and 0.5 million men. Child marriage was more common in western provinces among both girls and boys. Provincial prevalence estimates ranged from 0.44 percent in Beijing to 12.94 percent in Qinghai among girls. Among boys, estimates ranged from 0.13 percent in Beijing to 5.03 percent in Tibet. The gender gap widened across much of the country between censuses. Our results indicate that child marriage continues across mainland China despite laws that ostensibly prohibit the practice. They also draw attention to the global nature of child marriage as a threat to gender equality.

The third author (S.F.'s) lived experiences as a Hong Kong Chinese gender-fluid bodybuilder who competes in international women's bodybuilding contests serve as an impetus to examine cultural norming and marginalization in professional sport. Narrative analysis and autobiographical memory are used to understand SF's construction of identities in relation to her(1) sociocultural environment and as a political process that alerts us to the power structures that permit certain stories to be told while silencing others. Specifically, this article problematizes how professional women bodybuilders are being constructed as objects that are expected to embody Whiteness and 'authentic heightened femininity'. It highlights how the intersection of genderfluidity, race/ethnicity and bodybuilding defy dominant understandings of what is aesthetically, experientially and physically acceptable within the 'norm' in both 'Eastern' and 'Western', and masculine and feminine worlds. The discussion aims to provide implications to moving beyond the enduring binary gendered, racialized and sexual assumptions in women sport.

It is a major cause of admission to paediatric intensive care units; despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment, both incidence and mortality are high in low-income and middle-income countries. There are several barriers in addressing the enormous burden of paediatric sepsis in these countries, which include: lack of data of incidence and mortality; unfamiliarity of sepsis by the lay public, leading to failure to seek care early, and by health professionals, leading to failure to treat emergently; and insufficient government funding for sepsis care programmes leading to inadequate staffing, material, and financial resources, and therefore, poor health systems. Socioeconomic inequalities, such as inequity and marked variation in income and education, high rates of malnutrition, high percentage of young population, and health systems that do not meet the population's demands also represent barriers in the care of children with sepsis in Latin America. In this Viewpoint, we draw attention to the problem of paediatric sepsis in Latin America and call for action to reduce the disease burden by proposing some solutions.

J	Liao, H; Yan, CY; Ma, Y; Wang, J				Liao, Hui; Yan, Chaoyang; Ma, Ying; Wang, Jing			Association Between Dynamic Trends of Functional Disability and Poverty Among People Aged 45 and Over	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						functional disability; dynamic trends; economic conditions; poverty; catastrophic health expenditure	HEALTH-CARE; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; OLDER-ADULTS; LIFE; TRAJECTORIES; CHINA; INEQUALITIES; TRANSITIONS; EXPENDITURE; QUALITY	BackgroundThe disability problem has become prominent with the acceleration of the global aging process. Individual disability is associated with economic conditions and contributes to family poverty. As disability will change over a long period of time and may even show distinct dynamic trends, we aimed to focus on activities of daily living (ADL) and classify functional disability trends. Moreover, we aimed to highlight and analyze the association between functional disability trends and economic conditions and explore the influencing factors. Materials and MethodsA total of 11,222 individuals who were 45 years old or older were included in four surveys conducted by the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018. Samples were analyzed after excluding those with missing key variables. The latent class growth model was used to classify the ADL trends. Two binary logistic regressions were established to observe the association between the ADL trends and follow-up economic conditions or catastrophic health expenditure trends. ResultsADL trends of older adults were classified into improving (25.4%), stabilizing (57.0%), and weakening ADL (17.6%). ADL trend was associated with follow-up poverty (p = 0.002) and catastrophic health expenditure trends (p < 0.001). Compared with the improving ADL trend, the stabilizing ADL may have a negative influence on individuals' economic conditions (OR = 1.175, 95%CI = 1.060-1.303). However, a stabilizing ADL trend was less likely to bring about catastrophic health expenditures (OR = 0.746, 95%CI = 0.678-0.820) compared with an improving ADL trend. ConclusionThe improvement of functional disability would make the medical expense burden heavier but would still be beneficial for the prevention of poverty. A significant association was found between socioeconomic factors and poverty. Preventing the older adults from developing disability and illness, improving the compensation level of medical insurance, and optimizing the long-term care insurance and the primary healthcare system can potentially contribute to the prevention of poverty. Meanwhile, focusing on people who are poor at early stages, women, middle-aged, low-educated, and in rural areas is important.

Accessibility is widely used as a performance measure for land use and transport systems; it measures people's ease of reaching desired destinations and incorporates mode, time, and/or cost constraints. Considerable differences exist in the level of accessibility experienced by different mode users in reaching healthcare facilities, which calls for additional equity considerations given the prevailing socio-demographic characteristics of the users of various modes and the importance of healthcare facilities as a destination. In this study, we explore the distribution of accessibility to healthcare facilities by public transport and by car in Recife, Brazil, through an equity assessment to identify areas with low accessibility using these modes at different times of day. In general, the higher accessibility of public transport as well as greater modal equity was observed in central regions of Recife, whereas the periphery, where many low-income census tracts can be found, experiences significant inequity when it comes to access by both modes to healthcare facilities. This analysis allowed us to classify locations to access impoverished, access absolutely impoverished, and access impoverished by public transport areas, which can be targeted with appropriate land use and public transport policy interventions.

We introduce a public psychology for liberation (PPL) training model. Essentially, the model reflects a science, a pedagogical commitment, and practice of, by, and with the people who have been most marginalized in society. The PPL consists of five foundational domains or cross-cutting areas of expertise (e.g., facilitate human relationships; generate reciprocal knowledge and translation) and 10 interrelated lifelong practices (e.g., cultural humility; care and compassion) that foster healing and equity. The model centers the perspectives of the Global Majority, focuses on radical healing and equity, and emphasizes a developmental, culturally grounded, strengths-based approach to training. Various training initiatives consistent with a public psychology for liberation approach are presented. Public Significance Statement We propose the public psychology for liberation training model as one mechanism to assist the discipline in contributing to (a) the solutions to fundamental problems in society such as racism and other forms of exploitation and oppression and (b) the promotion of justice for all members in society. The model incorporates the development of five foundational domains or areas of expertise and 10 lifelong practices designed that can be applied to most professional roles.

Training and implementation of dialogical ways of working require that professionals disposition themselves as experts and 'unlearn' traditional therapeutic relations. This study explored trainees' discussions of their expectations of Open Dialogue as they commence their training. Four focus groups, two in Australia and two in Denmark, were analysed thematically. We generated the theme 'shared concern' with four sub-themes: (1) 'A democratising alternative', (2) 'Waiting and listening', (3) 'Acknowledging many kinds of expertise' and (4) 'Personal participation'. Rather than learning a therapeutic technique, 'shared concern' in dialogical practices emphasised a collaborative approach to manage ubiquitous uncertainty and a political commitment to addressing inequities in service delivery. This variance from usual reasons to undertake training has implications for course design and delivery that have yet to be considered. Practitioner points The theme 'shared concern' was generated from across the focus groups, which was well aligned with the doxa of Open Dialogue Trainees emphasised their experience of Open Dialogue as a moral counterapproach to traditional healthcare with less emphasis on the actual psychotherapeutic practices	[Buus, Niels] Relationships Australia NSW, Sekisui House,Level 1,68 Waterloo Rd, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2113, Australia; [Buus, Niels] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Reg Hlth Res, Odense, Denmark; [Buus, Niels; Einboden, Rochelle; McCloughen, Andrea] Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Susan Wakil Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Camperdown, NSW, Australia; [Leer, Mie] Municipal Aarhus, Ctr Facilitated Housing, Aarhus N, Denmark; [Mikes-Liu, Kristof] Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Nepean Clin Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Mikes-Liu, Kristof] Nepean Hosp, Mental Hlth Serv, Nepean Blue Mt Local Hlth Dist, Kingswood, NSW, Australia; [Dawson, Lisa] Sydney Childrens Hosp Network, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Pedersen, Merete Folkmann] House Psychiat, Aarhus C, Denmark	University of Southern Denmark; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; Nepean Hospital; NSW Health; Sydney Childrens Hospitals Network	Buus, N (corresponding author), Relationships Australia NSW, Sekisui House,Level 1,68 Waterloo Rd, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2113, Australia.	niels.buus@sydney.edu.au	Einboden, Rochelle/AAH-5023-2019; McCloughen, Andrea/AFO-0635-2022; Buus, Niels/M-7116-2013	Einboden, Rochelle/0000-0002-9541-899X; McCloughen, Andrea/0000-0002-5045-0558; Mikes-Liu, Kristof/0000-0003-2413-9050; Dawson, Lisa/0000-0003-0994-7025; Buus, Niels/0000-0003-4980-4096	Grant Family Charitable Trust; Michael Crouch Foundation	Grant Family Charitable Trust; Michael Crouch Foundation	The Centre for Family-Based Mental Health Care is generously supported by the Grant Family Charitable Trust and the Michael Crouch Foundation.		28	5	5	2	4	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0163-4445	1467-6427		J FAM THER	J.

Vegetables are available in great variety, ranging in their processing level, availability, cost, and arguably, nutritional value. A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted in Quebec, Canada to explore pathways of socioeconomic inequity in vegetable expenditure. Data was obtained for consumers who participated in a grocery loyalty program from 2015 to 2017 and linked to the 2016 Canadian census. Vegetable expenditure share (%) was examined as a fraction of the overall food basket and segmented by processing level. Panel random effects and tobit models were used overall and to estimate the stratified analysis by median income split. Consumers allocated 8.35% of their total food expenditure to vegetables, which was mostly allocated to non-processed fresh (6.88%). Vegetable expenditure share was the highest in early winter and lowest in late summer. In the stratified analysis, the low-income group exhibited less seasonal variation, allocated less to fresh vegetables, and spent more on canned and frozen compared to the high-income group. Measures of socioeconomic status were all significant drivers of overall vegetable consumption. Consumers with high post-secondary education in the low-income group spent 2% more on vegetables than those with low education. The complexity of observed expenditure patterns points to a need for more specific vegetable consumption guidelines that include provisions by processing level. Implications for education, marketing, intersectional policies, and the role of government are discussed. Governments can scale present efforts and catalyze health-promoting investments across local, state, national, and global food systems.

J	Hasenöhrl, S				Hasenoehrl, Syntia			Affective Politics of Care during COVID-19: Feminist Views of Political Discourses and Intersectional Inequalities in Mali	HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG			English	Article						Affect; care; intersectionality; political discourse; Mali; (West) Af-rica; affective politics; COVID-19; power relations; pandemic	NATIONALISM; AFRICA; HEALTH	>> Affektive Politiken der Sorge wahrend COVID-19: Feministische Blickwinkel auf Politische Diskurse und intersektionale Ungleichheiten in Mali'. Contrary to many African states' restrictive COVID-19 measures in the first half of 2020, which had severe socio-economic and political effects, the Malian government appeared more moderate in its fight against the pandemic and even introduced social measures to alleviate the effects of COVID-19 (measures). However, increasing anti-government protests still culminated in a military coup in August 2020. In order to shed light on government communication during that time as one factor in this paradox, this article focuses on the politics of care constructed by the Malian political elite between March and August 2020. The article uses an affective-discursive approach to analyse government communications and contrasts them with a feminist view of associations, NGOs, and activists. It shows that postcolonial, capitalist, and gendered path dependencies have decreased opportunities for care from the Malian state and increased the intersectional vulnerabilities of Malians to COVID-19 measures. In addition, the article demonstrates how the affective politics of domestic and international care that were maintained through the presidential discourse used securitisation and solidarity to construct subject positions that, however, incorporate rather than challenge the aforementioned inequalities.

J	Wipfli, H; Withers, M				Wipfli, Heather; Withers, Mellissa			Engaging youth in global health and social justice: a decade of experience teaching a high school summer course	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						Global health; education; social justice; high school	EDUCATION	Background Education and training in global health and social justice is crucial to ensuring the next generation of health professionals are poised to tackle the pressing issues of our time. Objectives To develop and implement an intensive summer course on global health and social justice for high school students at the University of Southern California. Methods This paper reviews the course aims and curriculum, its implementation both onsite and online, and reports on student course evaluations and long-term student outcomes. Results Student satisfaction with the program was extremely high, which endured when the course went virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most popular elements of the course included interactive, game-based activities and guest speakers. Many students reported that the course motivated them to pursue higher education and careers in global health or related fields. Conclusions More universities should consider offering summer programs or other extension programs targeting high school students in order to meet the increasing demand for global health education. Recommendations for implementing global health courses for younger learners include having an interdisciplinary focus with a range of topics and diverse perspectives; provision of scholarships to allow low-income students and students from abroad to participate; prioritizing the integration of active learning and experiential educational opportunities; and incorporating debriefing and reflection as integral parts of learning.

This review brings together international experts to describe both the direct (such as heat waves) and indirect (such as vector-borne disease incidence) health impacts of climate change. These impacts vary depending on vulnerability (i.e., existing diseases) and the international, economic, political, and environmental context. This unique review also expands on these issues to address a third category of potential longer-term impacts on global health: famine, population dislocation, and environmental justice and education. This scholarly resource explores these issues fully, linking them to global health in urban and rural settings in developed and developing countries. The review finishes with a practical discussion of action that health professionals around the world in our field can yet take.

J	King, B; Rishworth, A				King, Brian; Rishworth, Andrea			HIV responsibilisation: Stigma, disclosure, and care in the age of 90-90-90	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						care; HIV; responsibility; South Africa; stigma	SOCIAL CONNECTION; HEALTH-CARE; GEOGRAPHIES; ETHICS; CITIZENSHIP; GOVERNANCE; MEDICINE; JUSTICE; BODIES; SPACES	The announcement that World AIDS Day would mark its 30th anniversary with the theme "know your status" was the result of significant advancements in the global response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In making this declaration, UNAIDS emphasised that knowing one's status is crucial to achieving the 90-90-90 targets, namely that by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV will know their status, receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and have viral suppression. Far removed from an earlier period when access to antiretroviral therapy was limited or unavailable, the "know your status" campaign represents a more hopeful moment. Yet even with its laudatory goal, the campaign reflects a larger trend in global health emphasising that being responsible for one's own health obligates caring for the health of others. The intention of this paper is to engage with geographic scholarship on care to examine how living with HIV involves both personal responsibility and responsibilisation. Drawing from fieldwork in rural South Africa, the paper outlines the challenges for those living with HIV, particularly when stigma and other needs remain stark. We conclude by identifying points of convergence and divergence between theories of responsibility, responsibilisation, and an ethics of care.

The need for medical students to be familiar with the topic is increasing in acceptance. There is, however, a paucity of data on how medical students are exposed to global surgery. This study aims to evaluate exposure of medical students to global surgery, awareness of the key messages of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, global surgery career aspirations and barriers to said aspirations. Methods ISOMERS was a multi-centre, online, cross-sectional survey of final year medical students globally. The questionnaire utilised a combination of Likert-scale, multiple-choice, and free text questions. Results In this study, 1593 final year medical students from 144 medical schools in 20 countries participated. The majority (n = 869/1496, 58.1%) believed global surgery to be relevant, despite 17.7% (n = 271/1535) having any exposure to global surgery. Most participants (n = 1187/1476, 80.4%) wanted additional resources on global surgery. Difficulty in providing appropriate care for patients living abroad (n = 854/1242, 68.8%) was the most common perceived barrier to a career in global surgery. Conclusions Participants believed global surgery was a relevant topic for medical students and wanted additional resources that they could access on global surgery. It is critical for medical students to become aware that global surgery is a field that aims to address inequity in surgical care not just internationally, but nationally and locally as well.

EU health information progress: the harvest of policy supporting projects and networks	ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health information; International comparison; Health policy; Population health monitoring; Health system performance; Networks; Projects; Infrastructure; European Union		Background The European Commission supports the initiation of health information related projects and networks serving comparative population health monitoring and health system performance assessment. Many of these projects and networks have produced relevant data, standards, methods, indicators and knowledge that may be lost as these networks become inactive. The aim of this project retrieval and review was to identify health information projects and networks and their produced output; and subsequently facilitate systematic access to this information for policy makers, researchers and interested others via a web-based repository. Methods The scope of this article covers 1. population health oriented topics and 2. health system/health services oriented topics. Out of scope are specific infectious diseases; individual rare diseases; and the occurrence and effects of specific medical treatments, interventions and diagnostics; cohort studies; or studies focusing on research methods. We searched bibliographic databases and EU project databases for policy supporting projects and networks and selected those fulfilling our inclusion criteria after more in-depth inspection. We searched for their outputs. In addition, we reviewed country participation in these projects and networks. Results We identified 36 projects and networks, 16 of which are population health oriented, 6 are health systems and services oriented and 14 cover both. Their total volume of output is not easily retrievable, as many project websites have been discontinued. Some networks and/or their outputs have found continuance within European agencies and/or national institutions. Others are struggling or have gone lost, despite their policy relevance. Participation in the projects was not evenly distributed across Europe. Project information was made available through the Health Information Portal. Conclusions EU funded projects and networks have contributed greatly to the evidence-base for policy by providing comparative health information. However, more action is needed to evaluate and conserve their outputs and facilitate continued contribution to the field after project funding stops. The realization of a sustainable infrastructure for these projects and networks is urgent. The Health Information Portal can play an important role in conserving and reusing health information. Information inequalities may exist across Europe but need further investigating.

However, COVID-19 is causing serious impacts on tax revenue and many countries are facing constraints to new investment in health. To advance UHC progress, countries can also focus on improving health system technical efficiency to maximize the service outputs given the current health financing levels. Methods This study assesses Cambodia's public health services technical efficiency, unit costs, and utilization rates to quantify the extent to which current health financing can accommodate the expansion of social health protection coverage. This study employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), truncated regression, and pioneers the application of DEA Aumann-Shapley applied cost allocation to the health sector, enabling unit cost estimation for the major social health insurance payment categories. Results Overall, for the public health system to be fully efficient output would need to increase by 34 and 73% for hospitals and health centers, respectively. We find public sector service quality, private sector providers, and non-discretionary financing to be statistically significant factors affecting technical efficiency. We estimate there is potential supply-side 'service space' to expand population coverage to an additional 4.69 million social health insurance beneficiaries with existing financing if the public health system were fully efficient. Conclusions Public health service efficiency in Cambodia can be improved by increasing utilization of cost-effective services. This can be achieved by enrolling more beneficiaries into the social health insurance schemes with current supply-side financing levels. Other factors that can lead to increased efficiency are improving health service quality, regulating private sector providers, focusing on discretionary health financing, and incentivizing a referral system.

With a wide range of cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity, as well as immigration experiences and inequality, South Asians have experienced racialized violence and discrimination since first arriving in the USA in the 1700s. Following September 11, 2001, South Asians and other groups racialized as "Brown," including Muslim, Sikh, Middle Eastern, and Arab Americans, have experienced a marked increase in state violence, including racist laws, policies, and immigration enforcement. Despite abundant evidence of the adverse effects of violence on mental and physical health, there is limited research examining the impact of this racialized state violence on the health of South Asians in the USA. We summarize and synthesize existing peer-reviewed and gray literature on the prevalence and types of violence experienced by South Asians in the USA and enumerate their potential detrimental health impacts. We highlight the paucity of public health data and propose a conceptual framework describing how racialized violence and hate have significant implications for health among South Asians in the USA. Ultimately, these findings illuminate the need for change at the highest levels of governance to mitigate and resist hate violence, including through political participation and inclusion and equitable allocation of social and economic resources, to improve the health of South Asians in the USA.

J	Waldron, R				Waldron, Richard			Experiencing housing precarity in the private rental sector during the covid-19 pandemic: the case of Ireland	HOUSING STUDIES			English	Article						Private rental sector; housing precarity; housing inequalities; Ireland	GENERATION RENT; INSECURITY	The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated the fundamental importance of secure, affordable and quality housing. However, it has also revealed the precariousness of housing for many and how pre-existing inequalities have been amplified by a global health emergency. The private rental sector has long been considered a precarious tenure, owing to weaker regulation, the temporary leases and a power imbalance between the rights of tenants and the interests of landlords. This article mobilises the concept of precarity to explore the lived experiences of tenants navigating Ireland's rental sector, the challenges they face regarding housing affordability, security, quality and accessibility, and the ways the pandemic has intensified their experience of housing precarity. The research is operationalised through 28 interviews with renters from Dublin's inner-city, suburbs and commuter belt. The concept of precarity captures the economic importance of housing for financial well-being and security, as well as the non-economic functions of home as an emotional conduit for belonging, ontological security and mental health.

Rather, the world has been divided into two groups regarding access to medicine and vaccines as haves and have-nots. The rich countries had pre-ordered the vaccines of COVID-19 along with the holding of the same. The pandemic situation was further worsened, given the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in practice and restrictions on sharing technology of vaccines, medicines, and life-saving equipment. In this context, India and South Africa have proposed the joint proposal and garnered support for waiving off TRIPS to ensure equity, accessibility, and affordability of vaccines and the same as public goods. In this review, we emphasize that global justice is one of the important elements of normative international theories, which focus on all the moral obligations from the world's rich to the world's poor. The paper also questions and argues that if the rich countries fail to go by the principles of global justice, can the Indian and South African (SA) patent diplomacy play a catalyst role in global justice? The review concludes with an emphasis on global solidarity, and the acceptance of joint India-South Africa's "patent diplomacy" for TRIPS waiver would result in mass production and fair distribution, making the COVID-19 medicines and technologies available to everyone regardless of their poor-rich status.

A Troubled Body of Knowledge: The Durability of Racial Science in Human Anatomy Research in South Africa	COMPARATIVE EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article							ETHNIC-DIFFERENCES; CAPE COLONY; EDUCATION; RACE; HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA; MANAGEMENT; POLITICS; DISEASE; WHITE	This article examines the durability of racial science in the field of anatomy at one of South Africa's oldest universities and its resonance with race essentialist research in other national and transnational contexts. We present a critical assessment of more than 70 published and unpublished papers in anatomy through the lens of the politics of knowledge; in this perspective, scientific knowledge is viewed as socially constructed, value-laden, and acting in the service of power. The study finds that racial science thinking in medical science research persists after apartheid, that "race" is a poor proxy for explaining complex patterns of disease, and that bymedicalizing health maladies scientists fail to account for their links to racialized inequalities in the broader society. Research on the workings of racial science in the health sciences suggests promising new lines of inquiry into the study of "racial projects" in comparative and international education.

J	Schut, RA				Schut, Rebecca Anna			Disaggregating inequalities in the career outcomes of international medical graduates in the United States	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS			English	Article						international medical graduates; medical profession; nativism; physicians; racism; US health care	QUALITY-OF-CARE; PHYSICIANS; SERVICE	Although research finds that international medical graduates (IMGs) fill gaps in US health care left by US medical graduates (USMGs), the extent to which IMGs' career outcomes are stratified along the lines of their country of medical education remains understudied. Using data from the 2019 American Medical Association Physician Masterfile (n = 19,985), I find IMGs from developed countries chart less marginalised paths in their US careers relative to IMGs from developing countries; they are more likely to practise in more competitive and popular medical specialities; to attend prestigious residency programmes; and to practise in less disadvantaged counties that employ more USMGs relative to IMGs. These findings suggest IMGs experience divergent outcomes in the United States based on their place of medical education, with IMGs from developing countries experiencing more constraints in their careers relative to IMGs from developed countries. This understudied axis of stratification in medicine has important implications for our understanding of how nativism and racism may intersect to generate inequalities in the medical profession and in US health care more broadly.

J	de Almeida, SV; Paolucci, G; Seita, A; Ghattas, H				de Almeida, Sara Valente; Paolucci, Gloria; Seita, Akihiro; Ghattas, Hala			Co-payments and equity in care: enhancing hospitalisation policy for Palestine refugees in Lebanon	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Refugees; Co-payments in healthcare; Global health	HEALTH-CARE; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES; DIGNITY	Background This paper measures the impact of introducing a 10% co-payment on secondary care hospitalization costs for Palestine refugees living in Lebanon (PRL) in all UNRWA contracted hospitals, except for the Red Crescent Society. This ex-post analysis provides a detailed insight on the direction and magnitude of the policy impact in terms of demand by hospital type, average length of stay and treatment costs. Methods With a complete population episode level dataset, we use multinomial logit, negative binomial, and linear models to estimate impacts on the different dependent variables, controlling for disease, patient and hospital characteristics. Results After the implementation patients were at least 4 pp (p <0.01) more likely to choose a Red Crescent Society hospital for secondary care, instead of one with co-payment. Average length of stay was not affected in general, despite the increase in control at all UNRWA contracted hospitals. Except for the decrease in UNRWA contribution, did not find a statistically significant impact of the co-payment on costs, nor for the provider or for the patient. Findings suggest that introducing a 10% co-payment for secondary hospital care had an impact on patients' health care budget, leading to demand shifts towards cheaper options - i.e., patients had to chose care based on financial constraints rather than on their treatment preferences. Conclusion Before changing healthcare payment schemes in different types of hospitals, facilities offering free of charge treatment should be assessed and prepared for potential demand shifts to avoid overcapacity and the collapse of health care services for such a fragile population. In addition, exemptions from co-payments should be considered for patients with severe health conditions and financial constraints, who, according to our results, are the most likely to change their pattern of care due to an increase in treatment costs.

Accountability in promoting representation of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations in the eating disorders field: A call to action	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS			English	Article						accountability; call to action; diversity; early career investigators; eating disorders; equity; ethnicity; inclusion; justice; race	HEALTH; SCIENCE; RACE	Promoting representation of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations in the eating disorders (EDs) field among professionals and the populations studied and served has long been discussed, with limited progress. This may be due to a reinforcing feedback loop in which individuals from dominant cultures conduct research and deliver treatment, participate in research, and receive diagnoses and treatment. This insularity maintains underrepresentation: EDs in historically marginalized populations are understudied, undetected, and undertreated. An Early Career Investigators Workshop generated recommendations for change that were not inherently novel but made apparent that accountability is missing. This paper serves as a call to action to spearhead a paradigm shift from equality to equity in the ED field. We provide a theoretical framework, suggest ways to disrupt the feedback loop, and summarize actionable steps to increase accountability in ED leadership and research toward enhancing racial/ethnic justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI). These actionable steps are outlined in the service of challenging our field to reflect the diversity of our global community. We must develop and implement measurable metrics to assess our progress toward increasing diversity of underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and to address JEDI issues in our providers, patients, and research participants.

An international multidisciplinary consortium of 40+ experts in neuromuscular disease, dementia, movement disorders, psychology, cardiology, pulmonology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language pathology, nutrition, genetics, integrative medicine, and endocrinology were convened by the patient advocacy organization, Cure VCP Disease, in December 2020 to develop a standard of care for this heterogeneous and under-diagnosed disease. To achieve this goal, working groups collaborated to generate expert consensus recommendations in 10 key areas: genetic diagnosis, myopathy, FTD, PDB, ALS, Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT), parkinsonism, cardiomyopathy, pulmonology, supportive therapies, nutrition and supplements, and mental health. In April 2021, facilitated discussion of each working group's conclusions with consensus building techniques enabled final agreement on the proposed standard of care for VCP patients. Timely referral to a specialty neuromuscular center is recommended to aid in efficient diagnosis ofVCP MSP via single-gene testing in the case of a known familial VCP variant, or multi-gene panel sequencing in undifferentiated cases. Additionally, regular and ongoing multidisciplinary team follow up is essential for proactive screening and management of secondary complications. The goal of our consortium is to raise awareness of VCP MSP, expedite the time to accurate diagnosis, define gaps and inequities in patient care, initiate appropriate pharmacotherapies and supportive therapies for optimal management, and elevate the recommended best practices guidelines for multidisciplinary care internationally.

J	Haeck, C; Larose, S				Haeck, Catherine; Larose, Simon			What is the effect of school closures on learning in Canada? A hypothesis informed by international data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article						COVID-19; Lockdown; School closures; Learning loss; Academic achievement; Education	INEQUALITY; TRANSITION; STRIKES	Canadian lockdown response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included province-wide school shutdowns and frequent individual school closures to contain outbreaks. A number of scientists and political figures have shared their concerns about the medium- and long-term effects of school closures/shutdowns on student academic achievement, learning loss, and learning gaps. Unfortunately, there are no pan-Canadian studies to date to help define the scope of the problem. In this commentary, we report the results of a number of longitudinal research studies conducted in the Netherlands, Belgium, England, and the United States. Using these studies as a basis for comparison, we extrapolated a "Canadian" hypothesis on the unintended academic consequences of school closures, keeping in mind the unique nature of each province. We continue with recommendations on the types of research required to validate this hypothesis, and conclude with implications on public health and education should learning loss and gaps prove true.

This needs urgent attention. Therefore, the aim of the study was to understand the care experiences of people with learning disabilities, and explore the potential patient safety issues they, their carers and families raised. Methods Two data sources exploring the lived experience of care for people with learning disabilities were synthesised using an integrative approach, and explored using reflexive thematic analysis. This comprised two focus groups with a total of 13 people with learning disabilities and supportive staff, and 377 narratives posted publicly via the feedback platform Care Opinion. Results The qualitative exploration highlighted three key themes. Firstly, health and social care systems operated with varying levels of rigidity. This contributed to an inability to effectively cater to; complex and individualised care needs, written and verbal communication needs and needs for adequate time and space. Secondly, there were various gaps and traps within systems for this population. This highlighted the importance of care continuity, interoperability and attending to the variation in support provision from professionals. Finally, essential 'dependency work' was reliant upon social capital and fulfilled by paid and unpaid caring roles to divergent extents, however, advocacy provided an additional supportive safety net. Conclusions A series of safety inequities have been identified for people with learning disabilities, alongside potential protective buffers. These include; access to social support and advocacy, a malleable system able to accommodate for individualised care and communication needs, adequate staffing levels, sufficient learning disabilities expertise within and between care settings, and the interoperability of safety initiatives. In order to attend to the safety inequities for this population, these factors need to be considered at a policy and organisational level, spanning across health and social care systems. Findings have wide ranging implications for those with learning disabilities, their carers and families and health and social care providers, with the potential for international learning more widely.

Globally, the dermatologic disease contributes the fourth highest burden of nonfatal disability with the most acute impact in the Oceanic region, including the Republic of Palau. Efforts to address the dermatologic health inequality are hindered without the necessary epidemiologic evidence to guide health policy in the resource-poor setting of Palau. Methods We conducted a 4-year cross-sectional study of all Dermatology Service patients in the Belau National Hospital and outreach community health centers from 2015 to 2018. No other specialized dermatology service was available. Skin disease was both classified by diagnosis and Global Burden of Disease criteria and analyzed by age, gender, region, and surrounding Oceanic nations. Results The study enrolled 494 patients comprising 179 males and 315 females between 2015 and 2018. The most prevalent diseases were eczema (48.8%), superficial fungal infection (24.5%), and pruritus (22.7%). The neglected tropical disease of scabies was detected in four patients. Males were significantly more likely to present with cellulitis, keratinocyte carcinoma, stasis dermatitis, wounds, marine-related dermatitis, viral skin disease, tinea faciei, verruca, and xerosis and females with melasma and hyperpigmentation. Conclusion This study presents the first primary epidemiologic data describing the prevalence of dermatologic disease in the Palauan adult population. The significant burden of disease in Palau compared with other Oceanic nations validates ongoing dermatology services and informs public health implications for resource allocation and disease management to achieve health equality in the resource-poor nation.

Guidelines can improve care, but some groups such as people with minority characteristics may be disadvantaged if recommended approaches are the same for everyone. It is not known if dementia guidelines address specific needs related to patient characteristics. The objectives of this review are to identify which countries have national guidelines for dementia and synthesise recommendations relating to protected characteristics, as defined in the UK Equality Act 2010: age, disability, gender identity, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. Methods and findingsWe searched CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Medline databases and the Guideline International Network library from inception to March 4, 2020, for dementia guidelines in any language. We also searched, between April and September 2020, Google and the national health websites of all 196 countries in English and in each country's official languages. To be included, guidelines had to provide recommendations about dementia, which were expected to be followed by healthcare workers and be approved at a national policy level. We rated quality according to the iCAHE guideline quality checklist. We provide a narrative synthesis of recommendations identified for each protected characteristic, prioritising those from higher-quality guidelines. Forty-six guidelines from 44 countries met our criteria, of which 18 were rated as higher quality. Most guidelines (39/46; 85%) made at least one reference to protected characteristics, and we identified recommendations relating to age, disability, race (or culture, ethnicity, or language), religion, sex, and sexual orientation. Age was the most frequently referenced characteristic (31/46; 67%) followed by race (or culture, ethnicity, or language; 25/46; 54%). Recommendations included specialist investigation and support for younger people affected by dementia and consideration of culture when assessing whether someone had dementia and providing person-centred care. Guidelines recommended considering religion when providing person-centred and end-of-life care. For disability, it was recommended that healthcare workers consider intellectual disability and sensory impairment when assessing for dementia. Most recommendations related to sex recommended not using sex hormones to treat cognitive impairment in men and women. One guideline made one recommendation related to sexual orientation. The main limitation of this study is that we only included national guidelines applicable to a whole country meaning guidelines from countries with differing healthcare systems within the country may have been excluded. ConclusionsNational guidelines for dementia vary in their consideration of protected characteristics. We found that around a fifth of the world's countries have guidelines for dementia. We have identified areas of good practice that can be considered for future guidelines and suggest that all guidelines provide specific evidence-based recommendations for minority groups with examples of how to implement them. This will promote equity in the care of people affected by dementia and help to ensure that people with protected characteristics also have high-quality clinical services. Author summary Why was this study done? Clinical practice guidelines can improve the quality of dementia care, but some people with minority characteristics related, for example, to race or gender may be disadvantaged if the same approaches are used for everyone.It is not known whether national guidelines for dementia consider such characteristics in their recommendations. What did the researchers do and find? We did a systematic review searching in English and in the official languages of each country to identify which countries have national guidelines for dementia and assessed the extent to which they consider protected characteristics using the UK Equality Act 2010 to define protected characteristics.We identified 46 guidelines from 44 out of 196 countries in the world, most of which were high-income countries, and 37 of them included at least one recommendation related to protected characteristics including age, disability, race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.Age and race were the most frequently referenced characteristics with recommendations including specialist investigation for younger people; consideration of culture and language when assessing dementia; and consideration of age, culture, and religion when providing person-centred care. What do these findings mean? We identified areas of good practice in higher-quality guidelines and recommend that all guidelines include specific evidence-based recommendations for minority groups, which are in line with the World Health Organisation's human rights-based approach to dementia care.To our knowledge, this was the most comprehensive search for dementia guidelines to date; however, we only included national guidelines applicable to a whole country meaning that guidelines from countries with differing healthcare systems within the country have been excluded.

Microbes co-evolve with humans, and microbial populations in human bodies are determined by environments/exposures including family, food and place, health care, race and gender inequities, and toxic pollution. Microbiomes are transgenerational links, disarrangements between different bodies and the outside world. This article asserts that microbes are kin-kin that are made of and making environments, across generations. Post/nonhuman theories have debated the agency, sociality, and ontologies of microbes and things like microbes, all the while appropriating and eliding Indigenous scholarship that directly address the nonhuman world. Microbial kin evokes Indigenous formulations that necessitate reciprocal, ethical accountability to more-than-human relations. This article uses fieldwork in a transnational microbiome malnutrition project in Bangladesh to explore what develops for both the biological and social sciences if we call human-microbe relations kinships, and call microbes our kin.

Neighborhood-Based Socioeconomic Determinants of Cognitive Impairment in Zambian Children With HIV: A Quantitative Geographic Information Systems Approach	JOURNAL OF THE PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY			English	Article						child health; global health; HIV; infectious diseases; Zambia	IN-UTERO EXPOSURE; IMPACT; DDT; PERFORMANCE; PREVALENCE; FAMILY; HOME	Background. Place-based inequalities, such as exposure to violence and access to nutritious food and clean water, may contribute to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cognitive impairment. In this study, we investigated neighborhood effects on cognition in children and adolescents with HIV in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 208 children with perinatally acquired HIV (ages 8-17) and 208 HIVexposed uninfected controls. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing and interviews assessing socioeconomic status. Geographic regions with clusters of participants with HIV and cognitive impairment were identified using quantitative geographic information systems (QGIS) and SaTScan. Associations between location of residence and cognitive function were evaluated in bivariable and multivariable regression models. Mediation analysis was performed to assess direct and indirect effects of location of the residence on cognitive impairment. Results. Residence in Chawama, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Lusaka, was significantly associated with cognitive impairment in participants with HIV (odds ratio 2.9; P = .005) and remained significant in a multivariable regression model controlling for potential confounders. Mediation analysis found that 46% of the cognitive effects of residence in Chawama were explained by higher rates of malnutrition, lower school attendance, and poorer self-reported health. Conclusions. Place-based socioeconomic inequality contributes to cognitive impairment in Zambian children and adolescents with HIV. Neighborhood effects may be mediated by concentrated poverty, malnutrition, limited access to education and health care, and other yet unknown environmental factors that may be potentially modifiable.

References to the international literature and literature from Malmo from the mid-1980s and onwards will be used. Results: The development of research on psychosocial factors and social capital has followed international progress, with a complementary focus on social capital from the late 1990s onwards. Social participation, entailing a number of social activities, seems to be both the common connection between psychosocial stress theory and social capital and the common denominator between cohesion and structural/network approaches to social capital and health. Conclusions: The impact of this research area has been considerable in Sweden. Both psychosocial factors and social capital have been acknowledged as health determinants in national Swedish health policy, although a setback may be discerned in recent years.

The invisibility of gendered energy needs impedes addressing energy insecurity concerns to promote the adoption of energy innovations, especially in the Global South. Energy insecurity is significantly rampant in informal urban settlements inhabited by about 50% of SSA. Women and girls are not only the most vulnerable but also disproportionately affected by this phenomenon. There is a need to understand the gender-energy nexus in informal urban settlements to mainstream gender in the energy innovation process. It is evident that the existing gender analysis frameworks fail to address gendered energy needs, and none are specific to the context of informal urban settlements. The similarity in the formation of informal settlements across the continent informs the scope of this paper. Through an integrative literature review, a critical content analysis addresses two objectives; understanding the gender dimensions within energy innovation processes and conceptualising appropriate gender analysis tools for energy innovation processes in informal urban settlements. Some emergent gender inequality dimensions unique to informal settlements include limited exposure to energy innovations; poor health outcomes and higher mortality rates in women and children; limited financial capacity, poor skills training, low participation and lack of gender-sensitive energy policies. These factors are subsequently reconciled in developing a context-specific gender analysis framework to embed gender in energy innovation processes. The newly devised gender analysis framework could inform energy policy and enhance the adoption of energy innovations in Informal urban settlements in Africa.

Racial/ethnic minorities and lower-income groups in the USA are at a higher risk of death from exposure to PM2.5 than are other population/income groups(2-5). Moreover, disparities in exposure to air pollution among population and income groups are known to exist(6-17). Here we develop a data platform that links demographic data (from the US Census Bureau and American Community Survey) and PM2.5 data(18) across the USA. We analyse the data at the tabulation area level of US zip codes (N is approximately 32,000) between 2000 and 2016. We show that areas with higher-than-average white and Native American populations have been consistently exposed to average PM2.5 levels that are lower than areas with higher-than-average Black, Asian and Hispanic or Latino populations. Moreover, areas with low-income populations have been consistently exposed to higher average PM2.5 levels than areas with high-income groups for the years 2004-2016. Furthermore, disparities in exposure relative to safety standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency(19) and the World Health Organization(20) have been increasing over time. Our findings suggest that more-targeted PM2.5 reductions are necessary to provide all people with a similar degree of protection from environmental hazards. Our study is observational and cannot provide insight into the drivers of the identified disparities.

Catalyzing momentum in male contraceptive development	BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION			English	Article						Contraception; reproductive biology; grants; fellowships; research support; male contraception; spermatogenesis; sperm motility; sperm function		Globally, nearly half of all pregnancies are unplanned. Male contraceptives offer the potential to decrease unintended pregnancy and introduce contraceptive equity, but decades of research have yet to bring a novel product to market. New funding avenues from the philanthropic sector seek to stimulate research in male contraceptives through investments, grants, and support for trainees alongside other programs that encourage product development and ultimately commercialization. This Forum outlines the purpose of and funding opportunities provided by Male Contraceptive Initiative, a funding agency and non-profit focused on the advancement of non-hormonal, reversible contraceptive technologies for those who produce sperm. Summary sentence Male contraception offers unrealized potential for improving global health and well-being, and increased research support is available to the reproductive biology community that facilitates further study in this important realm.

Empowering Dutch and Surinamese children to prevent viral infections: implications from an international education module	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						global health; empowerment; health education; viruses; prevention	HEALTH-PROMOTION; INEQUALITIES; PEDAGOGY; ISSUES; FREIRE; FOCUS	Viral infections have a large share in human morbidity and mortality. Next to vaccinations and hygiene measures, health education plays a role in preventing infections. Social scientists argue that empowerment should be included in health education, as increasing knowledge is insufficient to achieve sustainable behaviour change. Within the international education module 'Viruskenner', primary school students learn how to prevent virus infections by identifying health risks and developing interventions. This qualitative formative study explored to what extent Viruskenner creates conditions in which empowerment processes can arise and take place in the Netherlands and Suriname. Indicators of empowerment, as defined in the literature and placed in the attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy model, were assessed during semi-structured interviews (n=24) with students, parents, teachers and facilitators. We conclude that Viruskenner is successful in creating conditions for empowerment processes to arise and take place, specifically in attitude and self-efficacy. According to interviewees, the module raised students' motivation, skills and confidence to take action to improve health behaviour. Educators played a stimulating role in the participatory setting in both countries, while content relevance and community involvement differed between the Netherlands and Suriname. These outcomes could improve this module and possibly other health education programmes.

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated gender inequalities women face and introduced new challenges that are unprecedented to society at large. Adverse effects of COVID-19, compounded by unintended consequences caused by public health policies such as lockdowns (e.g., delayed or canceled health services), have forced women to face issues ranging from COVID-19 infections and deaths, prolonged unemployment, to unparalleled scale and severity of domestic violence. However, though women face a canopy of debilitating challenges, there is a shortage of research that examines health solutions that can mitigate, if not offset, challenges women experience amid COVID-19. In this paper, we aim to shed light on why timely solutions are needed to mitigate gender inequalities and health disparities women face amid COVID-19 promptly. Furthermore, we underscore the imperative for cost-effective interventions that could shed light on the current health crisis and future pandemics.

At the same time, there are concerns that if care is not taken, the genomics revolution may widen global inequities in science and health. In Africa, these concerns are primarily linked to the underrepresentation of African populations in genomics research, limited genomics research capacity in Africa and associated macro-level justice issues such as benefit sharing, inequitable international research collaborations, and the contribution of genomics to the health and research priorities of Africa. Addressing these concerns requires an in-depth reflection on how the ideals of global justice and equity may be advanced in genomics research. To contribute to the limited but growing scholarship on global genomics equity, especially in the African context, we performed a conceptual analysis of three accounts of justice and governance namely, Ubuntu, shared health governance and global governance of health, with the aim of identifying principles that could inform genomics governance in Africa. We used a convergence approach in the conceptual analysis, resulting in the identification of nine principles namely: solidarity, furthering the ideals of health justice, reciprocity, shared decision-making, shared resources, shared responsibility, mutual trust, transparency, and mutual collective accountability. Examples of how the principles may be applied are provided. We recommend that these principles should form the foundation of any mechanism that seeks to systematically advance justice, fairness and equity in genomics research in Africa and more broadly, global health and science equity.

J	Krishnasastry, ST; Mackenzie, CD; Sadanandan, R				Krishnasastry, Suma T.; Mackenzie, Charles D.; Sadanandan, Rajeev			Scaling-up filariasis lymphoedema management into the primary health care system in Kerala State, Southern India: a case study in healthcare equity	INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY			English	Article						Lymphatic filariasis; Health equity; India; Lymphoedema; Global program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis	ADENOLYMPHANGITIS; EFFICACY	Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) remains one of the world's most debilitating parasitic infections and is a major contributor to poor health in many endemic countries. The provision of continuing care for all those affected by LF and its consequences is an important component of the United Nations'Sustainable Development Goals. The aim of this study is to integrate lymphedema care into the primary health care system of the State by developing lymphedema clinics at each district, through training of health personnel to fulfill WHO recommendation for morbidity management and disability prevention. Methods: Selected health care providers from all the districts in Kerala State of India participated in intensive training sessions endorsed by the State's health administration. The six training sessions (from 5 June 2017 to 25 May 2018) included appropriate self-care information and development of individual plans for each participating institution to provide instruction and care for their lymphoedema patients. The learning achieved by attendees was assessed by pre- and post-training tests. The number of lymphoedema patients receiving care and instruction from the post-training activities of each participating institution was assessed from local records, 6 months after the conclusion of the training sessions. Results: One hundred and eighty-four medical personnel (91 doctors and 93 nurses) from 82 medical institutions were trained which quickly led to the establishment of active lymphoedema clinics providing the essential package of care (EPC) for lymphoedema patients at all the participating institutions. Six months after the training sessions the number of previously unidentified lymphoedema patients registered and receiving care at these clinics ranged from 296 to almost 400 per clinic, with a total of 3,477 new patients receiving training in EPC. Conclusions: Generalist health personnel, when appropriately trained, can provide quality lymphoedema care in public health settings and patients when provided services close to their home, are willing to access them. This is a feasible strategy for integrating long term care for LF patients into the national health system, and is a clear example of moving towards equity in health care for the medically underserved, and thus successfully addresses a major goal of the global program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.

A nationwide cross-sectional survey	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						preventive medicine; social medicine; public health	PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION; HEALTH CONSEQUENCES; MENTAL-HEALTH; GAY; INTERSECTIONALITY; RACISM; BIRTH	Objectives The global public health community has been slow to acknowledge the important role of discrimination in health inequality. Existing evidence on discrimination is largely based on studies of specific subpopulations and specific forms of discrimination, with limited evidence from general population samples. We assessed the individual and combined effects of ethnicity, sexuality, disability and obesity on the likelihood of discrimination among a general population sample of Australian males. Design and setting We used data from The Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health (n=15 988, with response rate of 35%) to estimate the prevalence of self-perceived discrimination within the preceding 2 years and we used binary logistic regression models to assess the individual and combined effects of ethnicity, sexuality, disability and obesity on discrimination. Participants 13 763 adult males were included in this analysis. Results One in five (19.7%) males reported experiencing discrimination in the preceding 2 years. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander males were nearly three times (OR=2.97, p<0.001) more likely to experience discrimination. Those born in Southern/Eastern Europe, Asia or Africa were at least twice more likely to report discrimination. Homosexual or bisexual males (35.2%; OR=2.23, p=<0.001), men with morbid obesity (29.2%; OR=1.91, p<0.001) and men with a disability (33.8%; OR=2.07, p<0.001) also had higher odds of experiencing discrimination. Those belonging to one (30.4%; OR=2.60, p<0.001) or two or more (38.2%; OR=3.50, p<0.001) risk groups were increasingly more likely to experience discrimination. Conclusions Discrimination was correlated with ethnicity, sexuality, obesity and disability. Belonging to two or more of the risk groups was associated with substantial increases in the likelihood of experiencing discrimination. Approaches to preventing discrimination need to acknowledge and address the impact of this intersectionality.

Following the training programme 10-year strategic review, this qualitative study aimed to deepen understanding of facilitators and barriers for those progressing through NIHR-supported research careers. Design Semistructured qualitative study. Data collection and analysis Telephone interviews conducted between May and August 2017 were digitally recorded, transcribed and analysed using Framework Approach. Setting UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, university medical schools, District General Hospitals, Integrated Academic Training Programme centres and Research Design Services across the North East, North West, South East and South West of England, London and the Midlands. Participants Fourteen women and eight men, of whom, 14 were previous or current NIHR personal awardees (seven doctors and seven allied health professionals (AHPs) or nurses) and eight were managers (staff within clinical or university training-related roles). Results (1) NIHR awards were viewed as transformative for research careers; (2) however, there were perceptions of a biased 'playing field'. (3) Inequalities were perceived for AHPs and nurses, those outside of established research institutes and those in 'unfashionable' specialisms. (4) While support for NIHR awards contributed to a healthy research culture, (5) short-term awards were perceived as a barrier to continuing an independent research career. Conclusions Participants perceived many strengths of the NIHR training programmes in terms of developing individual careers and research capacity. Areas in which improvement could enhance the ability to attract, develop and retain researcher were identified. Our findings are of relevance to schemes in other countries, where healthcare researchers experience similar challenges. Further work is needed to overcome barriers and ensure equity of access to, and success within, clinical research training schemes to sustain the research workforce needed to address future global health challenges.

Social inequalities and nutritional disparities: the link between obesity and COVID-19	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Inequalities; COVID-19; Obesity; Communicable diseases; Chronic degenerative non-communicable diseases; Nutrition	RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS; ECONOMIC COSTS; GLOBAL BURDEN; HEALTH-CARE; DISEASE; PREVALENCE; OVERWEIGHT; INDUCTION; CYTOKINES; DIETARY	OBJECTIVE: Cohort studies, clinical audits of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and routine primary care records provided evidence-based insights on the relationship between excess weigh, obesity and COVID-19. The purpose of this umbrella review is to highlight the relationship between nutritional quality and social inequalities related to CDNCD, obesity and SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Only articles published from 2008 to the present were included in the search to show an updated picture of the topic. The search for published studies was conducted in February 2021 in the scientific databases PubMed (MEDLINE). The terms used for the search were "COVID-19", "Obesity", "Disparities", "Nutritional inequalities", "Chronic degenerative non-communicable diseases" and "review" OR "systematic review" OR "meta-analysis" separated by the Boolean operator AND. RESULTS: 1874 reviews were found, but only 99 met the objective. Obese or dysmetabolic patients are those who had a worse course of disease following COVID-19. This data was observed not only for Chinese and Caucasians, but also and above all among Africans, African Americans, Latinos and indigenous people. Plausible mechanisms to explain the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcomes, included the role of excess adipose tissue on respiratory function, metabolic dysfunction, the cardiovascular system, enhanced inflammatory response and impaired response to infection. CONCLUSIONS: Today, chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases (CDNCDs) are responsible for 70% of public health expenditure, affecting 30% of the population (one or more chronic diseases). Unfortunately, given the health emergency due to SARS-CoV-2, infectious diseases are currently more at the center of attention. However, the spread of infectious communicable diseases and CDNCDs is facilitated in situations of social disparity. In fact, in the poorest countries there are the highest rates of malnutrition and there is a greater risk of contracting viral infections, as well as, paradoxically, a risk of comorbidity, due to access to cheaper food and qualitatively poor, with high caloric density.

Development and evaluation of an interprofessional community health course in Zambia	JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE			English	Article						Interprofessional education; global health education	CULTURAL HUMILITY; EDUCATION; STUDENTS	Persistent global health inequities and workforce shortage require innovative strategies to prepare professionals for teamwork in a global context. Over two years, students (n = 33) from education, nursing, occupational therapy, public health, and physical therapy participated in a course in Zambia that emphasized interprofessional collaborative practice (IPP), cultural fluency, and understanding ecological approaches to health. Faculty measured the learning outcomes of the course using the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) Competency Self-Assessment Tool (pre and posttest), and a focus group to gain a deeper understanding of the student experience and course effectiveness. The Beliefs, Events and Values Inventory (BEVI) was used post trip to determine feasibility of distribution and response of the tool via e-mail. These preliminary results suggested that students developed skills and knowledge related to IPP, cultural fluency, and ecological approaches to health. Specifically, students acknowledged growth in their ability to communicate more effectively with other health professions, and ability to evaluate personal assumptions and biases toward health, healthcare, and cultural practices. The method of developing this course could be a model for other institutions wanting to grow IPP experiences for their students.

J	Tan, MKI				Tan, Mark K., I			COVID-19 in an inequitable world: the last, the lost and the least	INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article							HEALTH; REFUGEE	As the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, knowledge of existing inequities is more evident than before. This editorial approaches the topic from a global to national perspective by exploring the current and potential socioeconomic and health effects the pandemic has on three population groups, as labelled in the article title and selected based on their historical inequities. 'The last' focuses on the juxtaposition between low-andmiddleincome countries (LMICs) and high-income countries and how the inequitable landscapes of LMICs are fuelling their health systems' eventual collapse under the pressures of the pandemic. 'The lost' highlights how the inequitable environments, created by international neglect and hostility, have left refugees and displaced migrants in a precarious position, where they are exceptionally vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic. 'The least' is centred on the minority populations who are already bearing the brunt of the pandemic disease burden and are further subjected to a new wave of detrimental socioeconomic impacts as a result of the pandemic exacerbating the cycles of inequities. Under the magnifying light of this pandemic, inequities have never been any clearer and it is only right that effort is taken to resolve them.

Previous studies have described the value offered by these agreements in separate source and destination country perspectives. Objective We sought to identify and summarise existing literature on shared value creation for both source and destination countries. Method We conducted a systematic scoping review of health databases and grey literature. Using Mark Moore and Colin Talbot frameworks, we summarised the public value propositions in migration agreements and how state actors addressed competing priorities. Results Most articles (34/63, 53.9%) reported transnational SHW mobility as the public value proposition for source and destination countries. Fewer articles, 14 (22.2%) and 9 (14.3%) articles, respectively, referred to achieving health workforce sustainability and building capacity for SHW migration governance as shared public values. The most identified competing public value (CPV) was an overriding focus on addressing SHW shortages in destination countries (20/63, 37.7%). Efforts to address this CPV include mitigation of the adverse effects of migration (43/63, 68.3%) and promoting health workforce development in source countries (15, 23.8%). At the same time, state actors retained regulatory discretion for protecting their country's public health interest (34, 54%). Most articles reported the lack of funds (15/63, 23.8%) and implementation mechanisms (19/63, 30.2%) as constraints on the authorising environment and the operational capacity of SHW migration governance systems. Conclusion Regarding SHW migration governance, the literature reports shared public value propositions for source and destination countries. It also shows how the value-creating process in the management of SHW migration favours destination countries. Future studies will need to explore shared value creation models that ensure equity in the governance of SHW migration.

The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of socioeconomic conditions on self-rated health from a generational perspective, its differential effect on gender, and its influence on the gender gap in order to explore health diversity using a multidisciplinary approach and considering policy implications in Eastern European countries. Methods: We used data drawn from the European Health Interview Survey for eight Eastern European countries and EUROSTAT from 2006 through to 2009. We conducted multilevel analyses to understand the individual and national health determinants of self-rated health by gender and to determine whether national differences remain after controlling for micro variables. In order to analyze the role of equity (Gini quartile) in gender differences, Oaxaca analyses were used. Results: The self-rated health gender gap increases with age. Individual characteristics, such as educational level or smoking, influence citizens' perceived health, and have a stronger effect on women than on men. Knowing both the characteristics (endowment effects) and the effects of individual characteristics (coefficient effects) on health is important in order to understand gender gaps among people from the silent generation. Conclusions: Our research indicates that random effects are greater for men than for women. Moreover, random effects might be explained to a certain extent by economic equity (Gini index). The combined effects of gender, cohort, and geographical differences on self-rated health have to be taken into account to develop public health policies.

Mobilizing Established School Partnerships to Reach Underserved Children During a Global Pandemic	PEDIATRICS			English	Article							AMERICAN-INDIAN ADOLESCENTS; PROTECTIVE FACTORS; SUICIDE-PREVENTION; SUBSTANCE USE; SELF-INJURY; ALCOHOL-USE; ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM; BINGE DRINKING	The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to drastic public health measures, including school closures to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Reopening educational settings by using diagnostic testing approaches in schools can help accelerate the safe return of students and staff to on-site learning by quickly and accurately identifying cases, limiting the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and ultimately preventing unnecessary school and work absenteeism. Although the National Institutes of Health has identified community partnerships as the foundation for reducing health disparities, we found limited application of a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach in school engagement. Guided by the CBPR conceptual model, we provide case studies of 2 established and long-standing school-academic partnerships built on CBPR processes and practices that have served as a research infrastructure to reach underserved children and families during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The process described in this article can serve as an initial platform to continue to build capacity toward increasing health equity.

The UK Central and Eastern European Community (UK-CEE) are disproportionately exposed to the social determinants of poor physical and mental health. Their health and healthcare beliefs remain under-researched, particularly regarding primary care. Objective This review explores UK-CEE community members' use and perceptions of UK general practice. Methods A systematic search of nine bibliographic databases identified 2094 publications that fulfilled the search criteria. Grey literature searches identified 16 additional relevant publications. Screening by title and abstract identified 201 publications of relevance, decreasing to 65 after full-text screening. Publications were critically appraised, with data extracted and coded. Thematic analysis using constant comparison allowed generation of higher-order thematic constructs. Results Full UK-CEE national representation was achieved. Comparatively low levels of GP registration were described, with ability, desire and need to engage with GP services shaped by the interconnected nature of individual community members' cultural and sociodemographic factors. Difficulties overcoming access and in-consultation barriers are common, with health expectations frequently unmet. Distrust and dissatisfaction with general practice often persist, promoting alternative health-seeking approaches including transnational healthcare. Marginalized UK-CEE community subgroups including Roma, trafficked and homeless individuals have particularly poor GP engagement and outcomes. Limited data on the impact of Brexit and COVID-19 could be identified. Conclusions Review findings demonstrate the need for codesigned approaches to remove barriers to engagement, culturally adapt and develop trust in GP care for UK-CEE individuals. Community Involvement Community members and stakeholders shaped the conceptualisation of the review question and validation of emergent themes.

While the literature review has covered the international community, with particular attention to what has been produced from the social sciences; the other empirical materials (documents available on institutional virtual sites, NGO, etc., as well as ex novo or archival interviews) have preferably been confined to the Spanish case. The inquiry, aimed at Latin, Afro and Muslim associationism, has been complemented by LGTBI, mental health and disability cases, with attention to the concurrence of discrimination for not only migratory diversity. It is concluded with the existence of discursive confluences between analysts and associations, with potential for antidiscriminatory social policies and sociological research.

This study aimed to investigate the current state of non-contact healthcare in developed countries before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine the potential clinical and political implications applicable to Korea. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, non-contact healthcare was provided to a limited extent. However, given the surge in COVID-19 cases, countries have lifted the restrictions on non-contact healthcare by expanding eligibility to patients and providers and the range of services. Countries that were slow to implement non-contact healthcare before the pandemic experienced a paradigm shift. Noncontact healthcare has advantages in maintaining essential health services while protecting patients and providers from viral infections. In Korea, non-contact healthcare was regarded as a business sector, so it has not been formally discussed from a public health standpoint. Given this global urgency, discussions should begin surrounding how to best utilize non-contact healthcare, considering the values, safety, and efficacy from the perspective of continuity of patient care. Non-contact healthcare should shift to utilizing a patient-centered approach. The step-by-step strategic planning of non-contact healthcare is imperative for ensuring value, quality, equity, and safety of services.

We address this issue by highlighting the intrahousehold allocation of education expenditure. We extend the hurdle model into a three-part model to enable decomposition of households' education decisions into enrollment, total education expenditure, and share of the total education expenditure on the core component, or items relating to the quality of education such as private tutoring. We apply this model to four rounds of nationally representative household surveys from Bangladesh, a country that offers a unique setting in South Asia with the Female Stipend Programs (FSPs), a nationwide gender-targeted conditional cash transfer program. We demonstrate a strong profemale bias in the enrollment decision but contrasting promale bias in the other two decisions, conditional on enrollment. We argue that this contradirectional gender gap is unique to Bangladesh and that it can be explained partly by the FSPs. Both the three-part model and a separate analysis of double-difference model show that the FSPs promoted girls' secondary school enrollment. However, the FSPs did not narrow the gender gap in the intrahousehold allocation of educational resources. Consistently, we find a gender gap in on time completion of secondary school. Our findings collectively highlight the complex interplay of intrahousehold decisions and underscore the importance of minding the gender gap in the quality of education and implementing complementary policies to address it in developing countries.

However, research on the relationship between children's blood lead levels (BLLs) and the development of the lead industry is still limited. This study examined whether children's BLLs were associated with the development of lead industry in different regions. Using survey data on the BLLs of children living in 250 prefectures in China with corresponding data on their economic factors and lead industries, we explored the regional variation of children's BLLs using statistical methods. The results show that the level of economic development in leaded areas was associated with inequity in children's BLLs and met the environmental Kuznets hypothesis. In areas without lead industries, there was little correlation between the level of economic development and the BLLs of children and thus the environmental Kuznets hypothesis was not supported. Lead mines, lead smelting and chemical companies are major sources of blood lead in children living in leaded areas. This study demonstrated the success of control policies for lead-acid battery manufacturers in promoting the prevention and control of childhood lead poisoning in China. China should consciously support the improvement of children's BLLs in undeveloped areas with lead industries through national financing and policies to avoid the continuous effects of the regional inequality problem of high children's BLLs.

J	Rached, MA; Hankir, A; Zaman, R				Rached, Melissa Abi; Hankir, Ahmed; Zaman, Rashid			PATRIARCHAL UPBRINGING IN THE 21ST CENTURY: THE IMPACT EMOTIONAL ABUSE RELATED TO PARENTAL STYLES HAS ON THE GENESIS OF GENDER INEQUALITY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNRESOLVED TRAUMA IN CHILDREN	PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA			English	Article						emotional abuse; patriarchal parental style; hostile sexism; benevolent sexism; gender-equality; unresolved trauma	BENEVOLENT SEXISM; DIFFERENTIATING HOSTILE; AMBIVALENT SEXISM; CHILDHOOD; BEHAVIORS; ATTITUDES; VIOLENCE	Background: Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) (physical, sexual, and psychological/emotional) is a type of structural discrimination that violates the basic human rights of females on a global scale. Cultural norms that glorify male dominance, power imbalances, and abuse of authority are the most encountered reasons for VAWG. Emotional abuse, which can start in childhood, is widely recognised as the most prevalent form of VAWG. However, although victims of emotional abuse usually suffer terribly, perpetrators often evade accountability. Emotional abuse is underestimated in part because it is normalized by victims who are mostly women and girls. The normalization of VAWG is contributing to the propagation and perpetuation of biased perceptions of sexism. The intergenerational transmission of parenting styles - which is an important contributory factor for child development often includes gender-stereotyping norms, or patriarchy. Hitherto, limited focus has been directed towards the consequences that emotional abuse related to patriarchal upbringing has on children. Aim - to investigate if emotional abuse related to patriarchal upbringing influences the perception of sexism and gender stereotyping across genders, and the development of unresolved trauma in children. Methods: Participants were recruited via social media platforms to complete online questionnaires assessing parental emotional abuse, control, trauma, misogyny, and perceptions of sexism. Parametric analyses were conducted on the 188 participants (158 women and 30 men) recruited. Trauma and perceptions of sexism were statistically analysed using correlation and multiple linear regression. Results: Our findings show that parental emotional abuse and control in females predicted for unresolved traumatic experiences (16.6%). Misogynistic culture and male gender predicted for hostile sexism (9.9%), whereas emotional abuse predicted for benevolent sexism (40%). Conclusion: Emotional abuse related to patriarchal upbringing contributes to the genesis of gender inequality and unresolved trauma in children. Given that parental styles are transmitted from one generation to the next, to reduce sexism and improve mental health outcomes, the patriarchal parental cycle must be broken.

APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY			English	Article							COST-EFFECTIVENESS THRESHOLDS; HEALTH-CARE; EQUITY WEIGHTS; PRIORITIZATION; INQUIRY	Objectives Cost-effectiveness thresholds (CETs) play a particularly important role in the reimbursement decisions of health technologies in countries with limited healthcare resources. Our goal is to develop a scientifically solid proposal for a revised cost-effectiveness threshold, as part of the planned review of the Hungarian health economic guidance. Methods The Threshold Working Group of the Hungarian Health Economics Association performed a targeted review on CETs in European countries. International trends on CETs served as a basis for our recommendation, which was discussed at the Association's workshop and deliberated at an expert committee meeting with representatives from the national health technology assessment (HTA) and healthcare payer bodies, and academic HTA centres. Results The current Hungarian CET is one of the highest among European countries relative to GDP per capita, and even higher in nominal value than the CET applied by NICE. As opposed to the current, single Hungarian threshold, other European countries apply multiple thresholds. The Working Group recommends that Hungary should also apply multiple CETs in the range of 1.5-3 times GDP per capita with stratification according to the relative quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain of the new technology. In addition, multiple CETs in the range of 3-10 times GDP per capita is recommended for technologies in rare diseases. Conclusions CETs should be aligned with the country's economic performance and should reflect societal preferences. Our recommendation may increase the efficiency of healthcare resource allocation in Hungary by strengthening the role of HTA in the reimbursement decisions and favouring new technologies with higher QALY gain.

Using Telemedicine to Provide Education for the Symptomatic Patient with Chronic Respiratory Disease	LIFE-BASEL			English	Article						technology-enabled patient education; applications education; web-based education; chronic respiratory conditions	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; SELF-MANAGEMENT; REHABILITATION; QUALITY; COPD	Technology-enabled learning, using computers, smartphones, and tablets, to educate patients on their respiratory disease and management has grown over the last decade. This shift has been accelerated by the global COVID-19 pandemic and the need to socially distance for public health. Thirteen recently published papers examined experience, knowledge, skills and attitude acquisition, behaviour change, and impact on health outcomes of patient education using technology (websites and mobile device applications) for people with chronic respiratory disease. Technology-enabled patient education that includes relevant information, with activities that encourage the patient to interact with the digital platform, appears to lead to better patient experience and may increase learning and behaviour change with improved quality of life. Developing online relationships with healthcare providers, lower digital capabilities, and poor access to a computer/smartphone/tablet, appear to be barriers that need to be overcome for equity in access. Maintaining the principles of quality educational design, ensuring interactive experiences for patient involvement in the educational activities, patient co-design, healthcare professionals connecting with experts in the field of technology-enabled learning for development of education models, and ongoing research lead to the best patient outcomes in technology-enabled education for respiratory disease.

Veterinary Practice - The Canadian multinational veterinary workforce	CANADIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL-REVUE VETERINAIRE CANADIENNE			English	Review							INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; HEALTH-PROFESSIONALS; EDUCATION; SHORTAGE; POPULATIONS; SERVICES; WILL	The veterinary profession, from acceptance to veterinary college to retirement, has experienced extensive organizational change in the past 3 decades. This paper is an attempt to understand the context and complexity of national workforce planning in veterinary medicine in Canada. It identifies the obvious practical and ethical considerations, exposing inherent problems in guiding the future of the profession. The discourse concludes there is a structural deficiency in veterinary education program capacity in Canada (practical fact) and Canadian youth may have increasingly difficult access to tertiary education (ethical concern). Adaptation, rather than planning, characterizes current practices in which migration of foreign-trained veterinarians mitigates the structural deficiency in training capacity. Due to the pervasive adoption of neo-liberal marketing principles in tertiary education, a nationally self-sufficient Canadian veterinary college infrastructure is an unlikely future possibility. Our current system, reliant on migration of internationally trained professionals, raises questions of global justice and individual rights. Strategic solutions require reflection on veterinary professional identity, broad discussion, and a commitment to a rigorous concept of professional responsibilities, global citizenship, and the public good.

J	Vinay, R; Baumann, H; Biller-Andorno, N				Vinay, Rasita; Baumann, Holger; Biller-Andorno, Nikola			Ethics of ICU triage during COVID-19	BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN			English	Review						ICU triage; COVID-19; guidelines; ethics; resource allocation	EXCLUSION CRITERIA; CARE; ALLOCATION	Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has placed intensive care units (ICU) triage at the center of bioethical discussions. National and international triage guidelines emerged from professional and governmental bodies and have led to controversial discussions about which criteria-e.g. medical prognosis, age, life-expectancy or quality of life-are ethically acceptable. The paper presents the main points of agreement and disagreement in triage protocols and reviews the ethical debate surrounding them. Sources of data: Published articles, news articles, book chapters, ICU triage guidelines set out by professional societies and health authorities. Areas of agreement: Points of agreement in the guidelines that are widely supported by ethical arguments are (i) to avoid using a first come, first served policy or quality-adjusted life-years and (ii) to rely on medical prognosis, maximizing lives saved, justice as fairness and non-discrimination. Areas of controversy: Points of disagreement in existing guidelines and the ethics literature more broadly regard the use of exclusion criteria, the role of life expectancy, the prioritization of healthcare workers and the reassessment of triage decisions. Growing points: Improve outcome predictions, possibly aided by Artificial intelligence (AI); develop participatory approaches to drafting, assessing and revising triaging protocols; learn from experiences with implementation of guidelines with a view to continuously improve decision-making. Areas timely for developing research: Examine the universality vs. context-dependence of triaging principles and criteria; empirically test the appropriateness of triaging guidelines, including impact on vulnerable groups and risk of discrimination; study the potential and challenges of AI for outcome and preference prediction and decision-support.

The pandemic has exacerbated existing racial inequalities in the United States in terms of public health and economic outcomes, and it is well-established that individuals higher in racial bias are less likely to support social safety net programs such as those meant to improve public health and reduce poverty. This is particularly true among individuals who perceive racial minorities as overbenefitting from safety net programs. Accordingly, the primary focus of the current studies was to examine whether framing the pandemic in terms of its disproportionate impact on minorities would reduce support for pandemic mitigation policies. In addition, we examine whether such effects were mediated through psychological mechanisms of moral outrage and perceptions of realistic and symbolic threat, and moderated by participants' racial bias. Participants' belief in a just world was included as a covariate given its established role in predicting many related social outcomes. Results suggested that racial framing interacts with participants' racial bias to affect policy support indirectly through multiple mechanisms. Broad implications regarding the relationship between racial bias and public support for a strong social safety net are discussed.	[Franks, Andrew; Xiao, Y.

As such, the study of factors affecting life expectancy is a key issue for policymakers. This study aims to investigate the impact of energy consumption, the democratic process, and government service delivery on life expectancy in 100 countries during 2000-2018, using panel quantile regression. The impact of these factors on life expectancy has been estimated in quantiles of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 0.95. Also, the impact of GDP, CO2 emission, and Gini coefficient variables has been explored as controlling variables on life expectancy. The results show that the impact of CO2 emissions and the democratic process on life expectancy is negative in all quantiles, and the impact of GDP is negative in all quantiles except 0.95. Moreover, the relationship between hydroelectricity consumption and life expectancy in the 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, and 0.9 quantiles is negative and significant. Accordingly, based on the results, the impact of petroleum and other liquids consumption, government service delivery, and Gini coefficient on life expectancy in all quantiles is positive and only the impact of the Gini coefficient on life expectancy in all quantiles is significant.

We used a community child health lens to organise our findings and to consider how Australia might best respond to the needs of children (aged 0-12 years) We synthesised the literature on previous pandemics, epidemics and natural disasters, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. We found clear evidence of adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children that either repeated or extended the findings from previous pandemics We identified 11 impact areas, under three broad categories: child-level factors (poorer mental health, poorer child health and development, poorer academic achievement); family-level factors that affect children (poorer parent mental health, reduced family income and job losses, increased household stress, increased abuse and neglect, poorer maternal and newborn health); and service-level factors that affect children (school closures, reduced access to health care, increased use of technology for learning, connection and health care) There is increasing global concern about the likely disproportionate impact of the current pandemic on children experiencing adversity, widening existing disparities in child health and developmental outcomes We suggest five potential strategy areas that could begin to address these inequities: addressing financial instability through parent financial supplements; expanding the role of schools to address learning gaps and wellbeing; rethinking health care delivery to address reduced access; focusing on prevention and early intervention for mental health; and using digital solutions to address inequitable service delivery.

We analysed trends in the prevalence of birth by CS in Ghana from 1998 to 2014. Methods Using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software, data from the 1998-2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (GDHS) were analysed with respect of inequality in birth by CS. First, we disaggregated birth by CS by four equity stratifiers: wealth index, education, residence, and region. Second, we measured inequality through simple unweighted measures (Difference (D) and Ratio (R)) and complex weighted measures (Population Attributable Risk (PAR) and Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)). A 95% confidence interval was constructed for point estimates to measure statistical significance. Results The proportion of women who underwent CS increased significantly between 1998 (4.0%) and 2014 (12.8%). Throughout the 16-year period, the proportion of women who gave birth by CS was positively skewed towards women in the highest wealth quintile (i.e poorest vs richest: 1.5% vs 13.0% in 1998 and 4.0% vs 27.9% in 2014), those with secondary education (no education vs secondary education: 1.8% vs 6.5% in 1998 and 5.7% vs 17.2% in 2014) and women in urban areas (rural vs urban 2.5% vs 8.5% in 1998 and 7.9% vs 18.8% in 2014). These disparities were evident in both complex weighted measures of inequality (PAF, PAR) and simple unweighted measures (D and R), although some uneven trends were observed. There were also regional disparities in birth by CS to the advantage of women in the Greater Accra Region over the years (PAR 7.72; 95% CI 5.86 to 9.58 in 1998 and PAR 10.07; 95% CI 8.87 to 11.27 in 2014). Conclusion Ghana experienced disparities in the prevalence of births by CS, which increased over time between 1998 and 2014. Our findings indicate that more work needs to be done to ensure that all subpopulations that need medically necessary CS are given access to maternity care to reduce maternal and perinatal deaths. Nevertheless, given the potential complications with CS, we advocate that the intervention is only undertaken when medically indicated.

Patient-Identified Markers of Quality Care: Improving HIV Service Delivery for Older African Americans	JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES			English	Article						AIDS; HIV; Older adults; Quality care; Patient voice; African American; Qualitative study; Critical race theory	CONTINUUM; STIGMA; ENGAGEMENT; BARRIERS; PEOPLE; HIV/AIDS; AGE	Background Over 50% of new AIDS/HIV diagnoses are older adults and disproportionately African American people. Longstanding health inequities, driven by the enduring nature of systemic racism, pose challenges to obtaining optimal HIV services. Patient experiences and identities shape the health care experience, yet patient voices are often minimized, including their assessment of quality HIV care. Understanding these markers of care, including facilitators of and barriers to care and engagement, may help enhance the patient voice, potentially improving service delivery and eradicating HIV healthcare disparities. Method Using a convergent mixed method design, our study identifies patient-identified markers of quality care among older African Americans (N = 35). Measurements of global stress, HIV stigma, and engagement in care were collected, and in-depth qualitative interviews explored the symbols of quality care as well as facilitators of and barriers to care. Results We identified widespread participant awareness and recognition of quality care, the detection of facilitators and barriers across individual, clinic, and community levels. Facilitators of care include diet, health, relationships, community support, and compassionate HIV care. Barriers to care include health comorbidities, economic, food, and housing insecurity, lack of transportation, and structural racism. Conclusion Our findings illuminate how the prominence of barriers to care often uproot facilitators of care, creating impediments to HIV service delivery as patients transition through the HIV care continuum. We offer implications for practice and policy, as well as recommendations for reducing structural barriers to care by enhancing the patient voice and for aligning services toward compassionate and inclusive care.

Management of chronic ailments has become challenging because of the strained health-care resources and social distancing measures that prevent on-site clinical visits and treatments. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a debilitating, chronic disease characterized by unpredictable swelling attacks in various parts of the body. Controlling HAE symptoms often requires long-term prophylactic medication use and regular medical care; however, limited scientific information has been published about HAE medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To gather patient and health-care professional (HCP) perspectives on the global impact that COVID-19 has had, and the future impact it will have on HAE medical care and to identify differences in perceptions across economic and geographic boundaries. Methods: We conducted two independent but similar online global surveys to capture patient and HCP perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 has had, and the future impact it will have on HAE medical care. Results: Both patients and HCPs globally reported that the pandemic has limited the availability of HAE medical care, and they expect the restrictions to continue far beyond the pandemic. In addition, the results of our study suggested that telehealth use has increased across the globe but has been more successfully implemented in high-income countries. Conclusion: Patients and HCPs expect that HAE-related care will be negatively impacted by the pandemic for many years. Disparities in medical care and technologic infrastructure may exacerbate these challenges in non-high-income countries. Supportive tools and global infrastructure should be established to provide aid to non-high-income countries throughout the pandemic and several years after.

This represents a missed opportunity for monitoring and identifying gender-responsive, evidence-informed solutions to address a key driver of the pandemic. In this paper we review the availability of national sex-disaggregated surveillance data on COVID-19 and examine trends on the testing-to-outcome pathway. We further analyse the availability of data according to the economic status of the country and investigate the determinants of sex differences, including the national gender inequality status (according to a global index) in each country. Results are drawn from 18 months of global data collection from over 200 countries. We find differences in COVID-19 prevention behaviours and illness outcomes by sex, with lower uptake of vaccination and testing plus an elevated risk of severe disease and death among men. Supporting and maintaining the collection, collation, interpretation and presentation of sex-disaggregated data requires commitment and resources at subnational, national and global levels, but provides an opportunity for identifying and taking gender-responsive action on health inequities. As a first step the global health community should recognise, value and support the importance of sex-disaggregated data for identifying and tackling an inequitable pandemic.

Skilled birth attendance (SBA) is one of the crucial interventions to avert preventable obstetric complications and related maternal deaths. However, within-country inequalities prevent a large proportion of women from receiving skilled birth attendance. Scarcity of evidence related to this exists in Guinea. Hence, this study investigated the magnitude and trends in socioeconomic and geographic-related inequalities in SBA in Guinea from 1999 to 2016 and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) between 1999 and 2012. Methods We derived data from three Guinea Demographic and Health Surveys (1999, 2005 and 2012) and one Guinea Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2016). For analysis, we used the 2019 updated WHO Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT). We analyzed inequalities in SBA and NMR using Population Attributable Risk (PAR), Population Attributable Fraction (PAF), Difference (D) and Ratio (R). These summary measures were computed for four equity stratifiers: wealth, education, place of residence and subnational region. We computed 95% Uncertainty Intervals (UI) for each point estimate to show whether or not observed SBA inequalities and NMR are statistically significant and whether or not disparities changed significantly over time. Results A total of 14,402 for SBA and 39,348 participants for NMR were involved. Profound socioeconomic- and geographic-related inequalities in SBA were found favoring the rich (PAR = 33.27; 95% UI: 29.85-36.68), educated (PAR = 48.38; 95% UI: 46.49-50.28), urban residents (D = 47.03; 95% UI: 42.33-51.72) and regions such as Conakry (R = 3.16; 95% UI: 2.31-4.00). Moreover, wealth-driven (PAF = -21.4; 95% UI: -26.1, -16.7), education-related (PAR = -16.7; 95% UI: -19.2, -14.3), urban-rural (PAF = -11.3; 95% UI: -14.8, -7.9), subnational region (R = 2.0, 95% UI: 1.2, 2.9) and sex-based (D = 12.1, 95% UI; 3.2, 20.9) inequalities in NMR were observed between 1999 and 2012. Though the pattern of inequality in SBA varied based on summary measures, both socioeconomic and geographic-related inequalities decreased over time. Conclusions Disproportionate inequalities in SBA and NMR exist among disadvantaged women such as the poor, uneducated, rural residents, and women from regions like Mamou region. Hence, empowering women through education and economic resources, as well as prioritizing SBA for these disadvantaged groups could be key steps toward ensuring equitable SBA, reduction of NMR and advancing the health equity agenda of "no one left behind."

Methods This study summarized the pandemic prevention and control policies in BRICS countries and evaluated the effectiveness of those policies by extracting COVID-19 related data from official websites. Result As of May 4, 2021, responding to COVID-19. China adopted containment strategies. China's total confirmed cases (102,560) were stable, without a second pandemic peak, and the total deaths per million (3.37) were much lower than others. India and South Africa who adopted intermediate strategies have similar pandemic curves, total confirmed cases in India (20,664,979) surpassed South Africa (1,586,148) as the highest in five countries, but total deaths per million (163.90) lower than South Africa (919.11). Brazil and Russia adopted mitigation strategies. Total confirmed cases in Brazil (14,856,888) and Russia (4,784,497) continued to increase, and Brazil's total deaths per million (1,936.34) is higher than Russia (751.50) and other countries. Conclusion This study shows BRICS countries implemented different epidemic interventions. Containment strategy is more effective than intermediate strategy and mitigation strategy in limiting the spread of COVID-19. Especially when a strict containment strategy is implemented in an early stage, but premature relaxation of restrictions may lead to rebounding. It is a good choice to combat COVID-19 by improving the inclusiveness of intervention policies, deepening BRICS epidemic cooperation, and increasing health equities.

A Rapid Review of Weight-Related Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for COVID-19 Clinical Trials	VACCINES			English	Review						vaccine; vaccination; COVID-19; higher weight; BMI; clinical trial; equity; inequity	ANTIBODY-TITERS; OBESITY; OVERWEIGHT; GUIDANCE; CANCER	Higher weight status, defined as body mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m(2), is frequently described as a risk factor for severity and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (known as COVID-19). Therefore, study groups in COVID-19 vaccine trials should be representative of the weight spectrum across the global population. Appropriate subgroup analysis should be conducted to ensure equitable vaccine outcomes for higher weight people. In this study, inclusion and exclusion criteria of registered clinical trial protocols were reviewed to determine the proportion of trials including higher weight people, and the proportion of trials conducting subgroup analyses of efficacy by BMI. Eligibility criteria of 249 trial protocols (phase I, II, III and IV) were analysed; 51 protocols (20.5%) specified inclusion of BMI > 30, 73 (29.3%) specified exclusion of BMI > 30, and 125 (50.2%) did not specify whether BMI was an inclusion or exclusion criterion, or if BMI was included in any 'health' screenings or physical examinations during recruitment. Of the 58 protocols for trials in phase III and IV, only 2 (3.4%) indicated an intention to report subgroup analysis of vaccine efficacy by weight status. Higher weight people appear to be significantly under-represented in the majority of vaccine trials. This may result in reduced efficacy and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines for higher weight people and exacerbation of health inequities within this population group. Explicit inclusion of higher weight people in COVID-19 vaccine trials is required to reduce health inequities.

Instead, and for myriad reasons, modern correctional policy had emphasized the punitive over the humane. In this way, America is an outlier, distinct from many other Western nations. From this position, however, there are many opportunities to look to global peers for a counterfactual; the Scandinavian nations provide an appealing option. Building upon a comparative, international examination of penal policy, this Article seeks to leverage these differences to explore how transnational exchanges can inform domestic policymaking. We examine the Scandinavian Prison Project, a correctional exchange primarily between Pennsylvania and Norway, to consider the challenges inherent in such endeavors, as well as opportunities for encouraging actionable reform in a prison environment.

The status of AYAs' SRH constitutes leading health indicators across nations and globally, and reveals the well-being of this population. Throughout the article, AYAs' SRH is approached from a health equity perspective, which includes SRH health rights and reproductive justice. Using this health equity lens, salient topics are presented: sexual abuse/assault among AYAs; immigrant and refugee populations; child, early, and forced marriage; human trafficking; and female genital mutilation. The article also discusses access to SRH services and comprehensive education. Practical implications and resources are offered for healthcare providers for their daily encounters with AYAs, as well as for community, institutional level, and advocacy action. Healthcare providers are well positioned to advance AYAs SRH through mitigating inequities and in so doing, they are assuring the health of the population and future generations.

Human rights advocates have invoked the RTH in a collective demand for improved access to essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Similarly, scholars have used the RTH as a framework for analysing health problems. However, its utility for addressing skilled health worker (SHW) shortages in LMICs has been understudied. Realising that SHW shortages occur due to existing push-and-pull factors within and between LMICs and high-income countries (HICs), we sought to answer the question: "how, why, and under what circumstance does the RTH offer utility for addressing SHW shortages in LMICs?" Methods: We conducted a realist synthesis of evidence identified through a systematic search of peer-reviewed articles in Embase, Global Health, Medline (Ovid), ProQuest - Health & Medical databases, Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate), CINAHL (EBSCO), APAIS-Health, Health Systems Evidence and PDQ-EVIDENCE; as well as grey literature from Google Scholar. Results: We found that the RTH offers utility for addressing SHW shortages in LMICs through HIC state actors' concerns for their countries' reputational risk, recognition of their obligation to support health workforce strengthening in LMICs, and concerns for the cost implication. State actors in LMICs will respond to adopt programs inspired by the RTH when they are convinced that it offers tangible national benefits and are not overly burdened with ensuring its success. The socio-economic and institutional factors that constrain state actors' response include financial cost and sustainability of rights'-based options. Conclusion: State and non-state actors can use the RTH as a resource for promoting collective action towards addressing SHW shortages in LMICs. It can also inform negotiations between state actors in LMICs and their HIC counterparts.

Developing indicators of age-friendly neighbourhood environments for urban and rural communities across 20 low-, middle-, and high-income countries	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Green space; Walkability; Transportation access; Community health services; Social participation; Healthy ageing; Methodological study design; International collaboration		Background By 2050, the global population of adults 60 + will reach 2.1 billion, surging fastest in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed indicators of age-friendly urban environments, but these criteria have been challenging to apply in rural areas and LMIC. This study fills this gap by adapting the WHO indicators to such settings and assessing variation in their availability by community-level urbanness and country-level income. Methods We used data from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study's environmental-assessment tools, which integrated systematic social observation and ecometrics to reliably capture community-level environmental features associated with cardiovascular-disease risk factors. The results of a scoping review guided selection of 18 individual indicators across six distinct domains, with data available for 496 communities in 20 countries, including 382 communities (77%) in LMIC. Finally, we used both factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD) and multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) approaches to describe relationships between indicators and domains, as well as detailing the extent to which these relationships held true within groups defined by urbanness and income. Results Together, the results of the FAMD and MTMM approaches indicated substantial variation in the relationship of individual indicators to each other and to broader domains, arguing against the development of an overall score and extending prior evidence demonstrating the need to adapt the WHO framework to the local context. Communities in high-income countries generally ranked higher across the set of indicators, but regular connections to neighbouring towns via bus (95%) and train access (76%) were most common in low-income countries. The greatest amount of variation by urbanness was seen in the number of streetscape-greenery elements (33 such elements in rural areas vs. 55 in urban), presence of traffic lights (18% vs. 67%), and home-internet availability (25% vs. 54%). Conclusions This study indicates the extent to which environmental supports for healthy ageing may be less readily available to older adults residing in rural areas and LMIC and augments calls to tailor WHO's existing indicators to a broader range of communities in order to achieve a critical aspect of distributional equity in an ageing world.

Socioeconomic Disparities in the Utilization of Total Hip Arthroplasty	JOURNAL OF ARTHROPLASTY			English	Article						total hip arthroplasty; health care disparities; health care utilization; socioeconomic factors; disparities in joint arthroplasty	TOTAL JOINT ARTHROPLASTY; ETHNIC-DIFFERENCES; REPLACEMENT; RACE; OSTEOARTHRITIS; PHYSICIANS; VOLUME; KNEE	Background: There is increasing focus on highlighting disparities in both access to and equity of care in orthopedics and understanding the impact disparities have on patient health. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate socioeconomic-related factors affecting whether a patient undergoes total hip arthroplasty (THA) after a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Methods: From 2011 to 2018, patients >40 years of age diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis were identified in the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System, a comprehensive all-payer database collecting preadjudicated claims in New York State. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/Tenth Revision codes were used to identify the initial diagnosis and subsequent THA. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of patient factors on the likelihood of undergoing THA. Results: Of 142,681 hip osteoarthritis diagnoses, 48.6% proceeded to THA. Compared to non-Hispanic white patients, Asian (odds ratio [OR] 0.65, P < .0001), Black (OR 0.51, P < .0001), and "Other" race (OR 0.54, P < .0001) had lower odds of THA. Hispanic patients (OR 0.55, P < .0001) had lower odds of surgery. Compared to commercial insurance, Medicare (OR 0.83, P < .0001), Medicaid (OR 0.49, P < .0001), Self-pay (OR 0.78, P < .0001), and workers' compensation (OR 0.71, P < .0001) had lower odds of THA. Having one or more Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR 0.45, P < .0001) was associated with lower odds of THA, as was increased social deprivation (OR 0.99, P < .0001). Conclusion: THA is associated with disparities among race, gender, primary insurance, and social deprivation. Additional research is necessary to identify the cause of these disparities to improve equity in patient care. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Design A comparative cross-sectional study design was implemented. Hearing loss was defined as >= 35 dB HL at 3.0 kHz, as measured via Hearcheck in the better-hearing ear. Study sample We compared the estimates based on the English census in 2015 to estimates from psychoacoustic hearing data available for 8,263 participants in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) Wave 7 (2014-2015). Results Marked regional variability in hearing loss prevalence was revealed among participants with similar age profiles. The regional differences in hearing outcomes reached up to 13.53% in those belonging to the 71-80 years old group; the prevalence of hearing loss was 49.22% in the North East of England (95%CI 48.0-50.4), versus 35.69% in the South East (95%CI 34.8-36.50). Conclusion A socio-spatial approach in planning sustainable models of hearing care based on the actual populations' needs and not on age demographics might offer a viable opportunity for healthier lives. Regular assessment of the extent and causality of the population's different audiological needs within the country is strongly supported.

Analysis of the Opinions of Poland and Germany	ENERGIES			English	Article						change; citizen; green energy; renewable energy; energy; comparative analysis; Poland; Germany; EU	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RENEWABLE ENERGY; OIL-SPILLS; DISASTER	The EU's energy policy is geared towards introducing changes in order to stop or avoid negative climate change. The determinants of the energy policies of Poland and Germany are presented along with the priorities until 2050. The possibilities of reducing the impact of energy on the environment were interpreted, emphasizing its common goal. Activities supporting the EU and maintaining the level of energy security are indicated. Possible negative effects in the social and health sphere are presented as a response to the failure to implement these demands. The literature was analyzed and proprietary questionnaires were carried out, and the results realized in the EU by the independent FBI Economic Department were implemented. On the basis of earlier pilot studies, variants of a successful transformation were implemented, assuming different roles performed by a citizen (entrepreneur). Opportunities to tackle climate change and global challenges have been identified based on innovation and motivation. The opinion on the way of thinking in Poland and Germany was compared, and a descriptive model was prepared to increase the achievement of the assumed goals, together with a model based on innovation. Citizens should be active in efforts to promote renewable energy. The EU has a strong base to work to avoid climate change. What is needed is innovative thinking and a motivation to introduce changes with the involvement of every citizen through solidarity, efficiency, and justice. The existing foundations of legal solutions create adaptation possibilities and the ability to achieve goals through self-discipline, comparing with the assumption of EU civic awareness, significantly affecting the successful implementation of RES. Analyzing the attitudes of Poland and Germany, it seems that the distant social consequences are not sufficient. It is necessary not only to perform selected management functions (planning, organizing), but also partly to motivate. There is a strong need to increase motivation and implement the control process required under the threat of negative consequences in the current period as a key strategic preventive action. The analysis of the opinions of Poland and Germany against the background of the European Union allowed for no significant differences, subject to Germany's readiness to take greater risk. Most of Poland is less inclined to take risks. The lack of an unambiguous opinion may indicate incomplete awareness of both the negative effects of climate change. Both countries are concerned about the unplanned costs of transformation. Germany, unlike Poland, has dedicated employees to handle the climate, and conducts an energy audit and is of interest to investors, thanks to investment plans.

It represents a real opportunity to remedy global health inequity that has seen limited investment in diseases affecting populations from low- and middle-income countries. Previous research in Africa was limited to so-called parachute research, whereby samples were taken from local populations for use in high-income countries with no local oversight or use of the sample. These exploitative practices must be guarded against, but the current regulation of genomic research in Africa adopts a precautionary approach that at times is restrictive in nature. We argue that the regulation and oversight of genomic biobank research should guard against exploitative research, but in a manner that promotes reciprocal benefit and not restrictive research practices. To achieve this, there must be a rebalancing of the regulatory tilt.

And while vaccines offer the potential to drastically improve global health, low-and-middle-income countries around the world often experience reduced access to vaccines and reduced vaccine efficacy. Addressing these issues will require novel vaccine approaches and platforms, deeper insight how vaccines mediate protection, and innovative trial designs and models. On June 28-30, 2021, experts in vaccine research, development, manufacturing, and deployment met virtually for the Keystone eSymposium "Innovative Vaccine Approaches" to discuss advances in vaccine research and development.

Evidence from the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 global financial crisis	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						COVID-19; Health financing; Resilience; Global financial crisis; Austerity	IMPACT; UK	The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an economic shock just ten years after the shock of the 2008 global financial crisis. Economic shocks are a challenge for health systems because they reduce government rev-enue at the same time as they increase the need for publicly financed health care. This article explores the resilience of health financing policy to economic shocks by reviewing policy responses to the finan-cial crisis and COVID-19 in Europe. It finds that some health systems were weakened by responses to the 2008 crisis. Responses to the pandemic show evidence of lessons learnt from the earlier crisis but also reveal weaknesses in health financing policy that limit national preparedness to face economic shocks, particularly in countries with social health insurance schemes. These weaknesses highlight where perma-nent changes are needed to strengthen resilience in future: countries will have to find ways to reduce cyclicality in coverage policy and revenue-raising; increase the priority given to health in allocating public spending; and ensure that resources are used to meet equity and efficiency goals. Although many health systems are likely to face budgetary pressure in the years ahead, the experience of the 2008 crisis shows that austerity is not an option because it undermines resilience and progress towards universal health coverage.

Forty years into the HIV pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic challenges the achievements made in HIV and may even reverse some of them. Recent findings This article provides an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on people with, and at risk of, HIV infection. It addresses where the global response to HIV was expected to be by 2020, analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on HIV-related outcomes and reviews the impact of HIV on COVID-19 related outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the response to HIV infection through disruption of prevention, testing, and access to antiretroviral treatment, as well as on the management of long-term HIV and mental health. This negative impact has been unequal throughout the world and across populations and deepens inequities in health. HIV does not increase Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility once confounders are taken into account and inconsistencies are reported regarding its direct role on clinical severity. In post-COVID-19 scenarios, new models for HIV testing and care are likely to be consolidated. Monitoring responses needs high-quality epidemiological data and collaborative research.

However, excessive salt intake is associated with high blood pressure. As this effect likely drives cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, excessive salt intake is estimated to cause -5 million deaths per annum worldwide. Animal research has identified various mechanisms by which high salt intake drives disease in the kidney, brain, vasculature and immune system. The potential for therapeutic interventions in many of these pathways has yet to be tested. Salt-reduction interventions lower blood pressure, but for most individuals, 'hidden' salt in processed foods disconnects salt intake from discretionary control. This problem is compounded by growing inequalities in food systems, which form another hurdle to sustaining individual dietary control of salt intake. The most effective salt-reduction interventions have been implemented at the population level and comprise multi-component approaches, involving government, education and the food industry.

Many college-aged students receive their COVID-19-related information through social media and television even though research suggests that social media sources are more likely to be incorrect. Some students report trusting these sources over government sources such as the CDC and WHO. The purpose of this study was to understand Historically Black College and University (HBCU) students' COVID-19 knowledge, sources of information, and planned precautions. There were 21 in-depth interviews conducted with students attending a large southern HBCU during Spring 2020. Themes regarding knowledge included the following: it is a flu-like condition, it has international roots, there is inaccurate and changing information, and it is a pandemic. Themes regarding sources included: the news, US government and related officials, social media, interactions with family, and other social interactions. Themes regarding severity included the following: statistics, a distrust for hospital reporting, a belief that COVID-19 deaths were conflated with baseline health, peer influence, and familial influence. Themes regarding precautions included the following: proper mask use, hand washing/ sanitizing, avoiding large crowds/small crowds only, physical distancing, COVID-19 testing/symptom monitoring, and COVID-19 vaccination.

Design: We applied the Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI), a methodological framework developed by the International Network for Food and Obesity/non-communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) network. Qualitative content analysis of laws, directives and other documents formed the basis of a multistaged, structured consultation process. Setting: Germany. Participants: The expert consultation process included fifty-five experts from academia, public administration and civil society. Results: Germany lags behind international best practices in several key policy areas. For eighteen policy indicators, the degree of implementation compared with international best practices was rated as very low, for twenty-one as low, for eight as intermediate and for none as high. In particular, indicators on food taxation, regulation of food marketing as well as retail and food service sector policies were rated as very low to low. Identified priority actions included the binding implementation of nutrition standards for schools and kindergartens, a reform of the value added tax on foods and beverages, a sugar-sweetened beverage tax and stricter regulation of food marketing directed at children. Conclusions: The results show that Germany makes insufficient use of the potential of evidence-informed health-promoting nutrition policies. Adopting international best practices in key policy areas could help to reduce the burden of nutrition-related chronic disease and related inequalities in nutrition and health in Germany. Implementation of relevant policies requires political leadership, a broad societal dialogue and evidence-informed advocacy by civil society, including the scientific community.

Frailty in older people is becoming of global public health interest as a means of promoting health in old age in LMICs. As yet, little work has been done to establish to what extent the concept of frailty, as conceived according to 'western' biomedicine, has cross-cultural resonance for a low-income rural African setting. This study aimed to investigate the meaning of frailty contextually, using the biomedical concept of the frailty phenotype as a framework. Qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of older adults, their care-givers and community representatives in rural northern Tanzania. Thirty interview transcripts were transcribed, translated from Kiswahili to English and thematically analysed. Results reveal that despite superficial similarities in the understanding of frailty, to a great extent the physical changes highlighted by the frailty phenotype were naturalised, except when these were felt to be due to a scarcity of resources. Frailty was conceptualised as less of a physical problem of the individual, but rather, as a social problem of the community, suggesting that the frailty construct may be usefully applied cross-culturally when taking a social equity focus to the health of older people in LMICs.

J	de Borja, C; Chang, CJ; Watkins, R; Senter, C				de Borja, Celina; Chang, Cindy J.; Watkins, Rhonda; Senter, Carlin			Optimizing Health and Athletic Performance for Women	CURRENT REVIEWS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Female athlete; Team physician; Women in sports medicine	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; POSITION STATEMENT; BREAST SUPPORT; PREGNANCY; GENDER; SPORT; EXERCISE; STRENGTH; COMMUNICATION; BIOMECHANICS	Purpose of Review The exponential growth of women participating in competitive sports throughout the years was made possible through several initiatives by the International Olympic Committee and the passage and implementation of Title IX as a federal law in the United States. However, this positive trend towards gender equity in sports has not transpired for women in medicine, especially in fields that care for elite athletes. This current review will discuss specific areas that can be tailored to help female athletes prevent injuries and optimize their athletic performance. We will also highlight how increased female team physician representation in sports may help optimize care for female athletes. Recent Findings Female athletes are considered high risk for certain conditions such as ACL tears, patellofemoral pain syndrome, bone stress injuries, sport-related concussions, and sexual violence in sport. Addressing factors specific to female athletes has been found to be valuable in preventing injuries. Strength and conditioning can optimize athletic performance but remains underutilized among female athletes. Although diversity in healthcare workforce has been found to be beneficial for multiple reasons, women remain underrepresented in sports medicine. Increasing female team physician representation may positively impact care for female athletes. Team physicians must understand the physiologic, biomechanical, and anatomic factors that are unique to female athletes in order to tailor injury prevention programs and optimize their athletic performance. Advocating for gender equity in sports medicine to advance representation of women in the field will increase workforce diversity and promote excellence in sports medicine care.

J	Singhal, T				Singhal, Tanu			The Emergence of Omicron: Challenging Times Are Here Again!	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS			English	Article						COVID-19; Children; Omicron variant; Variant of concern (VOC); Third wave	COVID-19; IMMUNOGENICITY; VACCINES; HEALTH	COVID-19 has been reported to have caused more than 286 million cases and 5.4 million deaths till date. COVID variants have appeared at regular intervals-alpha, beta, gamma, delta and now omicron. 'Omicron' is driving the current surge of cases in most countries including India and is poised to replace 'delta' the world over. This variant with more than 50 mutations is phylogenetically very different from other variants. The omicron variant spreads rapidly with an average doubling time of two days. The disease so far has been mild as compared with delta. Though previous infection and vaccination offer little or no protection against infection with omicron, they do seem to partially protect against hospitalization and severe disease. Booster vaccinations have not made any notable impact on the spread of omicron and have further worsened global vaccine equity. The indirect consequences of omicron from lockdowns, restrictions, travel bans, economic losses, health care worker infections and overwhelming of health care facilities are likely to be enormous. The direct effects of omicron on children are expected to be mild like with the previous variants. However, the indirect effects on child mental, physical, and social health may be considerable owing to school closures, missed vaccinations, neglect of other diseases, etc. It is, therefore, imperative that governments take rational decisions to navigate the world through this latest crisis.

Understanding equity requires assessing needs for vaccines across countries. Making distinctions is especially challenging when countries perform similarly on traditional epidemiological metrics. This Viewpoint offers a novel conceptual framework (COVID-NEEDS) based on empirical evidence and public health guidance. It encompasses health, social, and economic impacts of COVID-19 and associated non-pharmaceutical interventions. We intend this framework to complement existing needs assessment methods to help identify countries most in need of vaccines. We present factors to consider, but future work will be required to understand how to weight the factors and to determine the practical utility of the framework for supplementing existing COVID-19 vaccine allocation mechanisms.

However, where routine immunisation is weak, an over-reliance on vaccination campaigns may lead to heterogeneous coverage. Here, we assessed the impact of a health system strengthening (HSS) intervention on the relative contribution of routine immunisation and outreach activities to reach immunisation goals in rural Madagascar. Methods We obtained data from health centres in Ifanadiana district on the monthly number of recommended vaccines (BCG, measles, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) and polio) delivered to children, during 2014-2018. We also analysed data from a district-representative cohort carried out every 2 years in over 1500 households in 2014-2018. We compared changes inside and outside the HSS catchment in the delivery of recommended vaccines, population-level vaccination coverage, geographical and economic inequalities in coverage, and timeliness of vaccination. The impact of HSS was quantified via mixed-effects logistic regressions. Results The HSS intervention was associated with a significant increase in immunisation rates (OR between 1.22 for measles and 1.49 for DTP), which diminished over time. Outreach activities were associated with a doubling in immunisation rates, but their effect was smaller in the HSS catchment. Analysis of cohort data revealed that HSS was associated with higher vaccination coverage (OR between 1.18 per year of HSS for measles and 1.43 for BCG), a reduction in economic inequality, and a higher proportion of timely vaccinations. Yet, the lower contribution of outreach activities in the HSS catchment was associated with persistent inequalities in geographical coverage, which prevented achieving international coverage targets. Conclusion Investment in stronger primary care systems can improve vaccination coverage, reduce inequalities and improve the timeliness of vaccination via increases in routine immunisations.

Dental Caries Prevalence and Experience (ICDAS II Criteria) of 5-, 12-and 15-Year-Old Children and Adolescents with an Immigrant Background in Greece, Compared with the Host Population: A Cross-Sectional Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						dental caries; ICDAS-II criteria; immigrants; children; adolescents; comparative study; risk indicators; ethnic background	ASSESSMENT SYSTEM ICDAS; ORAL-HEALTH; TREATMENT NEEDS; INTERNATIONAL CARIES; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; RISK INDICATORS; INEQUALITIES; HYGIENE	Evidence regarding disparities in oral health among native and immigrant child and adolescent populations in Europe is scarce. The present study aimed to determine the caries status of 5-, 12-, and 15-year-olds with an immigrant background in Greece in relation to their sociodemographic characteristics and compare their caries levels with those of their native Greek peers. A sample of 707 immigrants underwent clinical examination for caries (ICDAS II criteria), followed by a calculation of caries prevalence and experience estimates (2013-2014). Multivariable regression models assessed the effect of ethnic background on the caries experience (d(3-6)mfs/D3-6MFS) of the total (707 immigrants and 3702 Greeks) population, and the association between parental education level and the immigrants' d(3-6)mfs/D3-6MFS. Among the 5- and 12-year-olds, those with an immigrant background demonstrated higher caries rates and had unfulfilled treatment needs at higher proportions. Among 15-year-old adolescents, no considerable differences in caries status were observed according to ethnic background (native Greek or immigrant). The strength of the association between immigrant background and caries experience levels attenuated gradually with increasing age (IRR = 1.61, 1.27 and 1.10, and p = 0.001, p = 0.006 and p = 0.331 for 5-, 12- and 15-year-olds, respectively). Among the immigrants, adolescents with less educated mothers exhibited elevated caries levels. Public health strategies should prioritize immigrant children and early adolescents in order to reduce the existing ethnic disparities in oral health.

J	Dayal, R; Gundi, M				Dayal, Radhika; Gundi, Mukta			Assessment of the quality of sexual and reproductive health services delivered to adolescents at Ujala clinics: A qualitative study in Rajasthan, India	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CARE SERVICES	The Adolescent Friendly Health Clinic (AFHCs), a key component of the Government of India's National Adolescent Health Programme a.k.a. Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK), aims to increase the accessibility and utilization of sexual-reproductive health services by adolescents and youth. However, low quality of care provided at AFHCs by counsellors calls for attention. We, thus, explore both the clients' and providers' perspectives using the World Health Organization's (WHO) global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents to assess the quality of the sexual reproductive health service delivery at AFHCs in Rajasthan, India. We conducted a qualitative study, comprising observation of the service delivery using mystery clients (MCs) (n = 12) and in-depth interviews with the counsellors (n = 4) in four AFHCs. Interviews were transcribed in local language and were translated in English. The transcripts were coded thematically. Our study, using five of the eight WHO global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents highlighted several gaps in the quality-of-service delivery at AFHCs. We unearth various intricacies related to the quality of the services provided at the AFHCs by referring to the relevant input, process, and the output criteria of WHO global standards I, III, IV, V and VI. Our study calls for efforts to improve- (i) the counsellors' competencies to increase adolescents' health literacy on sensitive topics, (ii) the facilities at the clinic to ensure privacy, comfort and confidentiality of the adolescents seeking services, (iii) the referrals to improve appropriate package of services, and (iv) an overall environment to ensure an equity and non-discrimination for all the adolescents. Our findings unearth the barriers that both the service providers and the adolescents face at the AFHCs and underscore the need for regular monitoring and evaluation of the AFHCs to strengthen the facility-based intervention of the RKSK programme.

Design: Public health experts rated the extent of implementation of food environment-related Policy and the Infrastructure-support components, compared with international best practices. Subsequently, the experts proposed and prioritised future actions to address implementation gaps in an online workshop. Setting: Japan. Participants: A total of sixty-six experts rated policy implementation by the Japanese Government and twenty-three participated in the workshop on future actions. Results: The implementations of regulations on unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages were rated low in the domains of Food composition, Food labelling and Food promotion, Food prices and Food retail in the Policy component. The implementations of several domains in the Infrastructure-support component were, overall, rated at a higher level, specifically for monitoring and intelligence systems. Based on the rating, reducing health inequalities by supporting people, both economically and physically, was the highest priority for future actions in both components. Conclusions: The current study found that Japan has a robust system for long-term monitoring of population health but lacks regulations on unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages compared with international best practices. The current study confirmed the importance of continuous accumulation of evidence through national monitoring systems. Developing comprehensive regulations to restrict food marketing, sales and accessibility of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages is needed to improve the health of food environments in Japan.

Using data from the 2019 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD 2019), we evaluated national and provincial health trends and progress towards important Sustainable Development Goal targets from 1990 to 2019. Methods We analysed GBD 2019 estimates of mortality, non-fatal health loss, summary health measures and risk factor burden, comparing trends over 1990-2007 and 2007-2019. Additionally, we decomposed changes in life expectancy by cause of death and assessed healthcare system performance. Results Across the nine provinces, inequalities in mortality and life expectancy increased over 1990-2007, largely due to differences in HIV/AIDS, then decreased over 2007-2019. Demographic change and increases in non-communicable diseases nearly doubled the number of years lived with disability between 1990 and 2019. From 1990 to 2019, risk factor burdens generally shifted from communicable and nutritional disease risks to non-communicable disease and injury risks; unsafe sex remained the top risk factor. Despite widespread improvements in healthcare system performance, the greatest gains were generally in economically advantaged provinces. Conclusions Reductions in HIV/AIDS and related conditions have led to improved health since 2007, though most provinces still lag in key areas. To achieve health targets, provincial governments should enhance health investments and exchange of knowledge, resources and best practices alongside populations that have been left behind, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic.

J	Lee, PH				Lee, Po-Han			Struggle for Recognition: Theorising Sexual/Gender Minorities as Rights-Holders in International Law	FEMINIST LEGAL STUDIES			English	Article						Gender identity; Minority rights; Opinio necessitatis; Sexual and gender minorities; Sexual orientation; Yogyakarta Principles	GENDER; SEXUALITY; IDENTITY; POLITICS; HEALTH; STILL	This article argues for the necessity of recognising the collective rights-holding status of 'sexual and gender minorities' (SGMs) by examining the limits of the discourse concerning sexual orientation and gender identity in international law. I consider both symbolic interactionism and queer theory, which are critical of the assumption that everyone subscribes to a gender and a sexual identity. The theorisation proposed here accounts for not only people who possess a relatively stable identity, but also people whose situations are not conclusively characterised but still require recognition justice. Not equating SGMs to LGBTI populations, I contend that the use of the term 'SGMs' should capture the sociocultural dynamics of the way in which one is made a 'minority'. In light of the variations regarding sexual and gender norms in diverse contexts, SGMs are conceptually useful to accommodate differential experiences of nonconformity with the normative.

They are essential for the European Union's (EU) health information system as providers of health information and data. The aim of this mapping exercise was to identify and analyze EU research networks in terms of health data collection methods, quality assessment, availability and accessibility procedures. Methods A web-based search was performed to identify EU research networks that are not part of international organizations (e.g., WHO-Europe, OECD) and are involved in collection of data for health monitoring or health system performance assessment. General characteristics of the research networks (e.g., data sources, representativeness), quality assessment procedures, availability and accessibility of health data were collected through an ad hoc extraction form. Results Fifty-seven research networks, representative at national, international or regional level, were identified. In these networks, data are mainly collected through administrative sources, health surveys and cohort studies. Over 70% of networks provide information on quality assessment of their data collection procedures. Most networks share macrodata through articles and reports, while microdata are available from ten networks. A request for data access is required by 14 networks, of which three apply a financial charge. Few networks share data with other research networks (8/49) or specify the metadata-reporting standards used for data description (9/49). Conclusions Improving health information and availability of high quality data is a priority in Europe. Research networks could play a major role in tackling health data and information inequalities by enhancing quality, availability, and accessibility of health data and data sharing across European networks.

Methods We reviewed the sustainability goals and implementation plans of 10 global health universities from the Modified Letter Turned CommaTropEd & apos; network. We systematically collected information from institutional websites and annual reports. Through online interviews, 11 key informants validated the information from 9 of the institutions and shared their opinions regarding what factors are helping their institutions decarbonise and what factors are hindering progress. Results 4/10 institutions sampled have a sustainability strategy and implementation plan, only 3/10 have specific decarbonisation goals, and 3/10 are reporting on progress. 5/10 institutions reported that they are in the process of determining emission reduction targets. Conclusion This paper identifies common success factors that facilitate decarbonisation as well as common challenges and how they are being tackled, and makes recommendations on sustainability efforts in academic institutions.

Ethical health security in the age of antimicrobial resistance	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						public health; review; prevention strategies; health policy; infections; diseases; disorders; injuries	POLICY DECISION-MAKING; GLOBAL HEALTH; VALUES; COOPERATION; PERSPECTIVE; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; FIELD; SARS	Objective Owing to its potential human, social and economic costs, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is frequently referred to as a threat to health security. Simultaneously, health security and the preservation of antimicrobials are often described as a global public good. However, how the term 'public good' is used in the context of health security, and the values that underpin it, remains ambiguous. Policymaking is never value-free, and a better examination of such values is critical to understanding how issues such as AMR are problematised and how policy decisions are informed. Design We used McDougall's version of critical interpretive synthesis to capture the recurring concepts and arguments within public policy, political science and applied ethics literature on AMR. Articles were analysed by identifying recurring ideas and developing themes across the literature. Results A total of 77 papers were included in our review. In the context of health security and AMR, the concept of 'public good' appears to be used interchangeably with 'common good', reflecting confusion, but sometimes meaningful differences, regarding how antimicrobials, as a good, are conceived. Main approaches to addressing AMR are statism, globalism and regionalism, which appeal to different values in guiding policymakers. Common justificatory values underpinning preservation of antimicrobials as a public good were prevention of harm, solidarity, justice and rights. Conclusion The findings suggest that within the literature there is a lack of conceptual clarity as to whether antimicrobials constitute a public good or a common good. Moreover, the way in which antimicrobials are conceived and the approaches through which AMR as a threat to health security is addressed appear to be grounded in values that are often implicit. Being explicit about the values that underpin AMR and health security is not simply an intellectual exercise but has very real policy and programmatic implications.

The study was conducted prior to and during the recent global increase in the use of telehealth services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 telehealth practitioners and patients using constructionist grounded theory methods to collect and analyse data. Twenty-five axial coded data categories were then unified and aligned through selective coding with the Beauchamp and Childress (2013) framework of biomedical ethics. The groups were then compared. Results Thirteen categories aligned to the ethical framework were identified for practitioners and 12 for patients. Variance existed between the groups. Practitioner results were non-maleficence 4/13 or (31%), beneficence 4/13 (31%), professional-patient relationships 3/12 (22%), autonomy 1/13 (8%) and justice 1/13 (8%). Patient data results were non-maleficence 4/12 (33%), professional-patient relationships 3/12 (33%), autonomy 2/12 (18%), beneficence 1/12 (8%) and justice 1/12 (8%). Conclusions Ethical principles are experienced differently between telehealth practitioners and patients. These differences can impact the quality and safety of care. Practitioners feel telehealth provides better care overall than patients do. Patients felt telehealth may force a greater share of costs and burdens onto them and reduce equity. Both patients and practitioners felt telehealth can be more harmful than face-to-face service delivery when it creates new or increased risk of harms. Building sufficient trust and mutual understanding are equally important to patients as privacy and confidentiality.

A challenge to equity in transplantation: Increased center-level variation in short-term mechanical circulatory support use in the context of the updated US heart transplant allocation policy	JOURNAL OF HEART AND LUNG TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article						heart transplantation; health equity; heart transplant allocation; public policy; ethics	TIME	BACKGROUND: The United States National Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) implemented changes to the adult heart allocation system to reduce waitlist mortality by improving access for those at greater risk of pre-transplant death, including patients on short-term mechanical circulatory support (sMCS). While sMCS increased, it is unknown whether the increase occurred equitably across centers. METHODS: The OPTN database was used to assess changes in use of sMCS at time of transplant in the 12 months before (pre-change) and after (post-change) implementation of the allocation system in October 2018 among 5,477 heart transplant recipients. An interrupted time series analysis comparing use of bridging therapies pre- and post-change was performed. Variability in the proportion of sMCS use at the center level pre- and post-change was determined. RESULTS: In the month pre-change, 9.7% of patients were transplanted with sMCS. There was an immediate increase in sMCS transplant the following month to 32.4% - an absolute and relative increase of 22.7% and 312% (p < 0.001). While sMCS use was stable pre-change (monthly change 0.0%, 95% CI [-0.1%,0.1%]), there was a continuous 1.2%/month increase post-change ([0.6%,1.8%], p < 0.001). Center-level variation in sMCS use increased substantially after implementation, from a median (interquartile range) of 3.85% (10%) pre-change to 35.7% (30.6%) post-change (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of sMCS at time of transplant increased immediately and continued to expand following heart allocation policy changes. Center-level variation in use of sMCS at the time of transplant increased compared to pre-change, which may have negatively impacted equitable access to heart transplantation.

A human rights-based approach to improve access to insulin and other aspects of diabetes care	DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						diabetes care; human rights; dignity; United Nations	ESSENTIAL MEDICINES; CHILDREN; HEALTH	Many nations struggle to provide adequate diabetes care. Legal as well as moral obligations may facilitate access. International human rights law places obligations on governments to ensure the accessibility and affordability of insulin (a World Health Organization essential medicine), and other components of diabetes care. Despite this obligation, the global reality is that access remains deficient. A human rights approach facilitating the improvement of diabetes services and equitable access to insulin provides a strong framework, theoretically and practically, for advocacy and policymaking changes. This approach links governments to their international obligations, fosters the ideal of, and adherence to, national essential medicine lists, complements the pursuit of international goals in non-communicable diseases, and should influence the actions of pharmaceutical and device companies. This approach empowers patients, families, and communities living with diabetes, and grounds actions by governments, clinicians, and non-government organisations in the principles of dignity, non-discrimination, and equity of access.

Michelle			Using the Theoretical Domains Framework to Identify Barriers and Enablers to Implementing a Virtual Tertiary-Regional Telemedicine Rounding and Consultation for Kids (TRaC-K) Model: Qualitative Study	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						telemedicine; eHealth; pediatric care; inpatient; regional; rural; Canada; Theoretical Domains Framework; qualitative	SUBSPECIALTY CARE; HEALTH-CARE	Background: Inequities in access to health services are a global concern and a concern for Canadian populations living in rural areas. Rural children hospitalized at tertiary children's hospitals have higher rates of medical complexity and experience more expensive hospitalizations and more frequent readmissions. The 2 tertiary pediatric hospitals in Alberta, Canada, have already been operating above capacity, but the pediatric beds at regional hospitals are underused. Such imbalance could lead to poor patient safety and increased readmission risk at tertiary pediatric hospitals and diminish the clinical exposure of regional pediatric health care providers, erode their confidence, and compel health systems to further reduce the capacity at regional sites. A Telemedicine Rounding and Consultation for Kids (TRaC-K) model was proposed to enable health care providers at Alberta Children's Hospital to partner with their counterparts at Medicine Hat Regional Hospital to provide inpatient clinical care for pediatric patients who would otherwise have to travel or be transferred to the tertiary site. Objective: The aim of this study is to identify perceived barriers and enablers to implementing the TRaC-K model. Methods: This study was guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and used qualitative methods. We collected qualitative data from 42 participants from tertiary and regional hospitals through 31 semistructured interviews and 2 focus groups. These data were thematically analyzed to identify major subthemes within each TDF domain. These subthemes were further aggregated and categorized into barriers or enablers to implementing the TRaC-K model and were tabulated separately. Results: Our study identified 31 subthemes in 14 TDF domains, ranging from administrative issues to specific clinical conditions. We were able to merge these subthemes into larger themes and categorize them into 4 barriers and 4 enablers. Our findings showed that the barriers were lack of awareness of telemedicine, skills to provide virtual clinical care, unclear processes and resources to support TRaC-K, and concerns about clear roles and responsibilities. The enablers were health care providers' motivation to provide care closer to home, supporting system resource stewardship, site and practice compatibility, and motivation to strengthen tertiary-regional relationships. Conclusions: This systematic inquiry into the perceived barriers and enablers to the implementation of TRaC-K helped us to gain insights from various health care providers' and family members' perspectives. We will use these findings to design interventions to overcome the identified barriers and harness the enablers to successful of TRaC-K.These findings will inform the implementation of telemedicine-based interventions in pediatric settings in other parts of Canada and beyond.

J	Obasogie, OK				Obasogie, Osagie K.			EXCITED DELIRIUM AND POLICE USE OF FORCE	VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW			English	Article							EXCESSIVE FORCE; EMPIRICAL-ASSESSMENT; 4TH-AMENDMENT; VIOLENCE; ORIGINS; DEATH	Excited delirium is often described as a psychiatric illness characterized by a sudden onset of extreme agitation, confusion, and aggression that can make people irrationally combative and dangerous. Since its inception in the 1980s, this medical condition has been used to justify deadly uses of force by police officers who detain individuals whose seemingly bizarre and uncontrollable behavior is believed to be a threat. Excited delirium is also commonly used by medical examiners and law enforcement to explain why the extreme toll taken on the bodies of people who experience these psychiatric episodes might lead to spontaneous death when they are in police custody. While this diagnosis is increasingly relied upon to explain police use of force and in-custody deaths, a curious matter remains unresolved: excited delirium, as an actual medical condition, does not seem to exist. It is not recognized as a valid medical diagnosis in the American International Classification of Diseases ("ICD-10"), which are the most authoritative classifications of mental health conditions. Moreover, excited delirium has an ignoble history linked to racism and fraudulent forensic science. Nevertheless, excited delirium continues to play a prominent role in policing, prosecutions, and </n> 1983 constitutional tort claims adjudicated by federal courts when victims of police violence seek damages for violations of their constitutional rights. This Article provides the first comprehensive assessment of excited delirium in law and legal scholarship. Drawing upon an original dataset that collects information on in-custody deaths over the past decade tied to excited delirium, this Article documents the extent to which this condition has been articulated by legal and medical actors as a cause of death in situations where police have used force. The data show, among other findings, that at least 56% of deaths that occur in police custody that are attributed to excited delirium involve Black and Latinx victims. By putting these findings in conversation with an examination of the scientific literature and 1983 police excessive force cases that discuss excited delirium, this Article draws attention to how excited delirium has become a misplaced medical diagnosis that obscures and therefore excuses questionable uses of police force that produce harm and death-especially in communities of color. By relying on pseudoscience with little evidence, medical examiners and coroners have given life to a false medical condition that is often used to shield police officers from accountability when they use unacceptably harsh and unlawful force. Excited delirium shifts the blame for these deaths to what is often wrongly presumed to be an individual's tragic medical condition, which obfuscates the structural conditions that predictably lead to unlawful uses of police force that are the more proximate cause of harm. By offering this examination of excited delirium, its role in policing, and how it impacts the adjudication of excessive force claims, this Article suggests that policymakers and legal actors should be more attentive to how science and medicine can be used inappropriately to impede police accountability and justice for victims of police violence.

Underlying factors, including Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), could contribute to these statistics. Our prior work has explored associations between SDoH and several adverse health outcomes (eg, asthma and obesity). Our findings reinforce the emerging consensus that SDoH factors should be considered when implementing intelligent public health surveillance solutions to inform public health policies and interventions. Objective: This study sought to redefine the Healthy People 2030's SDoH taxonomy to accommodate the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we aim to provide a blueprint and implement a prototype for the Urban Population Health Observatory (UPHO), a web-based platform that integrates classified group-level SDoH indicators to individual-and aggregate-level population health data. Methods: The process of building the UPHO involves collecting and integrating data from several sources, classifying the collected data into drivers and outcomes, incorporating data science techniques for calculating measurable indicators from the raw variables, and studying the extent to which interventions are identified or developed to mitigate drivers that lead to the undesired outcomes. Results: We generated and classified the indicators of social determinants of health, which are linked to COVID-19. To display the functionalities of the UPHO platform, we presented a prototype design to demonstrate its features. We provided a use case scenario for 4 different users. Conclusions: UPHO serves as an apparatus for implementing effective interventions and can be adopted as a global platform for chronic and infectious diseases. The UPHO surveillance platform provides a novel approach and novel insights into immediate and long-term health policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and other future public health crises. The UPHO assists public health organizations and policymakers in their efforts in reducing health disparities, achieving health equity, and improving urban population health.
