ASTUTE Hlth Study Grp	Disinvestment policy and the public funding of assisted reproductive technologies: outcomes of deliberative engagements with three key stakeholder groups	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Australia; Evidence-based health policy; Deliberative methods; Discourse analysis; Disinvestment; Assisted reproductive technology	COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; HEALTH; SERVICES	Background: Measures to improve the quality and sustainability of healthcare practice and provision have become a policy concern. In addition, the involvement of stakeholders in health policy decision-making has been advocated, as complex questions arise around the structure of funding arrangements in a context of limited resources. Using a case study of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), deliberative engagements with a range of stakeholder groups were held on the topic of how best to structure the distribution of Australian public funding in this domain. Methods: Deliberative engagements were carried out with groups of ART consumers, clinicians and community members. The forums were informed by a systematic review of ART treatment safety and effectiveness (focusing, in particular, on maternal age and number of treatment cycles), as well as by international policy comparisons, and ethical and cost analyses. Forum discussions were transcribed and subject to thematic analysis. Results: Each forum demonstrated stakeholders' capacity to understand concepts of choice under resource scarcity and disinvestment, and to countenance options for ART funding not always aligned with their interests. Deliberations in each engagement identified concerns around 'equity' and 'patient responsibility', culminating in a broad preference for (potential) ART subsidy restrictions to be based upon individual factors rather than maternal age or number of treatment cycles. Community participants were open to restrictions based upon measures of body mass index (BMI) and smoking status, while consumers and clinicians saw support to improve these factors as part of an ART treatment program, as distinct from a funding criterion. All groups advocated continued patient co-payments, with measures in place to provide treatment access to those unable to pay (namely, equity of access). Conclusions: Deliberations yielded qualitative, socially-negotiated evidence required to inform ethical, accountable policy decisions in the specific area of ART and health care more broadly. Notably, reductionist, deterministic characterizations of stakeholder 'self-interest' proved unfounded as each group sought to prioritise universal values (in particular, 'equity' and 'responsibility') over specific, within-group concerns. Our results - from an emotive case study in ART - highlight that evidence-informed disinvestment decision-making is feasible, and potentially less controversial than often presumed.

However, the focus on competencies might be a poor fit with curricula intended to prepare students for responsibilities not emphasized in traditional medical education. This study examines an innovative approach to the use of potential competency expectations related to advancing global health equity to promote students' reflections and to inform curriculum development. Methods: In 2012, 32 medical students were admitted into a newly developed Global Health and Disparities (GHD) Path of Excellence. The GHD program takes the form of mentored co-curricular activities built around defined competencies related to professional development and leadership skills intended to ameliorate health disparities in medically underserved settings, both domestically and globally. Students reviewed the GHD competencies from two perspectives: a) their ability to perform the identified competencies that they perceived themselves as holding as they began the GHD program and b) the extent to which they perceived that their future career would require these responsibilities. For both sets of assessments the response scale ranged from "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree." Wilcoxon's paired T-tests compared individual students' ordinal rating of their current level of ability to their perceived need for competence that they anticipated their careers would require. Statistical significance was set at p < .01. Results: Students' ratings ranged from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree" that they could perform the defined GHD-related competencies. However, on most competencies, at least 50 % of students indicated that the stated competencies were beyond their present ability level. For each competency, the results of Wilcoxon paired T-tests indicate - at statistically significant levels - that students perceive more need in their careers for GHD-program defined competencies than they currently possess. Conclusion: This study suggests congruence between student and program perceptions of the scope of practice required for GHD. Students report the need for enhanced skill levels in the careers they anticipate. This approach to formulating and reflecting on competencies will guide the program's design of learning experiences aligned with students' career goals.

The study focuses on data that are relevant to low and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using five major electronic databases (Pubmed Medline, Biomed Central, EMBASE, Science of Citation Index, and Cochrane Library) and other sources to identify relevant studies published from January 2002 to July 2013. The review was guided by the socioecological model/perspective of public health and the ideation theory and focused on interventions at the community, healthcare, and multi-sectoral settings, which also reflect key intervention levels of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion. Eligible quantitative studies were selected according to specific study criteria and assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) framework. Conversely, qualitative studies, reviews, case studies, and editorials were not included. Studies were selected by two independent reviewers. Results: Twenty-nine relevant studies from 16 countries were included. Most studies focused on a single intervention or intervention level, rather than multi-sectoral interventions. The majority of the evidence relates to programs aimed at behavioral and social results (or relevant intermediate steps) within a specific population group. Two studies included implications for improvements in health service delivery, two studies examined the intervention's impact on health systems-related outcomes, and three had also implications for environmental health outcomes. Cost-and health equity-related implications for select evidence were also discussed. Conclusions: The paucity of well-designed quantitative evaluations of interventions to communicate health risk and promote disease control measures in LMICs does not allow for any definitive conclusions. Yet, the review identified several promising interventions and areas for future investigation. Among them, community-based and participatory interventions seemed to be central within epidemic and emerging disease settings, particularly in low-resource settings. Yet, evidence on their effectiveness is not conclusive and needs to be explored by future studies. Other promising areas for future investigation include multicomponent and multi-sectoral approaches to intervention design. Major research gaps referred to any evaluation of the impact of these kinds of interventions on health policy adoption and/or implementation, and social determinants of health. Research on cost-effectiveness also needs to be strengthened. This review identified several research gaps and questions, and discusses potential future directions for increasing capacity for future and more rigorous assessments.

Determinants of MSK health and disability - Social determinants of inequities in MSK health	BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH IN CLINICAL RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article						Inequity; Inequality; Determinants; Musculoskeletal disorders; Osteoarthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis	COUNTY OSTEOARTHRITIS PROJECT; NECROSIS FACTOR THERAPY; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS; HIP OSTEOARTHRITIS; JOINT REPLACEMENT; EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; SYMPTOMATIC HIP; GLOBAL BURDEN	Even in most egalitarian societies, disparities in care exist to the disadvantage of some people with chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders and related disability. These situations translate into inequality in health and health outcomes. The goal of this chapter is to review concepts and determinants associated with health inequity, and the effect of interventions to minimize their impact. Health inequities are avoidable, unnecessary, unfair and unjust. Inequities can occur across the health care continuum, from primary and secondary prevention to diagnosis and treatment. There are many ways to define and identify inequities, according for instance to ethical, philosophical, epidemiological, sociological, economic, or public health points of view. These complementary views can be applied to set a framework of analysis, identify determinants and suggest targets of action against inequity. Most determinants of inequity in MSK disorders are similar to those in the general population and other chronic diseases. People may be exposed to inequity as a result of policies and rules set by the health care system, individuals' demographic characteristics (e.g., education level), or some behavior of health professionals and of patients. Osteoarthritis (OA) represents a typical chronic MSK condition. The PROGRESS-Plus framework is useful for identifying the important role that place of residence, race and ethnicity, occupation, gender, education, socioeconomic status, social capital and networks, age, disability and sexual orientation may have in creating or maintaining inequities in this disease. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a consideration of international data led to the conclusion that not all RA patients who needed biologic therapy had access to it. The disparity in care was due partly to policies of a country and a health care system, or economic conditions. We conclude this chapter by discussing examples of interventions designed for reducing health inequity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Globalisation, health inequalities, competing economic interests and political instability contribute substantially to the spread of drug-resistant strains, which are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Issues such as increasing transmission of drug-resistant strains, poor diagnostic coverage and a lengthy, toxic treatment need to be overcome by innovative approaches to tuberculosis control, prevention, diagnostics and treatment. This review addresses recent developments and future concepts.

Divergence in Age Patterns of Mortality Change Drives International Divergence in Lifespan Inequality	DEMOGRAPHY			English	Article						Disparity; Health; Longevity; Retirement; Social policy	UNITED-STATES; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; HEALTH; TRENDS; DEATH; EXPECTANCY; DETERMINANTS; CANADA; LENGTH	In the past six decades, lifespan inequality has varied greatly within and among countries even while life expectancy has continued to increase. How and why does mortality change generate this diversity? We derive a precise link between changes in age-specific mortality and lifespan inequality, measured as the variance of age at death. Key to this relationship is a young-old threshold age, below and above which mortality decline respectively decreases and increases lifespan inequality. First, we show for Sweden that shifts in the threshold's location have modified the correlation between changes in life expectancy and lifespan inequality over the last two centuries. Second, we analyze the post-World War II (WWII) trajectories of lifespan inequality in a set of developed countries-Japan, Canada, and the United States-where thresholds centered on retirement age. Our method reveals how divergence in the age pattern of mortality change drives international divergence in lifespan inequality. Most strikingly, early in the 1980s, mortality increases in young U.S. males led to a continuation of high lifespan inequality in the United States; in Canada, however, the decline of inequality continued. In general, our wider international comparisons show that mortality change varied most at young working ages after WWII, particularly for males. We conclude that if mortality continues to stagnate at young ages yet declines steadily at old ages, increases in lifespan inequality will become a common feature of future demographic change.

We investigated the magnitude of socioeconomic inequality in the quality of life of Europeans in early old age and the influence of the welfare regime type on these relationships. Methods: Data from individuals aged 50-75 years (n = 16 074) residing in 13 European countries were derived from Waves 2 and 3 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Slope indices of inequality (SIIs) were calculated for the association between socioeconomic position and CASP-12, a measure of positive quality of life. Multilevel linear regression was used to assess the overall relationship between socioeconomic position and quality of life, using interaction terms to investigate the influence of the type of welfare regime (Southern, Scandinavian, Post-communist or Bismarckian). Results: Socioeconomic inequalities in quality of life were narrowest in the Scandinavian and Bismarckian regimes, and were largest by measures of current wealth. Compared with the Scandinavian welfare regime, where narrow inequalities in quality of life by education level were found in both men (SII = 0.02, 95% CI: -1.09 to 1.13) and women (SII = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.05-2.17), the difference in quality of life between the least and most educated was particularly wide in Southern and Post-communist regimes. Conclusion: Individuals in more generous welfare regimes experienced higher levels of quality of life, as well as narrower socioeconomic inequalities in quality of life.

J	Bauman, AE; King, L; Nutbeam, D				Bauman, Adrian E.; King, Lesley; Nutbeam, Don			Rethinking the evaluation and measurement of health in all policies	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						healthy public policy; evaluation challenges; evidence-based health promotion	COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; TOOLS; HIAP	Current international attention to Health in all policies (HiAP) has its origins in a more sophisticated understanding of the impact of public policies on health, and a recognition that policies across government have an impact on the social and environmental determinants of health and related inequalities in health. As an emerging field, there has been limited attention focused on comprehensive approaches to the evaluation of HiAP to date, and the research focus around HiAP has mainly examined the processes of cross-sectoral policy development, rather than their health-related impacts or outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to explore issues in assessing the implementation of HiAP and describe an expanded evaluation framework for assessing the potential intermediate and end-point effects of HiAP actions, using a planning logic model for 'complex programs'. This meets the needs of public sector policy-makers who express an interest in understanding the relationship between HiAP and health-related and social outcomes. The paper proposes applying a contribution analysis method to estimate and model the anticipated impacts of HiAP policies on intermediate and longer term outcomes, in advance of empirical studies of these outcomes, and as an innovative input into HiAP and evaluation planning. A broader long-term evaluation framework will enhance the political saliency of HiAP initiatives, especially from governments considering HiAP approaches in financially constrained environments.

Structured searches of PubMed, and ISI Web of Knowledge, were conducted. Quantitative and qualitative studies reporting health outcomes on children, published since 2007 and related to the 2008 economic crisis were included. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion. Data were synthesised as a narrative review. Five hundred and six titles and abstracts were reviewed, from which 22 studies were included. The risk of bias for quantitative studies was mixed while qualitative studies showed low risk of bias. An excess of 28,000-50,000 infant deaths in 2009 was estimated in sub-Saharan African countries, and increased infant mortality in Greece was reported. Increased price of foods was related to worsening nutrition habits in disadvantaged families worldwide. An increase in violence against children was reported in the U.S., and inequalities in health-related quality of life appeared in some countries. Most studies suggest that the economic crisis has harmed children's health, and disproportionately affected the most vulnerable groups. There is an urgent need for further studies to monitor the child health effects of the global recession and to inform appropriate public policy responses.

A host of systemic, economic, geopolitical and sociocultural factors have been implicated. Mobile information and communication technologies hold potential to ameliorate several of these challenges by supporting coordinated and evidence-based care, facilitating community based health services and enabling citizens to access health information and support. mHealth has attracted considerable attention as a means of supporting maternal, newborn and child health in developing countries and research to assess the impacts of mHealth interventions is increasing. While a number of expert reviews have attempted to summarise this literature, there remains a need for a fully systematic review employing gold standard methods of evidence capture, critical appraisal and meta-analysis, in order to comprehensively map, quality assess and synthesise this body of knowledge. Objectives To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the impacts of mobile technology-enabled interventions designed to support maternal, newborn and child health in low- and middle-income countries. Methods 16 online international electronic databases of published scientific abstracts and citations will be interrogated for the period 1990 to 2014 (no language restrictions) in order to identify relevant studies. Ongoing/unpublished studies will be identified through searching international trial repositories and consulting experts in the field. Study quality will be assessed using appropriate critical appraisal tools; including the Cochrane Handbook's 7 evaluation domains for randomised and clinical trials, the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) guidelines for other comparative study types, and the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tools for observational studies. Blinded assessment by at least two reviewers, with arbitration by a third if necessary, will ensure rigour. Meta-analysis will be undertaken, where possible, using a random-effects model. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be reported. Publication bias will be assessed. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required. Results These will be presented in one manuscript. The review protocol is registered with the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) CRD42014008939.

Early identification of developmental disabilities is a high priority for the World Health Organization to allow action to reduce impairments through Gap Action Program on mental health. The study identified the feasibility of using the developmental screening and monitoring tools for children aged 0-3 year(s) by non-specialist primary healthcare providers in low-resource settings. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify the tools, assess their psychometric properties, and feasibility of use in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Key indicators to examine feasibility in LMICs were derived from a consultation with 23 international experts. We identified 426 studies from which 14 tools used in LMICs were extracted for further examination. Three tools reported adequate psychometric properties and met most of the feasibility criteria. Three tools appear promising for use in identifying and monitoring young children with disabilities at primary healthcare level in LMICs. Further research and development are needed to optimize these tools.

Patients and methods: Data of 13,565 women aged 51-74 years old invited to attend an organised mammography screening session between 2010 and 2011 in thirteen French departments were randomly selected. Information on the women's participation in BCSP, their individual characteristics and the characteristics of their area of residence were recorded and analysed in a multilevel model. Results: Between 2010 and 2012, 7121 (52.5%) women of the studied population had their mammography examination after they received the invitation. Women living in the most deprived neighbourhood were less likely than those living in the most affluent neighbourhood to participate in BCSP (OR 95%CI = 0.84[0.78-0.92]) as were those living in rural areas compared with those living in urban areas (OR 95%CI = 0.87[0.80-0.95]). Being self-employed (p < 0.0001) or living more than 15 min away from an accredited screening centre (p = 0.02) was also a barrier to participation in BCSP. Conclusion: Despite the classless delivery of BCSP, inequalities in uptake remain. To take advantage of prevention and to avoid exacerbating disparities in cancer mortality, BCSP should be adapted to women's personal and contextual characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Children whose parents are upwardly mobile gain higher educational qualifications than their peers in their class of origin, but obtain lower qualifications than their peers in their class of destination. The reverse pattern is observed for the downwardly mobile. These results mirror those obtained for the relation between adult intra-generational social mobility and a number of widely used measures of health. The implications of the findings for different explanations of the social class gradient in educational attainment are examined. The findings provide greater support for theoretical explanations of educational inequalities that are based on differences in economic circumstances between social classes than they do for explanations based on social class variations in the levels of cultural capital and aspirations. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the overall pattern of results from these analyses is unchanged after statistically controlling for levels of parental education. The findings also have methodological implications for measuring the social class gradient in attainment and qualifications. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Agricultural production and other proximate determinants of global heights	EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY			English	Article							ANTHROPOMETRIC HISTORY; STATURE; NUTRITION; MORTALITY; INDIANS; GROWTH; WORLD; INEQUALITY; GENETICS; WEIGHT	We analyze the proximate determinants of the biological standard of living from a global perspective, namely high-quality nutrition and the disease environment during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Until the mid-twentieth century, the local availability of cattle, meat, and milk per capita and the local disease environment mainly determined the stature of the population and, by implication, how long they lived and how healthy they were. During the late twentieth century, the trade of agricultural products and health-promoting technologies increased in relative importance; hence, the local availabilities became less decisive in explaining height differences.

Suicidal behavior in the elderly population represents a huge potential burden on national health care systems and economies, as the average lifespan has increased significantly in most countries in recent decades. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between nursing care and the overall suicide rate in the elderly. Methods: We used a fixed-effect model to analyze panel data comprising suicide-related events in Taiwan from 2001 to 2009. Two data sets provided by the Taiwan Department of Health of the Executive Yuan, Taiwan, and the Taiwan Demographic Fact Book produced by the Taiwan Ministry of the Interior were used. Death by suicide was defined as those coded E950-E958 according to the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). These data comprised a longitudinal population-based survey of,a nationwide sample of 23, 224, 912 residents. Results: Our study suggests that suicides in the elderly can be prevented with medical care offered by nurses. Our findings show that increasing the number of nursing staff reduced suicidal ideation in older adults. Although the results regarding elderly male suicides were not statistically significant, elderly female suicides were found to be significantly reduced. Conclusion: This study concluded that it is possible to reduce this public health issue and decrease the associated national financial burden by increasing the nursing workforce.

As a result, the proportion of under-five deaths due to neonatal mortality increased. This increase is primarily a consequence of decreasing post-neonatal and child under-five mortality as a result of the typical focus of child survival programmes of the past two decades on diseases affecting children over four weeks of age. Newborns are lagging behind in improved child health outcomes. The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive, equity-focussed newborn care assessment and to explore options to improve newborn survival in Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) and the Philippines. Methods: We assessed newborn health policies, services and care in the three countries through document review, interviews and health facility visits. Findings were triangulated to describe newborns' health status, the health policy and the health system context for newborn care and the equity situation regarding newborn survival. Results: Main findings: (1) In the three countries, decline of neonatal mortality is lagging behind compared to that of under-five mortality. (2) Comprehensive newborn policies in line with international standards exist, although implementation remains poor. An important factor hampering implementation is decentralisation of the health sector, which created confusion regarding roles and responsibilities. Management capacity and skills at decentralised level were often found to be limited. (3) Quality of newborn care provided at primary healthcare and referral level is generally substandard. Limited knowledge and skills among providers of newborn care are contributing to poor quality of care. (4) Socio-economic and geographic inequities in newborn care are considerable. Conclusions: Similar important challenges for newborn care have been identified in Indonesia, Lao PDR and the Philippines. There is an urgent need to address weak leadership and governance regarding newborn care, quality of newborn care provided and inequities in newborn care. Child survival programmes focussed on children over four weeks of age have shown to have positive outcomes. Similar efforts as those used in these programmes should be considered in newborn care.

Today, major changes in trade are occurring with the advent of mega-ships that can transport thousands more containers than cargo ships now in use. Because global trade is expected to increase dramatically, the railroad industry-in the U. S. alone-has invested more than $5 billion a year over the past decade to expand rail yards and enhance rail routes to transport goods from ports to retail destinations. This article describes cancer risks for residents living in close proximity to rail yards with emissions of diesel particulate matter pollution from locomotives, trucks and yard equipment. The article examines the demographics (income, race/ethnicity) of populations living in the highest estimated cancer risk zones near 18 major rail yards in California, concluding that the majority are over-represented by either lower-income or minority residents (or both). The authors also describe a review of the news media and environmental impact reports to determine if rail yards are still being constructed or expanded in close proximity to homes and schools or in working class/working poor communities of color. The paper suggests policy efforts that might provide more public health protection and result in more "environmentally just" siting of rail yards. The authors conclude that diesel pollution from rail yards, which creates significant diesel cancer risks for those living near the facilities, is an often overlooked public health, health disparities and environmental justice issue in the U.S. The conclusions are relevant to other countries where international trade is increasing and large new intermodal rail facilities are being considered.

We aimed to investigate the influence of ageing index, health budget, and density of orthopaedic surgeons in the regional variability of the primary and revision THR rate in Spain, where regions decide on the allocation of their health budget. Inpatient database of hip procedures for years 1997 to 2011 was obtained from the Spanish Ministry of Health, segregated for each of the 17 regional health services in Spain. Crude and adjusted rates (direct method with total Spanish population per year) were calculated and used as dependent variables. Ageing index, Health Expenditure of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and number of orthopaedic surgeons per region were used as independent variables. Negative binomial regression analysis model and Poisson regression were calculated to estimate the risk contribution of the ecological variables. A total of 425,914 hip procedures, with 367,489 primary (mean crude rate = 124 x 10(5) inhabitants/year) and 58,425 revision hips (21 x 10(5) inhabitants/year) were included in the analysis. Regional variability was higher than expected in THR in Spain, despite a universal coverage health system in which equity may be challenged in the administration of hip arthroplasty. This was found particularly for primary THR. When hip replacement rates were adjusted for sex and age, the regional ageing index, the density of orthopaedic surgeons and the regional health budget could only partially explain risk ratio changes.

This article builds on key lessons learnt from a learning exchange between Communities for Health in England and the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health across the US (REACH US) communities that are tackling health inequities. It presents a qualitative analysis further capturing information about specific community interventions involved in the exchange and identifying lessons learnt. This exchange was led by a partnership between the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the International Union for Health Promotion and Education, the Department of Health of England, Health Action Partnership International, and Learning for Public Health West Midlands. These efforts provide interesting insights for further research, priority areas of action for policy and practice to address the SDH and to promote and sustain equity and social justice globally. The article highlights some key lessons about the use of data, assets-based community interventions and the importance of good leadership in times of crisis and adversity. Whilst complex and time-consuming to arrange, such programmes have the potential to offer other countries including the global south new insights and perspectives that will in turn contribute to the SDH field and provide concrete strategies and actions that effectively reduce inequities and promote the health of our societies. The key learnings have the potential to contribute to the global community and growing documentation on evidence of effective efforts in the reduction of health inequities.

A cross-country panel data analysis	APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article						smoking prevalence; cigarette price; panel threshold regression; WHO FCTC; price elasticity	TAX INCREASES; ADULT SMOKING; YOUTH SMOKING; DEMAND; HEALTH; AFFORDABILITY; INEQUALITY; TAXATION; INCOME	This article shows new cross-country evidences by empirically investigating the joint effects of cigarette price levels and joining the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) on smoking prevalence in 74 countries over the period of 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2006. We assessed cigarette price elasticity for three national income levels using different databases on cigarette price from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), demographic and socioeconomic country characteristics from the World Bank and adjusted smoking prevalence rates published by various yearly WHO reports on the global tobacco epidemic from 2000 to 2010. A panel threshold regression was used to capture the nonlinear effects that cigarette prices on smoking prevalence at the three national income levels endogenously determined by estimation. Our findings supported the evidence that joining the WHO FCTC would have a positive effect on reducing cross-country smoking prevalence, especially among countries with low- and medium-income levels. Moreover, some simulated results show that a price hike of 10% would reduce smoking prevalence in countries with national income levels equal to or less than US$1900 and by 7.2% in countries with national income levels between US$1900 and US$2510 more than those with national income levels that are higher than US$2510.

The prevalence of exposure (Pe) to job strain, ERI and job insecurity was calculated using the sample of 29,680 workers from 31 countries of the 2005 European Working Conditions Survey. Relative risks (RR) were obtained from three published meta-analyses. Pe and RR estimates were used to calculate attributable fractions (AF). Pe estimates were 26.90, 20.44 and 14.11 % for job strain, ERI and job insecurity in Europe, and significant differences were observed between countries. The job strain and ERI AFs for cardiovascular diseases were, respectively, 4.46 % (significantly different from zero for Europe and all countries, but without any differences between countries) and 18.21 % (not significantly different from zero for Europe and without differences between countries). The significant job strain and job insecurity AFs for mental disorders were 18.16 and 4.53 % in Europe, without any significant difference between countries. The significant ERI AF for mental disorders was 14.81 %, and significant differences were found between countries; the 3 highest AFs were observed in Greece, Slovenia and Turkey, and the 3 lowest in Bulgaria, Ireland and Latvia. This study is the first one to provide fractions of cardiovascular diseases and mental disorders attributable to three psychosocial work factors for the whole Europe and to explore the differences between 31 countries. These results may be useful to guide European and national prevention policies as well as to evaluate the economic costs of diseases attributable to these exposures.

Working questions were: (1) how well is health promotion implemented within physical therapy practice; and (2) how might this be improved across five target audiences (i.e. physical therapist practitioners, educators, researchers, professional body representatives, and government liaisons/consultants). In structured facilitated sessions, Summit representatives (n = 32) discussed: (1) within WCPT regions, what is working and the challenges; and (2) across WCPT regions, what are potential directions using World Cafe (TM) methodology. Commonalities outweighed differences with respect to strategies to advance health-focused physical therapy as a clinical competency across regions and within target audiences. Participants agreed that health-focused practice is a professional priority, and a strategic action plan was needed to develop it as a clinical competency. The action plan and recommendations largely paralleled the principles and objectives of the World Health Organization's non-communicable diseases action plan. A third Summit planned for 2015 will provide a mechanism for follow-up to evaluate progress in integrating health-focused physical therapy within the profession.

J	Wang, GZ				Wang, Guang-zhen			The Impact of Social and Economic Indicators on Maternal and Child Health	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						Maternal and child health; Gender equality; Women's human rights; Maternity care; Developing countries; Economic and political development	INTERNATIONAL HUMAN-RIGHTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; CITIZENSHIP; GENDER; ABORTION; POWER; TRANSITION; PROGRAMS; FEMINISM	As early as 1985, Rosenfield and Maine began to look at what is called the maternal child field (MCH). More than two decades later, maternal and infant mortality is still among the worst performing health indicator in resource-poor countries and regions, and it has barely changed since 1990. Although three of the eight United Nations Millennium Development Goals aim at reducing child mortality, maternal mortality, and promoting gender equality, most literature in the field is either clinical or exclusively deals with women's health problems. In this study, I proposed an empirical model that tests the impact of gender equality, women's human rights, and maternity care on MCH with economic and political development as background factors. The proposed model was tested by using structural equation analysis. Data were obtained from 137 developing countries. The proposed model is partially supported by the data. Empirical findings demonstrate that gender equality has a pivotal role to play in the promotion of MCH. The relationship between MCH and maternity care is found to be strong and statistically significant. This finding may permit a probable verification given the current social conditions in some developing countries, particularly the neglect of many of women's health needs and the assignment of their primary responsibilities in childrearing. The women's human rights hypothesis is not supported by the data. It is perhaps that human rights instruments provide a legal discourse for political functions and social welfare issues, but that the legal approach alone does not necessarily provide a moral and social foundation to ensure the implementation of social welfare and human well-being, particularly maternal and child health in developing countries. The findings also indicate the importance of economic development in predicting maternity care. Finally, a positive and statistically significant relationship is found between economic development and gender equality. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.

Basing its ruling on European Union Directive 2004/113/EC, the European Court of Justice on 1 March 2011 concluded that any gender-based discrimination is prohibited, so gender equality in the European Union (EU) must be ensured from 21 December 2012. Until then, gender-specific premium differentiation was allowed in most EU Member States for risks that are strongly linked to gender. We discuss the relevance of price differentiation criteria from the point of view of insurers, regulators and ethicists, and reflect on the degree of acceptance of such price differentiation by consumers, which is assessed empirically through an international consumer survey conducted in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland. The perception of risk factors and of effective gender-related price differences is considered with respect to motor, annuity, term life and health insurance Finally, we discuss possible consequences of the new regulation for the insurance industry.

This study examined the association between mental health status and certain socioeconomic indicators (personal social position and the socioeconomic status of the family) in Slovenian 15-year-old adolescents. Methods: Data originate from the WHO-Collaborative cross-national Health Behavior in School-aged Children' study conducted in Slovenia in 2010 (1,815 secondary school pupils, aged 15). Mental health status was measured by: KIDSCREEN-10, the Strength and Difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), a life satisfaction scale, and one question about feelings of depression. Socioeconomic position was measured by the socioeconomic status of the family (Family Affluence Scale, perceived material welfare, family type, occupational status of parents) and personal social position (number of friends and the type of school). Logistic regression and a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were performed. Results: Girls had 2.5-times higher odds of suffering feelings of depression (p < 0.001), 1.5-times higher odds of low life satisfaction (p = 0.008), and a greater chance of a lower quality of life and a higher SDQ score than boys (p = 0.001). The adolescents who perceived their family's material welfare as worse had 4-times higher odds (p < 0.001) of a low life satisfaction, a greater chance of a low quality of life, and a higher SDQ score than those who perceived it as better (p < 0.001). Adolescents with no friends had lower KIDSCREEN-10 and higher SDQ scores than those who had more than three friends. Conclusions: Despite the fact that Slovenia is among the EU members with the lowest rates of social inequalities, it was found that adolescents with a lower socioeconomic position have poorer mental health than those with a higher socioeconomic position. Because of the financial crisis, we can expect an increase in social inequalities and a greater impact on adolescents' mental health status in Slovenia in the future.

J	Kaushal, N				Kaushal, Neeraj			Intergenerational Payoffs of Education	FUTURE OF CHILDREN			English	Article							FAMILY INCOME; TRANSMISSION; ACHIEVEMENT; RETURNS; TUITION; HEALTH; IMPACT; MATTER; TAX	Better-educated parents generally have children who are themselves better educated, healthier, wealthier, and better off in almost every way than the children of the less educated. But this simple correlation does not prove that the relationship is causal. Neeraj Kaushal sifts through the evidence from economics and public policy and reviews large national and international studies to conclude that, indeed, education has large intergenerational payoffs in many areas of children's lives, and that these payoffs persist over time. Kaushal shows that, if anything, traditional measures of returns to education which focus on income and productivity almost certainly underestimate the beneficial effects that parents' education has on their children. She reports causal positive effects not only on children's test scores, health, and behavior, but also on mothers' behaviors that can affect their children's wellbeing, such as teenage childbearing and substance use. Her findings suggest that, as a component of two-generation programs, helping parents extend their education could go a long way toward reducing inequality across generations and promoting children's healthy development. Thus the rationale for two-generation programs that boost parents' education is compelling. However, Kaushal cautions, the U.S. education system reinforces socioeconomic inequality across generations by spending more money on educating richer children than on educating poorer children. By themselves, then, two-generation programs will not necessarily ameliorate the structural factors that perpetuate inequality in this country.

Methods: A cross-over design study was conducted in 99 prostate cancer patients at an urology outpatient clinic. Descriptive exact and global agreement percentages, intraclass correlation, and equivalence test based on minimal clinically important difference (MCID) approach were used to examine the equity of HRQOL scores between these two modes of administration. We also evaluated the feasibility of computerized assessment based on patients' acceptability and preference. Additionally, we used Rasch rating scale model to assess differential item functioning (DIF) between the two modes of administration. Results: The percentages of global agreement in all domains were greater than 85% in the EORTC QLQ-PR25. All results from equivalence tests were significant, except for Sexual functioning, indicating good equivalence. Only one item exhibited DIF between the two modes. Although nearly 80% of the study patients had no prior computer-use experience, the overall proportion of acceptance and preference for the touch-screen mode were quite high and there was no significant difference across age groups or between computer-use experience groups. Conclusions: The study results showed that the data obtained from the modes of administration were equivalent. The touch-screen mode of administration can be a feasible and suitable alternative to the paper-and-pencil mode for assessment of patient-reported outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.

J	Ruckert, A; Labonté, R				Ruckert, Arne; Labonte, Ronald			The global financial crisis and health equity: Early experiences from Canada	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Health equity; Global financial crisis; Social determinants of health; Austerity; Canada	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; ONTARIO; AUSTERITY; MARKET	Background: It is widely acknowledged that austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis are starting to undermine population health results. Yet, few research studies have focused on the ways in which the financial crisis and the ensuing 'Great Recession' have affected health equity, especially through their impact on social determinants of health; neither has much attention been given to the health consequences of the fiscal austerity regime that quickly followed a brief period of counter-cyclical government spending for bank bailouts and economic stimulus. Canada has not remained insulated from these developments, despite its relative success in maneuvering the global financial crisis. Methods: The study draws on three sources of evidence: A series of semi-structured interviews in Ottawa and Toronto, with key informants selected on the basis of their expertise (n = 12); an analysis of recent (2012) Canadian and Ontario budgetary impacts on social determinants of health; and documentation of trend data on key social health determinants pre- and post the financial crisis. Results: The findings suggest that health equity is primarily impacted through two main pathways related to the global financial crisis: austerity budgets and associated program cutbacks in areas crucial to addressing the inequitable distribution of social determinants of health, including social assistance, housing, and education; and the qualitative transformation of labor markets, with precarious forms of employment expanding rapidly in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Preliminary evidence suggests that these tendencies will lead to a further deepening of existing health inequities, unless counter-acted through a change in policy direction. Conclusions: This article documents some of the effects of financial crisis and severe economic decline on health equity in Canada. However, more research is necessary to study policy choices that could mitigate this effect. Since the policy response to a similar set of economic shocks has globally varied and led to differential health and health equity outcomes, comparative studies are now possible to assess the successes and failures of specific policy responses. This raises the question of what types of public policy can mitigate against the negative health equity effects of severe economic recessions.

Using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 111 prominent medical conditions, assessed globally and nationally by the World Health Organization, we linked DALYs with MEDLINE articles for each condition to assess the influence of DALY-based global disease burden, compared to the global market for treatment, on the production of relevant MEDLINE articles, systematic reviews, clinical trials and research using animal models vs. humans. We then explored how DALYs, wealth, and the production of research within countries correlate with this global pattern. We show that global DALYs for each condition had a small, significant negative relationship with the production of each type of MEDLINE articles for that condition. Local processes of health research appear to be behind this. Clinical trials and animal studies but not systematic reviews produced within countries were strongly guided by local DALYs. More and less developed countries had very different disease profiles and rich countries publish much more than poor countries. Accordingly, conditions common to developed countries garnered more clinical research than those common to less developed countries. Many of the health needs in less developed countries do not attract attention among developed country researchers who produce the vast majority of global health knowledge - including clinical trials - in response to their own local needs. This raises concern about the amount of knowledge relevant to poor populations deficient in their own research infrastructure. We recommend measures to address this critical dimension of global health inequality.

J	Sjöberg, O				Sjoberg, Ola			Old-age pensions and population health: A global and cross-national perspective	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						population health; life expectancy; social security; middle-income countries; old-age pensions	INCOME INEQUALITY; SOCIAL INSURANCE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; WELFARE; MORTALITY; SECURITY; POLITICS; REGIMES	Social security schemes can reduce poverty risk and increase resources available for individuals and families, and these schemes may therefore have an important role to play in population health in both high- and middle-income countries. This article analyses the linkage between effective coverage of old-age pension schemes and life expectancy in a sample of 93 high- and middle-income countries at the end of the twenty-first century. The analyses support the notion that social security schemes, and especially programmes with a universal approach, may have positive effects on population health, even after taking into account the effect of levels of economic development, income inequality and essential characteristics of health care systems. This article also demonstrates that there is no evident relationship between levels of economic development and social security legislation: historically, late industrialisers were often first in introducing major social security schemes, and today there is no clear cross-national relationship between levels of economic development and the proportion of the population covered by old-age pension schemes.

J	White, J				White, Julie			Overlooking entitlement	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION			English	Article						social justice; neoliberalism; chronic illness; social inclusion; inclusive education; policy	POLICY; TEACHERS	This article investigates why young people with significant and continuing health conditions can easily be overlooked in education. The Keeping Connected study from Australia revealed much about the complicated lives of young people with chronic illness, and several unanticipated ways that health conditions impacted on education are reported here. However, the effect of global education policy also provides some indication that there is a broader explanation that might explain exclusionary practices. The argument that social inclusion policy bears little relation to either social justice or inclusive education is developed. Informed by what young people and their parents reported in this study and by identification of policy conveniences and silences, this article offers some explanation for how the interests of this invisible cohort of young people are not well served. In light of this, it is appropriate to ask whether current understandings of inclusion could be problematised and further developed so that the entitlement of these young people to accommodation and success in education is more generally acknowledged.

We explore how social capital is understood as a concept and used in practice for guiding policy development and program delivery in South Australian public health programs. The empirical research compared policy makers' and practitioners' understandings of social capital and how theories about social capital and health inequality were translated into practice in three case study projects. It found that there are shifting discourses between social capital and related concepts, including community capacity building, and social inclusion/exclusion. Policy makers reported less use of the concept of social capital in favour of social inclusion/exclusion reflecting changing political and policy environments where terms come into favour and then go out of fashion. In this transition period the two terms are often used interchangeably although there are some conceptual points of difference.

Although the ACA aims to reduce the number of the uninsured through the simultaneous expansion of the private insurance industry and government-funded Medicaid, critics charge it merely expands rather than reforms the existing fragmented and costly employer-based health care system. Focusing in particular on the ACA's individual mandate and its planned Medicaid expansion, this statement charts a course for ethnographic contributions to the on-the-ground impact of the ACA while showcasing ways critical medical anthropologists can join the debate. We conclude with ways that anthropologists may use critiques of the ACA as a platform from which to denaturalize assumptions of "cost" and "profit" that underpin the global spread of market-based medicine more broadly.

Reducing stigma in reproductive health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Abortion stigma; Discrimination and stigma; HIV stigma; Infertility stigma; Professionalism and stigma; Service providers and stigma; Stigma	ETHICS; POLICY; CARE	Stigmatization marks individuals for disgrace, shame, and even disgust spoiling or tarnishing their social identities. It can be imposed accidentally by thoughtlessness or insensitivity; incidentally to another purpose; or deliberately to deter or punish conduct considered harmful to actors themselves, others, society, or moral values. Stigma has permeated attitudes toward recipients of sexual and reproductive health services, and at times to service providers. Resort to contraceptive products, to voluntary sterilization and abortion, and now to medically assisted reproductive care to overcome infertility has attracted stigma. Unmarried motherhood has a long history of shame, projected onto the "illegitimate" (bastard) child. The stigma of contracting sexually transmitted infections has been reinvigorated with HIV infection. Gynecologists and their professional associations, ethically committed to uphold human dignity and equality, especially for vulnerable women for whom they care, should be active to guard against, counteract, and relieve stigmatization of their patients and of related service providers.

In 1991 Georgia became an independent republic following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The armed conflict with Russia in 2008 and political unrest in recent years has presented the Georgian population and politicians with a demanding situation. As part of the WHO European Region, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) including Georgia is on the unfortunate side of a European health divide, with low male life expectancy and high under-five mortality. There is also a high degree of economic inequality in the population. We first look at the main players and the current strategies in public health work. Next we discuss this on the background of health promotion principles and recent international developments in knowledge and policy recommendations in the field of health promotion. Finally we point to some of the major public health challenges that Georgia faces. We conclude that the Georgian focus on reducing risk behaviours and improving access to quality health care is worthy of praise, but that this is not sufficient to solve the current public health challenges. Strategies for working across sectors with social determinants of health should be built into Georgian health thinking and policies. A health promotion work force should be developed. International developments such as the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) report, the 'Health 2020' framework and the HP Core Competencies project all provide useful input to future development of healthy public policies in Georgia.

Grounded in the interviews and focus groups conducted with a purposeful sample of 17 registered nurses (RNs) and registered practical nurses (RPNs) currently working in Ontario's mental health sector, our analysis underscores the need to move beyond reductionist notions of violence as simply individual physical or psychological events. While acknowledging that violence is a very real and disturbing experience for individual nurses, our article casts light on the importance of a broader, power structure analysis of violence experienced by nurses in this sector, arguing that effective redress lies beyond blame shifting between clients/patients and nurses. Our analysis illustrates how assumptions about gender, race and care operate in the context of global, neoliberal forces to reinforce, intensify and create, as well as obscure, structural violence through mechanisms of individualization and normalization.

Although OJ has proven predictive power and relevance, it has rarely been studied in health care settings. This stems partially from the lack of a reliable and valid measure of patients' OJ in health care encounters. The objective here was to create and validate a measure of patients' OJ. With that purpose, a survey study with two sampling contexts - the U.S. and Spain - was carried out in order to provide a cross-national validation of the scale in two versions: English (Perceived Organizational justice in Care Services, PJustCS) and Spanish (Percepcion de Justicia Organizacional en el Ambito Sanitario, PJustAS). Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were used to select the appropriate items in the final version of the instrument. Reliability and validity of the measure were tested. A total of 406 patients in the U.S. and 473 patients in Spain participated. The measures used were the newly created scale of Perceived Organizational justice in Care Services (PJustCS/PJustAS) and scales of patients' Satisfaction, Trust and Global justice. Factor Analyses supported the four dimensional structure of the instrument for each group. Multigroup CFA substantiated invariant factor loadings and invariant structural models across both samples, hence, supporting that the instrument is applicable in its two versions: English and Spanish. Validation results showed expected positive relations of OJ with patients' satisfaction, trust in clinicians and global perceived justice. These results point out the importance of health care customers' perceived organizational justice in the explanation of health care dynamics. The scale has desirable psychometric properties and shows adequate validity, contributing to the potential development of the area. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	McAvinchey, C				McAvinchey, Caoimhe			Coming of age: arts practice with older people in private and domestic spaces	RIDE-THE JOURNAL OF APPLIED THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						older people; private spaces; unusual labour; social relations		Britain's ageing population reflects an international trend - more people are living for longer. Whilst government grapples with the economic and social impact of this demographic revolution, social justice and equality charities advocate for greater recognition of the contribution that an ageing population brings to society, not just the health, welfare and pension problems to be addressed because of it. In the United Kingdom, there has been, over the past decade, a significant expansion in arts practice that specifically engages with older people as participants. There is a rich array of work in public spaces, from community centres to cultural collection contexts such as museums, libraries and heritage sites. This work has some degree of visibility with research evidencing its contribution to the cultural and social landscape of people's lives, having considerable health and well-being benefits that, in turn, are of economic benefit to society. However, this work in public spaces is only available to people who can physically access it. Within an ageing population there has been a significant rise in the number of people over 75 who are living alone or in residential care, increasingly isolated because of physical and mental health problems, a gap in support networks and a lack of confidence in their ability to navigate the world beyond the domestic. Can and should cultural organisations step beyond group projects in public venues to develop one-to-one work in intimate, private and domestic spaces? What are the implications of arts practice in people's home or private rooms in residential care? What new understandings do they reveal about innovations in form, artistic labour practices and cultural organisations' capacity? This article examines these questions through two projects, This is My Life (2007-2008) and Pen Friends (2006-2009), developed by Magic Me, a London-based organisation specialising in intergenerational arts practice and work with older people. Mayoria de edad: Practica artistica con personas mayores en espacios privados y domesticos.El envejecimiento de la poblacion Britanica refleja una moda internacional - mas gente vive durante mas tiempo. Mientras el gobierno lidia con el impacto economico y social de esta revolucion democratica, la justicia social y la equidad abogan por un mayor reconocimiento a la contribucion que una poblacion envejecida reporta a la sociedad, no solo remitirse a los problemas de salud, bienestar y pensiones debido a esto. En el Reino Unido, ha habido, en la ultima decada, una expansion significativa en la practica artistica que implica a las personas mayores como participantes. Hay una rica variedad de trabajo en espacios publicos, desde centros comunitarios a contextos de colecciones culturales tales como museos, bibliotecas y patrimonios de la humanidad. Este trabajo posee un cierto grado de visibilidad con una investigacion acreditando su contribucion al panorama social y cultural de la vida de las gentes, obteniendo considerables beneficios para la salud y el bienestar que, a su vez, son un beneficio economico para la sociedad. Sin embargo, este trabajo es espacios publicos es solo disponible para personas que puedan acceder a ellos fisicamente. Con una poblacion que envejece ha habido un aumento significativo del numero de personas mayores de 75 que viven solas o con atencion domiciliaria, cada vez mas aislados a causa de sus problemas de salud fisica o mental, una brecha en las redes de apoyo y una falta de confianza en su capacidad de navegar por el mundo mas alla de lo casero. Pueden y deben las organizaciones culturales ir mas alla de los proyectos grupales en espacios publicos para desarrollar trabajos individuales en espacios intimos, privados y caseros? Cuales son las implicaciones de la practica de arte en casa de las gentes o en habitaciones privadas con atencion domiciliaria? Que nuevos conocimientos revelan sobre las innovaciones en la forma, en las practicas laborables artisticas y en la capacidad de las organizaciones culturales?

J	Lo, AK				Lo, Alvis K.			Do Declines in Bank Health Affect Borrowers' Voluntary Disclosures? Evidence from International Propagation of Banking Shocks	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article							MANAGEMENT EARNINGS FORECASTS; INFORMATION ASYMMETRY; LENDING RELATIONSHIPS; FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION; INTERACTION TERMS; CONFERENCE CALLS; CREDIT SPREADS; CHOICE; EQUITY; CRISIS	I examine whether declines in banks' financial health affect their borrowers' disclosures. Prior studies indicate that, in relationship lending, banks and borrowers rely on private communication, rather than public disclosures, to resolve information asymmetries. When banking relationships are threatened, borrowers must turn to new funding sources, inducing them to reconsider their disclosure policies. This paper predicts that borrowers, whose banking relationships are threatened by declining bank health, change their public disclosures of forward-looking information. Using the emerging-market financial crises in the late 1990s as shocks to the health of certain U.S. banks, I find that affected banks' U.S. borrowers increase both the quantity and informativeness of their management forecasts following these shocks compared to borrowers of unaffected banks. The results are similar using conference calls or the length of the Management's Discussion and Analysis section as alternative proxies for voluntary disclosure. Overall, these results provide new insights into the impact of availability of relationship lending on firms' disclosure choices.

Speculations and ethical concerns in the conduct of outsourced clinical trials in India	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						India; Globalization; Emerging economies; Clinical trials; Outsourcing; Informed consent; Ethics	INFORMED-CONSENT; GLOBALIZATION	The globalization of biopharmaceutical clinical trials and their offshore outsourcing, from the West to low and middle-income countries, has come under increasing scrutiny from academic scholars, practitioners, regulatory agencies and the media. This article reports the results of a study conducted in Bangalore and Hyderabad between 2007 and 2009, to elicit the perspectives of stakeholders, concerning media representations of their work and the ethical issues that emanate from their engagement in the clinical trials enterprise. In acknowledging the inherently problematic nature of the outsourcing of clinical trials to low income countries, I argue that the practice of not prioritizing research on diseases that are most prevalent among communities, from which subjects are recruited, demands a coordinated and sustained critique. I propose that the critical discourse on the outsourcing of clinical trials should not only emphasize the perils of this practice, but also address some broader issues of equity and distributive justice that determine people's access to basic health care in low income countries. Close attention to the specific context of clinical trials in an increasingly neoliberal medical and health environment in emerging economies such as India can provide critical insights into the on-the-ground complexities and challenges of outsourced global clinical trials.

This public health problem is growing rapidly in developing countries where oral health services are limited. Significant proportions of people are underserved; insufficient oral health care is either due to low availability and accessibility of oral health care or because oral health care is costly. In all countries, the poor and disadvantaged population groups are heavily affected by a high burden of oral disease compared to well-off people. Promotion of oral health and prevention of oral diseases must be provided through financially fair primary health care and public health intervention. Integrated approaches are the most cost-effective and realistic way to close the gap in oral health between rich and poor. The World Health Organization (WHO) Oral Health Programme will work with the newly established WHO Collaborating Centre, Kuwait University, to strengthen the development of appropriate models for primary oral health care.

The Research Agenda on Oral Health Inequalities: The IADR-GOHIRA Initiative	MEDICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Common risk factors; Health inequalities; Health promotion; Non-communicable disease; Prevention; Social determinants of health	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS	The World Health Organization asserts that oral health is a basic human right, yet this is a right enjoyed by few. Oral disease is a major problem in high-income countries, where the cost of treating oral diseases often exceeds that for major non-communicable diseases. In low-to-middle income countries, oral diseases are a severe and growing public health problem. Furthermore, major inequalities exist both within and between countries in terms of disease severity and prevalence, and major social gradients exist in the prevalence of oral disease. The International Association for Dental Research (IADR) has responded to the challenge of poor oral health and oral health inequalities through the Global Oral Health Inequalities: the Research Agenda (GOHIRA) initiative. In a Call to Action it has set out the priorities for research that can lead to a reduction in oral health inequalities. Three key challenges have been identified, namely gaps in knowledge and an insufficient focus on social policy, the separation of oral health from general health, and inadequate evidence-based data. Ten key research priorities have been identified with due regard to the differing needs of the variety of global health care systems, and a set of prioritized outcomes and a timeline for implementation have been defined. In the wider context of the proposals set out above, five immediate priorities for action have been proposed. (C) 2014 S.

Spatial Cluster Detection of Air Pollution Exposure Inequities across the United States	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL INEQUALITY; HEALTH; MORTALITY; DISPARITIES; MODIFIERS; BENZENE; JUSTICE; CONTEXT; BURDEN; MODELS	Air quality is known to be a key factor in affecting the wellbeing and quality of life of the general populous and there is a large body of knowledge indicating that certain underrepresented groups may be overexposed to air pollution. Therefore, a more precise understanding of air pollution exposure as a driving cause of health disparities between and among ethnic and racial groups is necessary. Utilizing 52,613 urban census tracts across the United States, this study investigates age, racial, educational attainment and income differences in exposure to benzene pollution in 1999 as a case. The study examines spatial clustering patterns of these inequities using logistic regression modeling and spatial autocorrelation methods such as the Global Moran's I index and the Anselin Local Moran's I index. Results show that the age groups of 0 to 14 and those over 60 years old, individuals with less than 12 years of education, racial minorities including Blacks, American Indians, Asians, some other races, and those with low income were exposed to higher levels of benzene pollution in some census tracts. Clustering analyses stratified by age, education, and race revealed a clear case of disparities in spatial distribution of exposure to benzene pollution across the entire United States. For example, people aged less than 4 years from the western south and the Pacific coastal areas exhibit statistically significant clusters. The findings confirmed that there are geographical-location based disproportionate pattern of exposures to benzene air pollution by various socio-demographic factors across the United States and this type of disproportionate exposure pattern can be effectively detected by a spatial autocorrelation based cluster analysis method. It is suggested that there is a clear and present need for programs and services that will reduce inequities and ultimately improve environmental conditions for all underrepresented groups in the United States.

The objective of this study was to undertake a situation analysis of the Zambian eye health system and assess VISION 2020 process indicators on human resources, equipment and infrastructure. Methods: All eye health care providers were surveyed to determine location, financing sources, human resources and equipment. Key informants were interviewed regarding levels of service provision, management and leadership in the sector. Policy papers were reviewed. A health system dynamics framework was used to analyse findings. Results: During 2011, 74 facilities provided eye care in Zambia; 39% were public, 37% private for-profit and 24% owned by Non-Governmental Organizations. Private facilities were solely located in major cities. A total of 191 people worked in eye care; 18 of these were ophthalmologists and eight cataract surgeons, equivalent to 0.34 and 0.15 per 250,000 population, respectively. VISION 2020 targets for inpatient beds and surgical theatres were met in six out of nine provinces, but human resources and spectacles manufacturing workshops were below target in every province. Inequalities in service provision between urban and rural areas were substantial. Conclusion: Shortage and maldistribution of human resources, lack of routine monitoring and inadequate financing mechanisms are the root causes of underperformance in the Zambian eye health system, which hinder the ability to achieve the VISION 2020 goals. We recommend that all VISION 2020 process indicators are evaluated simultaneously as these are not individually useful for monitoring progress.

BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						Millennium development goals; Universal health coverage; Right to health		The present Millennium Development Goals are set to expire in 2015 and their next iteration is now being discussed within the international community. With regards to health, the World Health Organization proposes universal health coverage as a 'single overarching health goal' for the next iteration of the Millennium Development Goals. The present Millennium Development Goals have been criticised for being 'duplicative' or even 'competing alternatives' to international human rights law. The question then arises, if universal health coverage would indeed become the single overarching health goal, replacing the present health-related Millennium Development Goals, would that be more consistent with the right to health? The World Health Organization seems to have anticipated the question, as it labels universal health coverage as "by definition, a practical expression of the concern for health equity and the right to health". Rather than waiting for the negotiations to unfold, we thought it would be useful to verify this contention, using a comparative normative analysis. We found that - to be a practical expression of the right to health - at least one element is missing in present authoritative definitions of universal health coverage: a straightforward confirmation that international assistance is essential, not optional. But universal health coverage is a 'work in progress'. A recent proposal by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network proposed universal health coverage with a set of targets, including a target for international assistance, which would turn universal health coverage into a practical expression of the right to health care.

A notable exception is the apparent concentration of HIV/AIDS among wealthier individuals. This paper uses data from the Demographic Health Surveys and AIDS Indicator Surveys to examine socioeconomic inequalities in HIV/AIDS prevalence in 24 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, the region that accounts for two-thirds of the global HIV/AIDS burden. Methods: The relative and generalized concentration indices (RC and GC) were used to quantify wealth-based socioeconomic inequalities in HIV/AIDS prevalence for the total adult population (aged 15-49), for men and women, and in urban and rural areas in each country. Further, we decomposed the RC and GC indices to identify the determinants of socioeconomic inequalities in HIV/AIDS prevalence in each country. Results: Our findings demonstrated that HIV/AIDS was concentrated among higher SES individuals in the majority of SSA countries. Swaziland and Senegal were the only countries in the region where HIV/AIDS was concentrated among individuals living in poorer households. Stratified analyses by gender showed HIV/AIDS was generally concentrated among wealthier men and women. In some countries, including Kenya, Lesotho Uganda, and Zambia, HIV/AIDS was concentrated among the poor in urban areas but among wealthier adults in rural areas. Decomposition analyses indicated that, besides wealth itself (median = 49%, interquartile range [IQR] = 90%), urban residence (median = 54%, IQR = 81%) was the most important factor contributing to the concentration of HIV/AIDS among wealthier participants in SSA countries. Conclusions: Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms explaining the concentration of HIV/AIDS among wealthier individuals and urban residents in SSA. Higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS could be indicative of better care and survival among wealthier individuals and urban adults, or reflect greater risk behaviour and incidence. Moreover, differential findings across countries suggest that effective intervention efforts for reducing the burden of HIV/AIDS in the SSA should be country specific.

To measure the impact of shelter intervention and protection orders on the mental health functioning, resiliency, and further abuse of documented and undocumented immigrant women and their children in Houston, Texas, United States. Methods. A prospective cohort study initiated in 2011 examined a subsample of 106 immigrant mothers, primarily from Mexico and Central America, and evaluated their functioning with a battery of 13 well-established instruments as they accessed either shelter or justice services; followed-up was conducted 4 months later to measure improvement. Data were analyzed with a series of repeated measures 2 x 2 x 2 factorial analysis of variance tests. Results. Large effect size improvements were observed in abused immigrant women's mental health, resiliency, and safety, regardless of whether the intervention accessed was safe shelter or justice services, and regardless of duration of shelter stay and whether or not a protection order was issued. Similarly, large effect size improvements were observed in child functioning, independent of which type of intervention, the duration of shelter stay, or the issuance of a protection order. Conclusions. Accessing protective services has the potential to improve the health of immigrant women and their children, regardless of documentation status. Global policy for improved access and acceptability of shelter and justice services is essential to promote immigrant women's safety and to maximize functioning of women and children.

J	Pega, F; Valentine, NB; Matheson, D; Rasanathan, K				Pega, Frank; Valentine, Nicole B.; Matheson, Don; Rasanathan, Kumanan			Public social monitoring reports and their effect on a policy programme aimed at addressing the social determinants of health to improve health equity in New Zealand	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						New Zealand; Health policy; Social determinants of health; Health equity; Social monitoring; Social reporting	INDICATORS; INEQUALITIES; ALCOHOL; DRUG	The important role that monitoring plays in advancing global health is well established. However, the role of social monitoring as a tool for addressing social determinants of health (SDH) and health equity-focused policies remains under-researched. This paper assesses the extent and ways in which New Zealand's (NZ) Social Reports (SRs) supported a SDH- and health equity-oriented policy programme nationally over the 2000-2008 period by documenting the SRs' history and assessing its impact on policies across sectors in government and civil society. We conducted key-informant interviews with five senior policy-makers and an e-mail survey with 24 government and civil society representatives on SRs' history and policy impact. We identified common themes across these data and classified them accordingly to assess the intensity of the reports' use and their impact on SDH- and health equity-focused policies. Bibliometric analyses of government publications and media items were undertaken to empirically assess SRs' impact on government and civil society. SRs in NZ arose out of the role played by government as the "benevolent social welfare planner" and an understanding of the necessity of economic and social security for "progress". The SRs were linked to establishing a government-wide programme aimed at reducing inequalities. They have been used moderately to highly in central and local government and in civil society, both within and outside the health sector, but have neither entered public treasury and economic development departments nor the commercial sector. The SRs have not reached the more universal status of economic indicators. However, they have had some success at raising awareness of, and have stimulated isolated action on, SDH. The NZ case suggests that national-level social monitoring provides a valuable tool for raising awareness of SDH across government and civil society. A number of strategies could improve social reports' effectiveness in stimulating action on SDH. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Investment in interventions to improve early life experiences requires empirical evidence on levels of childhood adversity and the proportion of HHBs potentially avoided should such adversity be addressed. Methods: A nationally representative survey of English residents aged 18 to 69 (n = 3,885) was undertaken during the period April to July 2013. Individuals were categorized according to the number of ACEs experienced. Modeling identified the proportions of HHBs (early sexual initiation, unintended teenage pregnancy, smoking, binge drinking, drug use, violence victimization, violence perpetration, incarceration, poor diet, low levels of physical exercise) independently associated with ACEs at national population levels. Results: Almost half (47%) of individuals experienced at least one of the nine ACEs. Prevalence of childhood sexual, physical, and verbal abuse was 6.3%, 14.8%, and 18.2% respectively (population-adjusted). After correcting for sociodemographics, ACE counts predicted all HHBs, e. g. (0 versus 4+ ACEs, adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals)): smoking 3.29 (2.54 to 4.27); violence perpetration 7.71 (4.90 to 12.14); unintended teenage pregnancy 5.86 (3.93 to 8.74). Modeling suggested that 11.9% of binge drinking, 13.6% of poor diet, 22.7% of smoking, 52.0% of violence perpetration, 58.7% of heroin/crack cocaine use, and 37.6% of unintended teenage pregnancy prevalence nationally could be attributed to ACEs. Conclusions: Stable and protective childhoods are critical factors in the development of resilience to health-harming behaviors in England. Interventions to reduce ACEs are available and sustainable, with nurturing childhoods supporting the adoption of health-benefiting behaviors and ultimately the provision of positive childhood environments for future generations.

Methods: Cross-sectional survey of 242 young people serving CBOs and 273 serving custodial orders in Victoria in 2002-2003. Validated measures included the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for substance dependence, Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire for depression, and Psychosis Screening Questionnaire for psychosis symptoms. Prevalence estimates were adjusted for sampling bias and age-and sex-adjusted for between-group comparisons. Prevalence estimates were applied to 2010-2011 Victorian youth justice data to estimate annual frequencies at the state level. Results: The prevalence of substance dependence, poor mental health, and risky sexual behavior was high in both groups. Age-and sex-adjusted prevalence estimates were generally higher among those serving custodial orders; however, extrapolating prevalence estimates to statewide youth justice data generally resulted in higher estimated annual frequencies among CBOs. For example, the estimated prevalence of any substance dependence was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60-72) in those serving custodial orders and 34% (95% CI, 26-42) in CBOs, but the estimated frequency of substance dependence in CBOs in 2010-2011 was 970 (95% CI, 750-1,180), compared with 490 (95% CI, 450-530) in those serving a custodial order. Conclusions: There is a compelling case for scaling up health services for young offenders in custody and in the community, and for routinely monitoring the health of young offenders serving custodial and community orders.

How best to respond to the rising prevalence of hypertension in resource-deprived settings is a topic of ongoing public-health debate and discussion. In low-income and middle-income countries, socioeconomic inequality and cultural factors play a role both in the development of risk factors and in the access to care. In Europe, cultural barriers and poor communication between health systems and migrants may limit migrants from receiving appropriate prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. To use more efficiently resources available and to make treatment cost-effective at the patient level, cardiovascular risk approach is now recommended. In 2011, The European Society of Hypertension established a Working Group on 'Hypertension and Cardiovascular risk in low resource settings', which brought together cardiologists, diabetologists, nephrologists, clinical trialists, epidemiologists, economists, and other stakeholders to review current strategies for cardiovascular risk assessment in population studies in low-income and middle-income countries, their limitations, possible improvements, and future interests in screening programs. This report summarizes current evidence and presents highlights of unmet needs.

J	McIntyre, D				McIntyre, Diane			Celebrating the work of Gavin Mooney: Inclusiveness and involvement in global and public health issues	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Social determinants; Indigenous populations; Community preferences; Global health; Globalization	EQUITY	This paper considers Gavin Mooney's contributions to the research literature on inclusiveness in global and public health issues. Much of his contribution in this area stems from engaging with Indigenous people, which cemented his conviction that it is important to recognise the heterogeneity of groups in society, especially in relation to cultural differences. He believed that in order to develop appropriate equitable and efficient health and related policies, the preferences of citizens should be elicited. While this could feed into very specific policy decisions, such as how to allocate available resources within a particular community, more generally, community preferences should determine the core values that underpin a health system. He proposed that these values be documented in a 'constitution' and serve as the basis on which policy-makers and health managers make decisions. Preference elicitation has value in itself, as procedural justice allows for self-determination and contributes to empowerment. Further, engagement by citizens in deliberative processes can overcome polarisation. Health systems themselves, if developed as social institutions, can influence the nature of society and contribute to greater unity. Mooney raised similar concerns about policies arising from mono-cultural global perspectives and argued that, whether at the national or global level, values for health systems should be based on community preferences. He particularly highlighted the unequal distribution of benefits of neoliberal globalisation as the cause of growing health and wealth inequalities globally. There is resonance between Mooney's views on these issues and some of the contributions to the post-2015 development agenda debates. While it is unlikely that we have reached a point where the stranglehold of neo-liberal governments on key global institutions will be broken, the current debates nevertheless present an important window of opportunity to struggle for shifts in the global political economy. Current debates about universal coverage also provide a critical opportunity to move towards health systems that are built on values determined by citizens and are social institutions that build solidarity, redress inequalities and unite fractured societies.

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Conditions in Kenyan Rural Schools: Are Schools Meeting the Needs of Menstruating Girls?	WATER			English	Article						school; education; children; water sanitation and hygiene; NGOs; Africa; Kenya; menstruation	CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED TRIAL; NYANZA PROVINCE; WESTERN KENYA; SAFE WATER; HEALTH; IMPACT; PROGRAM; RISK; EXPERIENCES; PREVENTION	Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs in African schools have received increased attention, particularly around the potential impact of poor menstrual hygiene management (MHM) on equity for girls' education. This study was conducted prior to a menstrual feasibility study in rural Kenya, to examine current WASH in primary schools and the resources available for menstruating schoolgirls. Cross-sectional surveys were performed in 62 primary schools during unannounced visits. Of these, 60% had handwashing water, 13% had washing water in latrines for menstruating girls, and 2% had soap. Latrines were structurally sound and 16% were clean. Most schools (84%) had separate latrines for girls, but the majority (77%) had no lock. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) supported WASH in 76% of schools. Schools receiving WASH interventions were more likely to have: cleaner latrines (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.5; 95% Confidence Intervals [CI] 1.0, 2.1), handwashing facilities (RR 1.6, CI 1.1, 2.5), handwashing water (RR 2.7; CI 1.4, 5.2), and water in girls' latrines (RR 4.0; CI 1.4, 11.6). Schools continue to lack essential WASH facilities for menstruating girls.

Educational Inequalities in Obesity among Mexican Women: Time-Trends from 1988 to 2012	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BODY-MASS-INDEX; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; UNITED-STATES; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; US ADULTS; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; OVERWEIGHT; INCOME; WEIGHT	Background: Obesity is one of the leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. Trends in educational inequalities in obesity prevalence among Mexican women have not been analysed systematically to date. Methods: Data came from four nationally representative surveys (1988, 1999, 2006, and 2012) of a total of 51 220 nonpregnant women aged 20 to 49. Weight and height were measured during home visits. Education level (higher education, high school, secondary, primary or less) was self-reported. We analysed trends in relative and absolute educational inequalities in obesity prevalence separately for urban and rural areas. Results: Nationally, age-standardised obesity prevalence increased from 9.3% to 33.7% over 25 years to 2012. Obesity prevalence was inversely associated with education level in urban areas at all survey waves. In rural areas, obesity prevalence increased markedly but there was no gradient with education level at any survey. The relative index of inequality in urban areas declined over the period (2.87 (95%CI: 1.94, 4.25) in 1988, 1.55 (95%CI: 1.33, 1.80) in 2012, trend p<0.001). Obesity increased 5.92 fold (95%CI: 4.03, 8.70) among urban women with higher education in the period 1988-2012 compared to 3.23 fold (95%CI: 2.88, 3.63) for urban women with primary or no education. The slope index of inequality increased in urban areas from 1988 to 2012. Over 0.5 M cases would be avoided if the obesity prevalence of women with primary or less education was the same as for women with higher education. Conclusions: The expected inverse association between education and obesity was observed in urban areas of Mexico. The declining trend in relative educational inequalities in obesity was due to a greater increase in obesity prevalence among higher educated women. In rural areas there was no social gradient in the association between education level and obesity across the four surveys.

The objective of the study was to quantify the cancer burden related to social deprivation by identifying the cancer sites linked to socioeconomic status and measuring the proportion of cases associated with social deprivation. Methods: The study population comprised 68 967 cases of cancer diagnosed between 1997 and 2009 in Normandy and collected by the local registries. The social environment was assessed at an aggregated level using the European Deprivation Index (EDI). The association between incidence and socioeconomic status was assessed by a Bayesian Poisson model and the excess of cases was calculated with the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF). Results: For lung, lips-mouth-pharynx and unknown primary sites, a higher incidence in deprived was observed for both sexes. The same trend was observed in males for bladder, liver, esophagus, larynx, central nervous system and gall-bladder and in females for cervix uteri. The largest part of the incidence associated with deprivation was found for cancer of gall-bladder (30.1%), lips-mouth-pharynx (26.0%), larynx (23.2%) and esophagus (19.6%) in males and for unknown primary sites (18.0%) and lips-mouth-pharynx (12.7%) in females. For prostate cancer and melanoma in males, the sites where incidence increased with affluence, the part associated with affluence was respectively 9.6% and 14.0%. Conclusions: Beyond identifying cancer sites the most associated with social deprivation, this kind of study points to health care policies that could be undertaken to reduce social inequalities.

This priority was identified by a disability advocacy organization in Lusaka, Zambia, where the prevalence of HIV and of disability is each approximately 15%. The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions and experiences of HIV-related health services for PWDs who are also living with HIV in Lusaka, Zambia. Methods: This qualitative, interpretive study involved in-depth, semi-structured, one-on-one interviews with two groups of participants in Lusaka, Zambia: 21 PWDs who had become HIV-positive, and 11 people working in HIV and/or disability. PWDs had physical, hearing, visual and/or intellectual impairments. Interviews were conducted in English, Nyanja, Bemba or Zambian sign language. Descriptive and thematic analyses were conducted by a multidisciplinary, international research team. Results: Participants described their experiences with HIV-related health services in terms of the challenges they faced. In particular, they encountered three main challenges while seeking care and treatment: (1) disability-related discrimination heightened when seeking HIV services, (2) communication barriers and related concerns with confidentiality, and (3) movement and mobility challenges related to seeking care and collecting antiretroviral therapy. These experiences were further shaped by participants' profound concerns about poverty and unmet basic needs. Discussion: This study demonstrates how PWDs who are HIV-positive have the same HIV care, treatment and support needs as able-bodied counterparts, but face avoidable barriers to care. Many challenges mirror concerns identified with HIV prevention, suggesting that efforts to promote inclusion and reduce stigma could have widespread benefits. Conclusions: Despite the growing body of literature on increased risk of exposure to HIV among HIV-negative PWDs, this is the first published study to examine perceptions of testing, treatment and other HIV services for PWDs who have become HIV-positive. Findings reveal far-reaching opportunities for improving the quality of care for this population.

The impact of stages of chronic pain adjusted for disease load on societal burden has not been assessed in population surveys. Methods: A cross-sectional survey with 4360 people aged >= 14 years representative of the German population was conducted. Measures obtained included demographic variables, presence of chronic pain (based on the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain), chronic pain stages (by chronic pain grade questionnaire), disease load (by self-reported comorbidity questionnaire) and societal burden (by self-reported number of doctor visits, nights spent in hospital and days of sick leave/disability in the previous 12 months, and by current unemployment). Associations between chronic pain stages with societal burden, adjusted for demographic variables and disease load, were tested by Poisson and logistic regression analyses. Results: 2508 responses were received. 19.4% (95% CI 16.8% to 22.0%) of participants met the criteria of chronic non-disabling non-malignant pain. 7.4% (95% CI 5.0% to 9.9%) met criteria for chronic disabling non-malignant pain. Compared with no chronic pain, the rate ratio (RR) of days with sick leave/disability was 1.6 for non-disabling pain and 6.4 for disabling pain. After adjusting for age and disease load, the RRs increased to 1.8 and 6.8. The RR of doctor visits was 2.5 for non-disabling pain and 4.5 for disabling pain if compared with no chronic pain. After adjusting for age and disease load, the RR fell to 1.7 and 2.6. The RR of days in hospital was 2.7 for non-disabling pain and 11.7 for disabling pain if compared with no chronic pain. After adjusting for age and disease load, the RR fell to 1.5 and 4.0. Unemployment was predicted by lower educational level (Odds Ratio OR 3.27 [95% CI 1.70-6.29]), disabling pain (OR 3.30 [95% CI 1.76-6.21]) and disease load (OR 1.70 [95% CI 1.41-2.05]). Conclusion: Chronic pain stages, but also disease load and societal inequalities contributed to societal burden. Pain measurements in epidemiology research of chronic pain should include chronic pain grades and disease load.

We sought to catalogue the types of indicators being used to evaluate health RCS and to assess potential gaps in quality and coverage. Methods: We purposively selected twelve evaluations to maximize diversity in health RCS, funders, countries, and approaches to evaluation. We explored the quality of the indicators and extracted them into a matrix across individual, institutional, and national/regional/network levels, based on a matrix in the ESSENCE Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation framework. We synthesized across potential impact pathways (activities to outputs to outcomes) and iteratively checked our findings with key health RCS evaluation stakeholders. Results: Evaluations varied remarkably in the strengths of their evaluation designs. The validity of indicators and potential biases were documented in a minority of reports. Indicators were primarily of activities, outputs, or outcomes, with little on their inter-relationships. Individual level indicators tended to be more quantitative, comparable, and attentive to equity considerations. Institutional and national-international level indicators were extremely diverse. Although linkage of activities through outputs to outcomes within evaluations was limited, across the evaluations we were able to construct potential pathways of change and assemble corresponding indicators. Conclusions: Opportunities for improving health RCS evaluations include work on indicator measurement properties and development of indicators which better encompass relationships with knowledge users. Greater attention to evaluation design, prospective indicator measurement, and systematic linkage of indicators in keeping with theories of change could provide more robust evidence on outcomes of health RCS.

Using geospatial analysis of premises records, we identified 8861 Machine Zones which were areas with a 400 meter radius around gambling machine venue and 384 High Density Machine Zones (HDMZ) with 1 or more gambling machine per hectare. There was a significant correlation between machine density and socio-economic deprivation. HDMZs had greater levels of income deprivation, more economically inactive people and a younger age profile than other areas; 37 % of those living in HDMZs were economically inactive compared with 33 % of those in non-machine areas. HDMZs were in seaside locations but also New Towns or satellite towns to major urban areas. Area affluence explains some of this pattern; of the New Towns with HDMZs, 78 % were in New Towns with a high proportion of low income areas. We therefore concluded that the distribution of gambling machines in Great Britain, in line with other international jurisdictions, displays a significant association with areas of socio-economic deprivation. The profile of the resident population living in HDMZs mirrors the profile of those most at-risk of experiencing harm from gambling. This spatial pattern has important implications for assessing the relationship between gambling availability and gambling-related harm, and for the future development of policy, harm-prevention and treatment strategies.

As of December 2009, a policy change means that heart stents are covered by public health insurance, whereas previously they were not. This policy change provides us an opportunity to study how a change in insurance benefit affected the quantity and quality of hospital services. The new policy introduced incentives for both patients and providers: it encourages patient demand for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) services and stent use (moral hazard effect), and discourages hospital supply due to the financial pressures of the global cap (provider gaming effect). If the provider's gaming effect dominates the moral hazard effect, actual utilisation and costs might go down, and vice versa. Our hypothesis is that patients in the higher reimbursement groups will have fewer PCIs and lower inpatient costs. We aimed to examine the impact of health insurance benefit design on PCI and stent use, and on inpatient costs and out-of-pocket expenses for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Shanghai. We included 720 patients with AMI (467 before the benefit change and 253 after) from a large teaching tertiary hospital in Shanghai. Data were collected via review of hospital medical charts, and from the hospital billing database. Patient information collected included demographic characteristics, medical history and procedure information. All patients were categorised into four groups according to their actual reimbursement ratio: high (90-100 %), moderate (80-90 %), low (0-80 %) and none (self-paid patients). Multiple regression and difference-in-difference (DID) models were used to investigate the impacts of the health insurance benefit design on PCI and stent use, and on total hospital costs and patients' out-of-pocket expenses. After the change in insurance benefit policy, compared with the self-paid group, PCI rates for the moderate and low reimbursement groups increased by 22.2 and 20.3 %, respectively, and decreased by 48.7 % for the high reimbursement group. The change in insurance benefit policy had no impact on the number of stents used. The high reimbursement group had the lowest hospital costs, and the low reimbursement group had the highest hospital costs, regardless of benefit policy change. The general linear regression results showed that the high reimbursement group had higher total hospital costs than the self-paid group, but were the lowest among all reimbursement groups after the benefit policy change (DIDh = 1,202.21, P = 0.0096). There were no significant changes in the other two groups, and there were no differences in the out-of-pocket costs across any of the insured groups. Our results suggest that the benefit policy change did not impact life-saving procedures or reduce patients' burden of disease among AMI patients. The effect of 'provider gaming' was the strongest for the high reimbursement group as a result of the global budget cap pressure. The current FFS with a global budget cap is of low efficiency for cost containment and equity improvement. Payment method reforms with alignment of financial incentives to improve provider behaviour in practicing evidence-based medicine are needed in China.

Methods In a global survey, experts on contraception were invited to identify and rank the types of research that would be needed - and the knowledge gaps that would have to be filled - to reduce the unmet need for family planning in the next decade. The experts were then asked to score the research on a given topic in terms of the likelihood of its leading to an intervention that would: (i) be deliverable, affordable and sustainable; (ii) substantially reduce the unmet need for contraceptives; (iii) be effective and efficient in improving health systems; (iv) be ethically implemented; and (v) improve equity in the target population. The overall scores were then ranked. Findings Most of the topics that received the 15 highest scores fell into three categories: implementation of policies in family planning; the integration of services to address barriers to contraceptive use; and interventions targeted at underserved groups, such as adolescents. Conclusion Experts on contraception gave top priority ranking to research on improving the implementation and integration of health services and on strengthening the health systems supporting family planning services. The results of the exercise may help decision-makers, researchers and funding agencies to develop a clear and focused approach to satisfying the global need for family planning and reach the target set by the Family Planning 2020 initiative.

GLOBAL VARIANCE IN FEMALE POPULATION HEIGHT: THE INFLUENCE OF EDUCATION, INCOME, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, LIFE EXPECTANCY, MORTALITY AND GENDER INEQUALITY IN 96 NATIONS	JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; ADULT HEIGHT; VARIABLE PREFERENCES; WOMENS PREFERENCES; SECULAR TRENDS; STATURE; SIZE; CHILDREN	Human height is a heritable trait that is known to be influenced by environmental factors and general standard of living. Individual and population stature is correlated with health, education and economic achievement. Strong sexual selection pressures for stature have been observed in multiple diverse populations, however; there is significant global variance in gender equality and prohibitions on female mate selection. This paper explores the contribution of general standard of living and gender inequality to the variance in global female population heights. Female population heights of 96 nations were culled from previously published sources and public access databases. Factor analysis with United Nations international data on education rates, life expectancy, incomes, maternal and childhood mortality rates, ratios of gender participation in education and politics, the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) was run. Results indicate that population heights vary more closely with gender inequality than with population health, income or education.				quentinjmark@gmail.com							101	6	7	1	23	CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS	NEW YORK	32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA	0021-9320	1469-7599		J BIOSOC SCI	J.

This study examines convergence hypothesis for health and health inequalities across major Indian states, using both standard and cutting-edge convergence metrics. The findings lend support to the convergence in average health status among the states and the socioeconomic group of India, examined through select health indicators. However, results also suggest a setback in convergence in decline of health inequalities in recent times, particularly in life expectancy at birth, child immunization and underweight. Evidence signals that from the late 1990s, convergence in decline of health inequalities are replaced by emerging divergence. This paper contributes to health policy and planning by identifying areas where, India needs to work to achieve efficiency with equity in health status across geographical divisions and social groups.

Does the design and implementation of proven innovations for delivering basic primary health care services in rural communities fit the urban setting: the case of Ghana's Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS)	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Community-based health planning and service; Primary Health Care; CHPS Milestones; Urban Health; Health Policy; Ghana	NAVRONGO EXPERIMENT; IMPACT; DISTRICT; PROGRAM; EQUITY; PILOT	Background: Rapid urban population growth is of global concern as it is accompanied with several new health challenges. The urban poor who reside in informal settlements are more vulnerable to these health challenges. Lack of formal government public health facilities for the provision of health care is also a common phenomenon among communities inhabited by the urban poor. To help ameliorate this situation, an innovative urban primary health system was introduced in urban Ghana, based on the milestones model developed with the rural Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) system. This paper provides an overview of innovative experiences adapted while addressing these urban health issues, including the process of deriving constructive lessons needed to inform discourse on the design and implementation of the sustainable Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) model as a response to urban health challenges in Southern Ghana. Methods: This research was conducted during the six-month pilot of the urban CHPS programme in two selected areas acting as the intervention and control arms of the design. Daily routine data were collected based on milestones initially delineated for the rural CHPS model in the control communities whilst in the intervention communities, some modifications were made to the rural milestones. Results: The findings from the implementation activities revealed that many of the best practices derived from the rural CHPS experiment could not be transplanted to poor urban settlements due to the unique organizational structures and epidemiological characteristics found in the urban context. For example, constructing Community Health Compounds and residential facilities within zones, a central component to the rural CHPS strategy, proved inappropriate for the urban sector. Night and weekend home visit schedules were initiated to better accommodate urban residents and increase coverage. The breadth of the disease burden of the urban residents also requires a broader expertise and training of the CHOs. Conclusions: Access to improved urban health services remains a challenge. However, current policy guidelines for the implementation of a primary health model based on rural experiences and experimental design requires careful review and modifications to meet the needs of the urban settings.

Cross-national and historical differences in subjective well-being	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Subjective well-being; happiness; life satisfaction; mental health; national differences; historical change	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; HAPPINESS; SATISFACTION; INCOME; WEALTH; DIMENSIONS; COUNTRY; CLIMATE; LEVEL; PREDICTORS	Background There is a growing body of population survey data on national subjective well-being which allows comparisons across countries and across periods. Key issues in this work are as follows. Can response to questions on well-being be meaningfully compared across countries and periods? What social conditions are associated with greater well-being both between countries and across periods? Are there lessons for how global well-being might be improved? This review aims to give an overview of this area and its relevance to psychiatric epidemiology. Methods Systematic searches of the literature were carried out using eight academic databases between August 2012 and January 2013. Results Subjective well-being involves multiple components, including cognitive evaluation of satisfaction with life and emotional state, and these are separable from mental ill health. Although there are difficulties in measuring subjective well-being in comparable ways cross-culturally, there is sufficient evidence of validity to make comparisons meaningful. The subjective well-being of nations increases with income per capita, but gains are smaller in higher-income countries. Other national factors that affect well-being include income inequality, social welfare, individualism, democracy and freedom, social capital and physical health. Conclusions Economic growth of lower-income nations will improve global subjective well-being. However, this needs to be sustainable or it will reduce the well-being of future generations. Higher-income nations need to focus on other determinants of well-being. Research on cross-national well-being suggests a number of directions that may be profitably pursued in psychiatric epidemiology.

Health-risk behaviours in deprived urban neighbourhoods: a comparison between Slovak and Dutch cities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health-risk behaviours; Area deprivation; Socioeconomic inequalities; Urban health	MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; UNEMPLOYMENT; DEPRIVATION; CONSUMPTION; DRINKING; ADULTS	International comparisons of the associations of area-level socioeconomic position (SEP) and health-risk behaviours (HRBs) are for the most part lacking. The aims of this study were to compare Slovakia and the Netherlands regarding differences in the prevalence of HRBs by neighbourhood and individual deprivation, and to determine whether area differences could be explained by the SEP of residents. We obtained data on residents aged 19-64 from Slovak and Dutch cities from the FP7 EURO-URHIS2 project and employed multilevel logistic regression. The association between neighbourhood-level unemployment and HRBs differed between countries. In the Netherlands, the prevalence of almost all HRBs was higher in deprived areas, except for the consumption of fruits and vegetables. These area effects diminished after controlling for individual-level SEP. In Slovakia, no area effects were observed, although Slovak residents showed a higher risk for most HRBs. At the individual level, an inverse SE gradient was found for almost all HRBs in both countries. Local analyses of small area health differences and health determinants are critical for efficient implementation of neighbourhood-based interventions.

J	Bryant, L; Garnham, B				Bryant, Lia; Garnham, Bridget			Economies, ethics and emotions: Farmer distress within the moral economy of agribusiness	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Farmer distress; Ethics; Emotion; Moral economy; Political economy; Agribusiness	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; MENTAL-HEALTH; DROUGHT; SUICIDE; STRESS; MASCULINITIES; EXPERIENCE; INJUSTICE; GROWERS; LIFE	In the international literature farmer stress, mental illness and suicide are linked to economic conditions affecting farm viability that have emerged in relation to the neoliberal transformation, corporatization and globalization of agribusiness juxtaposed with climate change and concerns over environmental sustainability and periodic agricultural crises. Research and scholarship in this area has largely been framed through mental health frameworks informed by positivist and 'psy' discourses that marginalize ethical, political and emotional dynamics that shape farmer distress. At the margins of this dominant discursive framework however, interdisciplinary scholarship is emerging that problematizes farmer distress and suicide. This paper extends and contributes to this body of scholarship through insights derived from critical consideration of the operation of a moral economy in relation to farmer distress. It draws on elements of Andrew Sayer's work, which poses intersections between moral economy, political economy and wellbeing, to analyse empirical data from interviews with Australian wine grape growers experiencing distress. The paper demonstrates that in this case study, emotional distress arises from ethical breaches within social and economic relations between farmers, corporations and the State. In doing so, it brings the ethical and emotional dimensions of economic activity to the fore and thus calls for the problematization of social and political responses to farmer distress and suicide prevention.

Geographical Inequalities in Use of Improved Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation across Sub-Saharan Africa: Mapping and Spatial Analysis of Cross-sectional Survey Data	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT; COMMUNITY INTERVENTION; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; FACIAL CLEANLINESS; GLOBAL BURDEN; 21 REGIONS; TRACHOMA; DISEASE; SCHISTOSOMIASIS; CHOLERA	Background Understanding geographic inequalities in coverage of drinking-water supply and sanitation (WSS) will help track progress towards universal coverage of water and sanitation by identifying marginalized populations, thus helping to control a large number of infectious diseases. This paper uses household survey data to develop comprehensive maps of WSS coverage at high spatial resolution for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Analysis is extended to investigate geographic heterogeneity and relative geographic inequality within countries. Methods and Findings Cluster-level data on household reported use of improved drinking-water supply, sanitation, and open defecation were abstracted from 138 national surveys undertaken from 1991-2012 in 41 countries. Spatially explicit logistic regression models were developed and fitted within a Bayesian framework, and used to predict coverage at the second administrative level (admin2, e.g., district) across SSA for 2012. Results reveal substantial geographical inequalities in predicted use of water and sanitation that exceed urban-rural disparities. The average range in coverage seen between admin2 within countries was 55% for improved drinking water, 54% for use of improved sanitation, and 59% for dependence upon open defecation. There was also some evidence that countries with higher levels of inequality relative to coverage in use of an improved drinking-water source also experienced higher levels of inequality in use of improved sanitation (rural populations r = 0.47, p = 0.002; urban populations r = 0.39, p = 0.01). Results are limited by the quantity of WSS data available, which varies considerably by country, and by the reliability and utility of available indicators. Conclusions This study identifies important geographic inequalities in use of WSS previously hidden within national statistics, confirming the necessity for targeted policies and metrics that reach the most marginalized populations. The presented maps and analysis approach can provide a mechanism for monitoring future reductions in inequality within countries, reflecting priorities of the post-2015 development agenda. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary Editors' Summary Background Access to a safe drinking-water supply (a water source that is protected from contamination) and to adequate sanitation facilities (toilets, improved latrines, and other facilities that prevent people coming into contact with human urine and feces) is essential for good health. Unimproved drinking-water sources and sanitation are responsible for 85% of deaths from diarrhea and 1% of the global burden of disease. They also increase the transmission of parasitic worms and other neglected tropical diseases. In 2000, world leaders set a target of reducing the proportion of the global population without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation to half of the 1990 level by 2015 as part of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 ("Ensure environmental sustainability"; the MDGs are designed to improve the social, economic, and health conditions in the world's poorest countries). Between 1990 and 2010, more than 2 billion people gained access to improved drinking-water sources and 1.8 billion gained access to improved sanitation. In 2011, 89% of the world's population had access to an improved drinking-water supply, 1% above the MDG target, and 64% had access to improved sanitation (the MDG target is 75%). Why Was This Study Done? ? Despite these encouraging figures, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) estimates that, globally, 768 million people relied on unimproved drinking-water sources, 2.5 billion people did not use an improved sanitation facility, and more than 1 billion people (15% of the global population) were defecating in the open in 2011. The JMP estimates for 2011 also reveal national and sub-national inequalities in drinking-water supply and sanitation coverage but a better understanding of geographic inequalities is needed to track progress towards universal coverage of access to improved water and sanitation and to identify the populations that need the most help to achieve this goal. Here, the researchers use cross-sectional household survey data and modern statistical approaches to produce a comprehensive map of the coverage of improved drinking-water supply and improved sanitation at high spatial resolution for sub-Saharan Africa and to investigate geographic inequalities in coverage. Cross-sectional household surveys collect health and other information from households at a single time-point, including data on use of safe water and improved sanitation. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? ? The researchers extracted data on reported household use of an improved drinking-water supply (for example, a piped water supply), improved sanitation facilities (for example, a flushing toilet), and open defecation from 138 national household surveys undertaken between 1991 and 2012 in 41 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. They developed statistical models to fit these data and used the models to estimate coverage at the district (second administrative) level across sub-Saharan Africa for 2012. For ten countries, the estimated coverage of access to improved drinking water at the district level within individual countries ranged from less than 25% to more than 75%. Within-country ranges of a similar magnitude were estimated for coverage of access to improved sanitation (21 countries) and for open defecation (16 countries). Notably, rural households in the districts with the lowest coverage of access to improved water supply and sanitation within a country were 1.5-8 times less likely to access improved drinking water, 2-18 times less likely to access improved sanitation, and 2-80 times more likely to defecate in the open than rural households in districts with the best coverage. Finally, countries with high levels of inequality in improved drinking-water source coverage also experienced high levels of inequality in improved sanitation coverage. What Do These Findings Mean? ? These findings identify important geographic inequalities in the coverage of access to improved water sources and sanitation that were previously hidden within national statistics. The accuracy of these findings depends on the accuracy of the data on water supplies and sanitation provided by household surveys, on the researchers' definitions for improved water supplies and sanitation, and on their statistical methods. Nevertheless, these findings confirm that, to achieve universal coverage of access to improved drinking-water sources and sanitation, strategies that target the areas with the lowest coverage are essential. Moreover, the maps and the analytical approach presented here provide the means for monitoring future reductions in inequalities in the coverage of access to improved water sources and sanitation and thus reflect a major priority of the post-2015 development agenda.

Socioeconomic and geographic inequalities in adolescent smoking: A multilevel cross-sectional study of 15 year olds in Scotland	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Scotland; Urban rural; Smoking; Adolescent; Multilevel modelling; Socioeconomic inequalities	SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; HEALTH INEQUALITIES; CRITICAL PERIOD; URBAN; BEHAVIORS; RISK; PREVALENCE; EXPOSURE; SCOTTISH	The objective of the study was to present socioeconomic and geographic inequalities in adolescent smoking in Scotland. The international literature suggests there is no obvious pattern in the geography of adolescent smoking, with rural areas having a higher prevalence than urban areas in some countries, and a lower prevalence in others. These differences are most likely due to substantive differences in rurality between countries in terms of their social, built and cultural geography. Previous studies in the UK have shown an association between lower socioeconomic status and smoking. The Scottish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study surveyed 15 year olds in schools across Scotland between March and June of 2010. We ran multilevel logistic regressions using Markov chain Monte Carlo method and adjusting for age, school type, family affluence, area level deprivation and rurality. We imputed missing rurality and deprivation data using multivariate imputation by chained equations, and re-analysed the data (N = 3577), comparing findings. Among boys, smoking was associated only with area-level deprivation. This relationship appeared to have a quadratic S-shape, with those living in the second most deprived quintile having highest odds of smoking. Among girls, however, odds of smoking increased with deprivation at individual and area-level, with an approximate dose response relationship for both. Odds of smoking were higher for girls living in remote and rural parts of Scotland than for those living in urban areas. Schools in rural areas were no more or less homogenous than schools in urban areas in terms of smoking prevalence. We discuss possible social and cultural explanations for the high prevalence of boys' and girls' smoking in low SES neighbourhoods and of girls' smoking in rural areas. We consider possible differences in the impact of recent tobacco policy changes, primary socialization, access and availability, retail outlet density and the home environment. (C) 2014 The Authors.

J	Timmermann, C				Timmermann, Cristian			Sharing in or Benefiting from Scientific Advancement?	SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS			English	Article						Scientific participation; Objects of innovation; Development; Global justice; Human rights; Human capabilities; Recognition as peers	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; SCIENCE; HEALTH; RESISTANCE; EQUALITY; WORK	The intellectual property regimes we have currently in place are heavily under attack. One of the points of criticism is the interaction between two elements of article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the widely discussed issue of being able to benefit from scientific progress and the less argued for position of having a right to take part in scientific enterprises. To shine light on the question if we should balance the two elements or prioritize one of them, an exploration will be offered on how benefiting from scientific progress and the ability to participate in the advancement of science relate to securing human capabilities. A different perspective to the question will be gained by identifying the problem as an issue of misrecognition, especially the failure to recognize many willing collaboration partners in scientific research as peers. Lastly, I will argue that cooperative justice requires that if we have an innovation incentive system that disproportionally benefits one particular group, a certain duty to counterbalance this advantage exists when we are relying on mutual cooperation for the recognition of intellectual property rights.

Essential Medicines Are More Available than Other Medicines around the Globe	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; AFFORDABILITY; PRICES; CHILDREN; CARE	Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) promotes the development of national Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) in order to improve the availability and use of medicines considered essential within health care systems. However, despite over 3 decades of international efforts, studies show an inconsistent pattern in the availability of essential medicines. We evaluated and compared the availability of essential medicines, and medicines not included in national EMLs, at global and regional levels. Methods: Medicine availability in the public and private sector were calculated based on data obtained from national and provincial facility-based surveys undertaken in 23 countries using the WHO/HAI methodology. The medicines were grouped according to their inclusion ('essential') or exclusion (termed 'non-essential') in each country's EML current at the time of the survey. Availability was calculated for originator brands, generics and any product type (originator brands or generics) and compared between the two groups. Results were aggregated by WHO regions, World Bank country income groups, a wealth inequality measure, and therapeutic groups. Findings: Across all sectors and any product type, the median availability of essential medicines was suboptimal at 61.5% (IQR 20.6%-86.7%) but significantly higher than non-essential medicines at 27.3% (IQR 3.6%-70.0%). The median availability of essential medicines was 40.0% in the public sector and 78.1% in the private sector; compared to 6.6% and 57.1% for non-essential medicines respectively. A reverse trend between national income level categories and the availability of essential medicines was identified in the public sector. Interpretation: EMLs have influenced the provision of medicines and have resulted in higher availability of essential medicines compared to non-essential medicines particularly in the public sector and in low and lower middle income countries. However, the availability of essential medicines, especially in the public sector does not ensure equitable access.	[Bazargani, Yaser T.; de Boer, Anthonius; Leufkens, Hubert G.

Intergenerational redistribution and risk sharing with changing longevity	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						Longevity; Retirement; Pre-funding; Risk sharing	HEALTH-CARE EXPENDITURE; UNCERTAIN LIFETIME; FISCAL-POLICY; SUSTAINABILITY; POPULATION; MORTALITY; FUTURE	Trend increases in longevity are a global phenomenon challenging the fiscal sustainability of current welfare arrangements. Policy proposals abound and often build on implicit assertions concerning intergenerational equity. This paper offers a simple but manageable OLG model with endogenous retirement and cohort-specific longevity to address intergenerational redistribution and risk sharing. While it is well known that a utilitarian planner strives for consumption smoothing, it is shown that healthy ageing calls for work smoothing in the sense that retirement ages increase with longevity. Hence, cohorts with higher longevity should contribute to their larger consumption needs via later retirement, although it is shown that the planner still front-loads some financing (pre-saving). Stochastic longevity raises the issue of intergenerational risk sharing, which implies that cohorts turning out to have a high longevity are compensated at the expense of cohorts turning out to have a relatively short longevity.

Selection of oncology medicines in low- and middle-income countries	ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						oncology medicines; low and middle income countries; selection; essential medicines; access to medicines	BREAST-CANCER MORTALITY; DISEASES; HEALTH; DRUGS; CARE	Background: High cancer mortality rates in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) have raised concerns regarding access to oncology medicines. Essential medicines are those which satisfy the primary health care needs and provide a basis for public procurement or reimbursement decisions in LMICs. We explored selection of oncology medicines in LMICs through investigating national essential medicines lists (NEMLs) for cancer treatments. Methods: Recently updated NEMLs were retrieved for 76 countries. Oncology medicines were classified based on therapeutic categories. Countries were clustered based on geographic regions, income levels and burden of cancer (mortality and morbidity). Indicators of frequency (number of medicines), diversity (number of therapeutic (sub) categories) and more importantly absence were measured and compared across countries using parametric and nonparametric tests. Results: The overall median number of oncology medicines on NEMLs was 16 (interquartile range = 23) chosen predominantly from subcategories of 'antineoplastic agents', with substantial variation across regions and income groups. Five countries did not select any oncology medicine and 68% did not have any 'hormones and related agents' on their NEMLs. Newer technologies like targeted therapies were infrequently incorporated. The cluster of countries suffering most from the burden of cancer selected more essential oncology medicines and diversified further. Conclusion: The observed selection of oncology essential medicines can reflect insufficiencies and inequalities in access to cancer treatments at least in the public sector of LMICs. Further resources need to be allocated from governments and international organizations to tackle the problem of access to oncology medicines in these countries.	[Bazargani, Y.

A brief outline of some developments in the field of international law and justice for victims of gross human rights violations is presented, with a focus on the right to reparation including the means for rehabilitation. The fulfillment of this right is a complex endeavor which raises many questions. The road to justice and reparation for those whose rights have been brutally violated is long and burdensome. The active presence of trauma-informed health professionals in this process is a priority. Some of the issues raised within the context of states' obligations to provide and ensure redress 1 and rehabilitation to those subjected to torture and gross human rights violations are discussed, and in particular how rehabilitation can be understood and responded to by health professionals.

Socio-Economic Gradients in Maternal and Child Health-Seeking Behaviours in Egypt: Systematic Literature Review and Evidence Synthesis	PLOS ONE			English	Review							CARE; SERVICES; COUNTRIES	Background: Health-seeking behaviour lies on the direct pathway between socio-economic position (SEP) and health outcomes. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesise evidence of socio-economic gradients in health-seeking behaviours related to maternal and child health in Egypt. Methods: Four databases (Medline, Embase, Global Health and Web of Science) were searched in September 2013 for material published in English from 1992 to 2013 for a combination of terms describing health-seeking behaviours, indicators of socio-economic position and geographical limitation to Egypt. Findings of studies were described and synthesised in a narrative format as meta-analysis was not possible. Findings: Among the 786 references identified, 10 articles met the inclusion criteria. Six studies examined maternal and five studies child health-seeking behaviours (one study examined both). For maternal health, three dimensions of health-seeking behaviour (receipt of any care, type of care and intensity of care) were covered by studies of ante-natal and one dimension (type of care) by analyses of delivery care. For child health, two dimensions of preventive care (coverage of and intensity of immunisation) and three dimensions of curative care (receipt of any care, type and cost of care) were analysed. Conclusions: Based on two studies of time trends in nationally-representative surveys, socio-economic inequalities in seeking care for basic preventive and curative interventions in maternal and child health appear to have narrowed. Limited evidence of gradients in intensity of maternal preventive and provider selection in child curative care showed that inequalities may have widened. In studies of more geographically and socially homogeneous samples, fewer gradients were identified. Current body of evidence contains numerous limitations and gaps and is insufficient to draw a conclusive summary of such gradients. Improved understanding of SEP gradients is crucial in designing and prioritising interventions to equitably improve maternal and child health outcomes.

J	Gandhi, G; Lydon, P				Gandhi, Gian; Lydon, Patrick			Updating the evidence base on the operational costs of supplementary immunization activities for current and future accelerated disease control, elimination and eradication efforts	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							ORAL CHOLERA VACCINE; NEONATAL TETANUS; MEASLES; CAMPAIGNS; KILLINGS; IMPACT	Background: To achieve globally or regionally defined accelerated disease control, elimination and eradication (ADC/E/E) goals against vaccine-preventable diseases requires complementing national routine immunization programs with intensive, time-limited, and targeted Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs). Many global and country-level SIA costing efforts have historically relied on what are now outdated benchmark figures. Mobilizing adequate resources for successful implementation of SIAs requires updated estimates of non-vaccine costs per target population. Methods: This assessment updates the evidence base on the SIA operational costs through a review of literature between 1992 and 2012, and an analysis of actual expenditures from 142 SIAs conducted between 2004 and 2011 and documented in country immunization plans. These are complemented with an analysis of budgets from 31 SIAs conducted between 2006 and 2011 in order to assess the proportion of total SIA costs per person associated with various cost components. All results are presented in 2010 US dollars. Results: Existing evidence indicate that average SIA operational costs were usually less than US$0.50 per person in 2010 dollars. However, the evidence is sparse, non-standardized, and largely out of date. Average operational costs per person generated from our analysis of country immunization plans are consistently higher than published estimates, approaching US$1.00 for injectable vaccines. The results illustrate that the benchmarks often used to project needs underestimate the true costs of SIAs and the analysis suggests that SIA operational costs have been increasing over time in real terms. Our assessment also illustrates that operational costs vary across several dimensions. Variations in the actual costs of SIAs likely to reflect the extents to which economies of scale associated with campaign-based delivery can be attained, the underlying strength of the immunization program, sensitivities to the relative ease of vaccine administration (i.e. orally, or by injection), and differences in disease-specific programmatic approaches. The assessment of SIA budgets by cost component illustrates that four cost drivers make up the largest proportion of costs across all vaccines: human resources, program management, social mobilization, and vehicles and transportation. These findings suggest that SIAs leverage existing health system infrastructure, reinforcing the fact that strong routine immunization programs are an important pre-requisite for achieving ADC/E/E goals. Conclusions: The results presented here will be useful for national and global-level actors involved in planning, budgeting, resource mobilization, and financing of SIAs in order to create more realistic assessments of resource requirements for both existing ADC/E/E efforts as well as for new vaccines that may deploy a catch-up campaign-based delivery component. However, limitations of our analysis suggest a need to conduct further research into operational costs of SIAs. Understanding the changing face of delivery costs and cost structures for SIAs will continue to be critical to avoid funding gaps and in order to improve vaccination coverage, reduce health inequities, and achieve the ADC/E/E goals many of which have been endorsed by the World Health Assembly and are included in the Decade of Vaccines Global Vaccine Action Plan.

J	Olivier, C; Williams-Jones, B				Olivier, Catherine; Williams-Jones, Bryn			Global pharmacogenomics: Where is the research taking us?	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						public health; ethics; research; pharmacogenomics; global health	PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; HEALTH-CARE; DISEASES; DRUGS; INEQUALITIES; COUNTRIES; PROMISE; NO	Pharmacogenomics knowledge and technologies, which couple genomics information with pharmaceutical drug response, have been promised to revolutionise both drug development and prescription. One notable promise of pharmacogenomics is the potential to contribute to some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), namely to increase justice in global health by incentivising public research laboratories and pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for populations (e.g., in low- and middle-income countries) that have been neglected by the traditional drug development model. To evaluate the credibility of this promise, we examined - both quantitatively and qualitatively - those scientific papers indexed in PubMed and published between 1997 and 2010, with a view to describing the major orientations and tendencies characterising the development of pharmacogenomics research. Our results demonstrate that pharmacogenomics research has focused on three major non-communicable categories of disease: cancer, depression and other psychological disorders and cardiovascular and coronary heart disease. Few publications - and thus, by extension, little scientific interest - concerned orphan diseases, infectious diseases or maternal health, indicating that pharmacogenomics research over the last decade has replicated the well-known 90/10 ratio in drug development. As such, we argue that research in the field of pharmacogenomics has failed in its promise to contribute to the MDGs by reducing global health inequalities.

Methods: Our analysis is based on the Fifth European Working Conditions Survey that compared 23 European countries. We performed multi-level regression analysis. On the macro-level of analysis we included the Gini-Index as measure of inequality. On the micro-level of analysis we followed the Karasek-Theorell model and included three scales for psychological job demands, physical job demands, and decision latitude in the model. The model was stratified by sex. Results: We found that, in countries with high income inequality, workers report significantly more sickness absence than workers in countries with low income inequality. In addition we found that the level of income inequality moderates the relationship between psychological job demands and sickness absence. High psychological job demands are significantly more strongly related to more days of sickness absence in countries with low income inequality than in countries with high income inequality. Conclusions: As the nature and causal pathways of cross-level interaction effects still cannot be fully explained, we argue that future research should aim to explore such causal pathways. In accordance with WHO recommendations we argue that inequalities should be reduced. In addition we state that, particularly in countries with low levels of income inequality, policies should aim to reduce psychological job demands.

The objective was to describe socioeconomic inequalities in the rate of induced abortion in Spain in 2001, jointly evaluating the effects of both regional and individual socioeconomic characteristics. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a multilevel approach was carried out among women who were resident in Spain in 2001, considering the hierarchical structure of relevant factors. Analyses were carried out at the individual and regional level. We fit Poisson regression models to calculate adjusted relative risks (aRR) of induced abortion and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The estimated abortion rate was 6.26 per 1000 women aged 20-49 years. Induced abortion was more frequent among younger women (aRR = 1.55 for women aged 20-24 years, compared with those aged 25-34 years) and those with less than primary education (aRR = 2.25 compared with women with university studies). Women residing in regions with lower public spending on non-university education (aRR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.98) and a higher percentage of non-European Union immigrants (aRR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10) were also more likely to have had an induced abortion. Conclusions: Socioeconomic inequalities in the practice of induced abortion in Spain exist not only at the individual level but also at the regional level. The prevention of unintended pregnancy should be approached using a global political strategy aimed at changing contextual and individual factors that contribute to unintended pregnancy.

J	Das Gupta, M				Das Gupta, Monica			Population, Poverty, and Climate Change	WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER			English	Article							FAMILY-PLANNING PROGRAMS; EXOGENOUS VARIATION; BIRTH-ORDER; FERTILITY; IMPACT; CONSEQUENCES; INVESTMENT; POLICIES; GROWTH; SIZE	This literature review focuses on the relationships between population, poverty, and climate change. Developed countries are largely responsible for global warming, but the brunt of the fallout will be borne by developing countries in forms such as lower agricultural output, poorer health, and more frequent natural disasters. Although carbon emissions per capita have leveled off in developed countries, they are projected to rise rapidly in developing countries because of economic growth and population growth. Unfortunately, the latter will rise most notably in the poorest countries, combining with climate change to slow poverty reduction. These countries have many incentives to lower fertility. Previous studies indicate that in high fertility settings, fertility decline facilitates economic growth and poverty reduction. It also reduces the pressure on livelihoods and frees resources that can be used to cope with climate change. Moreover, slowing population growth helps avert some of the projected global warming, which will benefit the poorest countries far more than it will benefit developed countries that lie at higher latitudes and/or have more resources to cope with climate change. Natural experiments indicate that family-planning programs are effective and highly pro-poor in their impact. While the rest of the world wrestles with the complexities of reducing emissions, the poorest countries will benefit from simple programs to lower fertility.

We evaluated the contribution of 3 PDPs-Medicines for Malaria Venture, Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, and Institute for One World Health-according to Frost and Reich's access framework. We also evaluated PDPs' capacity building in low-and middle-income countries at the individual, institutional, and system levels. We found that these PDPs advance public health by ensuring their products' registration, distribution, and adoption into national treatment policies in disease-endemic countries. Nonetheless, ensuring broad, equitable access for these populations-high distribution coverage; affordability, particularly for the poor; and adoption at provider and end-user levels-remains a challenge.

The Modifying Influence of Country Development on the Effect of Individual Educational Attainment on Self-Rated Health	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							23 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; WELFARE REGIMES; SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS; SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; POPULATION HEALTH; MORTALITY; EXPLANATION; QUALITY; STATES	Objectives. We investigated how much the Human Development Index (HDI), a global measure of development, modifies the effect of education on self-reported health. Methods. We analyzed cross-sectional World Health Survey data on 217 642 individuals from 49 countries, collected in 2002 to 2005, with random-intercept multilevel linear regression models. Results. We observed greater positive associations between educational levels and self-reported good health with increasing HDI. The magnitude of this effect modification of the education-health relation tended to increase with educational attainment. For example, before adjustment for effect modification, at comparable HDI, on average, finishing primary school was associated with better general health (b = 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18, 1.80). With adjustment for effect modification by HDI, the impact became 4.63 (95% CI = 3.63, 5.62) for every 0.1 increase in HDI. Among those who completed high school, these associations were, respectively, 5.59 (95% CI = 5.20, 5.98) and 9.95 (95% CI = 8.89, 11.00). Conclusions. The health benefits of educational attainment are greater in countries with greater human development. Health inequalities attributable to education are, therefore, larger in more developed countries.	[van der Kooi, Anne L.

M.; Mackintosh, Maureen; Justin-Temu, Mary; Wuyts, Marc			Local production of pharmaceuticals in Africa and access to essential medicines: 'urban bias' in access to imported medicines in Tanzania and its policy implications	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Local production of medicines; Access to medicines; Africa; Tanzania; Urban bias	DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE; HEALTH; AVAILABILITY; DELIVERY; THERAPY; EQUITY; TRENDS	Background: International policy towards access to essential medicines in Africa has focused until recently on international procurement of large volumes of medicines, mainly from Indian manufacturers, and their import and distribution. This emphasis is now being challenged by renewed policy interest in the potential benefits of local pharmaceutical production and supply. However, there is a shortage of evidence on the role of locally produced medicines in African markets, and on potential benefits of local production for access to medicines. This article contributes to filling that gap. Methods: This article uses WHO/HAI data from Tanzania for 2006 and 2009 on prices and sources of a set of tracer essential medicines. It employs innovative graphical methods of analysis alongside conventional statistical testing. Results: Medicines produced in Tanzania were equally likely to be found in rural and in urban areas. Imported medicines, especially those imported from countries other than Kenya (mainly from India) displayed 'urban bias': that is, they were significantly more likely to be available in urban than in rural areas. This finding holds across the range of sample medicines studied, and cannot be explained by price differences alone. While different private distribution networks for essential medicines may provide part of the explanation, this cannot explain why the urban bias in availability of imported medicines is also found in the public sector. Conclusions: The findings suggest that enhanced local production may improve rural access to medicines. The potential benefits of local production and scope for their improvement are an important field for further research, and indicate a key policy area in which economic development and health care objectives may reinforce each other.

HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Health research; Latin America and Caribbean; National research for health systems		Background: National Research for Health Systems (NRfHS) in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have shown growth and consolidation in the last few years. A structured, organized system will facilitate the development and implementation of strategies for research for health to grow and contribute towards people's health and equity. Methods: We conducted a survey with the health managers from LAC countries that form part of the Ibero-American Ministerial Network for Health Education and Research. Results: From 13 of 18 questionnaires delivered, we obtained information on the NRfHS governance and management structures, the legal and political framework, the research priorities, existing financing schemes, and the main institutional actors. Data on investment in science and technology, scientific production, and on the socio-economic reality of countries were obtained through desk review focused on regional/global data sources to increase comparability. Conclusions: By comparing the data gathered with a review carried out in 2008, we were able to document the advances in research for health system development in the region, mostly in setting governance, coordination, policies, and regulations, key for better functionality of research for health systems. However, in spite of these advances, growth and consolidation of research for health systems in the region is still uneven.

While globalization has brought prosperity to millions, disparities among nations and nationals are growing raising once again the question of justice. Similarly, while medicine has developed dramatically over the past few decades, health disparities at the global level are staggering. Seemingly, what our humanity could achieve in matters of scientific development is not justly distributed to benefit everyone. In this paper, it will be argued that a global theoretical agreement on principles of justice may prove unattainable; however, a grass-roots change is warranted to change the current situation. The UNESCO Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights will be considered as a starting point to achieve this change through extracting the main values embedded in its principles. These values, namely, respecting human dignity and tending to human vulnerability with a hospitable attitude, should then be revived in medical practice. Medical education will be one possible venue to achieve that, especially through role models. Future physicians will then become the fervent advocates for a global and just distribution of health care.

Currently, the international monitoring system measures the type of drinking water source that households use. There have been calls for improved monitoring systems over several decades, some advocating use of multiple indicators. We review the literature on water service indicators and frameworks with a view to informing debate on their relevance to national and international monitoring. We describe the evidence concerning the relevance of each identified indicator to public health, economic development and human rights. We analyze the benefits and challenges of using these indicators separately and combined in an index as tools for planning, monitoring, and evaluating water services. We find substantial evidence on the importance of each commonly recommended indicator-service type, safety, quantity, accessibility, reliability or continuity of service, equity, and affordability. Several frameworks have been proposed that give structure to the relationships among individual indicators and some combine multiple indicator scores into a single index but few have been rigorously tested. More research is needed to understand if employing a composite metric of indicators is advantageous and how each indicator might be scored and scaled.

The global economic crisis offers an opportunity to examine this issue. This article builds on relative deprivation theory and proposes that economic crises evoke three subjective comparisons that influence distress: comparisons to 1) past outcomes; 2) the situation of others; and 3) expected future outcomes. Using a national survey obtained during the economic crisis in Iceland, we examine how these comparisons influence subjective injustice and emotional distress (anger and depression). Results indicate that perceived reduction in the standard of living has a more pronounced effect on subjective injustice and anger, 1) when individuals think that the crisis has harmed them more than others; and 2) when they have negative expectations about their future. The study implies that subjective comparisons can moderate the effect of sudden social change on distress.

Youth smoking may play an important role in the increasing social inequalities related to smoking. This study investigates social determinants of smoking among 15-year-old to 19-year-old individuals. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: The study uses data of 3536 participants aged 15-19 years of age of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) and the National Household Sample Survey (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostragem de Domicilio, PNAD) obtained from household interviews. Smoking was defined as currently smoking tobacco products, regardless of frequency. Household socioeconomic indicators included per capita income, the educational level and sex of the head of the household, the presence of smoking restrictions and the number of smokers (excluding adolescents). Adolescent social factors included years of delaying school and social status (full-time student, working, and neither working nor studying). The hierarchical logistic regression analysis considered the effect of the complex sampling design. Results: From 3536 participants, 6.2% were smokers (95% CI 5.4 to 7.1). More men than women had the habit of smoking (7.2%; 5.9 to 8.6 vs 3.6%; 2.7 to 4.6). The likelihood of smoking was significantly greater for men and older teens. There was an upward trend in the OR of smoking according to the number of smokers in the house. Adolescents living in households with no smoking restrictions had a greater likelihood of being smokers. OR of smoking rose as the number of years of delaying school increased, being about three times greater among adolescents who were working and five times greater among those who were neither studying nor working. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that socioeconomic inequality in smoking is established at younger ages and that school delay as well as school abandonment may contribute to increased smoking-related inequalities. Smoking restrictions at home were protective against adolescents becoming smokers. Living with other smokers was a strong predictor of adolescents becoming smokers.

A quasi-experimental study	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							GREEN SPACE ACCESSIBILITY; THERAPEUTIC HORTICULTURE; NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS; HEALTH INEQUALITIES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; ASSOCIATIONS; BENEFITS; EXPOSURE; SIZE	Introduction: There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that green spaces may positively influence psychological well-being. This project is designed to take advantage of a natural experiment where planned physical and social interventions to enhance access to natural environments in deprived communities provide an opportunity to prospectively assess impacts on perceived stress and mental well-being. Study design and methods: A controlled, prospective study comprising a repeat cross-sectional survey of residents living within 1.5 km of intervention and comparison sites. Three waves of data will be collected: prephysical environment intervention (2013); postphysical environment intervention (2014) and postwoodland promotion social intervention (2015). The primary outcome will be a measure of perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) preintervention and postintervention. Secondary, self-report outcomes include: mental well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale), changes in physical activity (IPAQ-short form), health (EuroQoL EQ-5D), perception and use of the woodlands, connectedness to nature (Inclusion of Nature in Self Scale), social cohesion and social capital. An environmental audit will complement the study by evaluating the physical changes in the environment over time and recording any other contextual changes over time. A process evaluation will assess the implementation of the programme. A health economics analysis will assess the cost consequences of each stage of the intervention in relation to the primary and secondary outcomes of the study. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been given by the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh College of Art Research, Ethics and Knowledge Exchange Committee (ref. 19/06/2012). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, national and international conferences and, at the final stage of the project, through a workshop for those interested in implementing environmental interventions.

Asthma mortality in Australia in the 21st century: a case series analysis	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							RAPID-ONSET ASTHMA; DEATHS; MANAGEMENT; EMERGENCY; VICTORIA; RISK	Objective: As previous asthma mortality studies were undertaken between 1986 and 1997, and treatments have evolved since that time, in order to direct future asthma interventions, we investigated the reasons for asthma deaths between 2005 and 2009. Design: We undertook a case series analysis by searching the National Coroners' Information System using the most recent International Classification of Diseases-10 codes J45 and J46 and the keyword 'asthma' as the underlying cause of death. Setting: Records for 283 cases aged 70 years and under were retrieved from each Australian state and territory. Coroner's findings, autopsy, toxicology and police reports were reviewed to determine: if the team agreed the death was due to asthma and whether the death was preventable or modifiable factors existed? Owing to the likelihood of comorbidities or alternative diagnoses contributing to deaths in those over 70 years of age, this group was excluded. Results: Examination of available data in those aged under 70 years identified risk factors associated with asthma death. These included physical barriers (rural and remote location, institutionalised care), psychosocial issues (social disengagement, mental illness, living alone, being unemployed), smoking, drug and alcohol dependence, allergies, respiratory tract infections, inadequate treatment and delay in seeking help. Conclusions: Our study provides a current assessment of death from asthma across Australia. Further reductions in the rate of asthma deaths will require interventions targeted at the personal, practice and policy levels. Asthma-related health literacy needs to be improved especially among those with episodic asthma. Reforms are also needed to address inequity in healthcare delivery to 'reach the unreached'. Our study points to the dangers associated with smoking, drug and alcohol use and the consequences of delay in seeking care among those with asthma.

An exploratory study of cannabis withdrawal among Indigenous Australian prison inmates: study protocol	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							ADULTS SEEKING TREATMENT; MARIJUANA; RELIABILITY; DEPENDENCE; FRAMEWORK; USERS	Introduction: Cannabis use and dependence is a serious health and criminal justice issue among incarcerated populations internationally. Upon abrupt, enforced cessation of cannabis, prisoners may suffer irritability and anger that can lead to threatening behaviour, intimidation, violence, sleep disturbances and self-harm. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome, proposed for inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013, has not been examined in Indigenous populations. Owing to the exceptionally high rates of cannabis use in the community, high proportions of Australian Indigenous prisoners may suffer from withdrawal upon entry to custody. Methods and analysis: 60 male and 60 female Indigenous prisoners (18-40 years) at a high risk of cannabis dependence will be recruited upon entry to custody. A pictorial representation of the standard Cannabis Withdrawal Scale will be tested for reliability and validity. Cortisol markers will be measured in saliva, as the indicators of onset and severity of cannabis withdrawal and psychological distress. The characteristics will be described as percentages and mean or median values with 95% CI. Receiver operator curve analysis will determine an ideal cut-off of the Cannabis Withdrawal Scale and generalised estimating equations modelling will test changes over time. The acceptability and efficacy of proposed resources will be assessed qualitatively using thematic analysis. Outcomes: A valid and reliable measure of cannabis withdrawal for use with Indigenous populations, the onset and time course of withdrawal symptoms in this population and the development of culturally acceptable resources and interventions to identify and manage cannabis withdrawal. Ethics and dissemination: The project has been approved by the James Cook University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number H4651). The results will be reported via peer reviewed publications, conference, seminar presentations and on-line media for national and international dissemination.

E-mail: jcbarnes@utdallas.edu Some theories contend that marriage leads to desistance from crime. Indeed, many studies have reported married persons are less involved in crime. Research has developed under the testable assumption that marriage affects criminal behavior but that criminal involvement does not affect marital propensity (i.e. no selection effect). The current study tests this assumption in two ways. First, we examine a cross-lagged path model where prior marital status is allowed to influence future crime and prior crime is allowed to influence future marital status. Second, we analyze a reciprocal effects model where the contemporaneous influence of marriage on criminal activity is examined while also estimating the influence of criminal behavior on marriage. The findings reveal mixed support for the effect of marriage on crime. The marriage effect is observed in one of the cross-lagged models but not in the reciprocal effects models. Implications for both theory and policy are considered.	[Barnes, J.

Where is the gap?: the contribution of disparities within developing countries to global inequalities in under-five mortality	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Under-five mortality; Health inequity	CHILD HEALTH INTERVENTIONS; EQUITY; COUNTDOWN; SURVIVAL; COVERAGE	Background: Global health equity strategists have previously focused much on differences across countries. At first glance, the global health gap appears to result primarily from disparities between the developing and developed regions. We examine how much of this disparity could be attributed to within-country disparities in developing nations. Methods: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 1995 and 2010 in 67 developing countries. Using a population attributable risk approach, we computed the proportion of global under-five mortality gap and the absolute number of under-five deaths that would be reduced if the under-five mortality rate in each of these 67 countries was lowered to the level of the top 10% economic group in each country. As a sensitivity check, we also conducted comparable calculations using top 5% and the top 20% economic group. Results: In 2007, approximately 6.6 million under-five deaths were observed in the 67 countries used in the analysis. This could be reduced to only 600,000 deaths if these countries had the same under-five mortality rate as developed countries. If the under-five mortality rate was lowered to the rate among the top 10% economic group in each of these countries, under-five deaths would be reduced to 3.7 million. This corresponds to a 48% reduction in the global mortality gap and 2.9 million under-five deaths averted. Using cutoff points of top 5% and top 20% economic groups showed reduction of 37% and 56% respectively in the global mortality gap. With these cutoff points, respectively 2.3 and 3.4 million under-five deaths would be averted. Conclusion: Under-five mortality disparities within developing countries account for roughly half of the global gap between developed and developing countries. Thus, within-country inequities deserve as much consideration as do inequalities between the world's developing and developed regions.

Impact of user fees on maternal health service utilization and related health outcomes: a systematic review	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Review						Maternal health; user fees; evaluation methods; literature review	CARE SERVICES; SURVIVAL 4; MORTALITY; ABOLITION; POLICY; ATTENDANCE; DELIVERY; CHARGES; QUALITY; ACCESS	Objective To assess the evidence of the impact of user fees on maternal health service utilization and related health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, as well as their impact on inequalities in these outcomes. Methods Studies were identified by modifying a search strategy from a related systematic review. Primary studies of any design were included if they reported the effect of fee changes on maternal health service utilization, related health outcomes and inequalities in these outcomes. For each study, data were systematically extracted and a quality assessment conducted. Due to the heterogeneity of study methods, results were examined narratively. Findings Twenty studies were included. Designs and analytic approaches comprised: two interrupted time series, eight repeated cross-sectional, nine before-and-after without comparison groups and one before-and-after in three groups. Overall, the quality of studies was poor. Few studies addressed potential sources of bias, such as secular trends over time, and even basic tests of statistical significance were often not reported. Consistency in the direction of effects provided some evidence of an increase in facility delivery in particular after fees were removed, as well as possible increases in the number of managed delivery complications. There was little evidence of the effect on health outcomes or inequality in accessing care and, where available, the direction of effect varied. Conclusion Despite the global momentum to abolish user fees for maternal and child health services, robust evidence quantifying impact remains scant. Improved methods for evaluating and reporting on these interventions are recommended, including better descriptions of the interventions and context, looking at a range of outcome measures, and adopting robust analytical methods that allow for adjustment of underlying and seasonal trends, reporting immediate as well as longer-term (e.g. at 6 months and 1 year) effects and using comparison groups where possible.

Our aim was to produce comparable estimates of changes in socioeconomic inequalities in NMR in the past two decades across these countries. Methods We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for countries in which a survey was done in 2008 or later and one about 10 years previously. We measured absolute inequalities with the slope index of inequality and relative inequalities with the relative index of inequality. We used an asset-based wealth index and maternal education as measures of socioeconomic position and summarised inequality estimates for all included countries with random-effects meta-analysis. Findings 24 low-income and middle-income countries were eligible for inclusion. In most countries, absolute and relative wealth-related and educational inequalities in NMR decreased between survey 1 and survey 2. In five countries (Cameroon, Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, and Uganda), the difference in NMR between the top and bottom of the wealth distribution was reduced by more than two neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year. By contrast, wealth-related inequality increased by more than 1.5 neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year in Ethiopia and Cambodia. Patterns of change in absolute and relative educational inequalities in NMR were similar to those of wealth-related NMR inequalities, although the size of educational inequalities tended to be slightly larger. Interpretation Socioeconomic inequality in NMR seems to have decreased in the past two decades in most countries of low and middle income. However, a substantial survival advantage remains for babies born into wealthier households with a high educational level, which should be considered in global efforts to further reduce NMR.

This article explores two similar but underutilized theoretical frameworks in medical anthropology, and discusses how they facilitate new insights about the relationships between epidemiological patterns and individual-level illness experiences. Two cases from our fieldwork in New Delhi and Chicago are presented to illustrate how syndemics and chronicity theories explain the epidemic problems of co-occurring depression and type 2 diabetes. We use these case studies to illustrate how the holistic agendas of syndemics and chronicity theories allow critical scholars to attend to the macrosocial factors contributing to the rise of noncommunicable diseases while still honoring the diversity of experiences that make individual illness experiences, and actual outcomes, unique. Such an approach not only promotes a more integrative medical anthropology, but also contributes to global health dialogues around diabetes, depression, and their overlap.

MEDICAL LAW REVIEW			English	Article						English NHS; Health and Social Care Act 2012; Health Care Regulation; Health Insurance; Monitor; The Netherlands	REFORM; NHS	This article seeks to establish what lessons might be available to the English health care sector following enactment of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 from the Dutch experience of introducing market competition into health care via a mandatory health insurance scheme implemented by for-profit insurance companies. The existence of the Beveridge NHS model in England, and a Bismarckian insurance system in The Netherlands perhaps suggest that a comparison of the two countries is at best limited, and reinforced by the different Enthoven-inspired competitive models each has adopted. However, we contend that there are positive and negative issues arising from introducing competition into health care-, e.g. concerns about equity and benefits of efficiencies-which go beyond national boundaries and different systems and reflect the global paradigm shift towards the use of market forces in previously non-market areas such as health. The article examines the situation in England following the HSCA 2012 and The Netherlands following the 2006 reforms before analysing two areas of common ground: the focus in both countries on competition on quality (as opposed to price) and integrated care, which is assuming ever greater significance. We suggest that our combined insights (as a health lawyer and competition lawyer respectively) coupled with a comparative approach create a novel contribution to current calls for a wider public debate about the real role of markets in health care over and above simple characterisation as a force for good or bad.

"My view that disability is okay sometimes clashes": experiences of two disabled occupational therapists	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY			English	Article						stigma; discrimination; disabled occupational therapists; disabled health personnel; disability	INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; HEALTH; PHYSICIANS; PEOPLE; MODEL; RACE	Aims: While disability is the focus of much attention in occupational therapy, there has been little attention paid to disability within the profession. Disabled therapists not only bring valuable perspectives on disability, but also pose important challenges to taken-for-granted assumptions about impairment and disability within the profession. At the same time, their cultural beliefs and values may clash with core assumptions of the profession. Methods: This study analyses interview data from two disabled occupational therapists, part of a larger study with cultural minority therapists. Semi-structured interviews explored their experiences of professional practice in the context of societal belief in the superiority of non-disabled and "normal" ways of doing and being. Major findings: Some cultural values of participants clashed with the values and beliefs of their profession, particularly concerning independence. Negative attitudes of colleagues and managers were the key barriers to practice. The responsibility for bridging the disabled/non-disabled cultural divide rested with the disabled therapists, exacerbating inequity. Nonetheless, these therapists believed their disability experiences had advantages for practice. Conclusions: Disabled therapists may be required to engage in invisible work to communicate across cultural differences, and to educate others. Respectful openness to difference could enhance the practice competence of both disabled therapists and their non-disabled colleagues. This demands critical reflexive attention to ableism within the profession.

J	Wolf, A; Gray, R; Fazel, S				Wolf, Achim; Gray, Ron; Fazel, Seena			Violence as a public health problem: An ecological study of 169 countries	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Crime; Violence; Public health; Income inequality; Alcohol	INTIMATE-PARTNER VIOLENCE; INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; WOMENS HEALTH; ALCOHOL; HOMICIDE; CRIME; MULTICOUNTRY; DRINKING; OBESITY	Individual level risk factors for violence have been widely studied, but little is known about country-level determinants, particularly in low and middle-income countries. We hypothesized that income inequality, through its detrimental effects on social cohesion, would be related to an increase in violence worldwide, and in low and middle-income countries in particular. We examined country-level associations of violence with socio-economic and health-related factors, using crime statistics from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and indicators from the Human Development Report published by the United Nations Development Programme. Using regression models, we measured relationships between country-level factors (age, education, measures of income, health expenditure, and alcohol consumption) and four violent outcomes (including measures of violence-related mortality and morbidity) in up to 169 countries. We stratified our analyses comparing high with low and middle-income countries, and analysed longitudinal data on homicide and income inequality in high-income countries. In low and middle-income countries, income inequality was related to homicide, robbery, and self-reported assault (all p's < 0.05). In high-income countries, urbanicity was significantly associated with official assault (p = 0.002, beta = 0.716) and robbery (p = 0.011, beta = 0.587) rates; income inequality was related to homicide (p = 0.006, beta = 0.670) and self-reported assault (p = 0.020, beta = 0.563), and longitudinally with homicide (p = 0.021). Worldwide, alcohol consumption was associated with self-reported assault rates (p < 0.001, beta = 0.369) suggesting public policy interventions reducing alcohol consumption may contribute to reducing violence rates. Our main finding was that income inequality was related to violence in low and middle-income countries. Public health should advocate for global action to moderate income inequality to reduce the global health burden of violence. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Global Study on Lone Mothers: Exploring the Associations of Self-Assessed General Health with Motherhood Types and Gender Inequality in 32 Countries	WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES			English	Article							WOMENS WORK; CHILD-CARE; MORTALITY; RUSSIA; HOUSEHOLDS; POVERTY; EUROPE; SWEDEN; POLICY	Background: In a study of 32 mostly non-affluent countries, we aimed to i) compare lone mother's general health to the health of other women and ii) assess whether the association of health with gender inequality was stronger among lone mothers than among other women. Methods: World Health Survey data were analyzed on 57,182 women aged 18 to 50 in 32 countries. The main outcome was self-assessed general poor health. The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) was used to measure the magnitude of gender inequality within countries. Logistic multilevel regression was used to compare the health of different groups of women, and to study the possible influence of gender inequality. Findings: Compared with all other women, lone mothers had the highest odds of poor health odds ratio (OR, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.22), also at 35 years or older with an OR of 1.18 (95% CI, 1.10-1.27). Lone mothers in Ethiopia and Tunisia had the highest odds of reporting poor health (OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.21-2.26] and OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 0.92-2.68], respectively). The degree of gender inequality was weakly related to cross-national variations in health of women. These associations were about similar for all women. For example, the OR for the GGGI was 1.03 for all women except coupled mothers. Conclusions: As within North America, lone mothers in non-affluent countries tend to have higher rates of poor health. The degree of gender inequality is not related to the relative health of lone mothers, suggesting that other characteristics of nations might be more influential.

Single mothers' self-assessment of health: a systematic exploration of the literature	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Review						Health Professionals; Lone Mothers; Nurses; Poverty; Review; Self-Rated Health; Single Mothers; Social Exclusion	RATED HEALTH; LONE MOTHERS; COUPLE MOTHERS; WOMENS HEALTH; MORTALITY; FAMILY; SWEDEN; MORBIDITY; ROLES; RISK	Aim: This study aimed to explore single mothers' self-assessed level of health status compared to partnered mothers and the relevant factors associated with it. Background: The number of single-mother families is increasing worldwide. A large body of international research reveals that single mothers experience poorer physical and mental health than their married counterparts. An important contributory factor for this health disparity appears to be socio-economic disadvantage. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the keywords 'lone' or 'single' and 'mother*' or 'parent*' or 'family structure' in combination with 'health'. EMBASE, CINAHL, COCHRANE and PUBMED databas were searched for quantitative research studies published in the past decade. Results: Eleven quantitative research articles with self-assessment of health status in single mothers were identified. Single mothers report lower levels of health status compared to partnered mothers. These inequalities appear to be associated with financial hardship and lack of social support. Both these factors increase single mothers' susceptibility to stress and illness. Conclusion: Despite the study limitations (e. g. results based mainly on secondary data from household surveys), it provides evidence that single motherhood places women in an adverse social position that is associated with prolonged stress mainly due to unemployment, economic hardship and social exclusion, which affects negatively their health status. These findings can be seen as a challenge for health professionals, especially those working in the community sector and policy makers too, to establish supportive measures for this vulnerable group focused on socio-economic factors.

J	Hayashi, K; Small, W; Csete, J; Hattirat, S; Kerr, T				Hayashi, Kanna; Small, Will; Csete, Joanne; Hattirat, Sattara; Kerr, Thomas			Experiences with Policing among People Who Inject Drugs in Bangkok, Thailand: A Qualitative Study	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article							HIV-INFECTION; MIDAZOLAM INJECTION; HARM REDUCTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; HIGH-RATES; USERS; INCARCERATION; RISK; ENFORCEMENT; IMPACTS	Background: Despite Thailand's commitment to treating people who use drugs as "patients'' not "criminals,'' Thai authorities continue to emphasize criminal law enforcement for drug control. In 2003, Thailand's drug war received international criticism due to extensive human rights violations. However, few studies have since investigated the impact of policing on drug-using populations. Therefore, we sought to examine experiences with policing among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Bangkok, Thailand, between 2008 and 2012. Methods and Findings: Between July 2011 and June 2012, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 42 community-recruited PWID participating in the Mitsampan Community Research Project in Bangkok. Interviews explored PWID's encounters with police during the past three years. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim, and a thematic analysis was conducted to document the character of PWID's experiences with police. Respondents indicated that policing activities had noticeably intensified since rapid urine toxicology screening became available to police. Respondents reported various forms of police misconduct, including false accusations, coercion of confessions, excessive use of force, and extortion of money. However, respondents were reluctant to report misconduct to the authorities in the face of social and structural barriers to seeking justice. Respondents' strategies to avoid police impeded access to health care and facilitated transitions towards the misuse of prescribed pharmaceuticals. The study's limitations relate to the transferability of the findings, including the potential biases associated with the small convenience sample. Conclusions: This study suggests that policing in Bangkok has involved injustices, human rights abuses, and corruption, and policing practices in this setting appeared to have increased PWID's vulnerability to poor health through various pathways. Novel to this study are findings pertaining to the use of urine drug testing by police, which highlight the potential for widespread abuse of this emerging technology. These findings raise concern about ongoing policing practices in this setting.

In addition, it provides evidence for the purpose of fair administration of justice and data for health sector regulation. Many jurisdictions recently underwent considerable review and made changes to their death investigation systems in accordance with modern innovation in medicine and science. This enhanced the quality of justice in those countries. The death investigation system in Sri Lanka was originally established in 1883 and is a modified model of the British coroners system. However, the system has not undergone significant revisions since then and is confined to an informal traditional framework. The scope of this article was to review the death investigation system in Sri Lanka with a view to amend it in accordance with the current global trends.

Priorities and challenges for skin cancer prevention in Europe: an expert survey	MELANOMA RESEARCH			English	Article						expert survey; prevention; skin cancer	CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; BREAST-CANCER; TRENDS; INTERVENTIONS; SURVIVAL; DISEASE; STAGE; OVERDIAGNOSIS; EUROMELANOMA; ASSOCIATION	The incidence, mortality, and survival rates of melanoma vary significantly across Europe, likely related to persistent inequalities between European countries in the areas of skin cancer early detection, case registration, and prevention. To enhance the planning of prevention strategies for skin cancer in Europe, we solicited the direct opinion of European experts in the field of dermatooncology on the main obstacles, needs, and priorities for the reduction of the skin cancer burden on this continent. We surveyed European dermatologists with leading positions in European and international organizations active in skin cancer prevention by means of written, single-choice and multiple-choice questionnaires. Fifty-two dermatologists from 32 European countries completed the survey (response rate 80%). Fewer respondents in Eastern Europe compared with Western Europe reported the presence of governmental (12 vs. 46%) or nongovernmental (35 vs. 65%) initiatives for skin cancer prevention. Most respondents in Eastern (73%) and Western Europe (69%) reported the existence of national cancer registries, but the confidence in the accuracy of melanoma registration was low. Public and professional education for early detection were top priorities for skin cancer campaigns across Europe and the perceived obstacles were similar in both regions: the lack of a national program of public education, insufficient public authority initiatives, and insufficient training of physicians on skin cancer. Our survey highlighted several areas requiring intervention for skin cancer prevention and found that the main issues and obstacles appear to be similar across Europe, creating the premise for coordinated, pan-European action.

Promises of Peace and Development Mining and Violence in Guatemala	ADVANCES IN NURSING SCIENCE			English	Article						colonialism; conflict; dispossession; Indigenous health; mining; peace; poverty	WORLD-BANK; HEALTH; OPERATIONS	For Indigenous peoples of Guatemala, mining is experienced within a lingering legacy of colonialism and genocide. Here, we discuss macro-level findings of a larger study, examining the lived context of a mining-affected community in Guatemala and barriers that this poses to peace. Using an anticolonial narrative methodology, guided by participatory action research principles, we interviewed 54 participants. Their accounts pointed to intersecting and ongoing forces of poverty, dispossession, gendered oppression, genocide, and global inequity were exacerbated and triggered by local mining operations. This context posed profound threats to community well-being and signals a call to action for nurses and other global actors.	[Caxaj, C.

Time to Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Is Longer and Developmental Outcomes Lower for Government Compared With Private Insurance	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Craniotomy; Disparities; Health inequity; Hemispherectomy; Socioeconomic	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE; UCLA EXPERIENCE; SEIZURE FREEDOM; SPECIALTY CARE; UNITED-STATES; HEALTH-CARE; DISPARITIES; CHILDREN; ACCESS	BACKGROUND: It is unclear if socioeconomic factors like type of insurance influence time to referral and developmental outcomes for pediatric patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study determined whether private compared with state government insurance was associated with shorter intervals of seizure onset to surgery and better developmental quotients for pediatric patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. METHODS: A consecutive cohort (n = 420) of pediatric patients undergoing epilepsy surgery were retrospectively categorized into those with Medicaid (California Children's Services; n = 91) or private (Preferred Provider Organization, Health Maintenance Organization, Indemnity; n = 329) insurance. Intervals from seizure onset to referral and surgery and Vineland developmental assessments were compared by insurance type with the use of log-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared with private insurance, children with Medicaid had longer intervals from seizure onset to referral for evaluation (log-rank test, P = .034), and from seizure onset to surgery (P = .017). In a subset (25%) that had Vineland assessments, children with Medicaid compared with private insurance had lower Vineland scores presurgery (P = .042) and postsurgery (P = .003). Type of insurance was not associated with seizure severity, types of operations, etiology, postsurgical seizure-free outcomes, and complication rate. CONCLUSION: Compared with Medicaid, children with private insurance had shorter intervals from seizure onset to referral and to epilepsy surgery, and this was associated with lower Vineland scores before surgery. These findings may reflect delayed access for uninsured children who eventually obtained state insurance. Reasons for the delay and whether longer intervals before epilepsy surgery affect long-term cognitive and developmental outcomes warrant further prospective investigations.

In the last decades the demographics of most Western countries have undergone a deep transformation, which has caused a steady increase in degenerative chronic diseases and has made maintaining health and social support by the welfare system difficult. This paper aims to present a set of indicators pertaining to the health status of the Italian population and to the national economic and social systems, as an aid to a better interpretation of the cancer burden impact and of its future tendencies. Material and methods. All indicators were derived from the ISTAT Health for All database. They were presented by region or macro area, globally or by gender, considering the most recent regional distribution and their time trends. The following features of the Italian population were chosen: percent of people aged over 65 years; life expectancy at birth; birth rate; crude and age-standardized overall mortality rates; dependency ratio; percent of single persons; percent of people with no more than a junior high school diploma; percent of people attaining at least the short first university degree; percent of people employed in the service and tertiary sectors; unemployment rate; incidence of poverty; total health expenditure (THE) as an absolute value and as percent of GDP; percent of public THE; percent of out-of-pocket THE of households; percent of smokers; proportion of overweight and obese people aged >= 18 years. Results. Italy presented an unbalanced demographic situation with an increasingly old population, a decreasing middle-aged age group, a low birth rate, high crude overall mortality rates, and decreasing standardized overall mortality rates. The Italian population is characterized by a constant increase in the dependency ratio and in the percentage of people living alone, together with increasing expenses for health care, both at the public and households levels. Smoking has reduced its impact in men but not yet in women. The increasing proportion of overweight and obese people may explain the convergence in time of the mortality rates of the different Italian macro areas. Discussion and conclusion. The Italian situation seems to be not well fitted to face the expected growing cancer burden. Along with the aging of the population, the corresponding lowering of the national GDP due to the persisting global economic crisis will lead the public sector and families to reduce health expenditure, while the number of people affected by cancer is bound to increase. Moreover, the social support provided by family members and the advantages of the Mediterranean dietary habits are declining. The strategies for facing the challenging evolution of the future should focus on successful primary prevention and a wider application of evidence-based medicine to optimize the choice of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures offered to citizens.

J	Mahmood, Q; Muntaner, C				Mahmood, Qamar; Muntaner, Carles			Politics, class actors, and health sector reform in Brazil and Venezuela	GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						governance; participation; politics; policy; empowerment; power; equity; social justice		Universal access to healthcare has assumed renewed importance in global health discourse, along with a focus on strengthening health systems. These developments are taking place in the backdrop of concerted efforts to advocate moving away from vertical, disease-based approaches to tackling health problems. While this approach to addressing public health problems is a step in the right direction, there is still insufficient emphasis on understanding the socio-political context of health systems. Reforms to strengthen health systems and achieve universal access to healthcare should be cognizant of the importance of the socio-political context, especially state-society relations. That context determines the nature and trajectory of reforms promoting universality or any pro-equity change. Brazil and Venezuela in recent years have made progress in developing healthcare systems that aim to achieve universal access. These achievements are noteworthy given that, historically, both countries had a long tradition of healthcare systems which were highly privatized and geared towards access to healthcare for a small segment of the population while the majority was excluded. These achievements are also remarkable since they took place in an era of neoliberalism when many states, even those with universally-based healthcare systems, were moving in the opposite direction. We analyze the socio-political context in each of these countries and look specifically at how the changing state-society relations resulted in health being constitutionally recognized as a social right. We describe the challenges that each faced in developing and implementing healthcare systems embracing universality. Our contention is that achieving the principle of universality in healthcare systems is less of a technical matter and more a political project. It involves opposition from the socially conservative elements in the society. Navigation to achieve this goal requires a political strategy that involves various actors within the state, the political society and civil society.

Understanding pattern of socioeconomic equalities in tobacco consumption in India will help in designing targeted public health control measures. Materials and Methods: Nationally representative data from the India Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) conducted in 2009-2010 was analyzed. The survey provided information on 69,030 respondents aged 15 years and above. Data were analyzed according to regions for estimating prevalence of current tobacco consumption (both smoking and smokeless) across wealth quintiles. Multiple logistic regression analysis predicted the impact of socioeconomic determinants on both forms of current tobacco consumption adjusting for other socio-demographic variables. Results: Trends of smoking and smokeless tobacco consumption across wealth quintiles were significant in different regions of India. Higher prevalence of smoking and smokeless tobacco consumption was observed in the medium wealth quintiles. Risk of tobacco consumption among the poorest compared to the richest quintile was 1.6 times higher for smoking and 3.1 times higher for smokeless forms. Declining odds ratios of both forms of tobacco consumption with rising education were visible across regions. Poverty was a strong predictor in north and south Indian region for smoking and in all regions for smokeless tobacco use. Conclusions: Poverty and poor education are strong risk factors for both forms of tobacco consumption in India. Public health policies, therefore, need to be targeted towards the poor and uneducated.

The objective of this study was to carry out a scoping review on social and health policies or interventions to tackle health inequalities in European cities published in scientific journals. Methods: Scoping review. The search was done in "PubMed" and the "Sociological Abstracts" database and was limited to articles published between 1995 and 2011. The inclusion criteria were: interventions had to take place in European cities and they had to state the reduction of health inequalities among their objectives. Results: A total of 54 papers were included, of which 35.2% used an experimental design, and 74.1% were carried out in the United Kingdom. The whole city was the setting in 27.8% of them and 44.4% were based on promoting healthy behaviours. Adults and children were the most frequent target population and half of the interventions had a universal approach and the other half a selective one. Half of the interventions were evaluated and showed positive results. Conclusions: Although health behaviours are not the main determinants of health inequalities, the majority of the selected documents were based on evaluations of interventions focusing on them.

J	Hunt, MR; Gogognon, P; Ridde, V				Hunt, Matthew R.; Gogognon, Patrick; Ridde, Valery			Ethical considerations related to participation and partnership: an investigation of stakeholders' perceptions of an action-research project on user fee removal for the poorest in Burkina Faso	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Action-research; Burkina Faso; Ethics; Participatory research; Partnership; Research ethics; User fees	CLINICAL-RESEARCH; GLOBAL HEALTH; WORST-OFF; COMMUNITY; IMPLEMENTATION; ISSUES; EQUITY; CARE	Background: Healthcare user fees present an important barrier for accessing services for the poorest (indigents) in Burkina Faso and selective removal of fees has been incorporated in national healthcare planning. However, establishing fair, effective and sustainable mechanisms for the removal of user fees presents important challenges. A participatory action-research project was conducted in Ouargaye, Burkina Faso, to test mechanisms for identifying those who are indigents, and funding and implementing user fee removal. In this paper, we explore stakeholder perceptions of ethical considerations relating to participation and partnership arising in the action-research. Methods: We conducted 39 in-depth interviews to examine ethical issues associated with the action-research. Respondents included 14 individuals identified as indigent through the community selection process, seven members of village selection committees, six local healthcare professionals, five members of the management committees of local health clinics, five members of the research team, and four regional or national policy-makers. Using constant comparative techniques, we carried out an inductive thematic analysis of the collected data. Results: The Ouargaye project involved a participatory model, included both implementation and research components, and focused on a vulnerable group within small, rural communities. Stakeholder perceptions and experiences relating to the participatory approach and reliance on multiple partnerships in the project were associated with a range of ethical considerations related to 1) seeking common ground through communication and collaboration, 2) community participation and risk of stigmatization, 3) impacts of local funding of the user fee removal, 4) efforts to promote fairness in the selection of the indigents, and 5) power relations and the development of partnerships. Conclusions: This investigation of the Ouargaye project serves to illuminate the distinctive ethical terrain of a participatory public health action-research project. In carrying out such projects, careful attention and effort is needed to establish and maintain respectful relationships amongst those involved, acknowledge and address differences of power and position, and evaluate burdens and risks for individuals and groups.

The associations between unhealthy behaviours, mental stress, and low socio-economic status in an international comparison of representative samples from Thailand and England	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Psychological stress; Psychosocial deprivation; Health behavior; Social class	OPEN-UNIVERSITY STUDENTS; HEALTH BEHAVIORS; NATIONAL COHORT; LIFE-SPAN; DEPRESSION; MORTALITY; DISPARITIES; INEQUALITY; ILLNESS; OBESITY	Background: Socioeconomic status is a recognised determinant of health status, and the association may be mediated by unhealthy behaviours and psychosocial adversities, which, in developed countries, both aggregate in low socioeconomic sectors of the population. We explored the hypothesis that unhealthy behavioural choices and psychological distress do not both aggregate in low socioeconomic status groups in developing countries. Methods: Our study is based on a cross-sectional comparison between national population samples of adults in England and Thailand. Psychological distress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) or three anxiety-oriented items from the Kessler scale (K6). Socioeconomic status was assessed on the basis of occupational status. We computed a health-behaviour score using information about smoking, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetable consumption, and physical activity. Results: The final sample comprised 40,679 participants. In both countries and in both genders separately, there was a positive association between poor health-behaviour and high psychological distress, and between high psychological distress and low socioeconomic status. In contrast, the association between low socioeconomic status and poor health-behaviour was positive in both English men and women, flat in Thai men, and was negative in Thai women (likelihood ratio test P <0.001). Conclusion: The associations between socioeconomic status, behavioural choices, and psychological distress are different at the international level. Psychological distress may be consistently associated with low socioeconomic status, whereas poor health-behaviour is not. Future analyses will test whether psychological distress is a more consistent determinant of socioeconomic differences in health across countries.

Christine			Foreign nurse recruitment: Global risk	NURSING ETHICS			English	Article						Economics; emigration; ethics; globalization; sustainability; workforce	INTERNATIONAL RECRUITMENT; HEALTH WORKFORCE; MIGRATION; POLICY	Recruitment of nurses by industrialized nations from developing countries has been common practice for decades. Globalization, a crucial trend of the 21st century, raises the world's awareness of the economic and social disparities between nations. The direct impact on nurse emigration emphasizes the ethical, economic, and social inequalities between source and destination countries. It is often more cost-effective for industrialized countries to recruit from developing countries; however, the depletion of source country resources has created a global healthcare crisis. Destination countries are being challenged on the ethical implications of aggressive recruitment and their lack of developing a sustainable self-sufficient domestic workforce. Similarly, source countries are confronting the same challenges as they struggle to fund and educate adequate numbers of nurses for domestic needs and emigrant replacement. This article will review the ethical, economic, and social impacts of continued unrestricted international recruitment of nurses and present a proposal for development of an international treaty addressing global sustainability.

However, citizens still have inequitable health-care systems. One component of such inequity relates to restricted financial access to health-care services. The recent uprisings in the Arab world, commonly referred to as the Arab spring, created a sociopolitical momentum that should be used to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). At present, many countries of the Arab spring are considering health coverage as a priority in dialogues for new constitutions and national policy agendas. UHC is also the focus of advocacy campaigns of a number of non-governmental organisations and media outlets. As part of the health in the Arab world Series in The Lancet, this report has three overarching objectives. First, we present selected experiences of other countries that had similar social and political changes, and how these events affected their path towards UHC.

J	McGovern, T				McGovern, Theresa			No risk, no gain: invest in women and girls by funding advocacy, organizing, litigation and work to shift culture	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						gender equality; women's status; international women's rights frameworks; sustainable development goals; national gender mechanisms; funding for women's rights; customary law; development aid; South Africa; Bangladesh	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; RIGHTS; COUNTRIES; PRIVATIZATION; REFORMS; TRENDS	The new development framework aspires to merge long-term hopes for environmental, political and financial sustainability with international poverty eradication goals. Central to this agenda is the promotion and protection of the human rights of women and girls. Yet national mechanisms, donors and international development agencies often do not fully tackle these issues or confront the accompanying politically sensitive, complex issues intermingling religion, socioeconomic status, social, cultural and family life. The increasing reliance on private investment may further weaken a women's rights approach. The proposed framework described in the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons Report could further systematize this problem, even though it improves on the MDGs by expanding targets related to women. Success will require support for a potent mix of advocacy, movement building and a complex set of ground-based strategies that shift cultural practices, laws and policies that harm women and girls. Funding for advocacy and interventions that hold firm on human rights is imperative, but given the conflicting loyalties of governments and public-private partnerships, reliance on either sector may be risky. An analysis of the status of women's rights work, infrastructure and donor support in Bangladesh and South Africa shows the need for vigilance and long-term investment in effective work.

J	Holmes, SM				Holmes, Seth M.			"Is it worth risking your life?": Ethnography, risk and death on the US-Mexico border	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						United States of America; Mexico; Border; Migration; Risk; Death; Ethnography	HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; IMMIGRATION	Every year, several hundred people die attempting to cross the border from Mexico into the United States, most often from dehydration and heat stroke though snake bites and violent assaults are also common. This article utilizes participant observation fieldwork in the borderlands of the US and Mexico to explore the experience of structural vulnerability and bodily health risk along the desert trek into the US. Between 2003 and 2005, the ethnographer recorded interviews and conversations with undocumented immigrants crossing the border, border patrol agents, border activists, borderland residents, and armed civilian vigilantes. In addition, he took part in a border crossing beginning in the Mexican state of Oaxaca and ending in a border patrol jail in Arizona after he and his undocumented Mexican research subjects were apprehended trekking through the borderlands. Field notes and interview transcriptions provide thick ethnographic detail demonstrating the ways in which social, ethnic, and citizenship differences as well as border policies force certain categories of people to put their bodies, health, and lives at risk in order for them and their families to survive. Yet, metaphors of individual choice deflect responsibility from global economic policy and US border policy, subtly blaming migrants for the danger - and sometimes death - they experience. The article concludes with policy changes to make US-Mexico labor migration less deadly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, A; Castillo, MG; Capewell, S; Lucy, J; O'Flaherty, M				Liu, Andrew; Castillo, Maria Guzman; Capewell, Simon; Lucy, John; O'Flaherty, Martin			Reduction in myocardial infarction admissions in Liverpool after the smoking ban: potential socioeconomic implications for policymaking	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						PUBLIC HEALTH; EPIDEMIOLOGY	FREE LEGISLATION; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; MORTALITY; ENGLAND	Objectives To analyse the trends and trend changes in myocardial infraction (MI) and coronary heart disease (CHD) admissions, to investigate the effects of the 2007 smoke-free legislation on these trends, and to consider the policy implications of any findings. Design setting Liverpool (city), UK. Participants Hospital episode statistics data on all 56995 admissions for CHD in Liverpool between 2004 and 2012 (International Classification of Diseases codes I20-I25 coded as an admission diagnosis within the defined dates). Primary and secondary outcome measures Trend gradient and change points (by trend regressions analysis) in age-standardised MI admissions in Liverpool between 2004 and 2012; by sex and by socioeconomic status. Secondary analysis on CHD admissions. Results A significant and sustained reduction was seen in MI admissions in Liverpool beginning within 1year of the smoking ban. Comparing 2005/2006 and 2010/2011, the age-adjusted rates for MI admissions fell by 42% (39-45%) (41.6% in men and by 42.6% in women). Trend analysis shows that this is significantly greater than the background trend of decreasing admissions. These reductions appeared consistent across all socioeconomic groups. Interestingly, admission rates for total CHD (including mild to severe angina) increased by 10% (8-12%). Conclusions A dramatic reduction in MI admissions in Liverpool has been observed coinciding with the smoking ban in 2007. Furthermore, the benefits were apparent across the socioeconomic spectrum. Health inequalities were not affected and may even have been reduced. The rapid effects observed with this top-down, environmental policy may further increase its value to policymakers.

These patients all need access to optimum health care. Population-based cancer survival is a key measure of the overall effectiveness of health systems in management of cancer. Survival varies very widely around the world. Global surveillance of cancer survival is needed, because unless these avoidable inequalities are measured, and reported on regularly, nothing will be done explicitly to reduce them.

Socioeconomic inequalities in smoking in low and mid income countries: positive gradients among women?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Smoking; Socio-economic status; Women; Inequalities; Smoking epidemic; Global; World health survey	TOBACCO USE; EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES; EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; HEALTH; PATTERNS; GENDER; TRENDS; MISCLASSIFICATION; EPIDEMIC; OLDER	Background: In Southern Europe, smoking among older women was more prevalent among the high educated than the lower educated, we call this a positive gradient. This is dominant in the early stages of the smoking epidemic model, later replaced by a negative gradient. The aim of this study is to assess if a positive gradient in smoking can also be observed in low and middle income countries in other regions of the world. Methods: We used data of the World Health Survey from 49 countries and a total of 233,917 respondents. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model associations between individual level smoking and both individual level and country level determinants. We stratified results by education, occupation, sex and generation (younger vs. older than 45). Countries were grouped based on GDP and region. Results: In Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean, we observed a positive gradient in smoking among older women and a negative gradient among younger women. In Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America no clear gradient was observed: inequalities were relatively small. In South-East Asia and East Asia a strong negative gradient was observed. Among men, no positive gradients were observed, and like women the strongest negative gradients were seen in South-East Asia and East Asia. Conclusions: A positive socio-economic gradient in smoking was found among older women in two regions, but not among younger women. But contrary to predictions derived from the smoking epidemic model, from a worldwide perspective the positive gradients are the exception rather than the rule.

J	Casey, V; Crooks, VA; Snyder, J; Turner, L				Casey, Victoria; Crooks, Valorie A.; Snyder, Jeremy; Turner, Leigh			Knowledge brokers, companions, and navigators: a qualitative examination of informal caregivers' roles in medical tourism	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Informal caregiving; Medical tourism; Global health services; Healthcare providers; Qualitative analysis; Family caregivers	FAMILY CAREGIVERS; CARE; COUNTRIES; DYNAMICS; THAILAND; INDUSTRY; SUPPORT; BURNOUT; IMPACT; CANCER	Introduction: Many studies examining the phenomena of medical tourism have identified health equity issues associated with this global health services practice. However, there is a notable lack of attention in this existing research to the informal care provided by the friends and family members who typically accompany medical tourists abroad. To date, researchers have not examined the care roles filled by informal caregivers travelling with medical tourists. In this article, we fill this gap by examining these informal caregivers and the roles they take on towards supporting medical tourists' health and wellbeing. Methods: We conducted 21 interviews with International Patient Coordinators (IPCs) working at medical tourism hospitals across ten countries. IPCs work closely with informal caregivers as providers of non-medical personal assistance, and can therefore offer broad insight on caregiver roles. The interviews were coded and analyzed thematically. Results: Three roles emerged: knowledge broker, companion, and navigator. As knowledge brokers, caregivers facilitate the transfer of information between the medical tourist and formal health care providers as well as other staff members at medical tourism facilities. The companion role involves providing medical tourists with physical and emotional care. Meanwhile, responsibilities associated with handling documents and coordinating often complex journeys are part of the navigation role. Conclusions: This is the first study to examine informal caregiving roles in medical tourism. Many of the roles identified are similar to those of conventional informal caregivers while others are specific to the transnational context. We conclude that these roles make informal caregivers an integral part of the larger phenomenon of medical tourism. We further contend that examining the roles taken on by a heretofore-unconsidered medical tourism stakeholder group sheds valuable insight into how this industry operates and that such knowledge is necessary in order to respond to the health equity debates that surround this particular global health services practice.

Health conditions were proxied by DALY rates for infectious and parasitic diseases, perinatal and maternal conditions, and nutritional deficiencies. Results show how the burden of considered diseases - and, particularly, of perinatal and maternal - is strongly and negatively related to national IQs even when income, education, and temperature or latitude are controlled for. The effect of education on national IQs is significant, but lesser than that of health. The burden of disease is a strong predictor of international differences in average cognitive abilities.

J	Byrne, A; Hodge, A; Jimenez-Soto, E; Morgan, A				Byrne, Abbey; Hodge, Andrew; Jimenez-Soto, Eliana; Morgan, Alison			Looking Beyond Supply: A Systematic Literature Review of Demand-Side Barriers to Health Service Utilization in the Mountains of Nepal	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						health care services; maternal and child health; health equity; inequalities in health; global health	MATERNAL HEALTH; CARE; ACCESS; PROGRAM; DELIVERY; ETHIOPIA	Significant disparities in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) outcomes and intervention coverage exist between the Mountains and other ecoregions of Nepal. Delivery of essential health services to remote mountainous areas is challenging and access is a known barrier to utilization. However, the contribution of demand-side barriers is poorly understood. Consequently, policies and programs cannot strategically target constraints to increase coverage. This systematic review identifies demand-side barriers to utilization of RMNCH services in the Mountain districts of Nepal. Research was drawn from MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Eldis, and unpublished literature. Beyond inaccessibility, utilization is undermined by costs of care-seeking, traditional attitudes and practices, low status of women, limited health knowledge, dissatisfaction with service quality, and low and inequitable care by community health workers. The intensity and repercussions of these barriers are of greater magnitude in the Mountains where delayed care-seeking combines with long distances for critical health consequences.

Much less is known about the impact of contextual factors, such as the socioeconomic circumstances, on the provision of care to socially marginalized groups. The objectives of this work were to assess the organisational characteristics of services providing mental health care for marginalized groups in 14 European capital cities and to explore the associations between organisational quality, service features and country-level characteristics. Methods: 617 services were assessed in two highly deprived areas in 14 European capital cities. A Quality Index of Service Organisation (QISO) was developed and applied across all sites. Service characteristics and country level socioeconomic indicators were tested and related with the Index using linear regressions and random intercept linear models. Results: The mean (standard deviation) of the QISO score (minimum = 0; maximum = 15) varied from 8.63 (2.23) in Ireland to 12.40 (2.07) in Hungary. The number of different programmes provided was the only service characteristic significantly correlated with the QISO (p < 0.05). The national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was inversely associated with the QISO. Nearly 15% of the variance of the QISO was attributed to country-level variables, with GDP explaining 12% of this variance. Conclusions: Socioeconomic contextual factors, in particular the national GDP are likely to influence the organisational quality of services providing mental health care for marginalized groups. Such factors should be considered in international comparative studies. Their significance for different types of services should be explored in further research.

It has been argued that sedentary time is likely to be additional to the risks associated with insufficient moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. New evidence identifies relationships of too much sitting with overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers and other adverse health outcomes. There is a need for a broader base of evidence on the likely health benefits of changing the relevant sedentary behaviours, particularly gathering evidence on underlying mechanisms and dose-response relationships. However, as remains the case for physical activity, there is a research agenda to be pursued in order to identify the potentially modifiable environmental and social determinants of sedentary behaviour. Such evidence is required so as to understand what might need to be changed in order to influence sedentary behaviours and to work towards population-wide impacts on prolonged sitting time. In this context, the research agenda needs to focus particularly on what can inform broad, evidence-based environmental and policy initiatives. We consider what has been learned from research on relationships of environmental and social attributes and physical activity; provide an overview of recent-emerging evidence on relationships of environmental attributes with sedentary behaviour; argue for the importance of conducting international comparative studies and addressing life-stage issues and socioeconomic inequalities and we propose a conceptual model within which this research agenda may be addressed.

Methods: Based on the proposals of British researchers, we sought to validate Quebec's material and social deprivation index using criteria of validity (content, criterion and construct validity), reliability and responsiveness, as well as other properties relevant to public health (comprehensibility, objectivity and practicality). Results: We reviewed the international literature on deprivation indices, as well as publications and uses of the Quebec index, to which we added factual data. Conclusion: Based on the review, it appears that the Quebec index responds favourably to the proposed validation criteria and properties. However, additional validations are required to better identify the contextual factors associated with the index.	[Pampalon, R.; Hamel, D.; Gamache, P.; Simpson, A.; Philibert, M.

Subjective social position shows people's self-location in a social hierarchy. Most studies on subjective social position have typically involved a few countries and neglected the role of national educational and occupational structures. We hypothesise that these characteristics, together with national-level economic factors, modify the effect of individual-level characteristics on subjective social location. Our expectations are based on extended reference group thesis, the big-fish-little-pond and stigmatisation arguments. The results of multi-level analysis indicated that the extent of educational and income inequalities in society as well as occupational structures influence the importance of individual incomes, education and occupations for estimating social position.

To conduct the review, the first two following steps were conducted iteratively and informed the third step: 1) Review of published peer-review literature since 2000; and 2) Review of grey literature; and 3) Quasi-realist synthesis of evidence. Evidence from three perspectives were examined: i) whether interventions can improve 'resilience' for vulnerable children and youth; ii) whether there is a differential effect among different populations; and, iii) whether there is evidence that resilience interventions 'close the gap' on health and social outcome measures. Definitions of resilience vary as do perspectives on it. We argue for a hybrid approach that recognizes the value of combining multiple theoretical perspectives, epistemologies (positivistic and constructivist/interpretive/critical) in studying resilience. Resilience is: a) a process (rather than a single event), b) a continuum (rather than a binary outcome), and c) likely a global concept with specific dimensions. Individual, family and social environmental factors influence resilience. A social determinants perspective on resilience and mental health is emphasized. Programs and interventions to promoting resilience should be complimentary to public health measures addressing the social determinants of health. A whole community approach to resilience is suggested as a step toward closing the public health policy gap. Local initiatives that stimulate a local transformation process are needed. Recognition of each child's or youth's intersections of gender, lifestage, family resources within the context of their identity markers fits with a localized approach to resilience promotion and, at the same time, requires recognition of the broader determinants of population health.

This study aims to evaluate user satisfaction with primary healthcare services. A sample of 6,113 healthcare services users was interviewed to evaluate satisfaction and determine a global satisfaction index using a Partial Least Squares Path Model. The global user satisfaction index with healthcare centers is 58.4 points on a 100-point scale, showing that users are only moderately satisfied with the service provided. The results show that the medical care and the price of services are the main predictors of user satisfaction. Other factors such as the perception of health equity and nursing services also seem to be important contributors to satisfaction. A more disturbing result is the negative relationship between perceived accessibility and satisfaction, which requires further research.

Risks of Emerging Infectious Diseases: Evolving Threats in a Changing Area, the Mediterranean Basin	TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES			English	Review						emerging infectious diseases; Mediterranean region; global changes; risk factors	WEST NILE VIRUS; BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS; CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; PLAGUE; SURVEILLANCE; CLIMATE; CATTLE; AGRICULTURE; POPULATIONS	The Mediterranean basin is a biodiversity hotspot; it has historically had a large human presence that has shaped ecosystems for millennia. As the cradle of many civilizations, the area was one of the main theatres for transitions that punctuated both human and pathogen histories, which are intimately linked. Today we are living through another great historical transition summarized in the expression global changes'. In this context, we are witnessing a rise in the emergence of pathogens widely associated with aforementioned global changes. The Mediterranean basin might be especially vulnerable to this phenomenon due to the acute consequences global changes will have in this key intercontinental interface region. In addition, Arab revolutions and European economic crisis are creating both sanitary issues and presenting new opportunities to improve infectious disease control and prevention in the region. The aim of this review is to identify the impacts that ongoing changes might have on the risk of infectious disease emergence in the Mediterranean basin. We focussed on three key domains undergoing transformations: (i) resources, namely safe drinking water and animal products, (ii) socio-economic factors including health inequalities within countries and poor sanitary conditions linked to ongoing conflicts and (iii) movements of people and goods that are reshaped by current changes and are intimately linked to the risk of disease proliferation. Building on recent examples, we try to identify upcoming challenges and discuss ways to meet them in the light of existing international human and veterinary health guidelines and their possible improvements.

Democratizing Molecular Diagnostics for the Developing World	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY			English	Review						Molecular diagnostics; Nanotechnology; Developing world; PCR	DISEASE	Objectives: Infectious diseases that are largely treatable continue to pose a tremendous burden on the developing world despite the availability of highly potent drugs. The high mortality and morbidity rates of these diseases are largely due to a lack of affordable diagnostics that are accessible to resource-limited areas and that can deliver high-quality results. In fact, modified molecular diagnostics for infectious diseases were rated as the top biotechnology to improve health in developing countries. Methods: In this review, we describe the characteristics of accessible molecular diagnostic tools and discuss the challenges associated with implementing such tools at low infrastructure sites. Results: We highlight our experience as part of the "Grand Challenge" project supported by the Gates Foundation for addressing global health inequities and describe issues and solutions associated with developing adequate technologies or molecular assays needed for broad access in the developing world Conclusions: We believe that sharing this knowledge will facilitate the development of new molecular technologies that are extremely valuable for improving global health.

Isolated from an initial and non-discriminate England-wide clustering analysis of 73 Audit Commission-defined quality of life indicators, the results of our study reveal that pivotal to London's prevailing quality of life distribution is the influence of deprivation, health and educational inequalities, all of which are masked at a pure inner' and outer' London comparison, capable only of distinguishing the city's borough-level transport and community safety diversity. The policy implications of our study are duly considered and several methodological insights are advanced for future research.

J	Nascimento, GL; de Oliveira, MRF				Nascimento, Gilmara Lima; Fernandes de Oliveira, Maria Regina			Severe forms of schistosomiasis mansoni: epidemiologic and economic impact in Brazil, 2010	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE			English	Article						Cost of illness; Mortality; PYLL; Schistosoma mansoni		Schistosoma mansoni infection is generally asymptomatic at the initial stage. However, patients left untreated can develop severe, potentially fatal clinical disease. In Brazil, S. mansoni transmission occurs in 19 states and, despite the contribution of infection to the cycle of poverty and disease, the economic impact of severe cases is unclear. Our objectives were to estimate the epidemiological burden and the costs of severe stages of S. mansoni in Brazil in 2010. We conducted an epidemiologic descriptive study and a partial economic evaluation of cost-of-illness. The study population was identified from records of notifications, hospitalizations and deaths related to S. mansoni in the respective information systems. The mortality rate for S. mansoni was 0.3 deaths per 100 000 population, which represented 1.1 of the deaths in Brazil from infectious diseases listed in Chapter I of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10(th) revision (ICD 10), and almost 9.0 of deaths from infection diseases in the state of Pernambuco. We calculated 6419 potential years of life lost (PYLL) to S. mansoni. The costs estimated within the public health sector totaled R$889 049.58 (US$495 016.47) and the costs of productivity losses reached R$ 35 725 332.72 (US$ 19 891 590.86) in terms of salaries lost as a result of premature death or absence from work. The cost-of-illness related to S. mansoni in Brazil was R$ 36 614 382.30 (US$ 20 386 627.12). The severe cases of S. mansoni disease still occurring in Brazil have an important epidemiologic and economic impact, representing a significant loss for society. The development of severe cases of a neglected parasitic disease that is preventable and responsive to primary healthcare intervention should be considered an expression of inequity. Our findings provide important evidence to support the strengthening of public health measures and investment to reduce poverty-related diseases in Brazil today.

Methods: The cross-country data were collected from 91 countries from the United Nations agencies in 2012. LE is the response variable with demographics (total fertility rate, and adolescent fertility rate), socioeconomic status (mean year of schooling, and gross national income per capita), and health factors (physician density, and HIV prevalence rate) are as the three main predictors. Stepwise multiple regression analysis is used to extract the main factors. Results: The necessity of more healthcare resources and higher levels of socioeconomic advantages are more likely to increase LE. On the other hand, demographic changes and health factors are more likely to increase LE by way of decease fertility rates and disease prevalence. Conclusion: These findings suggest that international efforts should aim at increasing LE, especially in the low income countries through the elimination of HIV prevalence, adolescent fertility, and illiteracy.

Redistributive policies aimed at reducing social inequalities, such as a welfare state and labour market policies, have shown a positive association with selected health indicators. In this study, we investigated the influence of redistributive policies specifically on the social environment of early child development in five countries with different political traditions. The objective of this analysis was to highlight similarities and differences in social and health services between the countries and their associations with other health outcomes that can inform better global early child development policies and improve early child health and development. Methods: Four social determinants of early child development were selected to provide a cross-section of key time periods in a child's life from prenatal to kindergarten. They included: 1) prenatal care, 2) maternal leave, 3) child health care, and 4) child care and early childhood education. We searched international databases and reports (e.g. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Bank, and UNICEF) to obtain information about early child development policies, services and outcomes. Results: Although a comparative analysis cannot claim causation, our analysis suggests that redistributive policies aimed at reducing social inequalities are associated with a positive influence on the social determinants of early child development. Generous redistributive policies are associated with a higher maternal leave allowance and pay and more preventive child healthcare visits. A decreasing trend in infant mortality, low birth weight rate, and under five mortality rate were observed with an increase in redistributive policies. No clear influence of redistributive policies was observed on breastfeeding and immunization rates. In the analysis of child care and early education, the lack of uniform measures of early child development outcomes was apparent. Conclusions: This paper provides further support for an association between redistributive policies and early child health and development outcomes, along with the organization of early child health and development services.

A systematic review of published guidance for the economic evaluation of public health interventions within this broad public policy paradigm was conducted. Methods: Electronic databases and organisation websites were searched using a 22 year time horizon (1990-2012). References of papers were hand searched for additional papers for inclusion. Government reports or peer-reviewed published papers were included if they; referred to the methods of economic evaluation of public health interventions, identified key challenges of conducting economic evaluations of public health interventions or made recommendations for conducting economic evaluations of public health interventions. Guidance was divided into three categories UK guidance, international guidance and observations or guidance provided by individual commentators in the field of public health economics. An assessment of the theoretical frameworks underpinning the guidance was made and served as a rationale for categorising the papers. Results: We identified 5 international guidance documents, 7 UK guidance documents and 4 documents by individual commentators. The papers reviewed identify the main methodological challenges that face analysts when conducting such evaluations. There is a consensus within the guidance that wider social and environmental costs and benefits should be looked at due to the complex nature of public health. This was reflected in the theoretical underpinning as the majority of guidance was categorised as extra-welfarist. Conclusions: In this novel review we argue that health economics may have come full circle from its roots in broad public policy economics. We may find it useful to think in this broader paradigm with respect to public health economics. We offer a 12 point checklist to support government, NHS commissioners and individual health economists in their consideration of economic evaluation methodology with respect to the additional challenges of applying health economics to public health.

J	Desclaux, A				Desclaux, Alice			When a prevention policy leads to economic vulnerability: the case of PMTCT in Senegal	GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						breastfeeding; health policies; HIV; medically induced poverty; PMTCT; Senegal; transitions	HEALTH	When, in 2010, a new PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) strategy replaced the provision of infant formula to mothers living with HIV by a prophylaxis based on antiretrovirals, some Senegalese couples decided to purchase infant formula on their own, thereby risking medically induced poverty'. This case study analyzes the emergence of a situation of economic vulnerability generated by a public health policy that is nevertheless globally appropriate in terms of accessibility and epidemiological effectiveness. Because of the gap between the rationales of institutions at the international and national levels and those of people on the ground', a strategy that has been defined as progress in terms of equity is interpreted as a regression creating inequality. This situation stems from several determinants analyzed in this article: rapid and poorly managed transition from one strategy to another, different perceptions of acceptable risk levels, and inadequate communication of information by care providers.

Small studies suggest high, and increasing, prevalence especially in urban areas, with poor detection and management, but national data has been lacking. The aim of the current study was to use nationally-representative survey data to examine socio-demographic inequalities in the prevalence, diagnosis and management of hypertension in Indian adults. Methods: Using data on self-reported diagnosis and treatment, and blood pressure measurement, collected from 12,198 respondents aged 18+ in the 2007 WHO Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health in India, factors associated with prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension were investigated. Results: 22% men and 26% women had hypertension; prevalence increased steeply with body mass index (<18.5 kg/m(2) : 18% men, 21% women; 25-29.9 kg/m(2) : 35% men, 35% women), was higher in the least poor vs. poorest (men: odds ratio (95% CI) 1.82 (1.20 to 2.76); women: 1.40 (1.08 to 1.81)), urban vs. rural men (1.64 (1.19 to 2.25)), and men recently vs. never using alcohol (1.96 (1.40 to 2.76)). Over half the hypertension in women, and 70% in men, was undetected with particularly poor detection rates in young urban men, and in poorer households. Two-thirds of men and women with detected hypertension were treated. Two-thirds of women treated had their hypertension controlled, irrespective of urban/rural setting or wealth. Adequate blood pressure control was sub-optimal in urban men. Conclusion: Hypertension is very common in India, even among underweight adults and those of lower socioeconomic position. Improved detection is needed to reduce the burden of disease attributable to hypertension. Levels of treatment and control are relatively good, particularly in women, although urban men require more careful attention.

Cost-effectiveness of a new rotavirus vaccination program in Pakistan: A decision tree model	VACCINE			English	Article						Rotavirus; Gastroenteritis; Cost-effectiveness; Vaccination; Pakistan	GLOBAL BURDEN; DISEASE; CHILDREN; GASTROENTERITIS; SURVEILLANCE; EFFICACY; HEALTH; IMPACT; IMMUNIZATION; STRATEGIES	Background: Rotavirus gastroenteritis places a significant health and economic burden on Pakistan. To determine the public health impact of a national rotavirus vaccination program, we performed a cost-effectiveness study from the perspective of the health care system. Methods: A decision tree model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a national vaccination program in Pakistan. Disease and cost burden with the program were compared to the current state. Disease parameters, vaccine-related costs, and medical treatment costs were based on published epidemiological and economic data, which were specific to Pakistan when possible. An annual birth cohort of children was followed for 5 years to model the public health impact of vaccination on health-related events and costs. The cost-effectiveness was assessed and quantified in cost (2012 US$) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted and cost per death averted. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: The base case results showed vaccination prevented 1.2 million cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis, 93,000 outpatient visits, 43,000 hospitalizations, and 6700 deaths by 5 years of age for an annual birth cohort scaled from 6% current coverage to DPT3 levels (85%). The medical cost savings would be US$1.4 million from hospitalizations and US$200,000 from outpatient visit costs. The vaccination program would cost US$35 million at a vaccine price of US$5.00. The ICER was US$149.50 per DALY averted or US$4972 per death averted. Sensitivity analyses showed changes in case-fatality ratio, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine cost exerted the greatest influence on the ICER. Conclusions: Across a range of sensitivity analyses, a national rotavirus vaccination program was predicted to decrease health and economic burden due to rotavirus gastroenteritis in Pakistan by similar to 40%. Vaccination was highly cost-effective in this context. As discussions of implementing the intervention intensify, future studies should address affordability, efficiency, and equity of vaccination introduction. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Promoting oral health of children through schools - Results from a WHO global survey 2012	COMMUNITY DENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						child oral health; school oral health policy; health promotion; setting for oral health; school based prevention; organization of school oral health programmes	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL; DENTAL-HEALTH; EDUCATION-PROGRAM; CARIES; PREVENTION; DENMARK; MILK; 21ST-CENTURY; INEQUALITIES; ADOLESCENTS	This paper reviews the range of school-based approaches to oral health and describes what is meant by a Health Promoting School. The paper then reports the results of a World Health Organization global survey of school-based health promotion. Purposive sampling across 100 countries produced 108 evaluations of school oral health projects spread across 61 countries around the globe. The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion noted that schools can provide a supportive environment for promoting children's health. However, while a number of well-known strategies are being applied, the full range of health promoting actions is not being used globally. A greater emphasis on integrated health promotion is advised in place of narrower, disease-or project-specific approaches. Recommendations are made for improving this situation, for further research and for specifying an operational framework for sharing experiences and research.

Evidence from a world sample suggests that genetic distance, interpreted as long-term cultural and biological divergence, is an important factor in understanding health inequalities across countries. Specifically, the paper documents a remarkably robust negative link between genetic distance to the United States and population health as measured by life expectancy at birth and the adult survival rate even after accounting for an extensive set of possible confounders, such as GDP per capita and various climatic factors. Consistent with the interpretation that genetic distance is related to population health indirectly through human barriers to the diffusion of modern health technologies, the evidence indicates that the gene gradient emerges at the onset of the international epidemiological transition.

METHODS: Official information on deaths and population in the city of Sao Paulo, 2003 to 2009, were used to estimate mortality rates from oral cancer (C00 to C10, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision), adjusted for age and stratified by gender (females and males) and race (blacks and whites). The Prais-Winsten auto-regression procedure was used to analyse the time series. RESULTS: During the study period, 8,505 individuals living in the city of Sao Paulo died of oral cancer. Rates increased for females (rate of yearly increase = 4.4%, 95%CI 1.4; 7.5), and levelled off for men, which represents an inversion of previous trends among genders in the city. Increases were identified for blacks, with a high rate of yearly increase of 9.1% (95%CI 5.5; 12.9), and levelled off for whites. Oral cancer mortality in blacks almost doubled during the study period, and surpassed mortality in whites for almost all categories. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality presented a higher increase among women than in men, and it doubled among backs. The surveillance of trends of oral cancer mortality across gender and racial groups may contribute to implementing socially appropriate health policies, which concurrently reduce the burden of disease and the attenuation of unfair, avoidable and unnecessary inequalities in health.

While the statistics of smoking prevalence in Poland are available, data on smoking initiation and its social correlates are still poorly described. Objective: To investigate the association of socio-demographic indicators with regular smoking initiation among adults. Materials and method: Data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) on socio-demographic and smoking-related characteristics of respondents were used. GATS is a nationally representative household survey. GATS provided data on a representative sample of 7,840 adult individuals 2,207 male and 1,321 female ever smokers. Logistic regression analysis Was performed and the chi 2 test for relevant calculations. Results: Among males, the regular smoking initiation rate was significantly higher compared to females (59.2% vs. 34.2%; p<0.01). Mean age of smoking initiation was lower in men compared to women (18.4 +/- 3.6 vs. 20.0 +/- 4.7 p < 0.01). Lack of awareness on smoking health consequences was strongly associated with initiating of regular smoking among both genders (unaware vs. aware respondents: OR = 3.0 CI 2.3-4.0; p < 0.001 in men and OR = 3.07 CI 2.3-3.9; p<0.001 in women). Older age, vocational education and unemployment were associated with regular smoking initiation among men and women. Also, not being religious considerably contributed to increased likelihood of smoking initiation in women (OR = 4.4 CI 2.5-7.7; p<0.001). Conclusion: The results indicate that policies focused on preventing smoking onset among Poles are needed to reduce tobacco epidemic, with the ultimate goal of translating evidence into policy.

This study analyzes the trend and disease burden of injury deaths in Chinese population from 2004 to 2010, using data from the National Disease Surveillance Points (DSPs) system, as injury deaths are classified based on the International Classification of Disease-10th Revision (ICD-10). We observed that injury death accounted for nearly 10% of all deaths in China throughout the period 2004-2010, and the injury mortality rates were higher in males than those in females, and higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Traffic crashes (33.79-38.47% of all injury deaths) and suicides (16.20-22.01%) were the two leading causes of injury deaths. Alarmingly, suicide surpassed traffic crashes as the leading cause of injury mortality in rural females, yet adults aged 65 and older suffered the greatest number of fatal falls (20,701 deaths, 2004-2010). The burden of injury among men (72.11%) was about three times more than that of women's (28.89%). This study provides indispensible evidence that China Authority needs to improve the surveillance and deterrence of three major types of injuries: Traffic-related injury deaths should be targeted for injury prevention activities in all population, people aged 65+ should be encouraged to take individual fall precautions, and prevention of suicidal behavior in rural females should be another key priority for the government of China.

Incidence has been associated with poverty and is also reported to disproportionately affect indigenous peoples, many of whom live in poor socioeconomic circumstances and experience lower standards of health. In this comprehensive assessment, we explore the burden of stomach cancer among indigenous peoples globally. Design The literature was searched systematically for studies on stomach cancer incidence, mortality and survival in indigenous populations, including Indigenous Australians, Maori in New Zealand, indigenous peoples from the circumpolar region, native Americans and Alaska natives in the USA, and the Mapuche peoples in Chile. Data from the New Zealand Health Information Service and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program were used to estimate trends in incidence. Results Elevated rates of stomach cancer incidence and mortality were found in almost all indigenous peoples relative to corresponding non-indigenous populations in the same regions or countries. This was particularly evident among Inuit residing in the circumpolar region (standardised incidence ratios (SIR) males: 3.9, females: 3.6) and in Maori (SIR males: 2.2, females: 3.2). Increasing trends in incidence were found for some groups. Conclusions We found a higher burden of stomach cancer in indigenous populations globally, and rising incidence in some indigenous groups, in stark contrast to the decreasing global trends. This is of major public health concern requiring close surveillance and further research of potential risk factors. Given evidence that improving nutrition and housing sanitation, and Helicobacter pylori eradication programmes could reduce stomach cancer rates, policies which address these initiatives could reduce inequalities in stomach cancer burden for indigenous peoples.

Community health psychology can benefit by focusing on interventions through mediating structures that develop innovative methods of leveraging power in the context of globalizing economic forces. Promising methods include careful analysis of power within targeted policy domains and developing strategic alliances with others, so as to exercise social power to affect policy change. The case of ISAIAH, an organizing group based in Minnesota, illustrates innovative avenues for intervention in the context of globalization.

J	Hochman, O; Skopek, N				Hochman, Oshrat; Skopek, Nora			The impact of wealth on subjective well-being: A comparison of three welfare-state regimes	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY			English	Article						Subjective well-being; Welfare-state; Income; Wealth; SHARE	LIFE SATISFACTION; ECONOMIC-STATUS; INCOME; HEALTH; HAPPINESS; DEBT; INEQUALITY; INCREASE; NATIONS; WORLD	This paper provides new insights into the association between economic standing and subjective well-being (SWB) among aging individuals in three industrialized countries: Germany, Israel, and Sweden. Specifically, we compare the effects of wealth, in line with the growing consensus that wealth is an important determinant of economic standing alongside income, on SWB across three welfare-state regimes: conservative (Germany), liberal (Israel), and social-democratic (Sweden). Drawing on needs theory, we hypothesize that individuals of poor wealth would report lower levels of SWB in all countries. We expect, however, the association between poor wealth and SWB to be stronger in the liberal system (Israel) and weaker in the conservative system (Germany) with the weakest effect found in the social-democratic system (Sweden) due to differences in the extent of social benefits each welfare-state regime provides its residents. To test our hypotheses, we utilize data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE(1)). Results indicate that income and wealth explain a greater part of the variance in SWB when taken together. We find a 'poor penalty' on SWB in Germany and Israel while in Sweden wealth has no impact on SWB. Finally, when controlling for subjective economic hardship (needs), the negative effect of poor wealth on SWB disappears in Germany, but maintains significance in Israel, suggesting that needs theory alone cannot explain the poor penalty in Israel. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the welfare-state has an impact on the wealth SWB relation and that the mechanisms that underlie this relation operate differently in Germany and Israel.

Localization of health systems in low- and middle-income countries in response to long-term increases in energy prices	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Health systems reform; Climate change; Decentralization; Rural health; Localization; Access to care; Developing countries	PUBLIC-HEALTH; PEAK OIL; FOOD SYSTEMS; USER FEES; DECENTRALIZATION; WORLD; CARE; INTEGRATION; PETROLEUM; SUSTAINABILITY	External challenges to health systems, such as those caused by global economic, social and environmental changes, have received little attention in recent debates on health systems' performance in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). One such challenge in coming years will be increasing prices for petroleum-based products as production from conventional petroleum reserves peaks and demand steadily increases in rapidly-growing LMICs. Health systems are significant consumers of fossil fuels in the form of petroleum-based medical supplies; transportation of goods, personnel and patients; and fuel for lighting, heating, cooling and medical equipment. Long-term increases in petroleum prices in the global market will have potentially devastating effects on health sectors in LMICs who already struggle to deliver services to remote parts of their catchment areas. We propose the concept of "localization," originating in the environmental sustainability literature, as one element of response to these challenges. Localization assigns people at the local level a greater role in the production of goods and services, thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and other external inputs. Effective localization will require changes to governance structures within the health sector in LMICs, empowering local communities to participate in their own health in ways that have remained elusive since this goal was first put forth in the Alma-Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care in 1978. Experiences with decentralization policies in the decades following Alma-Ata offer lessons on defining roles and responsibilities, building capacity at the local level, and designing appropriate policies to target inequities, all of which can guide health systems to adapt to a changing environmental and energy landscape.

Global health architecture is complex and better coordination is needed between multiple organizations. Three overlapping themes determine global health action and prioritization: development, security, and public health. These themes play out against a background of demographic change, socioeconomic development, and urbanization. Infectious diseases remain critical factors, but are no longer the major cause of global illness and death. Traditional indicators of public health, such as maternal and infant mortality rates no longer describe the health status of whole societies; this change highlights the need for investment in vital registration and disease-specific reporting. Noncommunicable diseases, injuries, and mental health will require greater attention from the world in the future. The new global health requires broader engagement by health organizations and all countries for the objectives of health equity, access, and coverage as priorities beyond the Millennium Development Goals are set.

The review is divided into 4 major areas: professional issues, work and well-being, life-span perspectives, and career theory and concepts. Subsumed within these clusters are foci on the status of career/vocational guidance around the globe, the career development experiences of immigrants, and the effects of economic stress. The authors offer three summarizing impressions. First, the 2012 collection is definitively global; this is a credit to the individual and institutional dimensions of the counseling profession. Second, the research articles represent a wide array of methodological approaches, and researchers have made wise research design choices for their areas of inquiry. Third, there is a true professional responsiveness to the needs of the world. It is suggested that the 2012 literature reflects Parsons's early vision of social justice and multiculturalism.

One important contribution of the paper is the inclusion of preexisting health conditions in the needs standardization procedure with the aim of taking into account utilization due to diagnosis or follow-up reasons. We find evidence of pro-rich inequalities in blood test use in some countries while high inequalities emerge in virtually every country with respect to mammography use. Decomposition analysis reveals that inequalities in mammography use are mostly driven by income while preventive needs distribution is only slightly pro-rich. On the other side, richer individuals appear to be much more likely to do blood tests despite their substantially lower diagnostic needs for that care. Generally, inequalities in mammography use are higher in countries without national breast cancer screening programs or in countries with only regional or less participated programs. Inequalities in blood tests are higher in countries with a high share of out-of-pocket payments and/or non universalistic entitlement to insurance coverage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A review of medical and substance use co-morbidities in Central Asian prisons: Implications for HIV prevention and treatment	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Review						Prisoners; Substance use disorders; Addiction; HIV; Tuberculosis; Injection drug use; HIV prevention; Central Asia; Republic of Azerbaijan	INJECTING DRUG-USE; ANTIRETROVIRAL ADHERENCE; METHADONE-MAINTENANCE; INFECTED PRISONERS; TUBERCULOSIS; PEOPLE; CARE	Background: HIV incidence in Central Asia is rising rapidly. People who inject drugs (PWIDs) contribute greatest to the epidemic, with more than a quarter of all HIV cases being in the criminal justice system (CIS). This review assembled and aggregated recent data on drug-related health problems and respective healthcare services in the CIS of Central Asia and the Republic of Azerbaijan. Methods: Online databases and published literature (peer-reviewed and gray) were reviewed. Additionally, prison officials in the 6 countries were invited to participate in a survey and prison administrators from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan completed it. Results: The data on conditions and healthcare in Central Asian prisons are inconsistent and lack unbiased details. Reporting is primarily based on "official" disease registries, which markedly underestimate prevalence. Even these limited data, however, indicate that HIV prevalence and drug-related health problems are high, concentrated and, in some countries, rising rapidly in CIS. Only some of the range of HIV prevention interventions recommended by international organizations have been implemented in the region with two of the crucial interventions, needle and syringe exchange programs (NSP) and opioid substitution therapy (OST), only available in prisons in Kyrgyzstan, with Tajikistan implementing a pilot NSP and contemplating introduction of prison-based OST. Conclusions: Despite deficiencies in routine health reporting and insufficient HIV sentinel surveillance undertaken in prisons, the data available on the concentration of HIV within at-risk populations in prisons indicate a necessity to broaden the range and increase the scale the scale of HIV prevention and treatment services.

J	Krishnamurthy, M; Herder, M				Krishnamurthy, Meena; Herder, Matthew			Justice in Global Pandemic Influenza Preparedness: An Analysis Based on the Values of Contribution, Ownership and Reciprocity	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article							FRAMEWORK	In December 2006, Indonesia decided to stop sending influenza virus specimens to the World Health Organization's Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN). Indonesia justified its actions by claiming that they were in protest of the injustice of GISN. Its actions stimulated negotiations to improve the workings of GISN by developing and implementing a more just framework for 'sharing influenza viruses and other benefits'. These negotiations eventually led to the adoption of a new framework for virus and benefit sharing in May 2011, at the World Health Assembly meeting. In this article, we critically evaluate Indonesia's claims about the unjustness of GISN. We show that arguments based on the values of ownership, contribution and reciprocity work together to support Indonesia's claim that it was owed an equal share in the benefits of GISN and, in turn, that GISN was unjust because of its failure to ensure this. We also use these values to evaluate the newly agreed upon framework for virus and benefit sharing. We suggest the new framework fails to give proper consideration to the values of ownership, contribution and reciprocity and, as a result, that it is fundamentally unjust.

We used time-series and longitudinal cross-national analysis of 127 countries from 1980 to 2008. Data on mean adult BMI were obtained from the Global Burden of Metabolic Risk Factors of Chronic Diseases Collaborating Group. Globalization was measured using the Swiss Economic Institute (KOF) index of economic globalization. Economic inequality between countries was measured with the mean difference in gross domestic product per capita purchasing power parity in international dollars. Economic inequality within countries was measured using the Gini index from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database. Other covariates including poverty, population size, urban population, openness to trade and foreign direct investment were taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Time-series regression analyses showed that the global increase in BMI is positively associated with both the index of economic globalization and inequality between countries, after adjustment for covariates. Longitudinal panel data analyses showed that the association between economic globalization and BMI is robust after controlling for all covariates and using different estimators. The association between economic inequality within countries and BMI, however, was significant only among high-income nations. More research is needed to study the pathways between economic globalization and BMI. These findings, however, contribute to explaining how contemporary globalization can be reformed to promote better health and control the global obesity epidemic.

The four-round Delphi study reveals high conformity on the proposed treatment-related issues. However, some points of divergence remain. Three controversies underpinning these disagreements are discussed. The first regards the treatment and control debate, the second concerns the dual role of assessment in forensic mental health care and the third describes potential entry conditions for treatment in a FPC. Further research is needed to scientifically underpin the above mentioned debates. In this regard, the study suggests a close collaboration between practitioners and researchers.

Although Italy has been malaria-free since 1970, the infection is commonly introduced into the country by travelers and immigrants from endemic areas. The term VFRs refers to immigrants from malaria-endemic countries who are regularly resident in a malaria-free area, and who travel to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFRs). This group is at special risk of malaria as they are unaware of having lost their transitory immunity to the disease. Methods. We conducted a retrospective study at the International Travelers Department of Palermo (Italy), examining records of malaria cases (67) reported over the period from 1998 to 2013. Results. VFRs represent the highest number of cases (77.6%), followed by workers (16.4%) and tourists (6.0%). All female patients and patients under the age of 18 were VFRs. Plasmodium falciparum was the most frequently-identified species. In all cases, chemoprophylaxis was not taken or was incomplete. Conclusions. VFRs are at high risk of contracting malaria. This is probably related to an inequality in health care available to immigrants, as well as to ethnic and cultural conditions.

Trauma Quality Indicator Consensus	Development and Evaluation of Evidence-Informed Quality Indicators for Adult Injury Care	ANNALS OF SURGERY			English	Article							AMERICAN-COLLEGE; AUDIT FILTERS; TRAUMA CARE; IMPROVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; RATINGS	Objective: To develop and evaluate evidence-informed quality indicators of adult injury care. Background: Injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, but there is a lack of consensus regarding how to evaluate injury care. Methods: Using a modification of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology, a panel of 19 injury and quality of care experts serially rated and revised quality indicators identified from a systematic review of the literature and international audit of trauma center quality improvement practices. The quality indicators developed by the panel were sent to 133 verified trauma centers in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for evaluation. Results: A total of 84 quality indicators were rated and revised by the expert panel over 4 rounds of review producing 31 quality indicators of structure (n = 5), process (n = 21), and outcome (n = 5), designed to assess the safety (n = 8), effectiveness (n = 17), efficiency (n = 6), timeliness (n = 16), equity (n = 2), and patient-centeredness (n = 1) of injury care spanning prehospital (n = 8), hospital (n = 19), and posthospital (n = 2) care and secondary injury prevention (n = 1). A total of 101 trauma centers (76% response rate) rated the indicators (1 = strong disagreement, 9 = strong agreement) as targeting important health improvements (median score 9, interquartile range [IQR] 8-9), easy to interpret (median score 8, IQR 8-9), easy to implement (median score 8, IQR 7-8), and globally good indicators (median score 8, IQR 8-9). Conclusions: Thirty-one evidence-informed quality indicators of adult injury care were developed, shown to have content validity, and can be used as performance measures to guide injury care quality improvement practices.

This was largely due to political prevarication in the midst of AIDS denialism. There has been an unprecedented expansion in the HIV treatment programme since 2008. As a result, South Africa now has the largest number of patients on antiretroviral drugs in the world, and South African life expectancy has increased by more than a decade. However, this has led to a number of fiscal, logistic and operational challenges that the country must face as the treatment programme continues to expand. Challenges include increasing detection within communities, linkage and retention in care, while strengthening operational support functions such as consistent drug supply, health staffing and infrastructure, diagnostic services, programme monitoring and sustainable financing. As a middle-income country, albeit with marked income inequality, and the heaviest HIV burden in the world, South Africa is a test case of whether a large-scale public health programme can boast of success in the face of numerous other health-system challenges.

The National and Subnational Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (NASBOD) Study aims to provide the required evidence based on updated data sources available in Iran and novel methods partly adopted from Global Burden of Disease 2010. Objective: This paper aims at explaining the motives behind the study, the design, the definitions, the metrics, and the challenges due to limitations in data availability. Methods: All available published and unpublished data sources will be used for estimating the burden of 291 diseases and 67 risk factors from 1990 to 2013 at national and subnational scale. Published data will be extracted through systematic review. Existing population-based data sources include: registries (death and cancer), Demographic and Health Surveys, National Health Surveys, and other population-based surveys such as Non_Communicable Diseases Surveillance Surveys. Covariates will be extracted from censuses and household expenditure surveys. Hospital records and outpatient data will be actively collected as two distinct projects. Due to lack of data points by year and province, statistical methods will be used to impute the lacking data points based on determined covariates. Two main models will be used for data imputation: Bayesian Autoregressive Multi-level models and Spatio-Temporal regression models. The results from all available models will be used in an Ensemble Model to obtain the final estimates. Five metrics will be used for estimating the burden: prevalence, death, Years of Life Lost due to premature death (YLL), Years of Life Lost due to Disability (YLD), and Disability-Adjusted Life Years Lost (DALY). Burden attributable to risk factors will be estimated through comparative risk assessment based on Population Attributable Fraction (PAF). Uncertainty Intervals (UIs) will be calculated and reported for all aforementioned metrics. Results: We will estimate trends in terms of prevalence, deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs for Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors province from 1990 to 2013. Conclusion: Results of the present study will have implications for policy making as they address health gaps in Iranian population and their inequality between provinces.

There are some documented trend and point estimations of metabolic risk factors for Iranian population but there are little information about their exposure distribution at sub-national level and no information about their trends and their effects on the population health. Methods: The present study protocol is aimed to provide the standard structure definitions, organization, data sources, methods of data gathering or generating, and data on trend analysis of the metabolic risk factors in NASBOD study. We will estimate 1990 to 2013 trends of prevalence, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life years DALYs for MRFs by gender, age group, and province. We will also quantify the uncertainty interval for the estimates of interest. Conclusion: The findings of study could provide practical information regarding metabolic risk factors and their burden for better health policy to reduce the burden of diseases, and to plan cost-effective preventive strategies. The results also could be used for future complementary global, regional, national, and sub national studies.

The physical health status, service utilisation and barriers to accessing care for asylum seekers residing in the community: a systematic review of the literature	AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW			English	Article						community; healthcare utilisation; physical health	MENTAL-HEALTH; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; REFUGEES; AFGHAN; IMPACT; NEEDS	Objective To document physical health problems that asylum seekers experience on settlement in the community and to assess their utilisation of healthcare services and barriers to care, in an international context. Methods A systematic review of quantitative and qualitative studies was undertaken according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL databases were searched from 2002 to October 2012, focusing on adult asylum seekers residing in the community in high-income countries. Results The search yielded 1499 articles, of which 32 studies met the inclusion criteria - 23 quantitative and nine qualitative. Asylum seekers had complex health profiles spanning a range of infectious diseases, chronic non-communicable conditions, and reproductive-health issues. They appeared to utilise health services at a higher rate than the host population, yet faced significant barriers to care. Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the health inequities faced by asylum seekers residing in the communities of host countries, internationally. National data on asylum seekers' health profiles, service utilisation and barriers to care, as well as cross-country policy comparisons, are urgently required for the development of effective Australian health programs and evidence-based policy. What is known about the topic? The clinical and political focus of asylum seekers' health has largely been on the higher incidence of mental disorders and the impact of immigration detention. Since policy changes made in late 2011, an increasing number of asylum seekers have been permitted to live in the community while their claims are processed. There is a paucity of research exploring the physical health needs of asylum seekers residing in the community. What does this paper add? The international literature highlights the complexity of asylum seekers' health profiles. Although they appear to utilise health services at a higher rate than the host population, they continue to face many barriers to care. What are the implications for practitioners? Studies that explore policy options, including cross-country comparisons of health policy and guidelines that improve health outcomes, to foster equity of access and reduce health inequalities between asylum seekers and the host population are urgently required.

Evaluation of Health in Pregnancy grants in Scotland: a protocol for a natural experiment	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; FINANCIAL INCENTIVES; MATERNAL NUTRITION; INFANT ORIGINS; RISK-FACTORS; SOCIAL-CLASS; FETAL; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY	Introduction: A substantial proportion of low birth weight is attributable to the mother's cultural and socioeconomic circumstances. Early childhood programmes have been widely developed to improve child outcomes. In the UK, the Health in Pregnancy (HiP) grant, a universal conditional cash transfer of 190 pound, was introduced for women reaching the 25th week of pregnancy with a due date on/or after 6 April 2009 and subsequently withdrawn for women reaching the 25th week of pregnancy on/or after 1 January 2011. The current study focuses on the evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the HiP grant. Methods and analysis: The population under study will be all singleton births in Scotland over the periods of January 2004 to March 2009 (preintervention), April 2009 to April 2011 (intervention) and May 2011 to December 2013 (postintervention). Data will be extracted from the Scottish maternity and neonatal database. The analysis period 2004-2013 should yield over 585 000 births. The primary outcome will be birth weight among singleton births. Other secondary outcomes will include gestation at booking, booking before 25 weeks; measures of size and stage; gestational age at delivery; weight-for-dates, term at birth; birth outcomes and maternal smoking. The main statistical method we will use is interrupted time series. Outcomes will be measured on individual births nested within mothers, with mothers themselves clustered within data zones. Multilevel regression models will be used to determine whether the outcomes changed during the period in which the HiP grants was in effect. Subgroup analyses will be conducted for those groups most likely to benefit from the payments. Ethics and dissemination: Approval for data collection, storage and release for research purpose has been given (6 May 2014, PAC38A/13) by the Privacy Advisory Committee. The results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications in journals, national and international conferences.

This study builds on formative qualitative research, conducted in the Moreland/Hume local government areas of Melbourne, Victoria 2006-2009, in response to community concerns for oral health of children from refugee and migrant backgrounds. Development of the community-based intervention described here extends the partnership approach to cogeneration of contemporary evidence with continued and meaningful involvement of investigators, community, cultural and government partners. This trial aims to establish a model for child oral health promotion for culturally diverse communities in Australia. Methods and analysis This is an exploratory trial implementing a community-based child oral health promotion intervention for Australian families from refugee and migrant backgrounds. Families from an Iraqi, Lebanese or Pakistani background with children aged 1-4 years, residing in metropolitan Melbourne, were invited to participate in the trial by peer educators from their respective communities using snowball and purposive sampling techniques. Target sample size was 600. Moreland, a culturally diverse, inner-urban metropolitan area of Melbourne, was chosen as the intervention site. The intervention comprised peer educator led community oral health education sessions and reorienting of dental health and family services through cultural Competency Organisational Review (CORe). Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for this trial was granted by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee and the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development Research Committee. Study progress and output will be disseminated via periodic newsletters, peer-reviewed research papers, reports, community seminars and at National and International conferences.

The International Network for Food and Obesity/non-communicable diseases (NCDs) Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) has been established to reduce obesity, NCDs and their related inequalities globally. This paper describes the design and methods of the first-ever, comprehensive national survey on the healthiness of food environments and the public and private sector policies influencing them, as a first step towards global monitoring of food environments and policies. Methods and analysis: A package of 11 substudies has been identified: (1) food composition, labelling and promotion on food packages; (2) food prices, shelf space and placement of foods in different outlets (mainly supermarkets); (3) food provision in schools/early childhood education (ECE) services and outdoor food promotion around schools/ECE services; (4) density of and proximity to food outlets in communities; food promotion to children via (5) television, (6) magazines, (7) sport club sponsorships, and (8) internet and social media; (9) analysis of the impact of trade and investment agreements on food environments; (10) government policies and actions; and (11) private sector actions and practices. For the substudies on food prices, provision, promotion and retail, 'environmental equity' indicators have been developed to check progress towards reducing diet-related health inequalities. Indicators for these modules will be assessed by tertiles of area deprivation index or school deciles. International 'best practice benchmarks' will be identified, against which to compare progress of countries on improving the healthiness of their food environments and policies. Dissemination: This research is highly original due to the very 'upstream' approach being taken and its direct policy relevance. The detailed protocols will be offered to and adapted for countries of varying size and income in order to establish INFORMAS globally as a new monitoring initiative to reduce obesity and diet-related NCDs.

'Communities First' is an area-wide regeneration scheme to improve the lives of people living in the most deprived areas in Wales (UK). This study will evaluate the impact of Communities First on residents' mental health and social cohesion. Methods and analysis: A prospective controlled quasi-experimental study of the association between residence in Communities First regeneration areas in Caerphilly county borough and change in mental health and social cohesion. The study population is the 4226 residents aged 18-74 years who responded to the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Study in 2001 (before delivery) and 2008 (after delivery of Communities First). Data on the location, type and cost of Communities First interventions will be extracted from records collected by Caerphilly county borough council. The primary outcome is the change in mental health between 2001 and 2008. Secondary outcomes are changes: in common mental disorder case status (using survey and general practice data), social cohesion and mental health inequalities. Multilevel models will examine change in mental health and social cohesion between Communities First and control areas, adjusting for individual and household level confounding factors. Further models will examine the effects of (1) different types of intervention, (2) contamination across areas, (3) length of residence in a Communities First area, and (4) population migration. We will carry out a cost-consequences analysis to summarise the outcomes generated for participants, as well as service utilisation and utility gains. Ethics and dissemination: This study has had approval from the Information Governance Review Panel at Swansea University (Ref: 0266 CF). Findings will be disseminated through peer-review publications, international conferences, policy and practice partners in local and national government, and updates on our study website (http://medicine.cardiff.ac.uk/clinical-study/communities-first-regeneration-programme/).

They are designed to encourage people with chronic disease to take an active self-management role to supplement medical care and improve outcomes. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of self-management education programmes for people with osteoarthritis. Search methods The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscINFO, SCOPUS and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform were searched, without language restriction, on 17 January 2013. We checked references of reviews and included trials to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of self-management education programmes in people with osteoarthritis were included. Studies with participants receiving passive recipients of care and studies comparing one type of programme versus another were excluded. Data collection and analysis In addition to standard methods we extracted components of the self-management interventions using the eight domains of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ), and contextual and participant characteristics using PROGRESS-Plus and the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Outcomes included self-management of osteoarthritis, participant's positive and active engagement in life, pain, global symptom score, self-reported function, quality of life and withdrawals (including dropouts and those lost to follow-up). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results We included twenty-nine studies (6,753 participants) that compared self-management education programmes to attention control (five studies), usual care (17 studies), information alone (four studies) or another intervention (seven studies). Although heterogeneous, most interventions included elements of skill and technique acquisition (94%), health-directed activity (85%) and self-monitoring and insight (79%); social integration and support were addressed in only 12%. Most studies did not provide enough information to assess all PROGRESS-Plus items. Eight studies included predominantly Caucasian, educated female participants, and only four provided any information on participants' health literacy. All studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias for self-reported outcomes; 20 studies were at high risk of selection bias, 16 were at high risk of attrition bias, two were at high risk of reporting bias and 12 were at risk of other biases. We deemed attention control as the most appropriate and thus the main comparator. Compared with attention control, self-management programmes may not result in significant benefits at 12 months. Low-quality evidence from one study (344 people) indicates that self-management skills were similar in active and control groups: 5.8 points on a 10-point self-efficacy scale in the control group, and the mean difference (MD) between groups was 0.4 points (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to 1.19). Low-quality evidence from four studies (575 people) indicates that self-management programmes may lead to a small but clinically unimportant reduction in pain: the standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups was -0.26 (95% CI -0.44 to -0.09); pain was 6 points on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) in the control group, treatment resulted in a mean reduction of 0.8 points (95% CI -0.14 to -0.3) on a 10-point scale, with number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 (95% CI 5 to 23). Low-quality evidence from one study (251 people) indicates that the mean global osteoarthritis score was 4.2 on a 0 to 10-point symptom scale (lower better) in the control group, and treatment reduced symptoms by a mean of 0.14 points (95% CI -0.54 to 0.26). This result does not exclude the possibility of a clinically important benefit in some people (0.5 point reduction included in 95% CI). Low-quality evidence from three studies (574 people) showed no signficant difference in function between groups (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.11); mean function was 1.29 points on a 0 to 3-point scale in the control group, and treatment resulted in a mean improvement of 0.04 points with self-management (95% CI -0.10 to 0.02). Low-quality evidence from one study (165 people) showed no between-group difference in quality of life (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01) from a control group mean of 0.57 units on 0 to 1 well-being scale. Moderate-quality evidence from five studies (937 people) shows similar withdrawal rates between self-management (13%) and control groups (12%): RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.57). Positive and active engagement in life was not measured. Compared with usual care, moderate-quality evidence from 11 studies (up to 1,706 participants) indicates that self-management programmes probably provide small benefits up to 21 months, in terms of self-management skills, pain, osteoarthritis symptoms and function, although these are of doubtful clinical importance, and no improvement in positive and active engagement in life or quality of life. Withdrawal rates were similar. Low to moderate quality evidence indicates no important differences in self-management, pain, symptoms, function, quality of life or withdrawal rates between self-management programmes and information alone or other interventions (exercise, physiotherapy, social support or acupuncture). Authors' conclusions Low to moderate quality evidence indicates that self-management education programmes result in no or small benefits in people with osteoarthritis but are unlikely to cause harm. Compared with attention control, these programmes probably do not improve self-management skills, pain, osteoarthritis symptoms, function or quality of life, and have unknown effects on positive and active engagement in life. Compared with usual care, they may slightly improve self-management skills, pain, function and symptoms, although these benefits are of unlikely clinical importance. Further studies investigating the effects of self-management education programmes, as delivered in the trials in this review, are unlikely to change our conclusions substantially, as confounding from biases across studies would have likely favoured self-management. However, trials assessing other models of self-management education programme delivery may be warranted.

J	Shortt, NK; Rind, E; Pearce, J; Mitchell, R				Shortt, Niamh K.; Rind, Esther; Pearce, Jamie; Mitchell, Richard			Integrating environmental justice and socioecological models of health to understand population-level physical activity	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE			English	Article						environmental justice; physical activity; health behaviours; socio-ecological model; capabilities	ADULTS PARTICIPATION; WALKING; DEPRIVATION; LIFE; TRANSPORTATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DETERMINANTS; INEQUALITIES; INACTIVITY; POLLUTION	The uneven geographical distribution of environmental pathogens and salutogens, as well as the political, social, and cultural antecedents leading to this sociospatial arrangement, have been posited as a partial explanation for the stark inequalities in health across many high-income nations. Whilst there is significant international evidence for the maldistribution of health-related environmental features, few studies have examined the material outcomes (including health) of this unequal environmental 'exposure'. In this paper we utilise the theoretical stances offered by work in the fields of environmental justice and socioecological models of health to consider the pathway between physical environmental deprivation and health. We consider the influence of multiple aspects of the 'natural' physical environment on individual-level levels of physical activity-both utilitarian and physical activity for leisure. We found that, for physical activity conducted for recreational purposes, there is a strong relationship with the natural physical environment: those living in the least deprived physical environments are most likely to engage in physical activity. However, for utilitarian physical activity, physical activity whose primary purpose is not the activity itself, we observed increased levels in the most environmentally deprived areas. Finally, the important role that the environment may play in shaping capabilities, particularly during the current economic and political climate, is recognised. Our results show that the environment matters and that rhetoric regarding 'lifestyle choice' needs to be viewed in a broader environmental context.

The workforce for health in a globalized context - global shortages and international migration	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Review						health workforce migration; global health; globalization; WHO Code of Practice	MEDICAL BRAIN-DRAIN; ACTIVE RECRUITMENT; WORKERS; NURSES	The 'crisis in human resources' in the health sector has been described as one of the most pressing global health issues of our time. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the world faces a global shortage of almost 4.3 million doctors, midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. A global undersupply of these threatens the quality and sustainability of health systems worldwide. This undersupply is concurrent with globalization and the resulting liberalization of markets, which allow health workers to offer their services in countries other than those of their origin. The opportunities of health workers to seek employment abroad has led to a complex migration pattern, characterized by a flow of health professionals from low-to high-income countries. This global migration pattern has sparked a broad international debate about the consequences for health systems worldwide, including questions about sustainability, justice, and global social accountabilities. This article provides a review of this phenomenon and gives an overview of the current scope of health workforce migration patterns. It further focuses on the scientific discourse regarding health workforce migration and its effects on both high- and low-income countries in an interdependent world. The article also reviews the internal and external factors that fuel health worker migration and illustrates how health workforce migration is a classic global health issue of our time. Accordingly, it elaborates on the international community's approach to solving the workforce crisis, focusing in particular on the WHO Code of Practice, established in 2010.

J	Clark, J				Clark, Jocalyn			Medicalization of global health 3: the medicalization of the non-communicable diseases agenda	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						global health; non-communicable disease; chronic disease; medicalization; sociology	NETWORK; EQUITY; FOOD	There is growing recognition of the massive global burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) due to their prevalence, projected social and economic costs, and traditional neglect compared to infectious disease. The 2011 UN Summit, WHO 25 x 25 targets, and support of major medical and advocacy organisations have propelled prominence of NCDs on the global health agenda. NCDs are by definition 'diseases' so already medicalized. But their social drivers and impacts are acknowledged, which demand a broad, whole-of-society approach. However, while both individual-and population-level targets are identified in the current NCD action plans, most recommended strategies tend towards the individualistic approach and do not address root causes of the NCD problem. These so-called population strategies risk being reduced to expectations of individual and behavioural change, which may have limited success and impact and deflect attention away from government policies or regulation of industry. Industry involvement in NCD agenda-setting props up a medicalized approach to NCDs: food and drink companies favour focus on individual choice and responsibility, and pharmaceutical and device companies favour calls for expanded access to medicines and treatment coverage. Current NCD framing creates expanded roles for physicians, healthcare workers, medicines and medical monitoring. The professional rather than the patient view dominates the NCD agenda and there is a lack of a broad, engaged, and independent NGO community. The challenge and opportunity lie in defining priorities and developing strategies that go beyond a narrow medicalized framing of the NCD problem and its solutions.

J	Clark, J				Clark, Jocalyn			Medicalization of global health 4: the universal health coverage campaign and the medicalization of global health	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						global health; universal health coverage; health care; medicalization; sociology	IMPROVE	Universal health coverage (UHC) has emerged as the leading and recommended overarching health goal on the post-2015 development agenda, and is promoted with fervour. UHC has the backing of major medical and health institutions, and is designed to provide patients with universal access to needed health services without financial hardship, but is also projected to have 'a transformative effect on poverty, hunger, and disease'. Multiple reports and resolutions support UHC and few offer critical analyses; but among these are concerns with imprecise definitions and the ability to implement UHC at the country level. A medicalization lens enriches these early critiques and identifies concerns that the UHC campaign contributes to the medicalization of global health. UHC conflates health with health care, thus assigning undue importance to (biomedical) health services and downgrading the social and structural determinants of health. There is poor evidence that UHC or health care alone improves population health outcomes, and in fact health care may worsen inequities. UHC is reductionistic because it focuses on preventative and curative actions delivered at the individual level, and ignores the social and political determinants of health and right to health that have been supported by decades of international work and commitments. UHC risks commodifying health care, which threatens the underlying principles of UHC of equity in access and of health care as a collective good.

J	Hirve, S				Hirve, Siddhivinayak			'In general, how do you feel today?' - self-rated health in the context of aging in India	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Review						self-rated health; aging; mortality; disability; reporting heterogeneity; India	SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION; RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; PREVALENCE; DISABILITY; SATISFACTION; INEQUALITIES; ASSOCIATION; COMMUNITIES; POPULATION	This thesis is centered on self-rated health (SRH) as an outcome measure, as a predictor, and as a marker. The thesis uses primary data from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) implemented in India in 2007. The structural equation modeling approach is employed to understand the pathways through which the social environment, disability, disease, and sociodemographic characteristics influence SRH among older adults aged 50 years and above. Cox proportional hazard model is used to explore the role of SRH as a predictor for mortality and the role of disability in modifying this effect. The hierarchical ordered probit modeling approach, which combines information from anchoring vignettes with SRH, was used to address the long overlooked methodological concern of interpersonal incomparability. Finally, multilevel model-based small area estimation techniques were used to demonstrate the use of large national surveys and census information to derive precise SRH prevalence estimates at the district and sub-district level. The thesis advocates the use of such a simple measure to identify vulnerable communities for targeted health interventions, to plan and prioritize resource allocation, and to evaluate health interventions in resource-scarce settings. The thesis provides the basis and impetus to generate and integrate similar and harmonized adult health and aging data platforms within demographic surveillance systems in different regions of India and elsewhere.

Findings from an international project	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						primary health care; health for all; community health workers		Background: The 4-year (2007-2011) Revitalizing Health for All international research program (http://www.globalhealthequity.ca/projects/proj_revitalizing/index.shtml) supported 20 research teams located in 15 low-and middle-income countries to explore the strengths and weaknesses of comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) initiatives at their local or national levels. Teams were organized in a triad comprised of a senior researcher, a new researcher, and a 'research user' from government, health services, or other organizations with the authority or capacity to apply the research findings. Multiple regional and global team capacity-enhancement meetings were organized to refine methods and to discuss and assess cross-case findings. Objective: Most research projects used mixed methods, incorporating analyses of qualitative data (interviews and focus groups), secondary data, and key policy and program documents. Some incorporated historical case study analyses, and a few undertook new surveys. The synthesis of findings in this report was derived through qualitative analysis of final project reports undertaken by three different reviewers. Results: Evidence of comprehensiveness (defined in this research program as efforts to improve equity in access, community empowerment and participation, social and environmental health determinants, and intersectoral action) was found in many of the cases. Conclusions: Despite the important contextual differences amongst the different country studies, the similarity of many of their findings, often generated using mixed methods, attests to certain transferable health systems characteristics to create and sustain CPHC practices. These include: 1. Well-trained and supported community health workers (CHWs) able to work effectively with marginalized communities 2. Effective mechanisms for community participation, both informal (through participation in projects and programs, and meaningful consultation) and formal (though program management structures) 3. Co-partnership models in program and policy development (in which financial and knowledge supports from governments or institutions are provided to communities, which retain decision-making powers in program design and implementation) 4. Support for community advocacy and engagement in health and social systems decision making These characteristics, in turn, require a political context that supports state responsibilities for redistributive health and social protection measures.

Most activities worldwide have focused on maternal and child health and communicable diseases, while less attention has been paid to environmental sustainability and the development of a global partnership. Up to now, several targets have been at least partially achieved: hunger reduction is on track, poverty has been reduced by half, living conditions of 200 million deprived people enhanced, maternal and child mortality as well as communicable diseases diminished and education improved. Nevertheless, some goals will not be met, particularly in the poorest regions, due to different challenges (e.g. the lack of synergies among the goals, the economic crisis, etc.). The post-2015 agenda is now under discussion. The new targets, whatever they will be called, should reflect today's political situation, health and environmental challenges, and an all-inclusive, intersectoral and accountable approach should be adopted.

Universal health coverage is a key priority for WHO and its member states, and provision of accessible and safe primary care is recognised as essential to meet this important international policy goal. Nevertheless, more than three decades after Alma Ata, the provision of primary health care remains inadequate, indicating that primary care has not received the priority it deserves, in many parts of the world. This is despite the proven health benefits that result from access to comprehensive primary health care. We highlight some examples of good practice and discuss the relevance of primary care in the context of health equity and cost-effectiveness. Challenges that influence the success of primary care include the availability of a qualified workforce, financing and system design and quality assurance and patient safety.

There is a growing recognition that the global health agenda needs to shift from an emphasis on disease-specific approaches to strengthening of health systems, including dealing with social, environmental, and economic determinants through multisectoral responses. Methods: A review and analysis of data on strengthening health sector reform and health systems was conducted. Attention was paid to the goal of health and interactions between health sector reforms and the functions of health systems. Further, we explored how these interactions contribute toward delivery of health services, equity, financial protection, and improved health. Findings: Health sector reforms cannot be developed from a single global or regional policy formula. Any reform will depend on the country's history, values and culture, and the population's expectations. Some of the emerging ingredients that need to be explored are infusion of a health systems agenda; development of a comprehensive policy package for health sector reforms; improving alignment of planning and coordination; use of reliable data; engaging 'street level' policy implementers; strengthening governance and leadership; and allowing a holistic and developmental approach to reforms. Conclusions: The process of reform needs a fundamental rather than merely an incremental and evolutionary change. Without radical structural and systemic changes, existing governance structures and management systems will continue to fail to address the existing health problems.

J	Stapleton, G; Schröder-Bäck, P; Laaser, U; Meershoek, A; Popa, D				Stapleton, Greg; Schroder-Back, Peter; Laaser, Ulrich; Meershoek, Agnes; Popa, Daniela			Global health ethics: an introduction to prominent theories and relevant topics	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Review						global health; world health; justice; health inequalities; international ethics; bioethics		Global health ethics is a relatively new term that is used to conceptualize the process of applying moral value to health issues that are typically characterized by a global level effect or require action coordinated at a global level. It is important to acknowledge that this account of global health ethics takes a predominantly geographic approach and may infer that the subject relates primarily to macro-level health phenomena. However, global health ethics could alternatively be thought of as another branch of health ethics. It may then relate to specific topics in themselves, which might also include micro-level health phenomena. In its broadest sense, global health ethics is a normative project that is best characterized by the challenge of developing common values and universal norms for responding to global health threats. Consequently, many subjects fall within its scope. Whilst several accounts of global health ethics have been conceptualized in the literature, a concise demarcation of the paradigm is still needed. Through means of a literature review, this paper presents a two-part introduction to global health ethics. First, the framework of 'borrowed' ethics that currently form the core of global health ethics is discussed in relation to two essential ethical considerations: 1) what is the moral significance of health and 2) what is the moral significance of boundaries? Second, a selection of exemplar ethical topics is presented to illustrate the range of topics within global health ethics.

J	Daibes, I; Sridharan, S				Daibes, Ibrahim; Sridharan, Sanjeev			Where theory and practice of global health intersect: the developmental history of a Canadian global health initiative	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						global health; equity; interdisciplinary research; complexity; research use; research excellence; theory of change		Objective: This paper examines the scope of practice of global health, drawing on the practical experience of a global health initiative of the Government of Canada - the Teasdale-Corti Global Health Research Partnership Program. A number of challenges in the practical application of theoretical definitions and understandings of global health are addressed. These challenges are grouped under five areas that form essential characteristics of global health: equity and egalitarian North-South partnerships, interdisciplinary scope, focus on upstream determinants of health, global conceptualization, and global health as an area of both research and practice. Design: Information in this paper is based on the results of an external evaluation of the program, which involved analysis of project proposals and technical reports, surveys with grantees and interviews with grantees and program designers, as well as case studies of three projects and a review of relevant literature. Results: The philosophy and recent definitions of global health represent a significant and important departure from the international health paradigm. However, the practical applicability of this maturing area of research and practice still faces significant systemic and structural impediments that, if not acknowledged and addressed, will continue to undermine the development of global health as an effective means to addressing health inequities globally and to better understanding, and acting upon, upstream determinants of health toward health for all. Conclusions: While it strives to redress global inequities, global health continues to be a construct that is promoted, studied, and dictated mostly by Northern institutions and scholars. Until practical mechanisms are put in place for truly egalitarian partnerships between North and South for both the study and practice of global health, the emerging philosophy of global health cannot be effectively put into practice.

GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						environmental health; Indigenous peoples; Australia; health; environment	MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA; DISEASE; ASSOCIATION; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; BURDEN; CANCER; INJURY; BIRTH	Indigenous people experience poorer health than non-Indigenous people, and this well-described inequality has been observed in many countries. The contribution of different risk factors to the health 'gap' has understandably focussed on those factors for which there are sufficient data. However, this has precluded environmental risk factors - those present in air, water, food, and soil - due to a lack of data describing exposures and outcomes. These risk factors are demonstrably important at the global scale, as highlighted by the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study. Here, we describe how a greater focus on environmental risk factors is required in order to define their role in the Indigenous health gap. We use the Australian context as a case study of an issue we feel has global analogues and relevance. Suggestions for how and why this situation should be remedied are presented and discussed.

J	Krumeich, A; Meershoek, A				Krumeich, Anja; Meershoek, Agnes			Health in global context; beyond the social determinants of health?	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Review						social determinants of health; health equity; health disparities; globalization; health promotion guidelines; evidence for practice; evidence for policy; local context; local adaptation	PUBLIC-HEALTH; GLOBALIZATION; CONSTRUCTION; PROMOTION	The rise of the social determinants of health (SDH) discourse on the basis of statistical evidence that correlates ill health to SDH and pictures causal pathways in comprehensive theoretical frameworks led to widespread awareness that health and health disparities are the outcome of complex pathways of interconnecting SDH. In this paper we explore whether and how SDH frameworks can be translated to effectively inform particular national health policies. To this end we identified major challenges for this translation followed by reflections on ways to overcome them. Most important challenges affecting adequate translation of these frameworks into concrete policy and intervention are 1) overcoming the inclination to conceptualize SDH as mere barriers to health behavior to be modified by lifestyle interventions by addressing them as structural factors instead; 2) obtaining sufficient in-depth insight in and evidence for the exact nature of the relationship between SDs and health; 3) to adequately translate the general determinants and pathways into explanations for ill health and limited access to health care in local settings; 4) to develop and implement policies and other interventions that are adjusted to those local circumstances. We conclude that to transform generic SDH models into useful policy tools and to prevent them to transform in SDH themselves, in depth understanding of the unique interplay between local, national and global SDH in a local setting, gathered by ethnographic research, is needed to be able to address structural SD in the local setting and decrease health inequity.

Review: For the main parameters of health like the burden of disease, life expectancy and healthy life expectancy, extreme discrepancies are observed across the world. Infant mortality, malnutrition and high fertility go hand in hand. Civil society, as an indispensable activator of public health development, mainly represented by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), is characterised by a high degree of fragmentation and lack of public accountability. The World Federation of Public Health Associations is used as an example of an NGO with a global mission and fostering regional cooperation as an indispensable intermediate level. The lack of a globally valid terminology of basic public health functions is prohibitive for coordinated global and regional efforts. Attempts to harmonise essential public health functions, services and operations are under way to facilitate communication and mutual understanding. Recommendations: 1) Given the limited effects of the Millennium Development Goal agenda, the Post-2015 Development Goals should focus on integrated regional development. 2) A code of conduct for NGOs should be urgently developed for the health sector, and NGOs should be registered and accredited. 3) The harmonisation of the basic terminology for global public health essentials should be enhanced.

The benefits have not been experienced by all groups. Here we investigate the factors associated with these inequities. Design: This study was located in a rural South African setting and used data collected from 2007 to 2010, the period when decentralised ART became available. Approximately one-third of the population were of Mozambican origin. There was a pattern of repeated circular migration between urban areas and this community. Survival analysis models were developed to identify demographic, socioeconomic, and spatial risk factors for HIV mortality. Results: Among the study population of 105,149 individuals, there were 2,890 deaths. The HIV/TB mortality rate decreased by 27% between 2007-2008 and 2009-2010. For other causes of death, the reduction was 10%. Bivariate analysis found that the HIV/TB mortality risk was lower for: those living within 5 km of the Bhubezi Community Health Centre; women; young adults; in-migrants with a longer period of residence; permanent residents; and members of households owning motorised transport, holding higher socioeconomic positions, and with higher levels of education. Multivariate modelling showed, in addition, that those with South Africa as their country of origin had an increased risk of HIV/TB mortality compared to those with Mozambican origins. For males, those of South African origin, and recent in-migrants, the risk of death associated with HIV/TB was significantly greater than that due to other causes. Conclusions: In this community, a combination of factors was associated with an increased risk of dying of HIV/TB over the period of the roll-out of ART. There is evidence for the presence of barriers to successful treatment for particular sub-groups in the population, which must be addressed if the recent improvements in population-level mortality are to be maintained.

We use the parlance of mastering deadly sins and striving for greater virtues in an effort to review what is needed to transform global health action. Global health falls prey to four main temptations: coveting silo gains, lusting for technological solutions, leaving broad promises largely unfulfilled, and boasting of narrow successes. This necessitates a change of heart: to keep faith with the promise it made, global health requires a realignment of core values and a sharper focus on the primacy of relationships with the communities it serves. Based on the literature to date, we highlight six steps to re-orienting global health action. Articulating a coherent global health agenda will come from principled action, enacted through courage and prudence in decision-making to foster people-centered systems of care over the entire lifespan.

Increased conservatism, lack of political will, outright resistance and the limited incorporation of human rights norms and standards into sexual and reproductive health policies and programmes are central challenges. Building capacity and skills to understand and address the range of issues raised by sexual and reproductive health and rights is of critical importance. Committed to the principles underlying the ICPD agenda and heavily involved in research and education, with a shared desire to bring global attention to the need for gender- and rights-oriented research and training in sexual and reproductive health, a group of us came together to form the Rights-Oriented Research and Education (RORE) Network for Sexual and Reproductive Health at the end of 2012. To generate dialogue, discussion and action, we propose what we mean by a human rights orientation to sexual and reproductive health and what we believe is needed going forward to achieve a human rights orientation to sexual and reproductive health education and research.

Variations raise questions about the quality, equity, and efficiency of resource allocation and use, and have important implications for health care and health policy. Objective: To perform a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on medical practice variations in OECD countries. Methods: We searched MEDLINE to find publications on medical practice variations in OECD countries published between 2000 and 2011. We present an overview of the characteristics of published studies as well as the magnitude of variations for select high impact conditions. Results: A total of 836 studies were included. Consistent with the gray literature, there were large variations across regions, hospitals and physician practices for almost every condition and procedure studied. Many studies focused on high-impact conditions, but very few looked at the causes or outcomes of medical practice variations. Conclusion: While there were an overwhelming number of publications on medical practice variations the coverage was broad and not often based on a theoretical construct. Future studies should focus on conditions and procedures that are clinically important, policy relevant, resource intensive, and have high levels of public awareness. Further study of the causes and consequences of variations is important. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

All participating countries would pay into a global fund based on a metric of their ability to pay and withdraw from the common pool based on a metric of their need for funds. We assessed how alternative strategies and metrics by which to operate such a fund would affect its size and impact on health system financing. Using a mathematical model, we found that common targets for health funding in low-income countries require higher levels of aid expenditures than presently distributed. Some mechanisms exist that may incentivize reduction of domestic health inequalities, and direct most funds towards the poorest populations. Payments from high-income countries are also likely to decrease over time as middle-income countries' economies grow.

Her informal transatlantic alliance with U. S. President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1989 played an important role in the promotion of an international neoliberal policy agenda that remains influential today. Her critique of UK social democracy during the 1970s and her adoption of key neoliberal strategies, such as financial deregulation, trade liberalization, and the privatization of public goods and services, were popularly labeled Thatcherism. In this article, we consider the nature of Thatcherism and its impact on health and well-being during her period as prime minister and, to a lesser extent, in the years that follow; we focus mainly on Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales). Thatcher's policies were associated with substantial increases in socioeconomic and health inequalities: these issues were actively marginalized and ignored by her governments. In addition, her public-sector reforms applied business principles to the welfare state and prepared the National Health Service for subsequent privatization.

J	Bambra, C; Garthwaite, K; Hunter, D				Bambra, Clare; Garthwaite, Kayleigh; Hunter, David			ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL: DOES IT MATTER FOR EQUITY HOW YOU ORGANIZE AND PAY FOR HEALTH CARE? A REVIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							INEQUALITIES; OUTCOMES; SYSTEMS; SWEDEN; IMPACT	Over the last 25 years, the health care systems of most high-income countries have experienced extensive-usually market-based-organizational and financial reforms. The impact of these system changes on health equity has been hotly debated. Examining evidence from systematic reviews of the effects of health care system organizational and financial reforms will add empirical information to this debate, identify any evidence gaps, and help policy development. Systematic review methodology was used to locate and evaluate published systematic reviews of quantitative intervention studies (experimental and observational) of the effects on equity in health care access and/or health status of health care system organizational and financial reforms (system financing, funding allocations, direct purchasing arrangements, organization of service provision, and health and social care system integration) in high-income countries. Nine systematic reviews were identified. Private insurance and out-of-pocket payments as well as the marketization and privatization of services have either negative or inconclusive equity effects. The evidence base on the health equity effects of managed care programs or integrated partnerships between health and social services is inconclusive. There were no relevant studies located that related to resource allocation reforms. The systematic review-level evidence base suggests that financial and organizational health care system reforms have had either inconclusive or negative impacts on health equity both in terms of access relative to need and in terms of health outcomes.

J	Krieger, N				Krieger, Nancy			DISCRIMINATION AND HEALTH INEQUITIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST; ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES; AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN; SELF-RATED HEALTH; OF-THE-LITERATURE; RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; MENTAL-HEALTH; RACIAL/ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION; RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION	In 1999, only 20 studies in the public health literature employed instruments to measure self-reported experiences of discrimination. Fifteen years later, the number of empirical investigations on discrimination and health easily exceeds 500, with these studies increasingly global in scope and focused on major types of discrimination variously involving race/ethnicity, indigenous status, immigrant status, gender, sexuality, disability, and age, separately and in combination. And yet, as I also document, even as the number of investigations has dramatically expanded, the scope remains narrow: studies remain focused primarily on interpersonal discrimination, and scant research investigates the health impacts of structural discrimination, a gap consonant with the limited epidemiologic research on political systems and population health. Accordingly, to help advance the state of the field, this updated review article: (a) briefly reviews definitions of discrimination, illustrated with examples from the United States; (b) discusses theoretical insights useful for conceptualizing how discrimination can become embodied and produce health inequities, including via distortion of scientific knowledge; (c) concisely summarizes extant evidence both robust and inconsistent linking discrimination and health; and (d) addresses several key methodological controversies and challenges, including the need for careful attention to domains, pathways, level, and spatiotemporal scale, in historical context.

Achieving equitable access to care is an important goal for all countries, but particularly challenging in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Despite wide use of the concept of access, it continues to be defined and measured in very different ways. This glossary is a structured overview of key definitions for concepts related to access to health care, with special focus on the interpretation for LMICs. It aims to help people with interest in health service delivery to draw an overview and provide some pointers for further reading in both conceptual and empirical advances in access to health care in LMICs. This document is structured in five sections. The first introduces a general description of the concept of access to health care and its relevance to LMICs, the second displays the search conducted on access to health care for LMICs and the framework used for presentation of glossary terms, the third describes theoretical models most frequently used in the past when looking at access to health care in LMICs, the fourth is the list of terms, and the final section is a discussion of the most salient aspects of this critical review.

JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						activism; collective action; community mobilisation; Paulo Freire; power; social change; social movements; the new left	HEALTH; PARTICIPATION	The article explores the Freirian theory of social change underpinning health-related community mobilisation in poor and marginalised communities. Highlighting potential shortcomings of its essentialist understandings of power and identity, and linear notions of change, it examines how lessons from the new left', and burgeoning global protest movements, can rejuvenate the field given the growing complexity of 21st-century social inequalities. It suggests the need for a pastiche of approaches to accommodate health struggles in different times and places. However, while needing some updating, Freire's profound and actionable understandings of the symbolic and material dimensions of social inequalities remain a powerful starting point for activism.

Medical education will become the key for successful healthcare reform. Purpose: We describe the current status of the Chinese medical degree system and its evolution over the last 80 years. Content: Progress has been uneven, historically punctuated most dramatically by the Cultural Revolution. There is a great regional disparity. Doctors with limited tertiary education may be licensed to practice, whereas medical graduates with advanced doctorates may have limited clinical skills. There are undefined relationships between competing tertiary training streams, the academic professional degree, and the clinical residency training programme (RTP). The perceived quality of training in both streams varies widely across China. As the degrees of master or doctor of academic medicine is seen as instrumental in career advancement, including employability in urban hospitals, attainment of this degree is sought after, yet is often unrelated to a role in health care, or is seen as superior to clinical experience. Meanwhile, the practical experience gained in some prestigious academic institutions is deprecated by the RTP and must be repeated before accreditation for clinical practice. This complexity is confusing both for students seeking the most appropriate training, and also for clinics, hospitals and universities seeking to recruit the most appropriate applicants. Conclusion: The future education reforms might include: 1) a domestic system of 'credits' that gives weight to quality clinical experience vs. academic publications in career advancement, enhanced harmonisation between the competing streams of the professional degree and the RTP, and promotion of mobility of staff between areas of excellence and areas of need; 2) International - a mutual professional and academic recognition between China and other countries by reference to the Bologna Accord, setting up a system of easily comparable and well-understood medical degrees.

The emergence of cardiometabolic disease risk in Chinese children and adults: consequences of changes in diet, physical activity and obesity	OBESITY REVIEWS			English	Review						China; physical activity; cardiometabolic risk; Abdominal obesity	NUTRITION TRANSITION; WEIGHT-GAIN; HEALTH-CARE; PREVALENCE; OVERWEIGHT; WOMEN; URBANIZATION; POPULATION; INEQUALITY; HOUSEHOLD	Strong secular declines in physical activity, increased fat and salt intake, and increased obesity, especially abdominal obesity, mark China's recent nutrition transition. The China Health and Nutrition 2009 Survey collected anthropometry, blood pressure and fasting blood samples from more than 9,000 individuals >= 7 years of age. We focus on elevated blood pressure and plasma markers of diabetes, inflammation and dyslipidemia. We used international definitions of cardiometabolic risk and estimated age- and sex-specific prevalence ratios for each outcome for high waist circumference or overweight. We used logistic regression to assess each risk factor's association with diet, physical activity, overweight and abdominal obesity. Cardiometabolic risk prevalence was high in all age groups Prevalence ratios for most risk factors were nearly doubled for overweight or high waist circumference groups. Prevalence ratios were higher in younger than older adults. Low physical activity consistently predicted higher cardiometabolic risk across most outcomes and age-sex groups. The co-occurrence of overweight and high waist circumference was highly predictive of dyslipidemia, elevated glycated haemoglobin and diabetes. High prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors and their strong association with weight status and abdominal obesity in young adults portend increases in cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality. Early interventions will be required to reverse trends.	[Adair, L. S.; Gordon-Larsen, P.; Du, S. F.; Popkin, B.

Design: Data were obtained from the 2008 Spanish Survey on Disability, Personal Autonomy, and Dependency Situations, a cross-sectional survey based on a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized population of Spain. Participants: The sample was composed of 213 626 participants aged >= 15 years (103 093 men and 110 533 women); 360 were blind (160 men and 200 women), 4048 had near visual impairment (1397 men and 2651 women), and 4034 had distance visual impairment (1445 men and 2589 women). Methods: The prevalence of near and distance visual impairment was calculated for each region. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. All analyses were stratified by sex. Main Outcome Measures: Visual impairment was based on 3 questions aimed at identifying blindness and near and distance visual impairment. Results: The prevalence (percentage) of blindness was 0.17 (men, 0.16; women, 0.18): 1.89 for near visual impairment (men, 1.36; women, 2.40), 1.89 for distance visual impairment (men, 1.40; women, 2.34), and 2.43 for any visual impairment (men, 1.81; women, 3.02). Regional inequalities in the prevalence of visual impairment were observed, correlated with regional income, and the prevalence was consistently higher among women than men. The magnitude of the inequalities remained after adjusting for age and educational level, and a north-to-south pattern of increasing prevalence was observed. Conclusions: Regional and sex inequalities in the prevalence of visual impairment and blindness were observed in Spain, with a north-to-south gradient of increasing prevalence that was not explained by age or individual educational level but was correlated with regional level of economic development. Factors that could be prioritized for future policies and research include differential regional economic development, rural environment, quality of eye care services, diabetes, ultraviolet light exposure, or gender inequalities in diagnostic and therapeutic health care.

In health policy, strong primary care is seen as key to deal with these challenges. European countries differ in how strong their primary care systems are. Two groups of traditionally weak primary care systems are distinguished. First a number of social health insurance systems in Western Europe. In these systems we identified policies to strengthen primary care by small steps, characterized by weak incentives and a voluntary basis for primary care providers and patients. Secondly, transitional countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CCEE) that transformed their state-run, polyclinic based systems to general practice based systems to a varying extent. In this policy review article we describe the policies to strengthen primary care. For Western Europe, Germany, Belgium and France are described. The CCEE transformed their systems in a completely different context and urgency of problems. For this group, we describe the situation in Estonia and Lithuania, as former states of the Soviet Union that are now members of the EU, and Belarus which is not. We discuss the usefulness of voluntary approaches in the context of acceptability of such policies and in the context of (absence of) European policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Urdal, H; Che, CP				Urdal, Henrik; Che, Chi Primus			War and Gender Inequalities in Health: The Impact of Armed Conflict on Fertility and Maternal Mortality	INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS			English	Article						armed conflict; conflict deaths; fertility; maternal health; UNSCR 1325	POPULATION; COUNTRIES; REFUGEE; PEOPLE; CONSEQUENCES; SERVICES; DECLINE; GUINEA; UGANDA	Recent studies have found significant excess mortality in women during and immediately after armed conflicts. This article directly assesses one of the most likely explanations, namely that war negatively affects reproductive health. Armed conflicts may contribute to sustain high fertility levels through increased social insecurity, loss of reproductive health services, and lower female education. Further, war's deteriorating impact on health infrastructure is expected to increase the relative risk that women die from complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth. These claims are tested in a global time-series cross-national study from 1970 through 2005. Three major findings are reported. First, armed conflicts are associated with higher overall fertility in low-income countries only. Second, maternal mortality rates are elevated, albeit moderately, in conflict countries. Third, conflicts in neighboring countries are associated with lower maternal mortality, possibly indicating that health interventions among refugee and host populations are relatively successful. While addressing one of the least successful UN Millennium Development Goals, this study also responds to the UN Security Council Resolution 1325, in which Article 16 specifically calls for the Secretary-General to carry out a study on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls.

Progress in Global Surveillance and Response Capacity 10 Years after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome	EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							SARS; CORONAVIRUS; TRANSMISSION; PREVENTION; TORONTO; ORIGIN	Ten years have elapsed since the World Health Organization issued its first global alert for an unexplained illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The anniversary provides an opportunity to reflect on the international response to this new global microbial threat. While global surveillance and response capacity for public health threats have been strengthened, critical gaps remain. Of 194 World Health Organization member states that signed on to the International Health Regulations (2005), <20% had achieved compliance with the core capacities required by the deadline in June 2012. Lessons learned from the global SARS outbreak highlight the need to avoid complacency, strengthen efforts to improve global capacity to address the next pandemic using all available 21st century tools, and support research to develop new treatment options, countermeasures, and insights while striving to address the global inequities that are the root cause of many of these challenges.

Neonatal health in Nepal: analysis of absolute and relative inequalities and impact of current efforts to reduce neonatal mortality	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Neonatal mortality; Rate ratio; Rate difference; Policy analysis; Developing country	NEWBORN SURVIVAL; COMMUNITY; INTERVENTIONS; DISTRICT; DECADE; INFECTIONS; DELIVERY; PROGRAM; TIME; CARE	Background: Nepal has made substantial progress in reducing under-five mortality and is on track to achieve Millennium Development Goal 4, but advances in neonatal health are less encouraging. The objectives of this study were to assess relative and absolute inequalities in neonatal mortality over time, and to review experience with major programs to promote neonatal health. Methods: Using four nationally representative surveys conducted in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011, we calculated neonatal mortality rates for Nepal and for population groups based on child sex, geographical and socio-economic variables using a true cohort log probability approach. Inequalities based on different variables and years were assessed using rate differences (rd) and rate ratios (rr); time trends in neonatal mortality were measured using the annual rate of reduction. Through literature searches and expert consultation, information on Nepalese policies and programs implemented since 1990 and directly or indirectly attempting to reduce neonatal mortality was compiled. Data on timeline, coverage and effectiveness were extracted for major programs. Results: The annual rate of reduction for neonatal mortality between 1996 and 2011 (2.8 percent per annum) greatly lags behind the achievements in under-five and infant mortality, and varies across population groups. For the year 2011, stark absolute and relative inequalities in neonatal mortality exist in relation to wealth status (rd = 21.4, rr = 2.2); these are less pronounced for other measures of socio-economic status, child sex and urban-rural residence, ecological and development region. Among many efforts to promote child and maternal health, three established programs and two pilot programs emerged as particularly relevant to reducing neonatal mortality. While these were designed based on national and international evidence, information about coverage of different population groups and effectiveness is limited. Conclusion: Neonatal mortality varies greatly by socio-demographic variables. This study clearly shows that much remains to be achieved in terms of reducing neonatal mortality across different socio-economic, ethnic and geographical population groups in Nepal. In moving forward it will be important to scale up programs of proven effectiveness, conduct in-depth evaluation of promising new approaches, target unreached and hard-to-reach populations, and maximize use of financial and personnel resources through integration across programs.

Methods: We reviewed routinely reported coverage data and conducted a national stratified, validation, cross-sectional survey in October 2010, according to WHO recommended sampling method. First, we stratified China into three regions (Eastern, Central and Western) based on economic criteria. Second, in each region, we selected eight counties with a probability proportional to population size. Third, in each selected county, we selected (a) 10 townships at random among the list of townships of the county. Results: We visited 244 townships as part of the final evaluation (71 in the East, 86 in the Center and 87 in the West). Overall, in these 244 townships, surveyed TBD coverage increased from 60% in 2002 to 91% in 2009 and surveyed three dose of hepatitis B vaccine coverage increased from 71% in 2002 to 93% in 2009. Overall, in the GAVI supported areas, the HepB3/DTP3 ratio increased from 57% in 2002 to 94% in 2009. Conclusion: Pro-poor GAVI approach was an effective way to reduce inequity among children through provision of free vaccination. When vaccine and AD syringes were provided for free, they closed the gap between Eastern and Western regions and between the rich and the poor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The inception, achievements, and implications of the China GAVI Alliance Project on Hepatitis B Immunization	VACCINE			English	Review							NEWBORN-INFANTS; VACCINATION; TRANSMISSION	The China GAVI Hepatitis B Immunization Project was initiated in 2002 with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between GAVI and the Government of China. The Project was one of the three (China, India, and Indonesia) GAVI-initiated special projects done to support countries too large to receive full GAVI support for hepatitis B vaccine and safe injections. The Project in China was designed by the Chinese Government and partners to deliver free hepatitis B vaccine and safe injections to all newborns in the 12 Western Provinces and Poverty Counties in 10 Provinces of Central China (1301 Counties with approximately 5.6 million births per year), eliminating the gap in immunization coverage between wealthier and poorer regions of China. The project budget (USD 76 million) was equally shared by GAVI and the Chinese Government. Initially planned for 5 years, two no cost extensions extended the project to 2011. Although China produced hepatitis B vaccine, before the project the vaccine was sold to parents who were also charged a "user fee" for the syringe and vaccine administration. Basic Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines such as BCG, DTP, Polio, and measles vaccines were provided free to parents, although they were charged a user fee. Vaccines were sold by China CDC Offices at provincial, prefecture, county level and township hospitals, and village doctors received a substantial portion of their income from the sale of hepatitis B and other vaccines. The result of charging for hepatitis B vaccine was that coverage was relatively high in Eastern and wealthier counties in Central China (similar to 80-90%), but was much lower (similar to 40%) in Western China and Poverty Counties where parents could not afford the vaccine. The Project was administered by the China MOH and China CDC EPI program, and two Project Co-managers, one from the Chinese Government and the other an international assignee, were chosen. The project had an oversight Operational Advisory Group composed of the Chinese Government, WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI. The initial targets of the project as delineated in the initial MOU for the Project areas (HepB3 coverage will reach 85% at the county level, >75% of newborns at the county level will receive the first dose of hepatitis B within 24 h of birth, and all immunization injections will be with auto disable [AD] syringes) were substantially exceeded. The differential in vaccine coverage between wealthier and poorer parts of China was eliminated contributing to a great improvement inequity. With additional contributions of the Chinese Government the Project was accomplished substantially under budget allowing for additional catch up immunization of children under 15 years of age. More than 5 million health workers were trained in how to deliver hepatitis B vaccine, timely birth dose (TBD), and safe injections, and public awareness of hepatitis B and its prevention rose significantly. TBD coverage was expedited by concurrent efforts to have women deliver in township clinics and district hospitals instead of at home. The effective management of the Project, with a Project office sitting within the China EPI and an Operational Advisory Group for oversight, could serve as a model for other GAVI projects worldwide. Most importantly, the carrier rate in Chinese children less than 5 years of age has fallen to 1%, from a level of 10% before the inception of the Project. Liver cancer, one of the major cancer killers in China (250,000-300,000 annual estimated deaths), will dramatically decline as immunized cohorts of Chinese children age. While hepatitis C and non-alcoholic liver disease also exist in China and can lead to liver cancer and cirrhosis, the majority of liver disease in China is hepatitis B related and therefore preventable. The authors believe that China's success in preventing hepatitis B is one of the greatest public health achievements of the 21st century. Work remains to be done in several key areas. There are still pockets of home births in rural provinces where a TBD is difficult to deliver, and China is strengthening its policy of screening pregnant women for HBsAg and delivering HBIG plus vaccine to newborns of HBV carrier mothers. Approximately 10% of the adult population of China remain chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus and cannot be helped by the vaccine, so prevention of liver cancer and cirrhosis in those groups remains a future challenge for China.

J	Arun, Ö				Arun, Ozgur			International Spotlight: Developing a Gerontological Social Policy Agenda for Turkey	GERONTOLOGIST			English	Article						Gender; Education; Partnership status; Income; Health; Religion and ethnicity; Turkey	HEALTH; AMERICANS; ETHNICITY; GENDER	From 1960 to 2013, the population of Turkey increased almost threefold, with older adults aged 65 and older increasing almost sevenfold. In light of the demographic revolution in the age composition of world populations, we investigated the following research questions from the perspective of Turkish gerontologists: What are the conditions of older people based on sociological factors such as gender, partnership status, income, education, health, religion, and ethnicity? What should Turkeys gerontological agenda contain for the short term, mid-term, and long term, particularly in view of the rapidly changing nature of political, social, and economic life in the country? By 2025, adults (aged 4065) will make up the largest population group in Turkeys history. It is time for Turkey to embrace this demographic gift and identify its own gerontological agenda to pave the way for social justice and social citizenship.

Data were derived from record linkage between the censuses of 1991 and 2001 and register data on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and emigration in the respective periods of 1st October 1991 to 1st January 1996 and 1st October 2001 to 1st January 2006. Both directly and indirectly standardised mortality rates and the relative index of inequality (RII) were computed. Mortality rates among adolescents and young adults have dropped significantly, especially infections and traffic accidents. However, educational inequalities among men have slightly increased: men with a maximum primary education are four times more likely to die than those who are higher educated [RII = 4.09 (2.78-6.03)]. Among women, no social gradient is observed in either period, but a clear split between the lowest educated and other educational groups is apparent in the 2000s. There is a positive evolution towards lower mortality among adolescents and young adults, but educational inequalities remain a public health concern.

J	Soors, W; Dkhimi, F; Criel, B				Soors, Werner; Dkhimi, Fahdi; Criel, Bart			Lack of access to health care for African indigents: a social exclusion perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Access to health care; Indigence; Africa; Social exclusion	EQUITY; PROTECTION; POLITICS; POVERTY	Background: Lack of access to health care is a persistent condition for most African indigents, to which the common technical approach of targeting initiatives is an insufficient antidote. To overcome the standstill, an integrated technical and political approach is needed. Such policy shift is dependent on political support, and on alignment of international and national actors. We explore if the analytical framework of social exclusion can contribute to the latter. Methods: We produce a critical and evaluative account of the literature on three themes: social exclusion, development policy, and indigence in Africa-and their interface. First, we trace the concept of social exclusion as it evolved over time and space in policy circles. We then discuss the relevance of a social exclusion perspective in developing countries. Finally, we apply this perspective to Africa, its indigents, and their lack of access to health care. Results: The concept of social exclusion as an underlying process of structural inequalities has needed two decades to find acceptance in international policy circles. Initial scepticism about the relevance of the concept in developing countries is now giving way to recognition of its universality. For a variety of reasons however, the uptake of a social exclusion perspective in Africa has been limited. Nevertheless, social exclusion as a driver of poverty and inequity in Africa is evident, and manifestly so in the case of the African indigents. Conclusion: The concept of social exclusion provides a useful framework for improved understanding of origins and persistence of the access problem that African indigents face, and for generating political space for an integrated approach.

In spite of increasingly developing intensive neonatal care wards and decreasing neonatal mortality rate, there is no follow up program in Iran. This study was carreid out to design high risk infants follow up care program with the practical aim of creating an model action for whole country, in 2012. Methods: This qualitative study has been done by the Neonatal Department of the Deputy of Public Health in cooperation with Pediatrics Health Research Center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. After study of international documents, consensus agreement about adapted program for Iran has been accomplished by focus group discussion and attended Delphi agreement technique. After compiling primary draft included evidence based guidelines and executive plan, 14 sessions including expert panels were hold to finalize the program. Results: After finalizing the program, high risk infants follow up care service package has been designed in 3 chapters: Evidence based clinical guidelines; eighteen main clinical guidelines and thirteen subsidiaries clinical guidelines, executive plan; 6 general, 6 following up and 5 backup processes. Education program including general and especial courses for care givers and follow up team, and family education processes. Conclusion: We designed and finalized high risk infants follow up care service package. It seems to open a way to extend it to whole country.

With air travel demand expected to grow by 77% in the next twenty years, there is a growing need to address airports' impacts on residents. This study examines the impacts of aircraft emissions on concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a harmful form of air pollution, at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest airport. Aircraft landing and takeoff emissions were modeled for June-July 2002 using the Advanced Modeling System for Transport, Emissions, Reactions, and Deposition of Atmospheric Matter (AMSTERDAM). Distributional analyses show that within 675 of 710 census tracts of the 29-county Atlanta metropolitan region, the average aircraft contribution to PM2.5 was low (<20 ng/m(3)). However, in tracts where aircraft contribution to PM2.5 exceeded 20 ng/m(3) (36 tracts), populations overwhelmingly had lower median incomes, home values, and educational attainment, as well as higher percentages of nonwhite residents, (p < 0.01). OLS regression, principal components analysis, and quantile regression explore the mediating relationships between socioeconomic variables. The relationship between minority population percentages and aircraft-derived particulate matter was found to grow stronger as concentrations increased. Analysis using a concentration-response function indicates that the airport's influence on PM2.5 concentrations may be responsible for approximate to 1.4 premature adult (age 25+) deaths per year (90% confidence interval: 0.5-2.7). The use of air quality modeling in planning decisions may help protect residents and give them necessary information to push for policies and technologies that would reduce emissions and exposure.

J	Horta, O				Horta, Oscar			Expanding Global Justice: The Case for the International Protection of Animals	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article								This article examines and rejects the view that nonhuman animals cannot be recipients of justice, and argues that the main reasons in favor of universal human rights and global justice also apply in the case of the international protection of the interests of nonhuman animals. In any plausible theory of wellbeing, sentience matters; mere species membership or the place where an animal is born does not. This does not merely entail that regulations of the use of animals aimed at reducing their suffering should be implemented. It actually supports the end of such use, as well as other positive steps to provide help and to promote what is good not only for domesticated animals, but also for those living in the wild. Another reason to bring the protection of animals' interests into the international arena is that it is at this level that numerous animal exploitation industries enjoy the protection of different agreements and institutions. It does not follow from this that changing international law should be animal advocates' first priority, but it does follow that they should conduct their work internationally and not limit it to their own countries. Policy Implications An international body should be constituted that is aimed at the protection of all sentient animals globally. Unlike the Organization for Animal Health (OIE) or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna (CITES), the purpose of this organization should not be to further human interests concerning how animals are used, nor to promote environmentalist aims that are concerned with animals only as members of certain salient species. Rather, its purpose should be the protection of the interests of nonhuman animals as sentient individuals. International subsidies to industries whose activities harm nonhuman animals should be brought to an end. The WTO accepts that human rights cannot be violated for the sake of free trade. A similar position should be maintained in the case of the protection of nonhuman animals. No domestic or supranational legislation aimed at protecting animals should be targeted, even if it means a ban on certain imports from other countries. Animal advocacy NGOs and private organizations should aim to spread their work beyond their home countries to the international arena. In particular, given how little public awareness there is about the need for global justice for animals in many countries, they should consider using significant resources to carry out public education on this topic.

We investigated associations of neighborhood poverty, sociability and walkability with self-rated physical and mental health in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) In separate models, each neighborhood variable was associated with physical health but associations with sociability and walkability were stronger than those for poverty. Only walkability remained significant after adjusting for the other neighborhood variables. There was no evidence that self-rated mental health as assessed by the SF12 was associated with neighborhood poverty, walkability or sociability.

This social empowerment methodology, Reflect, enabled 106 women to gain recognition for their unpaid care work through their own collection of time-use data. The literacy skills women acquired facilitated greater representation in community meetings calling for a reduction in their unpaid care work rather than shifting this work to girls. The article draws on Fraser's model of gender justice to explore how women's literacy, girls' education and a more equitable balance of care work are needed to improve women's status.

Methods: cross-sectional study based on data from 371 Latin American women (16-65 years old) from a total of 7,056 registered immigrants accesse through community parthers between 2009-2010. Socioeconomic status was measured through education, income and occupation; subjective social status was measured using the MacArthur Scale, and perceived health, using a Likert scale. Results: a weak correlation between socioeconomic and subjective social status was found. In the bivariate analysis, a significantly higher prevalence of negative perceived health in women with no education, low income, undocumented employment was observed. In the multivariate analysis, higher odds of prevalence of negative perceptions of health in the lower levels of the MacArthur scale were observed. No significant differences with the rest of the variables were found. Conclusions: the study suggests that subjective social status was a better predictor of health status than the socioeconomic status measurements. Therefore, the use of this measurement may be relevant to the study of health inequalities, particularly in socially disadvantaged groups such as immigrants.

J	Sullivan-Marx, EM				Sullivan-Marx, Eileen M.			Is it Time for a Public Health Nursing Approach to Aging?	JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING			English	Article								Following the enactment of Medicare in 1965, access to health care for older adults in the United States improved. At the same time, nurse researchers and policy leaders developed individual and family-centered care interventions and programs that led to improvements in quality of health and life. In the next 20 to 30 years, U.S. and global projections of an expanding aging cohort with potential increases in health care needs, coupled with continued nursing shortage projections, present challenges and opportunities to enhance gerontological nursing's approach to aging care. Invigorating a public health nursing focus on the needs of a population of older adults could enhance nursing's ability to create policy and programs of care that promote quality of life for older adults and their families. Nurses using public health approaches can lead and support social policies regarding the physical environment and daily life circumstances that contribute to health equity. Heightened attention to competencies in community/public health nursing education and promotion of public health nursing careers will be important policy considerations as we face the looming increase in a population of older adults throughout the world.

Methods: Using the structured World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview, the investigators conducted face-to-face surveys between September 1, 2005, and January 30, 2006. A total of 7,134 respondents age 18 years and above finished the surveys. The main outcomes were prevalence of mental disorders according to DSM-IV criteria, as well as prevalence of mental health services used in different sectors. Results: Nine percent of the sample had ever used some type of service for mental health issues, and 6.3% used services outside of the health service sector, such as human services and complementary and alternative medicine. In addition, DSM criteria for a mental disorder over the lifetime were met by 18.1% of respondents; of the respondents with a mental disorder, 18.3% had used mental health services at least once. Migrants who were unmarried, had high family income, were raised in metropolitan areas, had histories of homelessness or attempted suicide, had a psychotic disorder, or had an anxiety disorder were more likely to use services for mental health care. Conclusions: In Shenzhen, few migrants used mental health services and most used complementary and alternative medicine services. Future studies of service utilization patterns in migrant populations should give special attention to personal characteristics, such as family support.

Community level data on inequalities in early child development are therefore required to establish the impact of government early years' policies and programmes on children's strengths and vulnerabilities at local and national level. This would allow local leaders to target tailored interventions according to community needs to improve children's readiness for the transition to school. The challenge is collecting valid data on sufficient samples of children entering school to derive robust inferences about each local birth cohort's developmental status. This information needs to be presented in a way that allows community stakeholders to understand the results, expediting the improvement of preschool programming to improve future cohorts' development in the early years. The aim of the study was to carry out a pilot to test the feasibility and ease of use in Scotland of the 104-item teacher-administered Early Development Instrument, an internationally validated measure of children's global development at school entry developed in Canada. Methods: Phase 1 was piloted in an education district with 14 Primary 1 teachers assessing a cohort of 154 children, following which the instrument was adapted for the Scottish context (Scottish Early Development Instrument: SEDI). Phase 2 was then carried out using the SEDI. Data were analysed from a larger sample of 1090 participants, comprising all Primary 1 children within this school district, evaluated by 68 teachers. Results: The SEDI displayed adequate psychometric and discriminatory properties and is appropriate for use across Scotland without any further modifications. Children in the lowest socioeconomic status quintiles were 2-3 times more likely than children in the most affluent quintile to score low in at least one developmental domain. Even in the most affluent quintile though, 17% of children were 'developmentally vulnerable', suggesting that those in need cannot be identified by socioeconomic status alone. Conclusions: The SEDI offers a feasible means of providing communities with a holistic overview of school readiness for targeting early years' interventions.

J	Rodwell, J; Gulyas, A				Rodwell, John; Gulyas, Andre			The impact of the psychological contract, justice and individual differences: nurses take it personally when employers break promises	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						career commitment; job satisfaction; nurse management; organizational justice; psychological contract; structural equation modelling	PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT; JOB-SATISFACTION; SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; COMMITMENT; TURNOVER; AFFECTIVITY; PERCEPTIONS; OBLIGATIONS; FULFILLMENT; VALIDATION	AimTo explore affective and attitudinal outcomes of aspects of the psychological contract, organizational justice and negative affectivity in nursing. BackgroundJob satisfaction, mental health and commitment to organizations and the nursing profession is important for nurse retention. The psychological contract and organizational justice are related constructs that have been linked to these outcomes, as has the characteristic of negative affectivity. Rarely have the relationships between these concepts and outcomes been examined. DesignCross-sectional data were collected during November, 2007. MethodSurvey data collected on Registered Nurses and midwives from a large metropolitan hospital in Australia (n=193, after removing missing cases and outliers) were analysed using structural equation modelling. The model used self-report measures of psychological contract obligations, fulfilment and breach, organizational justice and negative affectivity as predictors of job satisfaction, organizational commitment, career commitment and psychological distress. ResultsGoodness-of-fit statistics confirmed a well-fitting model. The model explained 49%, 29%, 60% and 47% of the variance in psychological distress, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and career commitment respectively. ConclusionFindings support the influence of the psychological contract, fairness and individual differences on outcomes important to nurse retention. Keeping promises is more important than making promises that cannot be kept. The results support a discrepancy mechanism underlying fulfilment and breach. The impact of breach suggests that nurses take breach personally, whereas fulfilment may represent a global evaluation of discrepancies. Ultimately, fulfilling, rather than making promises, keeps nurses happy.

In urban areas, IAP interacts with outdoor pollutants in toxic chemical mixtures affecting also other citizens and damaging regional air quality in terms of 'brown clouds'. Deaths result mainly in women, children and infants, who are directly exposed to smoke in unventilated kitchens, thus reflecting differentiated and unequal impacts across population groups. Despite the heavy health burden and discomfort, IAP has only recently been recognised as associated with neglected diseases. In search of synergies between adaptation and mitigation, we seek gender sensitive social innovations to halt smoke, soot and early death while reducing deforestation and carbon emissions. Using transition arenas as a participatory method for experiments and social learning we engaged with local entrepreneurs and peasant farmers in subSaharan Africa to initiate co-production of efficient flue-piped stoves that save energy, labour and lives. Findings indicate that successful design, production and adoption of improved cooking stoves is possible, but the structural challenges of poverty, inequality and distrust may inhibit further diffusion and more profound processes of social learning. Insights from local studies must therefore be contextualised into broader understandings, as attempted here, while local adoption must be combined with wider initiatives and government policies into.complex micro-to-macro solutions that provide forceful effects against IAP and its drivers.

A subsample of data from the second International Self-Reported Delinquency Study was used (N= 10,525), collected among adolescents in the seventh to ninth grades of secondary school in four Western European countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria). Data were analyzed with multilevel logistic regression techniques. There is an indication that type of education affects prevalence rates of drunkenness and heavy episodic drinking; these effects prove robust for differences in socio-economic backgrounds. The results of this study support the literature regarding the role of the educational system in the reproduction of health inequalities and underscore the finding that students from education types of lower status are at greater risk than those from higher status types.

A comprehensive analysis of breastfeeding patterns across the developing world and what we can learn from them	BMC MEDICINE			English	Article						Breastfeeding; Health inequity; Child health; Global burden of disease; Infant feeding	NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; EARLY INITIATION; GLOBAL BURDEN; 21 REGIONS; DISEASE; UNDERNUTRITION; DETERMINANTS; NEWBORN; RISK	Background: In 2010 more than 7.7 million children died before their fifth birthday. Over 98% of these deaths occurred in developing countries, and recent estimates have attributed hundreds of thousands of these deaths to suboptimal breastfeeding. Methods: This study estimated prevalence of suboptimal breastfeeding for 137 developing countries from 1990 to 2010. These estimates were compared against WHO infant feeding recommendations and combined with effect sizes from existing literature to estimate associated disease burden using a standard comparative risk assessment approach. These prevalence estimates were disaggregated by wealth quintile and linked with child mortality rates to assess how improved rates of breastfeeding may affect child health inequalities. Results: In 2010, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding ranged from 3.5% in Djibouti to 77.3% in Rwanda. The proportion of child Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributable to suboptimal breastfeeding is 7.6% at the global level and as high as 20.2% in Swaziland. Suboptimal breastfeeding is a leading childhood risk factor in all developing countries and consistently ranks higher than water and sanitation. Within most countries, breastfeeding prevalence rates do not vary considerably across wealth quintiles. Conclusions: Breastfeeding is an effective child health intervention that does not require extensive health system infrastructure. Improvements in rates of exclusive and continued breastfeeding can contribute to the reduction of child mortality inequalities in developing countries.

Suitability of ART approach for managing caries lesions in people with disability-Experts' opinion	ACTA ODONTOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						atraumatic restorative treatment; attitude of health personnel; dental care for disabled; dental education; professional practice	MINIMAL INTERVENTION DENTISTRY; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; DENTAL TREATMENT; ORAL-HEALTH; CARE; INEQUALITIES	Objective. This study aimed to obtain the opinions of experts in Special Care Dentistry (SCD) regarding the suitability of the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) approach for the treatment of carious lesions in persons with disability. Material and methods. Thirty expert participants from around the world, joining the SCD Task Force meeting, Education Committee of the International Association of Disability and Oral Health (Antalya, Turkey, 2011), completed a questionnaire survey. Frequency distributions of variables were analysed using Chi-Square test for differences between variables. Results. All respondents reported having full or moderate knowledge of ART (23.3% and 63.3%, respectively) and 66.7% indicated that they felt the technique was useful for this population. However, only 50% of respondents used the technique regularly in their practice and five (16.7%) replied that they would never use it, even if a favourable evidence base for ART use in this population became available. The barriers to the introduction of ART to SCD are discussed and the need for training and further research highlighted. Conclusions. Barriers to the implementation of ART in practice were placement of the restoration under difficult conditions and the dentist's pre-conception of the technique as being 'lower quality dentistry'. Experts suggested that some of these barriers might be overcome by improving the evidence base in favour of the technique, specifically in the population with disability.

With the country's Prime Minister serving as a co-chair of the UN post-2015 development agenda panel, a this is a unique opportunity for the UK to put forward its health system architecture as a highly applicable and well-tested model for providing access to efficient and cost-effective care, with minimal financial hardship. Arguably, such a model tailored to the needs of specific countries could consequently lead to commercial opportunities for UK plc. in areas such as consulting, training, education and healthcare products. Finally, this approach would be consistent with the current thinking on the evolving role of UK aid, especially in the case of emerging powers such as India, where the focus has shifted from aid to investment in technical assistance and cooperation as a means of boosting bilateral business and trade.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Saudi Arabia; health systems; Saudi Health Reforms; New Health Insurance System; critical review	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ARABIA; INSURANCE; CARE	This paper outlines the health context of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). It reviews health systems development in the KSA from 1925 through to contemporary New Health Insurance System (NHIS). It also examines the consistency of NHIS in view of the emerging challenges. This paper identifies the determinants and scope of contextual consistency. First, it indicates the need to evolve an indigenous, integrated, and comprehensive insurance system. Second, it highlights the access and equity gaps in service delivery across the rural and remote regions and suggests how to bring these under insurance coverage. Third, it suggests how inputs from both the public and private sectors should be harmonized - the quality of services in the private healthcare industry to be regulated by the state and international standards, its scope to be determined primarily by open-market dynamics and the public sector welfare-model to ensure access of all to essential health services. Fourth, it states the need to implement an evidence-based public health policy and bridge inherent gaps in policy design and personal-level lifestyles. Fifth, it points out the need to produce a viable infrastructure for health insurance. Because social research and critical reviews in the KSA health scenario are rare, this paper offers insights into the mainstream challenges of NHIS implementation and identifies the inherent weaknesses that need attention. It guides health policy makers, economists, planners, healthcare service managers, and even the insurance businesses, and points to key directions for similar research in future.

J	Franken, M; Koolman, X				Franken, Margreet; Koolman, Xander			Health system goals: A discrete choice experiment to obtain societal valuations	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Health system goals; Valuation; Discrete choice experiment; International comparison; Health system performance; Health policy	PREFERENCES; UTILITY	Objective: To improve previous approaches to health system goals valuation. Methods: We reviewed literature on health system performance and previous comparative performance assessments, and combined this with literature on process utility to create a theoretical foundation for health system goals. We used a discrete choice experiment to elicit goal weights. To obtain social justice weights respondents were placed behind a 'veil of ignorance'. To ensure that respondents understood their task, we instructed them in a classroom setting. Results: We identified five health system goals. All five goals significantly affected choice behavior. An equitable distribution of health obtained the highest weight (0.34), followed by average level of health (0.29) and financial fairness (0.24). Both process outcomes (utility derived from the process and its distribution) received much lower weights (0.07 and 0.06, respectively). Conclusions: Our framework adds to that of the World Health Organization. We demonstrated the feasibility of measuring societal valuation of health system goals with a multi-attribute technique based on trade-offs. Our weights placed much greater emphasis on health and health inequality than on process outcomes. Our study improves the methodology of international health system performance comparison and thereby enhances global evidence-based health policy information. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Smoking and the potential for reduction of inequalities in mortality in Europe	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Smoking; Mortality; Inequalities; Modeling tool; PAF; International variation	TOBACCO CONTROL INTERVENTIONS; LUNG-CANCER MORTALITY; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES; SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; HEALTH BEHAVIORS; RISK-FACTORS; WOMEN; OLDER; MEN	Socioeconomic inequalities in health and mortality remain a widely recognized problem. Countries with smaller inequalities in smoking have smaller inequalities in mortality, and smoking plays an important part in the explanation of inequalities in some countries. We identify the potential for reducing inequalities in all-cause and smoking-related mortality in 19 European populations, by applying different scenarios of smoking exposure. Smoking prevalence information and mortality data come from 19 European populations. Prevalence rates are mostly taken from National Health Surveys conducted around the year 2000. Mortality rates are based on country-specific longitudinal or cross-sectional datasets. Relative risks come from the Cancer Prevention Study II. Besides all-cause mortality we analyze several smoking-related cancers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma. We use a newly-developed tool to quantify the changes in population health potentially resulting from modifying the population distribution of exposure to smoking. This tool is based on the epidemiological measure of the population attributable fraction, and estimates the impact of scenario-based distributions of smoking on educational inequalities in mortality. The potential reduction of relative inequality in all-cause mortality between those with high and low education amounts up to 26 % for men and 32 % for women. More than half of the relative inequality may be reduced for some causes of death, often in countries of Northern Europe and in Britain. Patterns of potential reduction in inequality differ by country or region and sex, suggesting that the priority given to smoking as an entry-point for tackling health inequalities should differ between countries.

Food price is one way through which climate change may affect health. The aim of this study of the global and Australian food systems is to provide a whole-of-system analysis of food price vulnerabilities, highlighting the key pressure points across the food system through which climate change could potentially have the greatest impact on consumer food prices and the implications for population health. We outline areas where there are particular vulnerabilities for food systems and food prices arising from climate change, particularly global commodity prices; agricultural productivity; short term supply shocks; and less direct factors such as input costs and government policies. We use Australia as a high-income country case study to consider these issues in more detail. The complex and dynamic nature of pricing mechanisms makes it difficult to predict precisely how prices will be impacted. Should prices rise disproportionately among healthy foodstuffs compared to less healthy foods there may be adverse health outcomes if less expensive and less healthy foods are substituted. Higher prices will also have equity implications with lower socio-economic groups most impacted given these households currently spend proportionately more of their weekly income on food. The ultimate objective of this research is to identify the pathways through the food system via which climate change may affect food prices and ultimately population health, thereby providing evidence for food policy which takes into account environmental and health considerations.

J	Cohen, J; Ezer, T				Cohen, Jonathan; Ezer, Tamar			HUMAN RIGHTS IN PATIENT CARE: A THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL FRAMEWORK	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								The concept of "human rights in patient care" refers to the application of human rights principles to the context of patient care. It provides a principled alternative to the growing discourse of "patients' rights" that has evolved in response to widespread and severe human rights violations in health settings. Unlike "patients' rights," which is rooted in a consumer framework, this concept derives from inherent human dignity and neutrally applies universal, legally recognized human rights principles, protecting both patients and providers and admitting of limitations that can be justified by human rights norms. It recognizes the interrelation between patient and provider rights, particularly in contexts where providers face simultaneous obligations to patients and the state ("dual loyalty") and may be pressured to abet human rights violations. The human rights lens provides a means to examine systemic issues and state responsibility. Human rights principles that apply to patient care include both the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which covers both positive and negative guarantees in respect of health, as well as civil and political rights ranging from the patient's right to be free from torture and inhumane treatment to liberty and security of person. They also focus attention on the right of socially excluded groups to be free from discrimination in the delivery of health care. Critical rights relevant to providers include freedom of association and the enjoyment of decent work conditions. Some, but not all, of these human rights correspond to rights that have been articulated in " patients' rights" charters. Complementary to-but distinct from-bioethics, human rights in patient care carry legal force and can be applied through judicial action. They also provide a powerful language to articulate and mobilize around justice concerns, and to engage in advocacy through the media and political negotiation. As " patients' rights" movements and charters grow in popularity, it is important to link patient rights back to human rights standards and processes that are grounded in international law and consensus.

Assessing trauma care at the district and provincial hospital levels: a case study of hospitals in Kenya	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Trauma care; Low and middle income countries; Developing countries	QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; EDUCATION	Trauma is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, of which more than 90% occur in low- and middle-income countries. Given the magnitude of this inequality, there is a need to devise and use tools to assess the capacity of facility-based trauma care. This study used two tools, hospital flowcharts and the World Health Organization's Trauma Care Checklist, to describe trauma care capacity at two hospitals in Kenya and ways in which this capacity can be strengthened. We found these hospitals had a large volume of trauma, but due to the lack of intensive care units, specialized trauma units, and axillary services, such as orthopedics and neurosurgery, the hospitals had a limited ability to provide definitive care for injured patients in critical condition. Additionally, organizational capabilities, such as trauma registries, trauma-specific training, and quality improvement programmes were lacking. The state of trauma care at district and provincial levels in Kenya demonstrates a strong case for national and global investment in clinical and systemic interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Inter-Sectoral Costs and Benefits of Mental Health Prevention: Towards a New Classification Scheme	JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article							ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; INTERVENTION; DEPRESSION; CHILDREN; ILLNESS; DEPENDENCE; DISORDERS; PROGRAMS; PARENTS; SAVINGS	Background: Many preventive interventions for mental disorders have costs and benefits that spill over to sectors outside the healthcare sector. Little is known about these "inter-sectoral costs and benefits" (ICBs) of prevention. However, to achieve an efficient allocation of scarce resources, insights on ICBs are indispensable. Aim of the Study: The main aim was to identify the ICBs related to the prevention of mental disorders and provide a sector-specific classification scheme for these ICBs. Methods: Using PubMed, a literature search was conducted for ICBs of mental disorders and related (psycho)social effects. A policy perspective was used to build the scheme's structure, which was adapted to the outcomes of the literature search. In order to validate the scheme's international applicability inside and outside the mental health domain, semi-structured interviews were conducted with (inter)national experts in the broad fields of health promotion and disease prevention. Results: The searched-for items appeared in a total of 52 studies. The ICBs found were classified in one of four sectors: "Education", "Labor & Social Security", "Household & Leisure" or "Criminal Justice System". Psycho(social) effects were placed in a separate section under "Individual & Family". Based on interviews, the scheme remained unadjusted, apart from adding a population-based dimension. Discussion: This is the first study which offers a sector-specific classification of ICBs. Given the explorative nature of the study, no guidelines on sector-specific classification of ICBs were available. Nevertheless, the classification scheme was acknowledged by an international audience and could therefore provide added value to researchers and policymakers in the field of mental health economics and prevention. Implications for Health Policies: The identification and classification of ICBs offers decision makers supporting information on how to optimally allocate scarce resources with respect to preventive interventions for mental disorders. Implications for Further Research: By exploring a new area of research, which has remained largely unexplored until now, the current study has an added value as it may form the basis for the development of a tool which can be used to calculate the ICBs of specific mental health related preventive interventions.

The local Joneses: Household consumption and income inequality in large metropolitan areas	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY			English	Article						Inequality; Stratification; Consumption	CONSUMERS; NEIGHBORS; CULTURE; SNOB	Do household consumption practices depend upon local standards of decency or distinction? This article explores effects of local income structure on household consumption across 18 large U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). Results show greater overall spending in high-inequality MSAs. But contrary to conventional depictions of "conspicuous consumption," the additional spending goes mostly toward shelter and food, not more visible purchases of jewelry, vehicles, apparel, and entertainment. High median income, by contrast, is associated with greater spending in two visible goods categories (apparel and entertainment), but only among low-income households. Results support depictions of expenditure cascades, where spending by those better off ratchets up local standards of "normal" and socially acceptable living. Some unfortunate consequences include decreased investment in health care and heightened competition for access to quality public schooling. In this sense, growing economic inequality and positional consumption may be self-reinforcing processes.

It is an alternative to standard utilitarian welfarism, the theoretical approach to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-utility analyses. Despite the limitations of the utility approach in capturing non-health benefits and broader welfare inequalities, there have been very limited applications of the capability approach in the mental health context where these issues are imperative. We report the development and application of a multidimensional instrument, the OxCAP-MH, which aims to operationalise the capability approach for outcome measurement in mental health research. The study was carried out as part of an ongoing programme on community coercion experienced by service users with severe and enduring mental illness being treated using Community Treatment Orders. Capabilities data were collected at baseline in the OCTET RCT for 333 'revolving door' mental health service users who were in involuntary hospital treatment at the time of recruitment in England (2008-2011). The research focused on the identification of capabilities domains most affected by mental illness and their association with socio-demographic and clinical factors and other measures of well-being such as the EQ-5D and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scales. The OxCAP-MH item response rate was 90%-68%. There were significant correlations between service users' overall capability scores and the GAF, EQ-5D VAS and EQ-5D-3L utilities (corr = 0.249, 0.514, 0.415, respectively). The most affected capability domains were: 'Daily activities', 'Influencing local decisions', 'Enjoying recreation', 'Planning one's life' and 'Discrimination'. Age had a mixed effect, while female service users and those with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia or longer illness duration reported significantly lower capability scores.

J	MacNeil, J; Ryan, M				MacNeil, Joan; Ryan, Maureen			Enacting global health in the nursing classroom	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Global health; Global social justice; Undergraduate nursing education	PROJECT	Globalization presents nurses with the challenges and an ethical responsibility of being competent caregivers within a global society. The link between globalization and global health, and the contributions nursing can make to the global health environment are described in the delivery of a new required course for undergraduate nursing students in a four year degree program. Innovative approaches for the delivery of this course are described, which even though living locally, can encourage nursing students to think globally. The need for nursing programs to acknowledge the shared responsibilities for examining global health challenges is now part of our reality in many countries.

Bringing Culture into Human Biology and Biology Back into Anthropology	AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST			English	Article						biology; anthropology; political economy; theory; biocultural; biologia; antropologia; economia politica; teoria; biocultural	BLOOD-PRESSURE; SOCIAL CLASSIFICATION; HYPERTENSION; EMBODIMENT; STATURE; STRESS; RACE	In the recent past, human biology in anthropology was typically theorized as separate fromeven in tension withculture. In contrast, by further theorizing the social, political, and ecological processes through which what I call cultural-biologicals dialectically come into being, I foreground the restlessness and site specificity of human biology. In this article, I highlight research of three junior colleagues to propose two general processes connecting culture to biology: (1) through culturally specific readings of biological variables that, in turn, have biological consequences, and (2) through systems of global and local stratification that get under the skin. Anthropology is well positioned to follow the diverse pathways through which forms of stratification such as racism, sexism, and class inequalities seep into our biological beings, influencing states of nutrition, stress, and health, as well as ecology and culture. I show that biology does not stand still. By highlighting some of the restlessness of biological processes, I hope to move anthropology to reconsider a more complex, site-specific, and dialectical approach to human biology. Rethinking biologyespecially human biologyin these ways may profoundly change how anthropologists, biologists, and citizens understand biology and thereby care for human bodies.

J	Schmid, E				Schmid, Evelyne			SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL RIGHTS AND WRONGS AFTER ARMED CONFLICTS Using the State Reporting Procedure before the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights More Effectively	NETHERLANDS QUARTERLY OF HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						armed conflict; education; health; impunity; internal displacement; transitional justice; United Nations Committee on Economic; Social and Cultural Rights; post-conflict justice	BOSNIA	Commentators and practitioners increasingly emphasise that redressing violations of economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) and improving the living conditions of individuals and communities is key in countries emerging from armed conflicts and widespread human rights abuses. Yet, it remains difficult to achieve this objective in practice and it is not obvious how international law can contribute to the enhancement of ESCR in the aftermath of pervasive abuses. This article addresses some of the subject's conceptual and practical complexities: Based on an analysis of all relevant concluding observations, the article traces the evolution of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights' jurisprudence on armed conflict. It then uses this analysis to highlight specific ways in which the reporting procedure before this supervisory body could be used more effectively to address ESCR problems related to armed conflicts, including by forging synergies with transitional justice mechanisms and broader post-conflict recovery policies.

Silencing women's sexuality: global AIDS policies and the case of the female condom	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY			English	Article						global policy; AIDS prevention; gender; sexual agency; female condom	HIV PREVENTION; MALE CIRCUMCISION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; HIV/AIDS; STIGMA; RETHINKING; MARRIAGE; GENDER; BLAME; RISK	Introduction: The female condom is the only evidence-based AIDS prevention technology that has been designed for the female body; yet, most women do not have access to it. This is remarkable since women constitute the majority of all HIV-positive people living in sub-Saharan Africa, and gender inequality is seen as a driving force of the AIDS epidemic. In this study, we analyze how major actors in the AIDS prevention field frame the AIDS problem, in particular the female condom in comparison to other prevention technologies, in their discourse and policy formulations. Our aim is to gain insight into the discursive power mechanisms that underlie the thinking about AIDS prevention and women's sexual agency. Methods: We analyze the AIDS policies of 16 agencies that constitute the most influential actors in the global response to AIDS. Our study unravels the discursive power of these global AIDS policy actors, when promoting and making choices between AIDS prevention technologies. We conducted both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of how the global AIDS epidemic is being addressed by them, in framing the AIDS problem, labelling of different categories of people for targeting AIDS prevention programmes and in gender marking of AIDS prevention technologies. Results: We found that global AIDS policy actors frame the AIDS problem predominantly in the context of gender and reproductive health, rather than that of sexuality and sexual rights. Men's sexual agency is treated differently from women's sexual agency. An example of such differentiation and of gender marking is shown by contrasting the framing and labelling of male circumcision as an intervention aimed at the prevention of HIV with that of the female condom. Conclusions: The gender-stereotyped global AIDS policy discourse negates women's agency in sexuality and their sexual rights. This could be an important factor in limiting the scale-up of female condom programmes and hampering universal access to female condoms.	[Peters, Anny J. T. P.; Jansen, Willy H.

The interaction between axes of inequality in studies on discrimination, stigma and HIV/AIDS: Contributions to the recent international literature	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						stigma; discrimination; HIV; AIDS; literature review; intersectionality	MALE SEX WORKERS; HIV PREVENTION; BLACK-MEN; HEALTH-PROFESSIONALS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; RISK; PEOPLE; WOMEN; AIDS; INTERSECTIONALITY	This study aimed to conduct a systematic literature review in order to identify how recent studies have addressed the interaction between social inequality and the processes of exclusion and marginalisation related to HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination. The review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus databases and included publications from 2008 to 2011. Of 497 summaries found in the review, 42 were selected and classified based on topic, population, axes of inequality employed, conceptualisation of stigma and relationship between stigma and vulnerability. Results demonstrated that there is a predominance of research on stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV/AIDS, sexual and racial/ethnic minorities and migrants. The axes of inequality examined in the literature were linked to specific cultural and socio-economic dimensions and analysed as factors that behave synergistically to increase social groups' vulnerability to HIV. Half of the 42 articles viewed expression of stigma/discrimination to be the result of power dynamics that reinforce the processes of social exclusion. The other half of the articles tended to describe stigma as intrinsic to social interaction. Some researchers are making a visible effort to devise consistent theoretical and methodological approaches in order to understand stigma as a complex social process produced at the intersection of different axes of inequality. These efforts provide vital information that can inform how best to address HIV/AIDS stigma.

Around one in four adults in rural India have hypertension, and of those, only a minority are accessing appropriate care. Health systems in India face substantial challenges to meet these gaps in care, and innovative solutions are needed. Methods: We hypothesise that a multifaceted intervention involving capacity strengthening of primary healthcare doctors and non-physician healthcare workers through use of a mobile device-based clinical decision support system will result in improved blood pressure control for individuals at high risk of a cardiovascular disease event when compared with usual healthcare. This intervention will be implemented as a stepped wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial in 18 primary health centres and 54 villages in rural Andhra Pradesh involving adults aged >= 40 years at high cardiovascular disease event risk (approximately 15,000 people). Cardiovascular disease event risk will be calculated based on World Health Organisation/ International Society of Hypertension's region-specific risk charts. Cluster randomisation will occur at the level of the primary health centres. Outcome analyses will be conducted blinded to intervention allocation. Expected outcomes: The primary study outcome is the difference in the proportion of people meeting guideline-recommended blood pressure targets in the intervention period vs. the control period. Secondary outcomes include mean reduction in blood pressure levels; change in other cardiovascular disease risk factors, including body mass index, current smoking, reported healthy eating habits, and reported physical activity levels; self-reported use of blood pressure and other cardiovascular medicines; quality of life (using the EQ-5D); and cardiovascular disease events (using hospitalisation data). Trial outcomes will be accompanied by detailed process and economic evaluations. Significance: The findings are likely to inform policy on a scalable strategy to overcome entrenched inequities in access to effective healthcare for under-served populations in low and middle income country settings.

We examined work disability due to depression with four indicators of socioeconomic status. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 125 355 Finnish public sector employees was linked to national register data on work disability (>9 days) due to depressive disorders (International Classification of Diseases, codes F32-F34) from January 2005 to December 2011. Primary outcomes were the onset of work disability due to depressive disorders and, among those with such disability, return to work after and recurrent episodes of work disability due to depression. Results: We found a consistent inverse socioeconomic gradient in work disability due to depression. Lower occupational position, lower educational level, smaller residence size, and rented (vs. owner-occupied) residence were all associated with an increased risk of work disability. Return to work was slower for employees with basic education (cumulative odds ratio = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.05-1.39) compared to those with higher education. Recurrent work disability episodes due to depression were less common among upper-grade non-manual workers (the highest occupational group) than among lower-grade non-manual (hazard ratio = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07-1.25) and manual (hazard ratio = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.02-1.26) workers. Conclusions: These data from Finnish public sector employees show persistent socioeconomic inequalities in work disability due to depression from 2005 to 2011 in terms of onset, recovery and recurrence.

The global enslavement of children affects countless numbers of victims who are trafficked within their home countries or transported away from their homes and treated as commodities to be bought, sold, and resold for labor or sexual exploitation. All over the world, girls are particularly likely to be trafficked into the sex trade: Girls and women constitute 98% of those who are trafficked for CSE. Health and safety standards in exploitative settings are generally extremely low, and the degree of experienced violence has been linked with adverse physical, psychological, and social-emotional development. The human-rights-based approach to child trafficking provides a comprehensive conceptual framework whereby victim-focused and law enforcement responses can be developed, implemented, and evaluated. This article highlights promising policies and programs designed to prevent child trafficking and CSE by combating demand for sex with children, reducing supply, and strengthening communities. The literature reviewed includes academic publications as well as international and governmental and nongovernmental reports. Implications for social policy and future research are presented.

Thirty years of the United Nations and global ageing: An Australian perspective	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL ON AGEING			English	Article						ageing; human rights; non-governmental organisations; policy; United Nations		Over the past three decades, the United Nations (UN) has slowly devoted increasing attention to global ageing. Concern for individually based welfare or health-care programs for older people in developed countries has progressed to also consider the contributions of older people and implications of ageing for socioeconomic advancement in developing countries, including those in Asia Oceania. These shifts are evident in the International Plans of Action on Ageing from Vienna in 1982 to Madrid in 2002; recent 10-year reviews of the Madrid Plan; and current advocacy for inclusion of ageing in the influential UN Millennium Plan post-2015. Australia has demonstrated progressive policies and contributed to ageing developments by the UN, International Federation on Ageing the World Health Organization and the International Association of Gerontology. Key ideas driving further action are the importance of valuing people at all ages, addressing inequalities over the life-course and implementing human rights approaches to ageing.

A systematic review of risk assessment strategies for populations at high risk of engaging in violent behaviour: update 2002-8	HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT			English	Review							INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; SELF-APPRAISAL QUESTIONNAIRE; FAMILY-OF-ORIGIN; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; WIFE ASSAULT RECIDIVISM; SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; HARMFUL COMMAND HALLUCINATIONS; PERRY AGGRESSION QUESTIONNAIRE	Background: This review systematically examines the research literature published in the period 2002-8 on structured violence risk assessment instruments designed for use in mental health services or the criminal justice system. It adopted much broader inclusion criteria than previous reviews in the same area in order to capture and summarise data on the widest possible range of available instruments. Objectives: To address two questions: (1) what study characteristics are associated with a risk assessment instrument score being significantly associated with a violent outcome? and (2) which risk assessment instruments have the highest level of predictive validity for a violent outcome? Data sources: Nineteen bibliographic databases were searched from January 2002 to April 2008, including PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, British Nursing Index, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Education Resources Information Centre, The Cochrane Library and Web of Knowledge. Review methods: Inclusion criteria for studies were (1) evaluation of a structured risk tool; (2) outcome measure of interpersonal violence; (3) participants aged 17 years or over; and (4) participants with a mental disorder and/or at least one offence and/or at least one indictable offence. A series of bivariate analyses using either a chi-squared test or Spearman's rank-order correlation were conducted to explore associations between study characteristics and outcomes. Data from a subset of studies reporting area under the curve (AUC) analysis were combined to provide estimates of mean validity. Results: For the overall set of included studies (n = 959), over three-quarters (77%) were conducted in the USA, Canada or the UK. Two-thirds of all studies were conducted with offenders who had either no formal mental health diagnosis (43%) or forensic samples with a formal diagnosis (25%). The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised was tested in the largest number of studies (n = 192). Most studies (78%) reported a statistically significant (p < 0.05) relationship between the instrument score and a violent outcome. Prospective data collection (chi(2) = 4.4, p = 0.035), number of people recruited (U = 27.8, p = 0.012) and number of participants at end point (U = 26.9, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with predictive validity. For those instruments tested in five or more studies reporting AUC values, the General Statistical Information on Recidivism instrument had the highest mean AUC (0.73). Limitations: Agreement between pairs of reviewers in the initial pilot exercises was good but less than perfect, so discrepancies may be present given the complexity and subjectivity of some aspects of violence research. Only five of the seven calendar years (2003-7) are completely covered, with partial coverage of 2002 and 2008. There is no weighting for sample or effect sizes when results from studies are aggregated. Conclusions: A very large number of studies examining the relationship between a structured instrument and a violent outcome were published in this relatively short 7-year period. The general quality of the literature is weak in places (e.g. over-reliance on cross-sectional designs) and a vast range of distinct instruments have been tested to varying degrees. However, there is evidence of some convergence around a small number of high-performing instruments and identification of the components of a high-quality evaluation approach, including AUC analysis. The upper limits (AUC >= 0.85) of instrument-based prediction have probably been achieved and are unlikely to be exceeded using instruments alone.

ETHICS OF ARV BASED PREVENTION: TREATMENT-AS-PREVENTION AND PrEP	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						antiretroviral therapy; bioethics; developing world; HIV; AIDS; justice; prevention	HIV; PROPHYLAXIS; INFECTION; HEALTH	Published data show that new HIV prevention strategies including treatment-as-prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using oral antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are highly, but not completely, effective if regimens are taken as directed. Consequently, their implementation may challenge norms around HIV prevention. Specific concerns include the potential for ARV-based prevention to reframe responsibility, erode beneficial sexual norms and waste resources. This paper explores what rights claims uninfected people can make for access to ARVs for prevention, and whether moral claims justify the provision of ARV therapy to those who do not yet clinically require treatment as a way of reducing HIV transmission risk. An ethical analysis was conducted of the two strategies, PrEP and treatment-as-prevention, using a public health stewardship model developed by the Nuffield Bioethics Council to consider and compare the application of PrEP and treatment-as-prevention strategies. We found that treating the person with HIV rather than the uninfected person offers advantages in settings where there are limited opportunities to access care. A treatment-as-prevention strategy that places all the emphasis upon the positive person's adherence however carries a disproportionate burden of responsibility. PrEP remains an important option for receptive partners who face increased biological vulnerability. We conclude that the use of ARV for prevention is ethically justified, despite imperfect global to drugs for those in clinical need. The determination of which ARV-based HIV prevention strategy is ethically preferable is complex and must take into account both public health and interpersonal considerations.

J	Kenworthy, NJ; Bulled, N				Kenworthy, Nora J.; Bulled, Nicola			FROM MODELING TO MORALS: IMAGINING THE FUTURE OF HIV PREP IN LESOTHO	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						antiretroviral therapy; HIV; AIDS; Prevention; Ethics; southern Africa; treatment; resource allocation	SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS; DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY; PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; ANTIRETROVIRAL PROPHYLAXIS; GENITAL-TRACT; UNITED-STATES; HUMAN-RIGHTS; INFECTION; CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS; TRANSMISSION	Amidst growing global endorsements of new biomedical HIV prevention strategies, ARV-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (ARV PrEP) has garnered considerable attention as a potentially promising prevention strategy. Though it may offer more effective protection for certain at-risk groups than conventional prevention strategies (such as sexual partner reduction, condom use, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission), PrEP is more costly. PrEP requires more ongoing contact between individuals and providers, and a level of surveillance from the health system that is not necessary with other preventive measures. In this sense, it represents a new bio-technology for HIV prevention that poses particular challenges for worldwide implementation, given developing countries' struggling health systems and incomplete HIV treatment programs. Since the emergence of PrEP has stimulated ethical discussions premised on incomplete knowledge of efficacy and implementation, this paper explores the ethical parameters of a likely scenario for PrEP usage in a single, resource-poor country. We first develop a plausible model for PrEP deployment and utilization based on current PrEP research, while carefully considering the reigning institutional values of feasibility and effectiveness in global health approaches. Drawing on ethnographic research of HIV treatment and prevention approaches in Lesotho, we address ethical questions arising from this scenario of PrEP delivery. Lesotho presents a compelling and emblematic case study of PrEP's potential successes and pitfalls in a developing country, given the country's high HIV prevalence, struggles to achieve universal access to HIV treatment regimes, continued existence of stigma around the epidemic, and difficulties in addressing persistent social inequalities that fuel infections.

Born Too Soon Preterm Birth Action	Born Too Soon: Accelerating actions for prevention and care of 15 million newborns born too soon	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Review							LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS; LIVES SAVED TOOL; PRETERM BIRTHS; NEONATAL RESUSCITATION; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; TIME TRENDS; MORTALITY; HEALTH; INTERVENTIONS; STILLBIRTH	Preterm birth complication is the leading cause of neonatal death resulting in over one million deaths each year of the 15 million babies born preterm. To accelerate change, we provide an overview of the comprehensive strategy required, the tools available for context-specific health system implementation now, and the priorities for research and innovation. There is an urgent need for action on a dual track: (1) through strategic research to advance the prevention of preterm birth and (2) improved implementation and innovation for care of the premature neonate. We highlight evidence-based interventions along the continuum of care, noting gaps in coverage, quality, equity and implications for integration and scale up. Improved metrics are critical for both burden and tracking programmatic change. Linked to the United Nation's Every Women Every Child strategy, a target was set for 50% reduction in preterm deaths by 2025. Three analyses informed this target: historical change in high income countries, recent progress in best performing countries, and modelling of mortality reduction with high coverage of existing interventions. If universal coverage of selected interventions were to be achieved, then 84% or more than 921,000 preterm neonatal deaths could be prevented annually, with antenatal corticosteroids and Kangaroo Mother Care having the highest impact. Everyone has a role to play in reaching this target including government leaders, professionals, private sector, and of course families who are affected the most and whose voices have been critical for change in many of the countries with the most progress.

Understanding socio-economic influences on child oral health could inform early interventions to reduce the oral health burden throughout the life-cycle. The aim of this study is to examine the socio-economic and ethnic influences on oral health among preschoolers in Kegalle, Sri Lanka. Methods: The study involved 784 children aged between 48-72 months recruited from 84 pre-schools in the Kegalle district in Sri Lanka. Cross-sectional data were collected by means of an oral examination of the children and a self-administered questionnaire to their parents/caregivers. The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) was used to assess Oral Health related Quality of Life (OHQoL). Univariate and multivariate models of Poisson regression were used to investigate the associations between the variables. Results: Compared to children whose fathers had tertiary education, those whose fathers did not study beyond grade 5, had more caries measured in terms of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs) (IRR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.30, 4.06; p < 0.01) and experienced poor OHQoL at child (IRR = 2.52; 95% CI: 1.20, 5.31; p < 0.05) and family (IRR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.27; p < 0.05) levels. However, lower educational attainment among mothers was associated with better OHQoL among children. Compared to the Sinhalese ethnic group, Tamils had more gingival bleeding (bleeding surfaces) (IRR = 3.04; 95% CI: 1.92, 4.81; p < 0.001) and poor OHQoL at child level (IRR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.19, 3.60; p < 0.01), whereas Muslims had poor OHQoL at family level (IRR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.84; p < 0.01). Children of low-income families had more gum bleeding (IRR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.00; p < 0.05) compared to children of high-income families. Conclusions: Socio-economic and ethnic differences in oral health outcomes exist among this population of preschoolers. Interventions targeting children of fathers with low educational levels and ethnic minority groups are required to reduce inequalities in oral health in Sri Lanka and other similar countries.

Methods: The questionnaire-based study recruited 1500 married women who were aged 15-49 years, had at least 1 pregnancy, and were living in rural Gansu, Qinghai, Shanxi, or Xinjiang, China, between October and December 2010. "Gender equity awareness" was quantified by responses to 7 statements, graded in accordance with a system scoring the strength of overall belief (>= 19, strong; 15-18, moderate; and <= 14, weak). Results: Only 383 women (26.3%) demonstrated high gender equity awareness. The percentage of women who received consistent prenatal care was highest in the group scoring 15 points or more (P < 0.001); the percentage of women with hospital delivery and gynecologic examination (P < 0.001) was highest in the group scoring 19 points or more; and the percentage of women with reproductive tract infections was highest in the group with the lowest scores (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Women's gender equity awareness is not strong in rural midwest China. There was a positive correlation between gender equity awareness and use of reproductive healthcare services. There should be an emphasis on various activities to educate women so that they can fully access reproductive healthcare. (C) 2013 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

J	Ord, K; Mitchell, R; Pearce, J				Ord, Katherine; Mitchell, Richard; Pearce, Jamie			Is level of neighbourhood green space associated with physical activity in green space?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY			English	Article						Green space; Physical activity; Health inequalities	GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEMS; POSSIBLE MECHANISM; MENTAL-HEALTH; ENVIRONMENT; WALKING; ATTRACTIVENESS; RESTORATION; RESIDENTS; URBANITY; EXPOSURE	Background: There is accumulating evidence that greater availability of green space in a neighbourhood is associated with health benefits for the local population. One mechanism proposed for this association is that green space provides a venue for, and therefore encourages, physical activity. It has also been suggested that socio-economic health inequalities may be narrower in greener areas because of the equalised opportunity for physical activity green spaces provide. However, research exploring associations between the availability of green space and physical activity has produced mixed results. Limits to the assessment of the type and amount of physical activity which occurs specifically in green space may account for these mixed findings. This observational study was therefore concerned with the extent to which green space is a venue for physical activity and whether this could account for narrower socio-economic health inequalities in greener neighbourhoods. Method: Secondary analysis of cross sectional data on 3679 adults (16+) living in urban areas across Scotland matched with a neighbourhood level measure of green space availability. Associations between green space availability and both total physical activity, and activity specifically within green space, were explored using logistic regression models. Interactions between socio-economic position and physical activity were assessed. All models adjusted for age, sex and household income. Results: The availability of green space in a neighbourhood was not associated with total physical activity or that specifically in green space. There was no evidence that income-related inequalities in physical activity within green space were narrower in greener areas of Scotland. Conclusion: Physical activity may not be the main mechanism explaining the association between green space and health in Scotland. The direct effect of perceiving a natural environment on physiological and psychological health may offer an alternative explanation.

Responses to the assets questions are used to compute a total score, which is intended to represent household wealth in models of test performance. This study uses item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to assess the validity of assets indices as wealth measures in three educational surveys of primary or secondary school students. We find that scores generated from binary household asset items can reasonably be interpreted as predominantly measuring a single wealth factor, but some scores are imprecise, with between one-third and one-half of their variability attributable to measurement error. Our study illustrates the potential of psychometric analyses to contribute to improvement of the household wealth items administered in similar international achievement assessments.

Previous research on social determinants of alcohol-related disorders has delivered inconsistent results. We aimed to investigate whether socioeconomic position (SEP) in childhood predicts alcohol-related disorders in young adulthood in a Swedish national cohort. Methods We studied a register-based national cohort of Swedish citizens born during 1973-1984 (N=948518) and followed them up to 2009 from age 15. Childhood SEP was defined by a six-category socioeconomic index from the Censuses of 1985 and 1990. HRs of alcohol-related disorders, as indicated by register entries on alcohol-related death and alcohol-related medical care, were analysed in Cox regression models with adjustment for sociodemographic variables and indicators of parental morbidity and criminality. Results Low childhood SEP was associated with alcohol-related disorders later in life among both men and women in a stepwise manner. Growing up in a household with the lowest SEP was associated with risk for alcohol-related disorders of HR: 2.24 (95% CI 2.08 to 2.42) after adjustment for sociodemographic variables, compared with the highest SEP group. Adjusting the analysis for parental psychosocial problems attenuated the association to HR 1.87 (95% CI 1.73 to 2.01). Conclusions The study demonstrates that low SEP in childhood predicts alcohol-related disorders in young adulthood. Alcohol abuse needs to be addressed in policies to bridge the gap of health inequalities.

It highlighted the unique problems faced by adolescent girls and young women-some of the most vulnerable and neglected individuals in the world-and stressed the importance of addressing their needs and rights, not only for their individual benefit, but also to achieve global goals such as reducing maternal mortality and HIV infection. In response to an invitation from the editors of Reproductive Health, we-the sixteen coauthors of this commentary-put together key themes that reverberated throughout the conference, on the health and development needs of adolescents and young people, and promising solutions to meet them. 1. Investing in adolescents and young people is crucial for ensuring health, creating prosperity and fulfilling human rights. 2. Gender inequality contributes to many health and social problems. Adolescent girls and boys, and their families and communities, should be challenged and supported to change inequitable gender norms. - Child marriage utterly disempowers girls. It is one of the most devastating manifestations of gender discrimination. - Negative social and cultural attitudes towards menstruation constrain the lives of millions of girls. This may well establish the foundation for lifelong discomfort felt by girls about their bodies and reticence in seeking help when problems arise. 3. Adolescents need comprehensive, accurate and developmentally appropriate sexuality education. This will provide the bedrock for attitude formation and decision making. 4. Adolescent-centered health services can prevent sexual and reproductive health problems and detect and treat them if and when they occur. 5. National governments have the authority and the responsibility to address social and cultural barriers to the provision of sexual and reproductive health education and services for adolescents and young people. 6. Adolescents should be involved more meaningfully in national and local actions intended to meet their needs and respond to their problems. 7. The time to act is now. We know more now than ever before about the health and development needs of adolescents and young people, as well as the solutions to meeting those needs.

The cost caused by cardiovascular diseases can have an enormous impact, and it is important to know what patients think about illness costs when they are hospitalized. Two interviews were realized in a longitudinal study, in a sample of 106 patients submitted to expensive techniques in Cardiology (Portugal), to understand the patients' perception about the health costs and behavior changes based on awareness. We can conclude that cardiovascular diseases are a global phenomenon that generally affects all social groups. From those interviewed, 83% of the patients agree about getting information concerning the treatments and intervention costs during hospitalization because the information about costs can bring the necessary tools for improvement in patients and health resources; 70.8% of the patients say that this information could bring awareness to the patient's life, enhancing responsibility and personal autonomy.

The purpose of this research was to consider the potential to improve decision-making through integration of HIA into the processes to review and set air quality standards used in Australia. To assess the value of HIA in this policy process, its strengths and weaknesses were evaluated aligned with review of international processes for setting air quality standards. Air quality standard setting programmes elsewhere have either used HIA or have amalgamated and incorporated factors normally found within HIA frameworks. They clearly demonstrate the value of a formalised HIA process for setting air quality standards in Australia. The following elements should be taken into consideration when using HIA in standard setting. (a) The adequacy of a mainly technical approach in current standard setting procedures to consider social determinants of health. (b) The importance of risk assessment criteria and information within the HIA process. The assessment of risk should consider equity, the distribution of variations in air quality in different locations and the potential impacts on health. (c) The uncertainties in extrapolating evidence from one population to another or to subpopulations, especially the more vulnerable, due to differing environmental factors and population variables. (d) The significance of communication with all potential stakeholders on issues associated with the management of air quality. In Australia there is also an opportunity for HIA to be used in conjunction with the NEPM to develop local air quality standard measures. The outcomes of this research indicated that the use of HIA for air quality standard setting at the national and local levels would prove advantageous. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Deas, L; Mattu, L; Gnich, W				Deas, L.; Mattu, L.; Gnich, W.			Intelligent policy making? Key actors' perspectives on the development and implementation of an early years' initiative in Scotland's public health arena	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Scotland; Oral health; Public health; NHS; Evidence-based policy; Evidence-based practice; Tacit knowledge; Early years; Childsmile	KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION; ORAL-HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; IMPROVEMENT; MODELS; IDEAS	Increased political enthusiasm for evidence-based policy and action has re-ignited interest in the use of evidence within political and practitioner networks. Theories of evidence-based policy making and practice are being re-considered in an attempt to better understand the processes through which knowledge translation occurs. Understanding how policy develops, and practice results, has the potential to facilitate effective evidence use. Further knowledge of the factors which shape healthcare delivery and their influence in different contexts is needed. This paper explores the processes involved in the development of a complex intervention in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS). It uses a national oral health programme for children (Childsmile) as a case study, drawing upon key actors' perceptions of the influence of different drivers (research evidence, practitioner knowledge and values, policy, and political and local context) to programme development. Framework analysis is used to analyse stakeholder accounts from in-depth interviews. Documentary review is also undertaken. Findings suggest that Childsmile can be described as an 'evidence-informed' intervention, blending available research evidence with knowledge from practitioner experience and continual learning through evaluation, to plan delivery. The importance of context was underscored, in terms of the need to align with prevailing political ideology and in the facilitative strength of networks within the relatively small public health community in Scotland. Respondents' perceptions support several existing theoretical models of translation, however no single theory offered a comprehensive framework covering all aspects of the complex processes reported. Childsmile's use of best available evidence and on-going contribution to knowledge suggest that the programme is an example of intelligent policy making with international relevance.

J	Rahmdel, M; Rahmdel, N				Rahmdel, Mansour; Rahmdel, Naser			The right to counsel in Iranian criminal justice system	CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article								Criminal law deals with very important aspects of the life in the society. The subjects of the crime, health, reputation aEuro broken vertical bar are so important that endangering them requires punishment and it is told that the society in order to protect the public order should punish the perpetrators. There is no doubt that the criminals should be punished. The punishment enacted by the legislator should be proportional. The more serious the crime, the more severe the punishment. But, it seems that in the process of criminal trial, the accused has rights too. It means that society has not an absolute authority in accusation and punishment and in addition to the proportionality and justification of punishment the trial should be fair. In other words, it is not possible to speak about justice any more if the criminal is punished proportionally and rightly but not fairly, i.e. without allowing him/her to present his/her case, defend him/herself and obtain legal aid or sufficient information. Iranian criminal law, like other criminal justice systems in respecting the rights of the accused, has provided the right to counsel. This value can be expressed in the concept of the rule of law, recognized in international documents. It seems that the standards of the criminal procedure are mostly determined and developed under the influence of this concept. The current paper considers different aspects of the right to counsel in Iran.

An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society policy statement: disparities in respiratory health	EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL			English	Article							INSURANCE STATUS; UNITED-STATES; LUNG-CANCER; ASSOCIATION; OUTCOMES	Health disparities, defined as a significant difference in health between populations, are more common for diseases of the respiratory system than for those of other organ systems, because of the environmental influence on breathing and the variation of the environment among different segments of the population. The lowest social groups are up to 14 times more likely to have respiratory diseases than are the highest. Tobacco smoke, air pollution, environmental exposures, and occupational hazards affect the lungs more than other organs and occur disproportionately in ethnic minorities and those with lower socioeconomic status. Lack of access to quality healthcare contributes to disparities. The executive committees of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) established a writing committee to develop a policy on health disparities. The document was reviewed, edited, and approved by their full executive committees and boards of directors of the societies. This document expresses a policy to address health disparities by promoting scientific inquiry and training, disseminating medical information and best practices, and monitoring and advocating for public respiratory health. The ERS and the ATS have strong international commitments and work with leaders from governments, academia, and other organisational bodies to address and reduce avoidable health inequalities. Their training initiatives improve the function of healthcare systems and health equality. Both the ATS and the ERS support all aspects of this document, confer regularly, and act together when possible, but the activities to bring about change may vary because of the differences in the continents where the two organisations carry out most of their activities. The ATS and ERS pledge to frame their actions to reduce respiratory health disparities. The vision of the ATS and ERS is that all persons attain better and sustained respiratory health. They call on all their members and other societies to join in this commitment.

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is an umbrella term to describe a range of effects from prenatal alcohol exposure including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Determining the prevalence of FASD is challenging. Approach.This narrative review collates information on the prevalence of FASD in Australia and documents the various methods used for attaining estimates and the limitations of the available data. Key Findings.Birth prevalence of FASD is most commonly measured through clinic-based studies, passive surveillance systems and active case ascertainment. Alcohol use in pregnancy and FAS in Australia is predominantly monitored through passive surveillance systems and under-ascertainment of cases is likely. State- and territory-based studies have reported birth prevalence rates of FAS of between 0.01 and 0.68 per 1000 live births. Prevalence rates of FASD have not been estimated in Australia. As reflected in the international data, Australian studies have found higher rates of FAS among some Indigenous communities. This likely reflects patterns of alcohol use and other socioeconomic risk factors. Implications.Under-recognition of FASD reflects incomplete and inconsistent data collections recording alcohol use in pregnancy, lack of awareness among health professionals and a lack of diagnostic and support services. Conclusion.Accurate measurement of FASD prevalence is crucial to inform policy, resource and service development in the areas of health, education, justice and community. There is a need for consensus on the collection and best use of data. [Burns L, Breen C, Bower C, O' Leary C, Elliott EJ.

However, such a shift would intensify the global competition for land, with possible consequences for 1.5 billion smallholder livelihoods that these models do not consider. Maintaining and enhancing robust livelihoods upon bioenergy deployment is an equally important sustainability goal that warrants greater attention. The social implications of biofuel production are complex, varied and place-specific, difficult to model, operationalize and quantify. However, a rapidly developing body of social science literature is advancing the understanding of these interactions. In this letter we link human geography research on the interaction between biofuel crops and livelihoods in developing countries to integrated assessments on biofuels. We review case-study research focused on first-generation biofuel crops to demonstrate that food, income, land and other assets such as health are key livelihood dimensions that can be impacted by such crops and we highlight how place-specific and global dynamics influence both aggregate and distributional outcomes across these livelihood dimensions. We argue that place-specific production models and land tenure regimes mediate livelihood outcomes, which are also in turn affected by global and regional markets and their resulting equilibrium dynamics. The place-specific perspective suggests that distributional consequences are a crucial complement to aggregate outcomes; this has not been given enough weight in comprehensive assessments to date. By narrowing the gap between place-specific case studies and global models, our discussion offers a route towards integrating livelihood and equity considerations into scenarios of future bioenergy deployment, thus contributing to a key challenge in sustainability sciences.

This means the construction of health resources and increase in the level of egalitarianism in access to these resources. Health education carried out on a high level in rural schools provides actual possibilities for gaining these resources. Many examples of educational practices confirm that the establishment of health conditioning and health behaviours of schoolchildren, and the diagnosis of rural school on the background of the specificity of the community in which it functions. These are a basis for the construction of effective educational programmes, and not analysis of the differences between urban and rural children and adolescents. In Poland, the performance of health education in rural schools encounters many problems associated both with the lack of infrastructure for health promotion, insufficient perception of the importance of health education at school by the educational authorities, underestimation of primary health care, low activity of the local governments, and lack of qualified rural health promoters. Current health education in Polish rural schools deepens inequalities in access to health, and postpones the moment of providing equal opportunities for rural and urban schoolchildren with access to the resources which condition the maintenance or even an enhancement of health. The objective of the study is to present selected problems in the performance of health education in a Polish rural school in the light of international trends, experiences and discussions related with an optimum form of health promotion in the environment of rural a school and the community.

J	Katz, AR				Katz, Alison Rosamund			NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES: GLOBAL HEALTH PRIORITY OR MARKET OPPORTUNITY? AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AT ITS WORST AND AT ITS BEST	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR	The promotion of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) as a global health priority started a decade ago and culminated in a 2011 United Nations high-level meeting. The focus is on four diseases (cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, cancers, and diabetes) and four risk factors (tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and harmful alcohol use). The message is that disease and death are now globalized, risk factors are overwhelmingly behavioral, and premature NCD deaths, especially in low- and middle-income countries, are the concern. The NCD agenda is promoted by United Nations agencies, foundations, institutes, and organizations in a style that suggests a market opportunity. This "hard sell" of NCDs contrasts with the sober style of the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease report, which presents a more nuanced picture of mortality and morbidity and different implications for global health priorities. This report indicates continuing high levels of premature death from infectious disease and from maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions in low-income countries and large health inequalities. Comparison of the reports offers an illustration of the World Health Organization at its worst, operating under the influence of the private sector, and at its best, operating according to its constitutional mandate.

The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) has used the Family Affluence Scale (FAS) on material assets. The present study used data collected from adolescents in eight countries in 2002, 2006 and 2010, and examined the construct validity of the FAS, by focusing on changes in item responses over time. The analyses reported the changes in means in item responses, and fitted models which estimated differential item functioning (DIF), and local dependency (LD) between items. DIF and LD were analysed by Graphical Log-Linear Rasch Models (GLLRMs), and changes in the measurement properties of the FAS over time and between countries were assessed. The results showed that the FAS items have changed their measurement properties between 2002 and 2010, and caution is warranted in studies comparing the FAS between different time points.

J	Bretonnière, S				Bretonniere, Sandrine			From laboratories to chambers of parliament and beyond: Producing bioethics in France and Romania	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Assisted reproductive technology; Bioethics; Norm production; Social justice; Romania; France	HEALTH	In a European context marked by heterogeneous Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) practices, this article will elucidate and compare the norm elaboration processes pertaining to ART in France and Romania. Using an experimental five-phase model encompassing experimentation, excesses, social mobilization, legislation and contestation, I will examine the processes linking micro (everyday medical practices), meso (institutional regulation) and macro (legislation) levels of ART bioethics in the two countries since the 1980s. ART has developed in France and Romania on different time frames, and Romania's management of ART is decisively influenced by Ceausescu's pro-natalist policy. However, I will show how the two countries share similar trajectories along the proposed model's first three phases of norm elaboration, and, in recent years, how both have witnessed the emergence of social actors' claims for a more liberal and state-sponsored access to ART, requiring a redefinition of bioethics in line with reproductive social justice at national levels. This is fed by contemporary medical practices and social values, and an increasing transnational interconnectedness between social actors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Gender-Transformative Interventions to Reduce HIV Risks and Violence with Heterosexually-Active Men: A Review of the Global Evidence	AIDS AND BEHAVIOR			English	Review						HIV prevention; Masculinity; Gender norms; Gender-transformative interventions; Violence prevention	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RURAL SOUTH-AFRICA; PARTNER VIOLENCE; STEPPING STONES; PREVENTION; HIV/AIDS; BOYS; MASCULINITY; BEHAVIOR; LESSONS	Emerging out of increased attention to gender equality within HIV and violence prevention programming has been an intensified focus on masculinities. A new generation of health interventions has attempted to shift norms of masculinity to be more gender equitable and has been termed "gender-transformative." We carried out a systematic review of gender-transformative HIV and violence prevention programs with heterosexually-active men in order to assess the efficacy of this programming. After reviewing over 2,500 abstracts in a systematic search, a total of 15 articles matched review criteria. The evidence suggests that gender-transformative interventions can increase protective sexual behaviors, prevent partner violence, modify inequitable attitudes, and reduce STI/HIV, though further trials are warranted, particularly in establishing STI/HIV impacts. In the conclusion, we discuss the promises and limitations of gender-transformative work with men and make suggestions for future research focused on HIV and/or violence prevention.

This paper explores the policy lessons on HRH from four countries that have achieved sustained improvements in UHC: Brazil, Ghana, Mexico and Thailand. Its purpose is to inform global policy and financial commitments on HRH in support of UHC. The paper reports on country experiences using an analytical framework that examines effective coverage in relation to the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (AAAQ) of HRH. The AAAQ dimensions make it possible to perform tracing analysis on HRH policy actions since 1990 in the four countries of interest in relation to national trends in workforce numbers and population mortality rates. The findings inform key principles for evidence-based decision-making on HRH in support of UHC. First, HRH are critical to the expansion of health service coverage and the package of benefits; second, HRH strategies in each of the AAAQ dimensions collectively support achievements in effective coverage; and third, success is achieved through partnerships involving health and non-health actors. Facing the unprecedented health and development challenges that affect all countries and transforming HRH evidence into policy and practice must be at the heart of UHC and the post-2015 development agenda. It is a political imperative requiring national commitment and leadership to maximize the impact of available financial and human resources, and improve healthy life expectancy, with the recognition that improvements in health care are-enabled by a health workforce that is fit for purpose.

This article demonstrates how medium-fidelity and low-fidelity simulation can be used in theory courses to introduce broad community health nursing concepts to junior and senior students, including social justice, harm reduction, activism, and social determinants of health.

How changes to Irish healthcare financing are affecting universal health coverage	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Health transition; Financing; Taxation; Health equity	EQUITY; DELIVERY	In 2010, the World Health Organisation (WHO) published the World Health Report Health systems financing: the path to universal coverage. The Director-General of the WHO, Dr Margaret Chan, commissioned the report "in response to a need, expressed by rich and poor countries alike, for practical guidance on ways to finance health care". Given the current context of global economic hardship and difficult budgetary decisions, the report offered timely recommendations for achieving universal health coverage (UHC). This article analyses the current methods of healthcare financing in Ireland and their implications for UHC. Three questions are asked of the Irish healthcare system: firstly, how is the health system financed; secondly, how can the health system protect people from the financial consequences of ill-health and paying for health services; and finally, how can the health system encourage the optimum use of available resources? By answering these three questions, this article argues that the Irish healthcare system is not achieving UHC, and that it is unclear whether recent changes to financing are moving Ireland closer or further away from the WHO's ambition for healthcare for all.

We compared occupational class differences in BMI and BMI change in Japan and Finland. Methods: The baseline surveys were conducted during 1998-1999 among Japanese (n = 4080) and during 2000-2002 among Finnish = 8685) public-sector employees. Follow-up surveys were conducted among those still employed, in 2003 (n = 3213) and 2007 (n = 7086), respectively. Occupational class and various explanatory factors were surveyed in the baseline questionnaires. Linear regression models were used for data analysis. Results: BMI was higher at baseline and BMI gain was more rapid in Finland than in Japan. In Finland, baseline BMI was lowest among men and women in the highest occupational class and progressively increased to the lowest occupational class; no gradient was found in Japan (country interaction effect, P = 0.020 for men and P < 0.0001 for women). Adjustment for confounding factors reflecting work conditions and health behavior increased the occupational class gradient among Finnish men and women, whereas factors related to social life had no effect. No statistically significant difference in BMI gain was found between occupational classes. Conclusions: The occupational class gradient in BMI was strong among Finnish employees but absent among Japanese employees. This suggests that occupational class inequalities in obesity are not inevitable, even in high-income societies.

Inequalities in self-rated health in Japan 1986-2007 according to household income and a novel occupational classification: national sampling survey series	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article						Japan; time trend; socioeconomic; self-rated health	EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; SOCIAL-CLASS; WORKING-AGE; MORTALITY; DETERMINANTS; ASSOCIATION; LIFE; REGRESSION; COMMUNITY; HEIGHT	Background Japan, for the past two decades, has seen economic stagnation and substantial social change. We examined whether health inequalities increased over this period. Methods Using eight triennial waves of a series of large nationally representative surveys between 1986 and 2007 (n=398303), temporal trends in relative and slope indices of inequality (RII, SII, respectively) were tested based on self-rated health in relation to theory-based social class and household income. Results Age-standardised prevalence of self-rated fair or poor health showed V-shaped time trends in both sexes with the lowest prevalence in early/mid-1990s. In 1986, RII and SII in household social class and income were significant for both sexes. In men, RII and SII according to income showed significant narrowing of temporal trends in poor health (-1.4% and -0.1% annually, respectively), but these were stable in women. After multilevel multiple imputation for missing income data, the findings in men were not altered but narrowing trends became evident and significant in women (-1% and -0.1% annually, respectively). Inequality indices for social class remained constant over the study period in both sexes. Conclusions Relative and absolute health inequalities for social class and income based on self-rated fair or poor health narrowed or remained stable between 1986 and 2007, despite the economic stagnation and adverse social changes. Overall population health across socioeconomic groups initially improved but then worsened. The positive finding regarding the health inequality trend seen in the Japanese context is informative for the wider international community during this period of economic uncertainty.

Agricultural biodiversity as a link between traditional food systems and contemporary development, social integrity and ecological health	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE			English	Review						smallholders; resilience; developing countries; markets; sustainability	COLLECTIVE ACTION; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; BREEDING TRAITS; SMALL-SCALE; ON-FARM; PLANT; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; SECURITY; NUTRITION	Traditional food systems offer a key link between the social and economic resilience of smallholder farmers and pastoralists and the sustainable food and nutrition security of global populations. This paper addresses issues related to socio-cultural diversity and the continuing complex engagement of traditional and modern communities with the plants and animals that sustain them. In light of some of the unhealthful consequences of the nutrition transition' to globalized modern diets, the authors define and propose a process for a more successful food system transition that balances agro-biodiversity and processed commodities to support diet diversity, health and social equity alongside sustainable economic growth. We review empirical research in support of practice and policy changes in agriculture, economic development and health domains as well as cross-sectoral and community-based innovation. High-value food crops within domestic and global value chains can be an entry point for smallholders' participation as contributors and beneficiaries of development, while sustainable small farms, as purveyors of environmental and public health services, diversify global options for long-term adaptation in the face of environmental uncertainty.

Embedding sexual and reproductive health and rights in a transformational development framework: lessons learned from the MDG targets and indicators	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						Millennium Development Goals; reproductive and sexual health; human rights; human development; health policy and programmes	MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; CHILD HEALTH; NEWBORN; COUNTDOWN; HIV/AIDS; PROGRESS; EQUITY	This paper explores the intended and unintended consequences of the selection of MDG 5 as a global goal, together with its respective targets and indicators, and places what happened to MDG 5, and sexual and reproductive health and rights more broadly, into the context of the development model that was encoded in the MDGs. Over the last decade, as the MDGs increasingly took centre stage in development and their use evolved, they were inappropriately converted from global goals into national planning targets. This conversion was particularly detrimental in the case of MDG 5. It not only created a narrowing in terms of policies and programming, but also had an enormous impact on the discourse of development itself, reshaping the field in terms of the organization and dissemination of knowledge, and underscoring that the process of setting targets and indicators is far from neutral but encodes normative values. Looking forward, it is not adequate to propose an MDG+ framework based on the same structure. Sexual and reproductive health and rights must be placed back into the global discourse, using development to empower women and marginalized populations, and to address structural inequalities that are fundamental to sustained social change. The new development framework should include a strong narrative of social transformation in which fit-for-purpose targets and indicators play a role, but do not overtake or restrict the broader aims of advancing social, political, and gender justice.

J	Hill, PS; Huntington, D; Dodd, R; Buttsworth, M				Hill, Peter S.; Huntington, Dale; Dodd, Rebecca; Buttsworth, Michael			From Millennium Development Goals to post-2015 sustainable development: sexual and reproductive health and rights in an evolving aid environment	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						sexual and reproductive health and rights; Millennium Development Goals; post-2015 development goals; aid effectiveness; Lao PDR; Malawi; Senegal; Tajikistan	HUMAN-RESOURCES; SYSTEMS; GAVI; PARTNERSHIPS; INITIATIVES; COUNTRIES; SUPPORT	Using research from country case studies, this paper offers insights into the range of institutional and structural changes in development assistance between 2005 and 2011, and their impact on the inclusion of a sexual and reproductive health and rights agenda in national planning environments. At a global level during this period, donors supported more integrative modalities of aid - sector wide approaches, poverty reduction strategy papers, direct budgetary support - with greater use of economic frameworks in decision-making. The Millennium Development Goals brought heightened attention to maternal mortality, but at the expense of a broader sexual and reproductive health and rights agenda. Advocacy at the national planning level was not well linked to programme implementation; health officials were disadvantaged in economic arguments, and lacked financial and budgetary controls to ensure a connection between advocacy and action. With increasing competency in higher level planning processes, health officials are now refocusing the post-2015 development goals. If sexual and reproductive health and rights is to claim engagement across all its multiple elements, advocates need to link them to the key themes of sustainable development: inequalities in gender, education, growth and population, but also to urbanisation, migration, women in employment and climate change.

J	Dauda, B; Dierickx, K				Dauda, Bege; Dierickx, Kris			Benefit sharing: an exploration on the contextual discourse of a changing concept	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Benefit sharing; Research ethics; International research; Common heritage of humankind; Biodiversity; Justice; Developing countries	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; GENETIC-RESOURCES; CLINICAL-RESEARCH; COMMON HERITAGE; JUSTICE; ETHICS; TRIALS; HEALTH	Background: The concept of benefit sharing has been a topical issue on the international stage for more than two decades, gaining prominence in international law, research ethics and political philosophy. In spite of this prominence, the concept of benefit sharing is not devoid of controversies related to its definition and justification. This article examines the discourses and justifications of benefit sharing concept. Discussion: We examine the discourse on benefit sharing within three main spheres; namely: common heritage of humankind, access and use of genetic resources according to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and international clinical research. Benefit sharing has change from a concept that is enshrined in a legally binding regulation in the contexts of common heritage of humankind and CBD to a non-binding regulation in international clinical research. Nonetheless, there are more ethical justifications that accentuate benefit sharing in international clinical research than in the contexts of common heritage of humankind and the CBD. Summary: There is a need to develop a legal framework in order to strengthen the advocacy and decisiveness of benefit sharing practice in international health research. Based on this legal framework, research sponsors would be required to provide a minimum set of possible benefits to participants and communities in research. Such legal framework on benefit sharing will encourage research collaboration with local communities; and dispel mistrust between research sponsors and host communities. However, more research is needed-drawing from other international legal frameworks, to understand how such a legal framework on benefit sharing can be successfully formulated in international health research.

Under this pressure, concerns of further inequalities exist that may have an impact on the burden of several diseases in certain European countries. In this context, Greece is currently an issue of top interest in any international economic discussion. Although the background of the recession has been largely discussed as a political crisis, its health effects on the population, as well as the key role of primary care and general practice/family medicine in health care reform remain to be explored. Serving both the worldwide trend of orienting health care systems towards strengthened primary care and the inner need for minimizing the demand and lessening the burden from the dysfunctional and costly hospital-care system, the economic crisis sets the perfect timing for prioritizing primary health care. In this article a unique window of opportunity for health care reform in Greece is examined, attempting to establish the axes of an example of how health care system can be reshaped amidst the economic crisis. Equity, quality, value framework, medical professionalism, information technology and decentralization emerge as topics of central interest. There is no doubt that Europe is transitioning under challenging social, economic and public health perspectives. However, taking Greece as an example, the current economic situation sets a good timing for health care reform and the key messages of this paper could be used by other countries facing similar problems.

The present paper reviews the published, peer-reviewed and English-language social science literature on HIV in Vietnam in order to identify critical theoretical and substantive gaps, while laying the groundwork for future research. We found four broad foci for work on the social context of HIV and AIDS in Vietnam: the cultural meanings and social relationships that shape Vietnam's HIV epidemic; stigma and discrimination; social inequality and structural violence as contributors to HIV risk; and, finally, how broader global and social systems shape Vietnam's HIV epidemic. We signal the particular need for additional research on the effects of the media on attitudes towards HIV and AIDS, on social movements, and on health systems, as well as on a number of other key areas. Work along these lines, in addition to more effective communication of policy-relevant findings to those responsible for the development and implementation of policies and programmes, will strengthen Vietnam's response to HIV and AIDS.

This essay challenges current public health views focused on individual risk-factors and motivates an evidence-informed debate in this matter. I argue that despite both international consensus and a growing body of evidence to support the relevance of addressing such more distant SDH through public policies, most governments remain focused on the modification of individual health-risk behaviours like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, heavily fatted diets and lack of physical exercise. Decades after following this same policy path, many countries have not achieved the expected reduction in rates of health-risk behaviours, and some have even experienced an increase in these risky behaviours over time. Policies addressing contextual SDH might take longer to implement, but could be more effective in the long-run, as structural modifications promote more sustainable changes to a larger proportion of the population.

This paper discusses the potential food-related public health risks of a radical new kind of trade agreement: the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP). Under negotiation since 2010, the TPP involves Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the USA, and Vietnam. Here, we review the international evidence on the relationships between trade agreements and diet-related health and, where available, documents and leaked text from the TPP negotiations. Similar to other recent bilateral or regional trade agreements, we find that the TPP would propose tariffs reductions, foreign investment liberalisation and intellectual property protection that extend beyond provisions in the multilateral World Trade Organization agreements. The TPP is also likely to include strong investor protections, introducing major changes to domestic regulatory regimes to enable greater industry involvement in policy making and new avenues for appeal. Transnational food corporations would be able to sue governments if they try to introduce health policies that food companies claim violate their privileges in the TPP; even the potential threat of litigation could greatly curb governments' ability to protect public health. Hence, we find that the TPP, emblematic of a new generation of 21st century trade policy, could potentially yield greater risks to health than prior trade agreements. Because the text of the TPP is secret until the countries involved commit to the agreement, it is essential for public health concerns to be articulated during the negotiation process. Unless the potential health consequences of each part of the text are fully examined and taken into account, and binding language is incorporated in the TPP to safeguard regulatory policy space for health, the TPP could be detrimental to public health nutrition. Health advocates and health-related policymakers must be proactive in their engagement with the trade negotiations.

Methods: The study involved i) country- and regional-level priority-setting exercises performed in 17 countries across five regions, with a desk review of relevant grey and published literature combined with mapping and interviews of national and regional stakeholders; ii) interviews with global-level stakeholders; iii) a scoping of published literature; and iv) a consensus building exercise with global stakeholders which resulted in the formulation and ranking of HPSR questions in the field of ATM. Results: A list of 18 priority policy issues was established following analysis of country-, regional-, and global-level exercises. Eighteen research questions were formulated during the global stakeholders' meeting and ranked according to four ranking criteria (innovation, impact on health and health systems, equity, and lack of research). The top three research questions were: i) In risk protection schemes, which innovations and policies improve equitable access to and appropriate use of medicines, sustainability of the insurance system, and financial impact on the insured? ii) How can stakeholders use the information available in the system, e. g., price, availability, quality, utilization, registration, procurement, in a transparent way towards improving access and use of medicines? and iii) How do policies and other interventions into private markets, such as information, subsidies, price controls, donation, regulatory mechanisms, promotion practices, etc., impact on access to and appropriate use of medicines? Conclusions: Our HPSR agenda adopts a health systems perspective and will guide relevant, innovative research, likely to bear an impact on health, health systems and equity.

The long Italian way for a scientific regulation	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY			English	Review							COMPASSIONATE USE; EXPANDED ACCESS; PRODUCTS; EUROPE; MARKET; HEALTH; DRUGS	On 23 May 2013, the Italian health minister decided to endorse a law regarding controversial stem cell-based therapies in 32 young terminally ill patients, shocking many scientists. According to the international scientific community, these therapies could be dangerous because they were not rigorously tested in humans. This decision was made after many days of media and judiciary pressure. Several lawsuits regarding stem cell-based therapies were brought before the judiciary districts of different Italian regions. We analyzed the Italian legal context regarding the field of pharmaceutical and medical devices, including the European Union trend. A national database - commonly used to manage legal materials for professional or educational purposes or both - was used to find relevant legal cases involving stem cell-based therapies. Stem cell-based therapies endorsed by the new Italian law have been the subject of an important discussion not only in the scientific community but also in various courts. We found several legal actions filed by parents in order to make stem cells available to their young children, who had serious neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of the analyzed legal disputes were settled in favor of the applicants, whereas only two decisions (Courts of Justice of Rome and Florence) rejected the complaint because of the absence of sufficient scientific data regarding stem cell-based therapies. The present Italian situation is influencing the destiny of future young patients and strongly impacting public and institutional opinion. It is a practical example of the complexity of the decision of not providing unapproved scientific stem cell-based therapies when medicine does not have any other alternative therapies.

In light of the global commitment to health equity, we have previously developed and published a reporting guideline for equity-focused systematic reviews (PRISMA-E 2012). The objectives of this study were to explore the utility of the equity extension items included in PRISMA-E 2012 from a systematic review author perspective, including facilitators and barriers to its use. This will assist in designing dissemination and knowledge translation strategies. We conducted a survey of systematic review authors to expose them to the new items in PRISMA-E 2012, establish the extent to which they had historically addressed those items in their own reviews, and gather feedback on the usefulness of the new items. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel 2008 and Stata (version 11.2 for Mac). Of 151 respondents completing the survey, 18.5% (95% CI: 12.7% to 25.7%) had not heard of the PRISMA statement before, although 83.4% (95% CI: 77.5% to 89.3%) indicated that they plan to use PRISMA-E 2012 in the future, depending on the focus of their review. Most (68.9%; 95% CI: 60.8% to 76.2%) thought that using PRISMA-E 2012 would lead them to conduct their reviews differently. Important facilitators to using PRISMA-E 2012 identified by respondents were journal endorsement and incorporation of the elements of the guideline into systematic review software. Barriers identified were lack of time, word limits and the availability of equity data in primary research. This study has been the first to 'road-test' the new PRISMA-E 2012 reporting guideline and the findings are encouraging. They confirm the acceptability and potential utility of the guideline to assist review authors in reporting on equity in their reviews. The uptake and impact of PRISMA-E 2012 over time on design, conduct and reporting of primary research and systematic reviews should continue to be examined.

Health risk behaviors, defined as habits or practices that increase an individual's likelihood of harmful health outcomes, are thought to mediate such inequalities. Discussion: Obesity has been related with increased cancer incidence and mortality due to imbalance of leptin and adiponectin which are connected to activation of PI3K, MAPK, and STAT3 pathways and decreasing insulin/ insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and mTOR signaling via activation of 5 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), respectively. Physical activity has been associated to prevent cancer by the aforementioned obesity-related mechanisms, but also increasing level of circulating vitamin D, which has been related to lower risk of several cancers, and increasing prostaglandin F2a and reducing prostaglandin E2, which are both related with cancer prevention and promotion, respectively. A large number of different substances may induce themselves a direct cytotoxicity and mutagenic action on cells by smoking, whereas alcohol promote immune suppression, the delay of DNA repair, inhibition of the detoxification of carcinogens, the production of acetaldehyde, and the contribution to abnormal DNA methylation. The combined smoking and alcohol drinking habits have been shown to increase cancer risk by smoke action of increasing the acetaldehyde burden following alcohol consumption and alcohol action of enhancing the activation of various procarcinogens contained in tobacco smoke. Conclusions: Interventions at the social level may be done to increase awareness about cancer risks and promote changing in unhealthy behaviors.

Insights into the policy context for climate change and health adaptation decision-making in Cambodia	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						climate change adaptation; policy analysis; governance; Asia Pacific; global health; Cambodia	GLOBAL HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; EQUITY	Changes in climatic conditions and increases in weather variability affect human health directly and indirectly, including through agricultural changes and urban warming. Adaptation to climate change is receiving increasing attention, given, now, the inevitability of further climate change and its diverse impacts. However, with increased international funding for adaptation comes challenges such as ensuring supportive national policy environments for developing and implementing effective adaptation activities. Adaptation at community and population levels is underpinned by governance processes, such as the nature by which decisions are taken and implemented by government, community and private organizations. Thus an understanding of the policy context is necessary to identify the factors that enable or inhibit adaptation policy and programmes. This article examines to what degree there exist enabling factors to support the development of adaptation policy and activities, with relevance to the health sector. Results of a policy analysis are presented, which used stakeholder participation to investigate the context in which adaptation decisions were made within organizations across different sectors in Cambodia. Five factors were identified as critical components of the governance environment: (1) policy development processes; (2) the existence of a political recognition of climate change and (3-5) the organizational barriers relating to coordination, funding and lack of information. Without achieving a supportive policy environment, future adaptation actions are likely to have limited effect.

We assess the feasibility of doing so between 2010 and 2020 and the differential impact among countries by applying different scenarios to current trends in HLY. Methods: Data comprised HLY and life expectancy (LE) at birth 2004-09 from Eurostat. We estimated HLY in 2010 in each country by multiplying the Eurostat projections of LE in 2010 by the ratio HLY/LE obtained either from country and sex-specific linear regression models of HLY/LE on year (seven countries retaining same HLY question) or extrapolating the average of HLY/LE in 2008 and 2009 to 2010 (20 countries and EU27). The first scenario continued these trends with three other scenarios exploring different HLY gap reductions between 2010 and 2020. Results: The estimated gap in HLY in 2010 was 17.5 years (men) and 18.9 years (women). Assuming current trends continue, EU27 HLY increased by 1.4 years (men) and 0.9 years (women), below the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing target, with the HLY gap between countries increasing to 18.3 years (men) and 19.5 years (women). To eliminate the HLY gap in 20 years, the EU27 must gain 4.4 HLY (men) and 4.8 HLY (women) in the next decade, which, for some countries, is substantially more than what the current trends suggest. Conclusion: Global targets for HLY move attention from inter-country differences and, alongside the current economic crisis, may contribute to increase health inequalities.

Int Task Force Decision Criteria	WHICH CRITERIA ARE CONSIDERED IN HEALTHCARE DECISIONS?

Methods: Using snowball sampling and an online questionnaire with forty-three criteria organized into ten clusters, decision makers were invited by an international task force to report which criteria they consider when making decisions on healthcare interventions in their context. Respondents reported whether each criterion is currently considered, should be considered, and its relative weight (scale 0-5). Differences in proportions of respondents were explored with inferential statistics across levels of decision (micro, meso, macro), decision maker perspectives, and world regions. Results: A total of 140 decision makers (1/3 clinical, 2/3 policy) from 23 countries in five continents completed the survey. The most relevant criteria (top ranked for Currently considered, Should be considered, and weights) were Clinical efficacy/effectiveness, Safety, Quality of evidence, Disease severity, and Impact on healthcare costs. Organizational and skill requirements were frequently considered but had relatively low weights. For almost all criteria, a higher proportion of decision makers reported that they Should be considered than that they are Currently considered (p < .05). For more than 74 percent of criteria, there were no statistical differences in proportions across levels of decision, perspectives and world regions. Statistically significant differences across several comparisons were found for: Population priorities, Stakeholder pressure/interests, Capacity to stimulate research, Impact on partnership and collaboration, and Environmental impact. Conclusions: Results suggest convergence among decision makers on the relevance of a core set of criteria and on the need to consider a wider range of criteria. Areas of divergence appear to be principally related to contextual factors.

J	Asgary, R; Junck, E				Asgary, Ramin; Junck, Emily			New trends of short-term humanitarian medical volunteerism: professional and ethical considerations	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Public Health Ethics; Education for Health Care Professionals; Applied and Professional Ethics; Clinical Ethics	HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS; GLOBAL HEALTH; HAITI EARTHQUAKE; EXPERIENCE; STUDENTS; SPECIALIZATION; SUPPORT; RELIEF; WORLD; EMERGENCIES	Short-term humanitarian medical volunteerism has grown significantly among both clinicians and trainees over the past several years. Increasingly, both volunteers and their respective institutions have faced important challenges in regard to medical ethics and professional codes that should not be overlooked. We explore these potential concerns and their risk factors in three categories: ethical responsibilities in patient care, professional responsibility to communities and populations, and institutional responsibilities towards trainees. We discuss factors increasing the risk of harm to patients and communities, including inadequate preparation, the use of advanced technology and the translation of Western medicine, issues with clinical epidemiology and test utility, difficulties with the principles of justice and clinical justice, the lack of population-based medicine, sociopolitical effects of foreign aid, volunteer stress management, and need for sufficient trainee supervision. We review existing resources and offer suggestions for future skill-based training, organisational responsibilities, and ethical preparation.

Urban Health Challenges in Europe	JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE			English	Article						Aging society; Decentralization; Equity; European region; Health inequalities; Global change; Local authorities; Migration	CITIES; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY	This article synthesizes diverse official reports, statistics, and scientific papers that present demographic, economic, environmental, and social trends impacting on the health and quality of life of citizens living in European cities. A literature review led to the identification of some key challenges including an aging society, migration flows, inequalities in health, global change, and risk behaviors that should be addressed in order to promote urban health. Other challenges, such as food production and consumption, are also relevant, but not included. Cities that have participated in one or more of the phases of the WHO European Healthy Cities Network have implemented a number of policies, programs, and measures to deal with the challenges discussed in this article. Some contributions are presented to illustrate how health and quality of life in urban areas can be promoted by local authorities.

INFORMAS	Monitoring and benchmarking government policies and actions to improve the healthiness of food environments: a proposed Government Healthy Food Environment Policy Index	OBESITY REVIEWS			English	Review						government policies; INFORMAS; non-communicable diseases; obesity prevention	DIETARY ENERGY DENSITY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MEASURING PROGRESS; WEIGHT STATUS; BODY-WEIGHT; OBESITY; TRADE; BEVERAGES; DISEASE; INTERVENTIONS	Government action is essential to increase the healthiness of food environments and reduce obesity, diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and their related inequalities. This paper proposes a monitoring framework to assess government policies and actions for creating healthy food environments. Recommendations from relevant authoritative organizations and expert advisory groups for reducing obesity and NCDs were examined, and pertinent components were incorporated into a comprehensive framework for monitoring government policies and actions. A Government Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) was developed, which comprises a policy' component with seven domains on specific aspects of food environments, and an infrastructure support' component with seven domains to strengthen systems to prevent obesity and NCDs. These were revised through a week-long consultation process with international experts. Examples of good practice statements are proposed within each domain, and these will evolve into benchmarks established by governments at the forefront of creating and implementing food policies for good health. A rating process is proposed to assess a government's level of policy implementation towards good practice. The Food-EPI will be pre-tested and piloted in countries of varying size and income levels. The benchmarking of government policy implementation has the potential to catalyse greater action to reduce obesity and NCDs.

Depressive Symptom Trajectories Among Girls in the Juvenile Justice System: 24-month Outcomes of an RCT of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care	PREVENTION SCIENCE			English	Article						MTFC; Randomized controlled trial; Depression; Girls; Juvenile justice; Maltreatment	2-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MENTAL-DISORDERS; CONDUCT PROBLEMS; ADOLESCENT BOYS; INTERVENTION; COMORBIDITY; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR; TIME	Youth depression is a significant and growing international public health problem. Youth who engage in high levels of delinquency are at particularly high risk for developing problems with depression. The present study examined the impact of a behavioral intervention designed to reduce delinquency (Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care; MTFC) compared to a group care intervention (GC; i.e., services as usual) on trajectories of depressive symptoms among adolescent girls in the juvenile justice system. MTFC has documented effects on preventing girls' recidivism, but its effects on preventing the normative rise in girls' depressive symptoms across adolescence have not been examined. This indicated prevention sample included 166 girls (13-17 years at T1) who had at least one criminal referral in the past 12 months and who were mandated to out-of-home care; girls were randomized to MTFC or GC. Intent-to-treat analyses examined the main effects of MTFC on depression symptoms and clinical cut-offs, and whether benefits were greatest for girls most at risk. Depressive symptom trajectories were specified in hierarchical linear growth models over a 2 year period using five waves of data at 6 month intervals. Depression clinical cut-off scores were specified as nonlinear probability growth models. Results showed significantly greater rates of deceleration for girls in MTFC versus GC for depressive symptoms and for clinical cut-off scores. The MTFC intervention also showed greater benefits for girls with higher levels of initial depressive symptoms. Possible mechanisms of effect are discussed, given MTFC's effectiveness on targeted and nontargeted outcomes.

EURO-GBD-SE Consortium	Educational differences in disability-free life expectancy: a comparative study of long-standing activity limitation in eight European countries	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Europe; Educational differences; Disability-free life expectancy; Long-standing activity limitation; Sullivan's method; Census-linked mortality data; EU-SILC survey data	SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; HEALTH EXPECTANCY; MORTALITY; FINLAND; NORWAY; STATES	Healthy life expectancy is a composite measure of length and quality of life and an important indicator of health in aging populations. There are few cross-country comparisons of socioeconomic differences in healthy life expectancy. Most of the existing comparisons focus on Western Europe and the United States, often relying on older data. To address these deficiencies, we estimated educational differences in disability-free life expectancy for eight countries from all parts of Europe in the early 2000s. Long-standing severe disability was measured as a Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI) derived from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey. Census-linked mortality data were collected by a recent project comparing health inequalities between European countries (the EURO-GBD-SE project). We calculated sex-specific educational differences in disability-free life expectancy between the ages of 30 and 79 years using the Sullivan method. The lowest disability-free life expectancy was found among Lithuanian men and women (33.1 and 39.1 years, respectively) and the highest among Italian men and women (42.8 and 44.4 years, respectively). Life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy were directly related to the level of education, but the educational differences were much greater in the latter in all countries. The difference in the disability-free life expectancy between those with a primary or lower secondary education and those with a tertiary education was over 10 years for males in Lithuania and approximately 7 years for males in Austria, Finland and France, as well as for females in Lithuania. The difference was smallest in Italy (4 and 2 years among men and women, respectively). Highly educated Europeans can expect to live longer and spend more years in better health than those with lower education. The size of the educational difference in disability-free life expectancy varies significantly between countries. The smallest and largest differences appear to be in Southern Europe and in Eastern and Northern Europe, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

About a third of these deaths occurred in India and Ethiopia. Public finance of rotavirus vaccination in these two countries could substantially decrease child mortality and also reduce rotavirus-related hospitalizations, prevent health-related impoverishment and bring significant cost savings to households. Methods: We use a methodology of 'extended cost-effectiveness analysis' (ECEA) to evaluate a hypothetical publicly financed program for rotavirus vaccination in India and Ethiopia. We measure program impact along four dimensions: 1) rotavirus deaths averted; 2) household expenditures averted; 3) financial risk protection afforded; 4) distributional consequences across the wealth strata of the country populations. Results: In India and Ethiopia, the program would lead to a substantial decrease in rotavirus deaths, mainly among the poorer; it would reduce household expenditures across all income groups and it would effectively provide financial risk protection, mostly concentrated among the poorest. Potential indirect benefits of vaccination (herd immunity) would increase program benefits among all income groups, whereas potentially decreased vaccine efficacy among poorer households would reduce the equity benefits of the program. Conclusions: Our approach incorporates financial risk protection and distributional consequences into the systematic economic evaluation of vaccine policy, illustrated here with the case study of public finance for rotavirus vaccination. This enables selection of vaccine packages based on the quantitative inclusion of information on equity and on how much financial risk protection is being bought per dollar expenditure on vaccine policy, in addition to how much health is being bought.

Shared learning in an interconnected world: innovations to advance global health equity	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article							RAPID SCALE-UP; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; TREATMENT PROGRAM; HIV PREVENTION; RWANDA; CARE; PARTNERSHIPS; RETENTION; DIAGNOSIS; SERVICES	The notion of "reverse innovation" that some insights from low-income countries might offer transferable lessons for wealthier contexts-is increasingly common in the global health and business strategy literature. Yet the perspectives of researchers and policymakers in settings where these innovations are developed have been largely absent from the discussion to date.

By United Nations geographical classification, these countries belong to Eastern Europe, Western Asia and South-Central Asia. Methods Published data were used to describe population health indicators and risk factors. Epidemiological training and research was assessed based on author knowledge, information searches and E-mail survey of experts. Bibliometric analyses determined epidemiological publication outputs. Results Between-country differences in life expectancy, amount and profile of disease burden and prevalence of risk factors are marked. Epidemiological training is affected by ongoing structural reforms of educational systems. Training is advanced in Israel and several Eastern European countries. Epidemiological research is mainly university-based in most countries, but predominantly conducted by governmental research institutes in several countries of the former Soviet Union. Funding is generally external and limited, partially due to competition from and prioritization of biomedical research. Multiple relevant professional societies exist, especially in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Few of the region's 39 epidemiological academic journals have international currency. The number of epidemiological publications per population is highest for Israel and lowest for South-Central Asian countries. Conclusions Epidemiological capacity will continue to be heterogeneous across the region and depend more on countries' individual historical, social, political and economic conditions and contexts than their epidemiologists' successive efforts. National and international research funding, and within- and between-country collaborations should be enhanced, especially for South-Central Asian countries.

J	McIntyre, D; Ranson, MK; Aulakh, BK; Honda, A				McIntyre, Di; Ranson, Michael K.; Aulakh, Bhupinder K.; Honda, Ayako			Promoting universal financial protection: evidence from seven low- and middle-income countries on factors facilitating or hindering progress	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Financial protection; Low- and middle-income countries; Policy analysis; Pooling; Purchasing; Revenue collection; Universal health coverage	HEALTH-INSURANCE; COVERAGE; GHANA; CARE	Although universal health coverage (UHC) is a global health policy priority, there remains limited evidence on UHC reforms in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper provides an overview of key insights from case studies in this thematic series, undertaken in seven LMICs (Costa Rica, Georgia, India, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Thailand) at very different stages in the transition to UHC. These studies highlight the importance of increasing pre-payment funding through tax funding and sometimes mandatory insurance contributions when trying to improve financial protection by reducing out-of-pocket payments. Increased tax funding is particularly important if efforts are being made to extend financial protection to those outside formal-sector employment, raising questions about the value of pursuing contributory insurance schemes for this group. The prioritisation of insurance scheme coverage for civil servants in the first instance in some LMICs also raises questions about the most appropriate use of limited government funds. The diverse reforms in these countries provide some insights into experiences with policies targeted at the poor compared with universalist reform approaches. Countries that have made the greatest progress to UHC, such as Costa Rica and Thailand, made an explicit commitment to ensuring financial protection and access to needed care for the entire population as soon as possible, while this was not necessarily the case in countries adopting targeted reforms. There also tends to be less fragmentation in funding pools in countries adopting a universalist rather than targeting approach. Apart from limiting cross-subsidies, fragmentation of pools has contributed to differential benefit packages, leading to inequities in access to needed care and financial protection across population groups; once such differentials are entrenched, they are difficult to overcome. Capacity constraints, particularly in purchasing organisations, are a pervasive problem in LMICs. The case studies also highlighted the critical role of high-level political leadership in pursuing UHC policies and citizen support in sustaining these policies. This series demonstrates the value of promoting greater sharing of experiences on UHC reforms across LMICs. It also identifies key areas of future research on health care financing in LMICs that would support progress towards UHC.

The unfinished agenda in child survival	LANCET			English	Review							COMMUNITY CASE-MANAGEMENT; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; HEALTH INTERVENTIONS; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; TIME TRENDS; MORTALITY; DIARRHEA; EQUITY; UNDERNUTRITION; STRATEGIES	10 years ago, The Lancet published a Series about child survival. In this Review, we examine progress in the past decade in child survival, with a focus on epidemiology, interventions and intervention coverage, strategies of health programmes, equity, evidence, accountability, and global leadership. Knowledge of child health epidemiology has greatly increased, and although more and better interventions are available, they still do not reach large numbers of mothers and children. Child survival should remain at the heart of global goals in the post-2015 era. Many countries are now making good progress and need the time and support required to finish the task. The global health community should show its steadfast commitment to child survival by amassing knowledge and experience as a basis for ever more effective programmes. Leadership and accountability for child survival should be strengthened and shared among the UN system; governments in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries; and non-governmental organisations.

Trauma in Canada: A Spirit of Equity & Collaboration	WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article							PRESIDENTIAL-ADDRESS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; CENTER CARE; ACCESS; SYSTEM; TELESONOGRAPHY; ASSOCIATION; INJURIES	The delivery of equitable trauma care in Canada is not without challenges within our universal health care system. Notably, the tyranny of geography is intermittently at odds with adequate access for our rural, indigenous, and impoverished populations. Other differences exist when compared with neighbouring trauma systems, for example in the United States. As a critical review, we chose to compare and critique the overall system of trauma organization and perceived societal expectations of a high-income, North American country (Canada) to assist with discussions on trauma systems for the future. Tele-technology is providing some early solutions. Trauma systems and delivery of care in Canada differ from the United States due to our single-payer system, regionalization and universal provision. Care for injured Canadians has a long history of being multidisciplinary, with collaborative research programs. Canada also has a history of global surgical endeavours, beginning with Dr. Norman Bethune and his recognition of the political causes of trauma and continuing as a global public health concern for all. While challenges continue to exist for the provision of equitable trauma care in Canada, unique multidisciplinary, collaborative and technology-based solutions continue to be developed, both locally and globally, to address this critical public health issue.

Memphis has earned the unique reputation in the US as America's Aerotropolis. However, the model has not yet received full attention by the urban geography community. This study analyzes the Memphis Aerotropolis (MA) defined as an economic hub extending outward from the Memphis International Airport into a surrounding area that specializes in transportation and warehousing. Our findings reveal polycentric pattern of employment which we grouped into centers, subcenters, and clusters. To understand industrial specialization of job areas, we used location quotient analysis. The area around the airport is consistent with the "Aerotropolis" concept, and attracts both jobs (it is the largest job concentration in the region) and housing. The area also has a greater share of higher-paying jobs, however female and minority workers benefit less than white male workers. This study contributes to the body of research on the spatial aspects of racial, gender, and paying/earning characteristics of both jobs and workers of a current-day metropolis. Availability of the LED data enables easy replication of the analysis of the local job and labor structure elsewhere within the United States. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Inequality and inequity in access to health care and treatment for chronic conditions in China: the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Inequity; inequality; chronic illness; access to care; China	CHRONIC DISEASES; RISK-FACTORS; HONG-KONG; EQUITY; POPULATION; INCOME; SERVICES; PREVALENCE; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT	Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a large and rapidly-growing problem in China and other middle-income countries. Clinical treatment of NCDs is long-term and expensive, so it may present particular problems for equality and horizontal equity (equal treatment for equal need) in access to health care, although little is known about this at present in low-and middle-income countries. To address this gap, and inform policy for a substantial proportion of the global population, we examined inequality and inequity in general health care utilization (doctor consultations and hospital admissions) and in treatment of chronic conditions (hypertension, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia), in 30 499 Chinese adults aged >= 50 years from one of China's richest provinces, using the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (2003-2008). We used concentration indices to test for inequality and inequity in utilization by household income per head. Inequality was decomposed to show the contributions of income, indicators of 'need for health care' (age, sex, self-rated health, coronary heart disease risk and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and non-need factors (education, occupation, out-of-pocket health care payments and health insurance). We found inequality and inequity in treatment of chronic conditions but not in general health care utilization. Using more objective and specific measures of 'need for health care' increased estimates of inequity for treatment of chronic conditions. Income and non-need factors (especially health insurance, education and occupation) made the largest contributions to inequality. Further work is needed on why access to treatment for chronic conditions in China is restricted for those on low incomes and how these inequities can be mitigated.

From reaching every district to reaching every community: analysis and response to the challenge of equity in immunization in Cambodia	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Immunization; health equity; reaching every district; reaching every community	HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; COVERAGE; POOR; SERVICES; ACCESS; TRENDS; IMPACT; FUNDS; CARE	Background An international review of the Cambodian Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 2010 and other data show that despite immunization coverage increases and vaccine preventable diseases incidence reductions, inequities in access to immunization services exist. Utilizing immunization and health systems literature, analysis of global health databases and the EPI review findings, this paper examines the characteristics of immunization access and outcome inequities, and describes proposed longer-term strategic and operational responses to these problems. Findings The national programme has evolved from earlier central and provincial level planning to strengthening routine immunization coverage through the District level 'Reaching Every District Strategy'. However, despite remarkable improvements, the review found over 20% of children surveyed were not fully immunized, primarily from communities where inequities of both access and impact persist. These inequities relate mainly to socio-economic exposures including wealth and education level, population mobility and ethnicity. To address these problems, a shift in strategic and operational response is proposed that will include (a) a re-focus of planning on facility level to detect disadvantaged communities, (b) establishment of monitoring systems to provide detailed information on community access and utilization, (c) development of communication strategies and health networks that enable providers to adjust service delivery according to the needs of vulnerable populations, and (d) securing financial, management and political commitment for 'reaching every community'. Conclusions For Cambodia to achieve its immunization equity objectives and disease reduction goals, a shift of emphasis to health centre and community is needed. This approach will maximize the benefits of new vaccine introduction in the coming 'Decade of Vaccines', plus potentially extend the reach of other life-saving maternal and child health interventions to the socially disadvantaged, both in Cambodia and in other countries with a similar level of development.

Cross-country evidence from the World Health Survey	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Inequality; equity; health inequalities; global health; resource allocation; prioritization	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; INTERVENTIONS	Reduction of health inequalities within and between countries is a global health priority, but little is known about the determinants of popular support for this goal. We used data from the World Health Survey to assess individual preferences for prioritizing reductions in health and health care inequalities. We used descriptive tables and regression analysis to study the determinants of preferences for reducing health inequalities as the primary health system goal. Determinants included individual socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, urban residence, education, marital status, household income, self-rated health, health care use, satisfaction with health care system) and country-level characteristics [gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, disability-free life expectancy, equality in child mortality, income inequality, health and public health expenditures]. We used logistic regression to assess the likelihood that individuals ranked minimizing inequalities first, and rank-ordered logistic regression to compare the ranking of other priorities against minimizing health inequalities. Individuals tended to prioritize health system goals related to overall improvement (improving population health and health care responsiveness) over those related to equality and fairness (minimizing inequalities in health and responsiveness, and promoting fairness of financial contribution). Individuals in countries with higher GDP per capita, life expectancy, and equality in child mortality were more likely to prioritize minimizing health inequalities.

It is estimated to cause approximately 20 million new episodes of ALRI in children annually, 97% of these occurring in developing countries. It is also estimated to result in 28000 to 112000 deaths annually in young children. Apart from hospitalisations and deaths, influenza has significant economic consequences. The current egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines have several limitations: annual vaccination, high production costs, and cannot respond adequately to meet the demand during pandemics. Methods: We used a modified CHNRI methodology for setting priorities in health research investments. This was done in two stages. In Stage I, we systematically reviewed the literature related to emerging cross-protective vaccines against influenza relevant to several criteria of interest: answerability; cost of development, production and implementation; efficacy and effectiveness; deliverability, affordability and sustainability; maximum potential impact on disease burden reduction; acceptability to the end users and health workers; and effect on equity. In Stage II, we conducted an expert opinion exercise by inviting 20 experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies). They answered questions from the CHNRI framework and their "collective optimism" towards each criterion was documented on a scale from 0 to 100%. Results: The experts expressed very high level of optimism for deliverability, impact on equity, and acceptability to health workers and end users. However, they expressed concerns over the criteria of answerability, low development cost, low product cost, low implementation cost, affordability and, to a lesser extent sustainability. In addition they felt that the vaccine would have higher efficacy and impact on disease burden reduction on overall influenza-associated disease rather than specifically influenza-associated pneumonia. Conclusion: Although the landscape of emerging influenza vaccines shows several promising candidates, it is unlikely that the advancements in the newer vaccine technologies will be able to progress through to large scale production in the near future. The combined effects of continued investments in researching new vaccines and improvements of available vaccines will hopefully shorten the time needed to the development of an effective seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine suitable for large scale production.

Few nationwide epidemiological studies include a large enough sample of older adults to provide estimates of chronic conditions in the older adult population. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of eight common chronic health conditions and examine socioeconomic inequalities in the diseases among older adults in China. Method: Data are from SAGE-China Wave 1, including 13,157 people aged 50-plus years. Respondents were asked if they had been diagnosed with any of the following chronic medical conditions: angina, arthritis, asthma, stroke, diabetes, depression, chronic lung disease and hypertension. A set of validated symptom-based questions and related diagnostic algorithms were also used to estimate disease prevalence for angina, arthritis, asthma and depression. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the probability of developing chronic conditions in relation to sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, urban/rural setting and household wealth level. Results: Fifty percent of respondents reported having one of the selected chronic conditions, 18.9% two conditions, 5.8% three conditions, and 1.4% reported having four or more chronic conditions. Self-reported prevalence was generated for angina (8%), arthritis (22%), asthma (2%), stroke (3%), diabetes (7%), depression (0.3%), chronic lung disease (8%) and hypertension (27%). The symptom-based prevalence of angina, arthritis, asthma and depression was 10%, 20%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Conclusion: This study provides the best available prevalence estimates for major chronic health conditions among older Chinese adults. Findings from this study indicated that major chronic conditions were common, so prevention and early intervention targeting adults aged 50 years and older should be prioritized.

J	Mulley, AG				Mulley, Albert G., Jr.			The Global Role of Health Care Delivery Science: Learning from Variation to Build Health Systems that Avoid Waste and Harm	JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						global health; delivery science; practice variation; shared decision making; patients' preferences	SMALL-AREA VARIATIONS; REGIONAL-VARIATIONS; MORTALITY; PROSTATE	This paper addresses the fourth theme of the Indiana Global Health Research Working Conference, Clinical Effectiveness and Health Systems Research. It explores geographic variation in health care delivery and health outcomes as a source of learning how to achieve better health outcomes at lower cost. It focuses particularly on the relationship between investments made in capacities to deliver different health care services to a population and the value thereby created by that care for individual patients. The framing begins with the dramatic variation in per capita health care expenditures across the nations of the world, which is largely explained by variations in national wealth. The 1978 Declaration of Alma Ata is briefly noted as a response to such inequities with great promise that has not as yet been realized. This failure to realize the promise of Alma Ata grows in significance with the increasing momentum for universal health coverage that is emerging in the current global debate about post-2015 development goals. Drawing upon work done at Dartmouth over more than three decades, the framing then turns to within-country variations in per capita expenditures, utilization of different services, and health outcomes. A case is made for greater attention to the question of value by bringing better information to bear at both the population and individual levels. Specific opportunities to identify and reduce waste in health care, and the harm that is so often associated with it, are identified by learning from outcome variations and practice variations.

The main focus was on how individual patients could be empowered to cope with the challenges of science and technology. Since the 1990s, the main source of bioethical problems is the process of globalization, particularly neo-liberal market ideology. Faced with new challenges such as poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, hunger, pandemics, and organ trafficking the bioethical discourse of empowering individuals is no longer sufficient. Global bioethics nowadays is concerned with applying and implementing a universal ethical framework. Islamic bioethics has contributed to creating such framework (exemplified in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights) while at the same time it is continuously articulating and interpreting this framework in specific settings and contexts.

J	Sartorius, B; Sartorius, K				Sartorius, Benn; Sartorius, Kurt			Identifying and Targeting Mortality Disparities: A Framework for Sub-Saharan Africa Using Adult Mortality Data from South Africa	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POPULATION ATTRIBUTABLE FRACTIONS; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; GLOBAL BURDEN; DISEASE; HEALTH; WOMEN; MODEL; DETERMINANTS; ESTIMATORS; BANGLADESH	Background: Health inequities in developing countries are difficult to eradicate because of limited resources. The neglect of adult mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a particular concern. Advances in data availability, software and analytic methods have created opportunities to address this challenge and tailor interventions to small areas. This study demonstrates how a generic framework can be applied to guide policy interventions to reduce adult mortality in high risk areas. The framework, therefore, incorporates the spatial clustering of adult mortality, estimates the impact of a range of determinants and quantifies the impact of their removal to ensure optimal returns on scarce resources. Methods: Data from a national cross-sectional survey in 2007 were used to illustrate the use of the generic framework for SSA and elsewhere. Adult mortality proportions were analyzed at four administrative levels and spatial analyses were used to identify areas with significant excess mortality. An ecological approach was then used to assess the relationship between mortality "hotspots" and various determinants. Population attributable fractions were calculated to quantify the reduction in mortality as a result of targeted removal of high-impact determinants. Results: Overall adult mortality rate was 145 per 10,000. Spatial disaggregation identified a highly non-random pattern and 67 significant high risk local municipalities were identified. The most prominent determinants of adult mortality included HIV antenatal sero-prevalence, low SES and lack of formal marital union status. The removal of the most attributable factors, based on local area prevalence, suggest that overall adult mortality could be potentially reduced by,90 deaths per 10,000. Conclusions: The innovative use of secondary data and advanced epidemiological techniques can be combined in a generic framework to identify and map mortality to the lowest administration level. The identification of high risk mortality determinants allows health authorities to tailor interventions at local level. This approach can be replicated elsewhere.

Further, it is unknown if these rates are influenced by levels of neighbourhood deprivation or by a patient's age or sex. Our study aims to investigate if inequalities in AP treatment could be observed between patients living in neighbourhoods with the highest levels of material and social deprivation and those with the lowest deprivation levels, between patients from different age groups, or between men and women. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of medical-administrative data of a cohort of adult patients in the province of Quebec with a medical contact for schizophrenia in a 2-year period (2004-2005). We assessed the proportion of patients that filled at least 1 prescription for an AP and received adequate pharmaceutical treatment, defined as being in possession of APs at least 80% of the time as outpatients during a 2-year follow-up period. Results: Among the 30 544 study patients, 88.5% filled at least 1 prescription for an AP, and 67.5% of the treated patients received adequate treatment. Though no clinically significant differences were observed by deprivation or sex, younger age was associated with lower proportions of patients receiving adequate treatment (46% of treated patients aged between 18 and 29 years, compared with 72% aged between 30 and 64 years, and 77% aged 65 years and over). Conclusions: In Quebec's routine practice, over 70% of treated patients aged 30 and over received adequate pharmacological treatment, regardless of sex or neighbourhood socioeconomic status. In contrast, in patients aged between 18 and 29 years this percentage was 47%. This is a discouraging finding, especially because optimal treatment in the early phase of disease is reported to result in the best long-term outcomes.

In these studies, however, the diagnosis of major depressive disorders may be underestimated because they identified only individuals who visited a doctor and received a diagnosis. Moreover, these studies did not consider neurotic personality traits, which can affect the occurrence of major depressive disorders. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the cross-sectional association of organizational justice with major depressive episodes in the past 12 months more precisely in Japanese employees. Methods: A total of 425 males and 708 females from five branches of a manufacturing company in Japan completed self-administered questionnaires measuring organizational justice, other job stressors (i.e., job strain, social support at work, and effort-reward imbalance), neuroticism, and demographic characteristics. A web-based self-administered version of the computerized Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0) was used to assess major depressive episodes. Logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: In the univariate analysis, low procedural justice and low interactional justice were significantly associated with major depressive episodes in the past 12 months. After adjusting for other job stressors and demographic characteristics, only the association of interactional justice remained significant. The moderating effect of neuroticism on the association of organizational justice with major depressive episodes in the past 12 months was not significant. Conclusions: Low interactional justice may be associated with major depressive disorders regardless or other job stressors or neurotic personality traits.

Inequality as an obstacle to sustainable electricity and transport energy use	ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Energy; Inequality; Vehicles; Emissions; Sustainability; Western Australia	AIR-POLLUTION; RENEWABLE ENERGY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; IMPACT; INDEX; CALIFORNIA; EXPOSURE; CLIMATE; ASTHMA; PERTH	The Australian state of Western Australia could follow a number of different paths to satisfy its future energy needs with each path meeting different criteria for sustainable development. A number of energy use scenarios were analysed, including the present case of high fossil fuel use, in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, water consumption, and financial impact on households with incomes at different levels. Scenarios had different combinations of electricity generation sources and vehicle type. It was found that health costs from vehicle emissions are a significant cost of energy use for households relative to other costs (e.g., cost of fuel). Because of high income inequality and the effects of vehicle emissions on health, it was found that the most sustainable use of energy for society overall requires households to use energy differently according to their income levels. Low-median income households have the most to gain from overall electric vehicle uptake, but these same households cannot afford to adopt these vehicles. We show that the differential effects of current energy use on households with different income levels is increasing inequality between households, and that inequality both results from, and is a cause of unsustainable energy use. The conclusion is that income inequality is an obstacle to the uptake of electric vehicles, and can therefore be an obstacle to sustainable energy use. (C) 2013 International Energy Initiative.

The Geography of Recreational Open Space: Influence of Neighborhood Racial Composition and Neighborhood Poverty	JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE			English	Article						Recreational open space; Neighborhood racial composition; Neighborhood poverty; Racial/socioeconomic segregation; Spatial demography; Boston; US	SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; HEALTH DISPARITIES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; PRIORITIZING COMMUNITIES; SOCIOECONOMIC MEASURES; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; SPATIAL DEPENDENCE	The geography of recreational open space might be inequitable in terms of minority neighborhood racial/ethnic composition and neighborhood poverty, perhaps due in part to residential segregation. This study evaluated the association between minority neighborhood racial/ethnic composition, neighborhood poverty, and recreational open space in Boston, Massachusetts (US). Across Boston census tracts, we computed percent non-Hispanic Black, percent Hispanic, and percent families in poverty as well as recreational open space density. We evaluated spatial autocorrelation in study variables and in the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression residuals via the Global Moran's I. We then computed Spearman correlations between the census tract socio-demographic characteristics and recreational open space density, including correlations adjusted for spatial autocorrelation. After this, we computed OLS regressions or spatial regressions as appropriate. Significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found for neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics (all p value = 0.001). We found marginally significant positive spatial autocorrelation in recreational open space (Global Moran's I = 0.082; p value = 0.053). However, we found no spatial autocorrelation in the OLS regression residuals, which indicated that spatial models were not appropriate. There was a negative correlation between census tract percent non-Hispanic Black and recreational open space density (r (S) = -0.22; conventional p value = 0.005; spatially adjusted p value = 0.019) as well as a negative correlation between predominantly non-Hispanic Black census tracts (> 60 % non-Hispanic Black in a census tract) and recreational open space density (r (S) = -0.23; conventional p value = 0.003; spatially adjusted p value = 0.007). In bivariate and multivariate OLS models, percent non-Hispanic Black in a census tract and predominantly Black census tracts were associated with decreased density of recreational open space (p value < 0.001). Consistent with several previous studies in other geographic locales, we found that Black neighborhoods in Boston were less likely to have recreational open spaces, indicating the need for policy interventions promoting equitable access. Such interventions may contribute to reductions and disparities in obesity.

At the same time, especially in the case of the temporary migration, there are positive effects from the foreign professional practice, one of which being the development of professional competencies. The aim of this presentation is to highlight the doctors 'perception of the "doctor-patient" relationship after practicing abroad. The methodology which was used in this study was qualitative. The data were therefore obtained after conducting 22 interviews. The study participants were 10 doctors who had at least one year of practicing abroad and returned to Romania and 12 doctors working in EU countries (France, Belgium, UK). To gather the information we used semi-directive interview guides and the analysis was thematic, using the QsrNvivo program. The results showed that one of the main benefits felt by Romanian doctors regarding their experience abroad was the opportunity to develop interaction skills with patients. Practicing in other health systems meant changing attitude on the doctor-patient relationship by understanding the role of the doctor and sometimes the different needs of patients compared to their previous experience in Romania. Finally it is concluded that patients in source countries can benefit from better health services following the development of professional skills of healthcare human resources and therefore temporary migration may be regarded as a positive factor, stimulating the development of such ethical principles as equity, dignity and mutual respect for the doctor-patient relationship.

J	Varabyova, Y; Schreyögg, J				Varabyova, Yauheniya; Schreyoegg, Jonas			International comparisons of the technical efficiency of the hospital sector: Panel data analysis of OECD countries using parametric and non-parametric approaches	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						International comparison; Hospital sector; Technical efficiency; DEA; SFA	HEALTH PRODUCTION; COST EFFICIENCY; PRODUCTION FRONTIERS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; INFANT-MORTALITY; CARE; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; INEQUALITY; OWNERSHIP	There is a growing interest in the cross-country comparisons of the performance of national health care systems. The present work provides a comparison of the technical efficiency of the hospital sector using unbalanced panel data from OECD countries over the period 2000-2009. The estimation of the technical efficiency of the hospital sector is performed using nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) and parametric stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). Internal and external validity of findings is assessed by estimating the Spearman rank correlations between the results obtained in different model specifications. The panel-data analyses using two-step DEA and one-stage SFA show that countries, which have higher health care expenditure per capita, tend to have a more technically efficient hospital sector. Whether the expenditure is financed through private or public sources is not related to the technical efficiency of the hospital sector. On the other hand, the hospital sector in countries with higher income inequality and longer average hospital length of stay is less technically efficient. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Mortality differentials 1991-2005 by self-reported ethnicity: findings from the ONS Longitudinal Study	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article						Mortality; Inequalities; Ethnicity; Longitudinal Studies; Epidemiology	DROP-OUT; ENGLAND; WALES; COUNTRY; BIRTH; 2ND-GENERATION; MIGRANTS; DURATION; POSITION; HEALTH	Background Research on ethnic differentials in mortality in England and Wales has focused on immigrants because, until now, studies collecting data on ethnicity have not covered sufficient deaths to investigate the subject. International migrants are selected for good health and tend to have low mortality. Methods We investigated all-cause mortality at ages 1-79 in 1991-2005 by self-reported ethnicity and country of birth. The data are from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study of England and Wales for the cohort aged 0-64 in 1991 (n=436195). Poisson regression was used to adjust the estimates for metropolitan residence and three indicators of socioeconomic status. Results White, Black Caribbean, Other Asian and Other immigrants all had lower mortality than Whites born in the UK. Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Chinese immigrants had lower mortality than the UK-born Whites living in similar circumstances to them. By contrast, the UK-born Black Caribbean group had higher mortality (RR=1.38, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.86) than the UK-born Whites. This excess mortality was accounted for by their low socioeconomic status. Within the Black Caribbean population, the UK-born individuals had significantly higher mortality than those born abroad whether or not the estimates were adjusted for socioeconomic status and metropolitan residence. Adjusting exposure time for undocumented emigration made little difference to the estimates. Conclusions Immigrants are selected for good health. This has offset the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage on the mortality of minority ethnic groups. As the immigrant population ages and the UK-born minority ethnic population grows, ethnic differentials in all-cause mortality are likely to change.

The increasing incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, coupled with an ageing population, will exacerbate the burden of CKD unless effective control and prevention strategies are implemented. The unmet challenges of managing the growing number of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in China are reflected by the lower rate of patients receiving dialysis relative to many Western countries, owing to a lack of financial and clinical resources, and inequalities in access to health care across regions and populations. The feasibility of expanding peritoneal dialysis is being examined, and ongoing health-care reforms provide an invaluable opportunity to improve the status and quality of dialysis for patients with ESRD in China. The Chinese Society of Nephrology (CSN) advocates for efforts focused on preventing CKD coupled with early detection, treatment, and adequate follow-up to reduce mortality and the long-term burden of CKD. In addition, rapid advances in nephrology research, from basic science to clinical epidemiology, as well as broad communication and collaboration between the CSN and other international nephrology societies, will promote the development of nephrology in China.

Given that there has been no global investigation of the factors that might impede their successful use in cases of sexual assault, we conducted a review of relevant scholarly and grey literature from industrialized and less-developed regions. One key theme to emerge from the analysis concerned certain problematic practices and behaviors of professional groups involved in the various stages of the post-sexual assault process. We found that a lack of competence in handling sexual assault cases, contempt for women who have been victimized, and corruption among some forensic examiners, police, scientists, and legal personnel often have shaped the collection, processing, analysis, and use of medico-legal evidence. We discuss recent initiatives and future directions for research that might serve to address these issues.

The associations were tested in two European welfare state occupational cohorts to strengthen the evidence base and improve generalizability. Methods Data came from two cohorts: the Finnish Helsinki Health Study (baseline 2000-2002, follow-up 2007, N=6328) and the British Whitehall II Study (baseline 1997-1999, follow-up 2003-2004, N=4350). Responses to the survey item "finding it hard to afford adequate food and clothes and pay bills" repeated at baseline and follow-up were used to examine persistent, increasing, and decreasing economic difficulties. Poor physical and mental health functioning were denoted as being in the lowest quartile of the Short Form 36 physical and mental component summary. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for sex, age, childhood economic difficulties, household income at baseline and follow-up, employment status at follow-up, and baseline health functioning. Results We observed strong sex- and age-adjusted associations between increasing [odds ratio (OR) range 1.69-2.96] and persistent (OR range 2.54-3.21) economic difficulties and poorer physical and mental health functioning in both British and Finnish occupational cohorts. These associations remained after full adjustments. Those reporting decreasing difficulties over follow-up also had poorer functioning (OR range 1.30-1.61) compared to those who did not have difficulties at baseline, possibly reflecting residual effects of economic difficulties at baseline. Conclusion Changes in economic difficulties are associated with poorer physical and mental health functioning independent of income, employment status, and baseline health functioning.

Also the analytical approach used often did not account, as recommended, for the changes in the relative distribution of social groups and the changes in the absolute level of the health outcome within social groups. Methods: Data from four successive waves of the Belgian Health Interview Survey (1997, 2001, 2004, 2008) were used to study the time trends in educational inequalities in daily smoking for those aged between 15 and 74 years. We estimated two measures of relative inequalities: the OR and the relative index of inequality; and two measures of absolute inequalities: the population attributable fraction and the slope index of inequality. Three of these measures (relative index of inequality, population attributable fraction, slope index of inequality) account for the change in the relative size of the social groups over time. Results: The four measures of inequality were consistent in showing significant inequalities among educational groups. The time trends, however, were less consistent. Measures of trends in relative inequalities witnessed a small linear increase. However, no substantial over time change was observed with the measures of absolute inequalities. Conclusion: The time trends in social inequalities in smoking varied according to the measure of inequality used. This study confirms the importance of using multiple measures of inequalities to understand and monitor social inequalities in smoking.

Acceptable cost for the patient and society	FERTILITY AND STERILITY			English	Article						Assisted reproductive technology; costs; health policy; health economics	ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY; IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION; GEOGRAPHICALLY DETERMINED POPULATION; SINGLE EMBRYO-TRANSFER; BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; AGE 8-9 YEARS; INSURANCE MANDATES; TREATMENT-SEEKING; MULTIPLE BIRTHS; LIVE BIRTH	Alongside the debate around clinical, scientific, and ethical aspects of assisted reproductive technology (ART), there exists a parallel debate around the economics of ART treatment and what is the most appropriate funding framework for providing safe, equitable, and cost-effective treatment. The cost of ART treatment from a patient perspective exhibits striking differences worldwide due to the costliness of underlying health care systems and the level of public and third-party subsidization. These relative cost differences affect not only who can afford to access ART treatment but how ART is practiced in terms of embryo transfer practices; in turn significantly impacting the health outcomes and costs of caring for ART conceived children. Although empirical evidence indicates that ART treatment is "good value money" from a societal and patient perspective, the challenge remains to communicate this to policy makers, primarily because fertility treatments are not easily accommodated by traditional health economic methods. Furthermore, with global demand for ART treatment likely to increase, it is important that future funding decisions are informed by what has been learned about how costs and economic incentives influence equity of access and clinical practice. In this review we provide an international perspective on the costs and consequences of ART and summarize key economic considerations from the perspective of ART patients, providers, and society as a whole in the coming decade.

This study prospectively examined the relationships between area-level socioeconomic position (SEP) and the incidence of MetS. Methods: A prospective cohort study design was employed involving 1,877 men and women aged 18+ living in metropolitan Adelaide, Australia, all free of MetS at baseline. Area-level SEP measures, derived from Census data, included proportion of residents completing a university education, and median household weekly income. MetS, defined according to International Diabetes Federation, was ascertained after an average of 3.6 years follow up. Associations between each area-level SEP measure and incident MetS were examined by Poisson regression Generalised Estimating Equations models. Interaction between area-and individual-level SEP variables was also tested. Results: A total of 156 men (18.7%) and 153 women (13.1%) developed MetS. Each percentage increase in the proportion of residents with a university education corresponded to a 2% lower risk of developing MetS (age and sex-adjusted incidence risk ratio (RR) = 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.97-0.99). This association persisted after adjustment for individual-level income, education, and health behaviours. There was no significant association between area-level income and incident MetS overall. For the high income participants, however, a one standard deviation increase in median household weekly income was associated with a 29% higher risk of developing MetS (Adjusted RR = 1.29; 95%CI = 1.04-1.60). Conclusions: While area-level education was independently and inversely associated with the risk of developing MetS, the association between area-level income and the MetS incidence was modified by individual-level income.

The aim of this study is to measure to what extent this goal has been obtained in various European countries and evaluate the determinants of inequalities within countries, as well as cross-country patterns with regard to different cultural, institutional and social settings. Methods: The data utilized in this study provides information on 440,000 individuals in 26 European countries and stem from The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) collected in 2007. As measures of income-related inequality in health both the relative concentration indices and the absolute concentration indices are calculated. Further, health inequality in each country is decomposed into individual-level determinants and cross-country comparisons are made to shed light on social and institutional determinants. Results: Income-related health inequality favoring the better-off is observed for all the 26 European countries. In terms of within-country determinants inequality is mainly explained by income, age, education, and activity status. However, the degree of inequality and contribution of each determinant to inequality varies considerably between countries. Aggregate bivariate linear regressions show that there is a positive association between health-income inequality in Europe and public expenditure on education. Furthermore, a negative relationship between health-income inequality and income inequality was found when individual employee cash income was used in the health-concentration measurement. Using that same income measure, health-income inequality was found to be higher in the Nordic countries than in other areas, but this result is sensitive to the income measure chosen. Conclusions: The findings indicate that institutional determinants partly explain income-related health inequalities across countries. The results are in accordance with previously published theories hypothesizing social mobility as the explanation for differences in health-income inequalities between countries and higher health-income inequality could be a result of lower income inequality.

Left behind: widening disparities for males and females in US county life expectancy, 1985-2010	POPULATION HEALTH METRICS			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; ADULTS HEALTH; GLOBAL BURDEN; RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; EDUCATION; INCOME; AGE	Background: The United States spends more than any other country on health care. The poor relative performance of the US compared to other high-income countries has attracted attention and raised questions about the performance of the US health system. An important dimension to poor national performance is the large disparities in life expectancy. Methods: We applied a mixed effects Poisson statistical model and Gaussian Process Regression to estimate age-specific mortality rates for US counties from 1985 to 2010. We generated uncertainty distributions for life expectancy at each age using standard simulation methods. Results: Female life expectancy in the United States increased from 78.0 years in 1985 to 80.9 years in 2010, while male life expectancy increased from 71.0 years in 1985 to 76.3 years in 2010. The gap between female and male life expectancy in the United States was 7.0 years in 1985, narrowing to 4.6 years in 2010. For males at the county level, the highest life expectancy steadily increased from 75.5 in 1985 to 81.7 in 2010, while the lowest life expectancy remained under 65. For females at the county level, the highest life expectancy increased from 81.1 to 85.0, and the lowest life expectancy remained around 73. For male life expectancy at the county level, there have been three phases in the evolution of inequality: a period of rising inequality from 1985 to 1993, a period of stable inequality from 1993 to 2002, and rising inequality from 2002 to 2010. For females, in contrast, inequality has steadily increased during the 25-year period. Compared to only 154 counties where male life expectancy remained stagnant or declined, 1,405 out of 3,143 counties (45%) have seen no significant change or a significant decline in female life expectancy from 1985 to 2010. In all time periods, the lowest county-level life expectancies are seen in the South, the Mississippi basin, West Virginia, Kentucky, and selected counties with large Native American populations. Conclusions: The reduction in the number of counties where female life expectancy at birth is declining in the most recent period is welcome news. However, the widening disparities between counties and the slow rate of increase compared to other countries should be viewed as a call for action. An increased focus on factors affecting health outcomes, morbidity, and mortality such as socioeconomic factors, difficulty of access to and poor quality of health care, and behavioral, environmental, and metabolic risk factors is urgently required.

Objectives The objective was to assess community attitudes of SGBV and health facility capacity to address SGBV in eastern DRC. Design and setting The design and setting are as follows: a cross-sectional, population-based cluster survey of 998 adults in eastern DRC territories, a convenience sample of 27 adults using semi-structured directed interviews, qualitative data from 37 focus groups conducted in three health zones, assessment of 64 health facilities and a comparative analysis of SGBV strategies. Main outcome measures The main outcome measures opinions regarding SGBV prevention and justice and health facility capacity to address SGBV. Results The majority of respondents favored the legal system over community mediation to obtain justice for SGBV. However, 61.1% (95% CI, 51.8-70.5%) of SGBV survivors reported being forced to accept community mediation. Among SGBV survivors, 81.2% (95% CI, 74.5-87.8%) reported no available mental health care. Less than half of all respondents reported access to a hospital, clinic or pharmacy. The analyses and facility assessment reinforce the need to improve SGBV care. Conclusions Mixed methodologies point to the complexities of addressing SGBV, assess key elements of SGBV prevention, justice and response, and may ultimately inform national and international strategies.

Objectives: (a) to identify how student-interns contrasted Canadian and Brazilian cultural and social realities within a primary healthcare context from a social development perspective; (b) to examine how philosophical underpinnings, including social critical theory and notions of social justice, guided student-interns in acknowledging inequalities in primary healthcare in Brazil; and (c) to participate in the debate on the contribution of Canadian nursing students to the global movement for social development. Design and Setting: A qualitative appraisal of short-term outcomes of an international internship in the cities of Birigui & Aracatuba (Sao Paulo-Brazil). Participants: Four Canadian fourth-year undergraduate nursing students enrolled in a metropolitan university program. Methods: Recruitment was through an email invitation to the student-interns, who accepted, and signed informed consent forms. Their participation was unpaid and voluntary. One-time individual interviews were conducted at the end of their internships. Transcriptions of the audio-recorded interviews were coded using the qualitative software program ATLAS ti 6.0. The findings were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Student-interns' learning unfolded from making associations among concepts, new ideas, and their previous experiences, leading to a personal transformation through which they established new conceptual and personal connections. The two main themes revealed by the thematic analysis were dichotomizing realities, that is, acknowledging the existence of "two sides of each situation," and discovering an unexpected reciprocity between global and urban health. Furthermore, the student-interns achieved personal and professional empowerment. Conclusions: The knowledge gained from the international experience helped the student-interns learn how to collaborate with Brazilian society's sectors to improve the social conditions of a "marginalized population". Student-interns became aware of their inner power to promote change by making invisible inequity visible in their own terms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Influence of socioeconomic and demographic status on spirometry testing in patients initiating medication targeting obstructive lung disease: a population-based cohort study	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Socioeconomic Status; Spirometry; Obstructive Lung Disease	ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; ASTHMA PREVALENCE; PULMONARY-DISEASE; GLOBAL STRATEGY; PRIMARY-CARE; HEALTH-CARE; MANAGEMENT; ACCESS; MORTALITY	Background: Socioeconomic status is known to influence the prevalence, severity and mortality of obstructive lung diseases, but it is uncertain whether it affects the use of diagnostic spirometry in patients initiating treatment for these conditions. The objective of this paper was to examine a possible association between education, income, labour market affiliation, cohabitation status and having spirometry performed when initiating medication targeting obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study. Danish national registers were linked, retrieving data on prescriptions, spirometry testing, socioeconomic and demographic variables in all first time users of medication targeting obstructive lung disease in 2008. Results: A total of 37,734 persons were included and approximately half of the cohort had spirometry performed. Among medication users under 65 years of age, being unemployed was significantly associated with reduced odds of having spirometry performed, the strongest association was seen in men (OR = 0.82, CI = 0.73-0.91). Medium income was associated with increased odds of having spirometry performed in men (OR = 1.18, CI = 1.06-1.30) and high educational level (>12 years) was associated with reduced odds of having spirometry performed in women (OR = 0.86, CI = 0.78-0.94). Cohabitation status was not associated with having spirometry performed. Among medication users over 65 years of age, living alone was associated with reduced odds of having spirometry performed among men (OR = 0.78, CI = 0.69-0.88). Conclusion: Social inequity in spirometry testing among patients initiating medication targeting obstructive lung disease was confirmed in this study. Increased focus on spirometry testing among elderly men living alone, among the unemployed and among women with higher education is required when initiating medication.

We also analyze the quality of life of disabled people by adding a political dimension (adapted from the Minorities' Rights Support Scale by Nata & Menezes, 2007) to this construct and seeking to understand the impact of discrimination. The sample is composed of 217 participants, most of whom have a physical disability, aged 16 to 81. Validation procedures of the Quality of Life Questionnaire (Schalock & Keith, 1993) and descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were conducted. Confirmatory Factor Analysis revealed good local and global fit indices, and the internal consistency of the scales was satisfactory. An adapted version of the instrument composed of five scales-satisfaction, competence, empowerment, equality of rights and positive discrimination-is proposed. The results reveal the importance of rights and empowerment for the quality of life of disabled people and indicate a strong critical consciousness concerning the experience of discrimination in different contexts. Taken together, the findings indicate the strong need for social and political changes in this domain.

We consider the topic using a household-level approach. We use a new survey, "Georgia on the Move," to examine migrant-level, household-level, and contextual variables associated with the probability that a household in the Republic of Georgia receives remittances. We then apply propensity score matching to estimate how remittances affect particular types of household expenditures, savings, labor supply, health, and other measures of well-being. Separate analysis of the subsample of households with a migrant currently abroad distinguishes the effects of remittances from the effects of migration as such. In Georgia, remittances improve household economic well-being without, for the most part, producing the negative consequences often suggested in the literature. We find evidence for an important aspect that has not been widely discussed in prior studies: remittances foster the formation of social capital by increasing the amount of money that households give as gifts to other households.

J	Hunt, MR; Godard, B				Hunt, Matthew R.; Godard, Beatrice			Beyond procedural ethics: Foregrounding questions of justice in global health research ethics training for students	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						research ethics; global health; justice; equity; students; training	CLINICAL-RESEARCH; ISSUES	Interest in global health is growing among students across many disciplines and fields of study. In response, an increasing number of academic programmes integrate and promote opportunities for international research, service or clinical placements. These activities raise a range of ethical issues and are associated with important training needs for those who participate. In this paper, we focus on research fieldwork conducted in lower income nations by students from more affluent countries and the ethics preparation they would benefit from receiving prior to embarking on these projects. Global health research is closely associated with questions of justice and equity that extend beyond concerns of procedural ethics. Research takes place in and is shaped by matrices of political, social and cultural contexts and concerns. These realities warrant analysis and discussion during research ethics training. Training activities present an opportunity to encourage students to link global health research to questions of global justice, account for issues of justice in planning their own research, and prepare for ethics-in-practice' issues when conducting research in contexts of widespread inequality. Sustained engagement with questions of justice and equity during research ethics training will help support students for involvement in global health research.

J	Dingle, A; Powell-Jackson, T; Goodman, C				Dingle, Antonia; Powell-Jackson, Timothy; Goodman, Catherine			A decade of improvements in equity of access to reproductive and maternal health services in Cambodia, 2000-2010	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Equity; Access; Utilisation; Reproductive and maternal health services; Cambodia	RURAL BANGLADESH; CARE; INEQUALITIES; POOR; INTERVENTIONS; INEQUITIES; MORTALITY; DELIVERY; SEEKING; WELFARE	Introduction: Despite encouraging reductions in global maternal mortality rates, Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 on reducing maternal mortality and achieving universal access to reproductive health remains the most off-track of all MDGs. Furthermore a preoccupation with aggregate coverage statistics masks extensive disparities in health improvements between societal groups. Recent national health indicators for Cambodia highlight impressive improvements, for example, in maternal, infant and child mortality, whilst substantial government commitments have been made since 2000 to address health inequities. It is therefore timely to explore the extent of equity in access to key reproductive and maternal health services in Cambodia and how this has changed over time. Methods: Analysis was conducted on three rounds of Demographic and Health Survey data from 2000, 2005 and 2010. Outcome variables comprised utilisation of six reproductive and maternal health services - antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, facility-based delivery, postnatal care, met need for family planning and abortion by skilled provider. Four equity measures were calculated - equity gaps, equity ratios, concentration curves and concentration indices. Household assets were used to create the social-stratification variable, using principal components analysis. Results: Coverage levels of all six services improved over the decade. Coverage improvements were greatest amongst wealthier quintiles of the population, although poorer quintiles also increased use of services. Critically, inequity in service use of all services dramatically reduced over time, except for postnatal care where inequity increased slightly. However, in 2010 inequity in service use remained favouring wealthier quintiles, greatest in use of skilled birth attendance and facility-based delivery, though the magnitude of inequity was substantially reduced compared to 2000. Met need for family planning was almost perfectly equitable in 2010. Conclusions: Cambodia has made impressive improvements in overall coverage of reproductive and maternal health services over the last decade, and also in the distribution of their use across wealth quintiles. A range of pro-poor health financing and supply-side policies as well as non-health factors may have contributed to these achievements. Further research will explore specific schemes qualitatively and quantitatively to assess their impact on equity and service use.

Ross			AIDER: A model for social accountability in medical education and practice	MEDICAL TEACHER			English	Article							CARE	Background: Social accountability in healthcare requires physicians and medical institutions to direct their research, services and education activities to adequately address health inequities. The need for greater social accountability has been addressed in numerous national and international healthcare reviews of health disparities and medical education. Aim: The aim of this work is to better understand how to identify underserved populations and address their specific needs and also to provide physicians and medical institutions with a means by which to cultivate social accountability. Methods: The authors reviewed existing literature and prominent models focusing on social accountability, as well as medical education frameworks, and identified the need to engage underserved stakeholders and incorporate education that includes knowledge translation and reciprocity. The AIDER model was developed to satisfy the need in medical education and practice that is not explicitly addressed in previous models. Results: The AIDER model (Assess, Inquire, Deliver, Educate, Respond) is a continuous monitoring process that explicitly incorporates reciprocal education and continuous collaboration with underserved stakeholders. Conclusion: This model is an incremental step forward in helping physicians and medical institutions foster a culture of social accountability both in individual practice and throughout the continuum of medical education.

Youth conduct disorder is increasingly prevalent in the UK and is associated with a range of negative outcomes. Quantitative systematic reviews carried out for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have identified multisystemic therapy, an intensive, multimodal, home-based, family intervention for youth with serious antisocial behaviour, as one of the most promising interventions for reducing antisocial or offending behaviour and improving individual and family functioning. Previous international trials of multisystemic therapy have yielded mixed outcomes, and it is questionable to what extent positive US findings can be generalised to a wider UK mental health and juvenile justice context. This paper describes the protocol for the Systemic Therapy for At Risk Teens (START) trial, a multicentre UK-wide randomised controlled trial of multisystemic therapy in antisocial adolescents at high risk of out-of-home placement. Methods/Design: The trial is being conducted at 10 sites across the UK. Seven hundred participants and their families will be recruited and randomised on a 1: 1 basis to multisystemic therapy or management as usual. Treatments are offered over a period of 3 to 5 months, with follow-up to 18 months post-randomisation. The primary outcome is out-of-home placement at 18 months. Secondary outcomes include offending rates, total service and criminal justice sector costs, and participant well-being and educational outcomes. Data will be gathered from police computer records, the National Pupil Database, and interview and self-report measures administered to adolescents, parents and teachers. Outcomes will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, using a logistic regression with random effects for the primary outcome and Cox regressions and linear mixed-effects models for secondary outcomes depending on whether the outcome is time-to-event or continuous. Discussion: The START trial is a pragmatic national trial of sufficient size to evaluate multisystemic therapy, to inform policymakers, service commissioners, professionals, service users and their families about its potential in the UK. It will also provide data on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of usual services provided to youth with serious antisocial behaviour problems.

According to the United Nations, older adults and the serious and terminally ill are considered special needs populations subject to special international health and social practice and policy considerations. We argue that older adults in prison have unique individual and social developmental needs that result from life course exposure to cumulative risk factors compounded by prison conditions that accelerate their aging. We position these factors in a social context model of human development and well-being and present a review of international human rights guidelines that pertain to promoting health and well-being to those aging in custody. The study concludes with promising practices and recommendations of their potential to reduce the high direct and indirect economic costs associated with mass confinement of older adults, many of whom need specialized long-term care that global correctional systems are inadequately equipped to provide.

Methods: A secondary analysis was performed using data generated from a prospective, multi-center, descriptive study conducted in 2008 that assessed perinatal care in 12 public hospitals in the city of Buenos Aires and 70 public hospitals in Buenos Aires Province. In the original study, eligible women answered questions about their obstetric history, sociodemographic characteristics, and prenatal and intrapartum care within 48 hours of delivery. In the present analysis, the associations between nationality and prenatal care, intrapartum care, and perinatal outcome were determined. Results: The study included 10 898 women. The sociodemographic characteristics were similar between the groups, although the proportion of adolescents was higher among Argentines than among immigrants (20.1% versus 12.5%), whereas immigrant women were less educated (30.7% of the immigrant women reported 0-6 years of education compared with 7.3% of Argentines). Likewise, there were few differences in obstetric care during pregnancy and delivery, and the pregnancy outcomes were also similar between the groups. Conclusion: There were few clinically significant differences in medical care between Argentine women and resident immigrant women during the prepartum and intrapartum periods.

Methods Data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 2007-2010 in African countries were used. The study assessed the contribution of determinants to (1) overall inequality in under-5 mortality measured by the Gini index and (2) wealth-related inequality in under-5 mortality measured by the concentration index. Techniques used were multivariate logistic regression and decomposition of Gini and concentration indexes. Results Birth order and interval and region contributed the most to overall inequality in under-5 mortality in a majority of countries. A significant wealth-related inequality was observed in five countries: DRCongo, Egypt, Madagascar, Nigeria and Sao Tome & Principe. Overall, household wealth, father's occupation and mother's education contributed the most to this inequality, though the ranking of the most important determinants differed across countries. Conclusions Assessing the contribution of determinants to overall inequality and to wealth-related inequality in under-5 mortality help in prioritising interventions aiming at improving child survival and equity.

Retrospective data were collected during an international service-learning program between 2002 and 2009. A sample of 1,143 children (55% females; mean age 12.7 +/- 13.1years) was analyzed. The mean DMFT score, represented largely by untreated tooth decay, was 4.02 (4.76). The variables that had the most significant effect on the DMFT score were proportion of paved roads between the community and dental services, and the availability of piped potable water. The DMFT score increased in proportion to the percentage of paved roads. In contrast, the DMFT score decreased with the availability of piped potable water. Similar results were found for untreated tooth decay. The main variable associated with a significant increase in dental fillings was proportion of paved roads. Together with Brazilian reports, this is one of the first investigations of the association between geographical factors and oral health in an underdeveloped setting.

J	Schrecker, T				Schrecker, Ted			Interrogating scarcity: how to think about 'resource-scarce settings'	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Resource allocation; scarcity; health ethics; globalization; justice	DOHA DECLARATION; WORLD-BANK; HEALTH; ACCESS; WATER; COUNTRIES; TRIPS	The idea of resource scarcity permeates health ethics and health policy analysis in various contexts. However, health ethics inquiry seldom asks-as it should-why some settings are 'resource-scarce' and others not. In this article I describe interrogating scarcity as a strategy for inquiry into questions of resource allocation within a single political jurisdiction and, in particular, as an approach to the issue of global health justice in an interconnected world. I demonstrate its relevance to the situation of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with brief descriptions of four elements of contemporary globalization: trade agreements; the worldwide financial marketplace and capital flight; structural adjustment; imperial geopolitics and foreign policy. This demonstration involves not only health care, but also social determinants of health. Finally, I argue that interrogating scarcity provides the basis for a new, critical approach to health policy at the interface of ethics and the social sciences, with specific reference to market fundamentalism as the value system underlying contemporary globalization.

The study used hierarchical linear modeling to examine the relations between individual and school characteristics, and students' psychosomatic symptoms. Methods: Data were analyzed using a two-level model based on 22,552 students (49.8% boys; M age = 15.70, SD = .69) nested within 1,111 schools. A questionnaire devised by the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) international group was used. Results: Sense of community and procedural unfairness in the school at the individual level showed a significant association with students' psychosomatic symptoms. School characteristics predicted between-school variation in psychosomatic symptoms, in that procedural unfairness at the school level increased the risk for psychosomatic symptoms and a sense of community in the school protected students. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the quality-of-school context may have a key role in predicting students' psychosomatic symptoms. (C) 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

However, scant evidence exists about the distribution of child mortality at low sub-national levels, which in diverse and decentralized countries like India are required to inform policy-making. This study estimates changes in child mortality across a range of markers of inequalities in Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, two of India's largest, poorest, and most disadvantaged states. Methods: Estimates of under-five and neonatal mortality rates were computed using seven datasets from three available sources - sample registration system, summary birth histories in surveys, and complete birth histories. Inequalities were gauged by comparison of mortality rates within four sub-state populations defined by the following characteristics: rural-urban location, ethnicity, wealth, and district. Results: Trend estimates suggest that progress has been made in mortality rates at the state levels. However, reduction rates have been modest, particularly for neonatal mortality. Different mortality rates are observed across all the equity markers, although there is a pattern of convergence between rural and urban areas, largely due to inadequate progress in urban settings. Inter-district disparities and differences between socioeconomic groups are also evident. Conclusions: Although child mortality rates continue to decline at the national level, our evidence shows that considerable disparities persist. While progress in reducing under-five and neonatal mortality rates in urban areas appears to be levelling off, polices targeting rural populations and scheduled caste and tribe groups appear to have achieved some success in reducing mortality differentials. The results of this study thus add weight to recent government initiatives targeting these groups. Equitable progress, particularly for neonatal mortality, requires continuing efforts to strengthen health systems and overcome barriers to identify and reach vulnerable groups.

Health system constraints often have the greatest impact on disadvantaged populations, resulting in poor access to quality health services among vulnerable groups. Methods: The Investment Cases in Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, and the state of Orissa in India were implemented to support evidence-based sub-national planning and budgeting for equitable scale-up of quality MNCH services. The Investment Case framework combines the basic setup of strategic problem solving with a decision-support model. The analysis and identification of strategies to scale-up priority MNCH interventions is conducted by in-country planners and policymakers with facilitation from local and international research partners. Results: Significant variation in scaling-up constraints, strategies, and associated costs were identified between countries and across urban and rural typologies. Community-based strategies have been considered for rural populations served predominantly by public providers, but this analysis suggests that the scaling-up of maternal, newborn, and child health services requires health system interventions focused on 'getting the basics right'. These include upgrading or building facilities, training and redistribution of staff, better supervision, and strengthening the procurement of essential commodities. Some of these strategies involve substantial early capital expenditure in remote and sparsely populated districts. These supply-side strategies are not only the 'best buys', but also the 'required buys' to ensure the quality of health services as coverage increases. By contrast, such public supply strategies may not be the 'best buys' in densely populated urbanised settings, served by a mix of public and private providers. Instead, robust regulatory and supervisory mechanisms are required to improve the accessibility and quality of services delivered by the private sector. They can lead to important maternal mortality reductions at relatively low costs. Conclusions: National strategies that do not take into consideration the special circumstances of disadvantaged areas risk disempowering local managers and may lead to a "business-as-usual" acceptance of unreachable goals. To effectively guide health service delivery at a local level, national plans should adopt typologies that reflect the different problems and strategies to scale up key MNCH interventions.

J	Habersack, M; Luschin, G				Habersack, Marion; Luschin, Gero			WHO-definition of health must be enforced by national law: a debate	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						WHO; Health; Right to health; Democratic process		Background: On its establishment, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as a fundamental human right deserving legal protection. Subsequently, the Ottawa Charter reaffirmed health as a fundamental right, and emphasized health promotion as the most appropriate response to global health issues. Here we suggest that the WHO definition of health as more than simply the absence of illness is not normative, and therefore requires standardization. To date such standardization unfortunately is lacking. Discussion: National legislatures must actively ensure fair access to health care, both nationally and internationally, and also must reduce social inequality. To achieve this requires practical action, not statements of intentions, commitments or targets. Protecting fundamental rights to health care can be a fruitful focus for legislatures. Legislative action can build an objective legal framework for health care law, and guide its interpretation and application. Additionally, it is important to ensure the law is appropriate, useful and sustainable. Summary: Action is needed to protect the fundamental right to health care.

Additionally, professional experts should help interpret and codify concepts of health and join the interdisciplinary discussion of a variable health standard.

Factors that influence current tuberculosis epidemiology	EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL			English	Review						Epidemiology; Pott Disease; Risk factors; Spine; Tuberculosis	DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; PASSIVE SMOKING; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; TOBACCO SMOKING; RISK-FACTORS; INFECTION; MORTALITY; CHILDREN; ADULTS; ASSOCIATION	According to WHO estimates, in 2010 there were 8.8 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) and 1.5 million deaths. TB has been classically associated with poverty, overcrowding and malnutrition. Low income countries and deprived areas, within big cities in developed countries, present the highest TB incidences and TB mortality rates. These are the settings where immigration, important social inequalities, HIV infection and drug or alcohol abuse may coexist, all factors strongly associated with TB. In spite of the political, economical, research and community efforts, TB remains a major global health problem worldwide. Moreover, in this new century, new challenges such as multidrug-resistance extension, migration to big cities and the new treatments with anti-tumour necrosis alpha factor for inflammatory diseases have emerged and threaten the decreasing trend in the global number of TB cases in the last years. We must also be aware about the impact that smoking and diabetes pandemics may be having on the incidence of TB. The existence of a good TB Prevention and Control Program is essential to fight against TB. The coordination among clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and others, and the link between surveillance, control and research should always be a priority for a TB Program. Each city and country should define their needs according to the epidemiological situation. Local TB control programs will have to adapt to any new challenge that arises in order to respond to the needs of their population.

GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						capacity building; development; health promotion; Sub-Saharan Africa; The Gambia	AFRICA	This paper discusses the difficulties facing the development of health promotion in The Gambia, and in closing the implementation gap' noted by the WHO 7(th) Global Conference on Health Promotion (2009, Nairobi). The Gambia has achieved a great deal so far, but health promotion as a discipline has not really informed the development of its approach to health. There is not a central concern with determinants of health and tackling health inequalities and there is no well-developed health promotion infrastructure. The difficulties facing sub-Saharan Africa generally can be extrapolated from the paper, with the conclusion that sub-Saharan Africa faces many disease and health challenges not experienced by richer countries and thus not only does the discourse of health promotion need to take this into account, but also the basic needs of Africa need to be placed at the forefront.

There is much to applaud in a charter which responds to the need to take action on the social and economic determinants of health and which seeks to empower communities to be at the centre of this. Such accolades tend to position the Ottawa Charter as beyond critique'; a taken-for-granted given' in the history of health promotion. In contrast, we argue it is imperative to critically reflect on its manufacture' and assess the possibility that certain voices have been privileged, and others marginalized. Methods: This paper re-examines the 1986 Ottawa Conference including its background papers from a postcolonial standpoint. We use critical discourse analysis as a tool to identify the enactment of power within the production of the Ottawa health promotion discourse. This exercise draws attention to both the power to ensure the dominant presence of privileged voices at the conference as well as the discursive strategies deployed to naturalize' the social order of inequality. Results: Our analysis shows that the discourse informing the development of the Ottawa Charter strongly reflected Western/colonizer centric worldviews, and actively silenced the possibility of countervailing Indigenous and developing country voices. Conclusion: The Ottawa Charter espouses principles of participation, empowerment and social justice. We question then whether the genesis of the Ottawa Charter lives up to its own principles of practice. We conclude that reflexive practice is crucial to health promotion, which ought to include a preparedness for health promotion to more critically acknowledge its own history.

A settings approach offers an opportunity to bridge these two, with its focus on the interplay between individual, environmental and social determinants of health. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the literature on theoretical bases and practical applications of the settings approach. Interventions targeting social inequities in health through action on various settings were analyzed to establish what is done in health equity research and action as it relates to settings. Results: Four elements emerged as central to an equity-focused settings approach: a focus on social determinants of health, addressing the needs of marginalized groups, effecting change in a setting's structure, and involving stakeholders. Each came with related challenges. To offer potential solutions to these challenges we developed a conceptual framework that integrates theoretical and methodological approaches, along with six core guiding principles, into a settings praxis'. Conclusions: Reducing social inequities in health through the creation of supportive environments requires the application of the settings approach in an innovative way. The proposed conceptual framework can serve as a guide to do so, and help develop, implement and evaluate equity-focused settings-related interventions. (Global Health Promotion, 2013; 20(2): 39-52).

J	Slade, K; Forrester, A				Slade, Karen; Forrester, Andrew			Measuring IPDE-SQ personality disorder prevalence in pre-sentence and early-stage prison populations, with sub-type estimates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Personality disorder; International Personality Disorder; Examination - Screening Questionnaire; Prison; Remand	SUICIDAL-BEHAVIOR; MENTAL-DISORDERS; NATIONAL-SURVEY; HEALTH; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ENGLAND; RISK	Understanding the prevalence and type of personality disorder within prison systems allows for the effective targeting of resources to implement strategies to alleviate symptoms, manage behaviour and attempt to reduce re-offending. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of personality disorder (PD) traits within a local urban high-turnover adult male prison with a remand/recently sentenced population in London, UK. The International Personality Disorder Examination Screening Questionnaire (IPDE-SQ) self-administered questionnaire (LCD-10 version) was completed by 283 prisoners (42% completion rate). 77% of respondents reached the threshold for one or more PDs. The most common PD types were Paranoid PD (44.5%), Anankastic PD (40.3%), Schizoid PD (35%) and Dissocial PD (25.8%). These results confirm and extend existing knowledge regarding the prevalence of PD in prison populations into a high-turnover, urban, remand population. The stark comparison with community samples indicates that a more equitable standard of service delivery within the criminal justice system, focussing on preventive and early intervention services, is now required.

This paper explores how changes to state financial support together with changing family dynamics are impacting on urban Chinese elders. Drawing on exploratory fieldwork in Wuhan, the paper takes an everyday-life approach to reveal new inequalities for older people. Changes to health-care costs are causing anxiety among many elders and plunging others into poverty. However, it is the family that emerges as pivotal to older people's economic and social well-being. For those with decently employed children there are emerging opportunities for independence in later life; conversely, where children are low paid or out of work, it is parental income that is taking the strain. The paper concludes by setting these findings in a broader global context.

The aim of the present study was to identify any health inequalities related to lung cancer and ethnicity. Data on 423 patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer treated at a large specialist cancer hospital in London UK were analysed. Data on stage of disease at diagnosis, co-morbidities, socio-economic status, treatments received and survival were collected and examined for differences by ethnic group. There was a significant difference between black and minority ethnic (BME) patients and White-European patients in socio-economic status (Chi-square test P-value < 0.001). BME patients were over-represented in the most deprived socio-economic groups and under-represented in the most affluent. There were no significant differences in histology, stage of disease, co-morbidities and performance status or treatments received between the different ethnic groups. Ethnicity was not associated with survival. Significant prognostic factors for overall survival were performance status (P < 0.001), stage of disease (P = 0.001) and gender (P = 0.003). Our findings suggest that patients from BME groups are over-represented in more deprived socio-economic groups; however, this did not impact on significant prognostic factors or the treatments that they received. Importantly ethnicity did not influence survival.	[Nimako, K.; Gunapala, R.; O'Brien, M. E.

Members included persons experiencing mental illness and health professionals. Four international visits and local activities enabled a knowledge creation process that combined the experience of social inclusion as we lived and worked together with exploration of the processes of community projects, narratives of experiences and reflective workshops. Outcomes included identification and description of the following: the nature of social inclusion as lived by the participants; the critical elements that support inclusion; and the competences that are developed by all stakeholders during this process. The complex process of social inclusion is facilitated by doing together in environments that enable equality, trust, risk taking and realignment of power. These conceptual understandings of inclusion are discussed in relation to the ongoing activities of the partners, to their potential contribution to the education of occupational therapists (and other professionals) and to the development of socially inclusive occupation-based projects in the community.

One strand of research focuses on inequalities in health within a single country. A separate and newer strand of research focuses on the relationship between inequality and average population health across countries. Despite the theorization of (presumably variable) social conditions as fundamental causes of disease and health, the cross-national literature has focused on average, aggregate population health as the central outcome. Controversies currently surround macro-structural determinants of overall population health, such as income inequality. We advance and redirect these debates by conceptualizing inequalities in health as cross-national variables that are sensitive to social conditions. Using data from 48 World Values Survey countries, representing 74% of the world's population, we examine cross-national variation in inequalities in health. The results reveal substantial variation in health inequalities according to income, education, sex, and migrant status. While higher socioeconomic position is associated with better self-rated health around the globe, the size of the association varies across institutional context and across dimensions of stratification. There is some evidence that education and income are more strongly associated with self-rated health than sex or migrant status.

However, little is known about socioeconomic disparities and mental health problems in childhood and adolescence. This study systematically reviews publications on the relationships between various commonly used indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) and mental health outcomes for children and adolescents aged four to 18 years. Studies published in English or German between 1990 and 2011 were included if they reported at least one marker of socioeconomic status (an index or indicators, e.g., household income, poverty, parental education, parental occupation status, or family affluence) and identified mental health problems using validated instruments. In total, 55 published studies met the inclusion criteria, and 52 studies indicated an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and mental health problems in children and adolescents. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children and adolescents were two to three times more likely to develop mental health problems. Low socioeconomic status that persisted over time was strongly related to higher rates of mental health problems. A decrease in socioeconomic status was associated with increasing mental health problems. The strength of the correlation varied with age and with different indicators of socioeconomic status, whereas heterogeneous findings were reported for gender and types of mental health problems. The included studies indicated that the theoretical approaches of social causation and classical selection are not mutually exclusive across generations and specific mental health problems; these processes create a cycle of deprivation and mental health problems. The review draws attention to the diversity of measures used to evaluate socioeconomic status, which might have influenced the comparability of international epidemiological studies. Furthermore, the review highlights the need for individual-level early childhood interventions as well as a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities at a societal level to improve mental health in childhood and adolescence.

J	Robinson-Pant, A; Singal, N				Robinson-Pant, Anna; Singal, Nidhi			Research ethics in comparative and international education: reflections from anthropology and health	COMPARE-A JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION			English	Article						intercultural learning; anthropology; medical research; ethical codes; comparative and international education	COMMITTEES; PROGRESS; JUSTICE	Within methodological debate on comparative and international education (CIE), issues around research ethics have rarely been directly interrogated. By bringing together insights from discussions in the fields of anthropology and health research, this paper aims to develop a situated' approach for exploring educational research ethics across cultures and institutions. The paper begins with a critique of the legalistic starting point on educational research ethics existing in many Northern institutions, which have often been imposed on other cultural contexts, with a particular focus on examining issues of consent, anonymisation and harm. Cultural values implicit in current UK educational research ethical procedures have been shown to conflict with values in the local context. By focusing on the micro community interactions, ethical concerns discussed in the anthropological literature can provide a resource for learning about differing beliefs and ethical codes of practice. While debates in the health research adopt a social justice agenda, which makes it feasible to interrogate issues such as the processes of knowledge production, the purpose of research and who are the ultimate beneficiaries of the research. The paper concludes by arguing that these reflections can contribute to developing a new lens for exploring research ethics within CIE.

Meeting the commitments of the ICPD Programme of Action to young people	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						adolescents and young people; education; child marriage; gender equity; gender-based violence; health and health services	RURAL SOUTH-AFRICA; CHILD MARRIAGE; BEHAVIOR; TRIAL; WOMEN; HIV	Some of the commitments nations have made in international agreements, notably in the ICPD Programme of Action (1994) and the resolution of the UN Committee on Population & Development (2012), to young people include: realisation of the right to education and attainment of a secondary school education; delaying marriage beyond childhood and ensuring free and full choice in marriage-related decisions; exercise of the right to health, including access to friendly health services and counselling; access to health-promoting information, including on sexual and reproductive matters; acquisition of protective assets and agency, particularly among girls and young women, and promotion of gender equitable roles and attitudes; protection from gender-based violence; and socialisation in a supportive environment. These are crucial for a successful transition to adulthood with reference to sexual and reproductive health outcomes. This paper assesses the extent to which these commitments have been realised, drawing from available studies conducted in the 2000s in developing countries. It concludes that while some progress has been made in most of these aspects, developing countries have a long way to go before they can be said to be helping their young people achieve a successful sexual and reproductive health-related transition to adulthood.

We develop national historic emissions databases for both greenhouse gases to 2005, justifying 1950 as the starting point for global perspectives. We include CO2 emissions from fossil sources [CO2(f)], as well as, in a separate analysis, land use change and forestry. We calculate the CO2(f) and CH4 remaining in the atmosphere in 2005 from 205 countries using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report impulse response functions. We use these calculations to estimate the fraction of remaining global emissions due to each country, which is applied to total radiative forcing in 2005 to determine the combined climate debt from both greenhouse gases in units of milliwatts per square meter per country or microwatts per square meter per person, a metric we term international natural debt (IND). Australia becomes the most indebted large country per capita because of high CH4 emissions, overtaking the United States, which is highest for CO2(f). The differences between the INDs of developing and developed countries decline but remain large. We use IND to assess the relative reduction in IND from choosing between CO2(f) and CH4 'control measures and to contrast the imposed versus experienced health impacts from climate change. Based on 2005 emissions, the same hypothetical impact on world 2050 IND could be achieved by decreasing CH4 emissions by 46% as stopping CO2 emissions entirely, but with substantial differences among countries, implying differential optimal strategies. Adding CH4 shifts the basic narrative about differential international accountability for climate change.

This study assesses unemployment rates among individuals with mental health problems before and during the current economic recession. Methods: Using individual and aggregate level data collected from 27 EU countries in the Eurobarometer surveys of 2006 and 2010, we examined changes in unemployment rates over this period among individuals with and without mental health problems. Results: Following the onset of the recession, the gap in unemployment rates between individuals with and without mental health problems significantly widened (odds ratio: 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.34). This disparity became even greater for males, and individuals with low levels of education. Individuals with mental health problems living in countries with higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes regarding dangerousness of people with mental illness were more vulnerable to unemployment in 2010, but not 2006. Greater agreement that people with mental health problems have themselves to blame, was associated with lower likelihood of unemployment for individuals with and without mental health problems. Conclusion: These findings study suggest that times of economic hardship may intensify social exclusion of people with mental health problems, especially males and individuals with lower education. Interventions to combat economic exclusion and to promote social participation of individuals with mental health problems are even more important during times of economic crisis, and these efforts should target support to the most vulnerable groups.

The traditional view targets school-based explanationsU.S. schools attract poorer teachers and lack the proper incentives. But the U.S. educational system may also serve children with comparatively greater academic challenges as a result of poorer social conditions. One way of gaining leverage on this issue is to understand when U.S. students fall behind their international counterparts. I first compare reading/vocabulary test scores for U.S. and Canadian children (ages 4-5) using National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979-Children and Youth (NLSY79) and Canada's National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth (NLSCY). I then compare the magnitude of these differences to similar cohorts of students at ages 15 to 16 using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Findings indicate that while the Canadian advantage in PISA is substantial (0.30 standard deviation units), this advantage already existed at ages 4 to 5, before formal schooling had a chance to matter. I discuss the implications of this pattern for interpreting international test score rankings.

In this review, we suggest that social class is a fundamental means by which individuals are ranked on the social ladder of society. A rank-based perspective on social class shines light on several future areas of research: Specifically, understanding how social class ranks individuals vis-a-vis others leads to predictions about how class is signaled in interactions, influences social cognition and health, is shaped by global economic inequality trends, and changes across the life course. Importantly, our theory highlights the potential of experimental manipulations of social class rank for testing the causal role of social class in shaping basic patterns of cognition, emotion, and behavior. Future predictions regarding the channels of social class rank signals, along with how position on the social ladder shapes political attitudes and interacts with cultural values, are considered.

POPULATION HEALTH METRICS			English	Article						Population; Demography; Mapping; Millenium development goals	GEOGRAPHICAL ACCESSIBILITY; GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION; UPDATED ATLAS; RISK; TRANSMISSION; ENDEMICITY; MORTALITY; SCHISTOSOMIASIS; SERVICES; INFANT	The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have prompted an expansion in approaches to deriving health metrics to measure progress toward their achievement. Accurate measurements should take into account the high degrees of spatial heterogeneity in health risks across countries, and this has prompted the development of sophisticated cartographic techniques for mapping and modeling risks. Conversion of these risks to relevant population-based metrics requires equally detailed information on the spatial distribution and attributes of the denominator populations. However, spatial information on age and sex composition over large areas is lacking, prompting many influential studies that have rigorously accounted for health risk heterogeneities to overlook the substantial demographic variations that exist subnationally and merely apply national-level adjustments. Here we outline the development of high resolution age- and sex-structured spatial population datasets for Africa in 2000-2015 built from over a million measurements from more than 20,000 subnational units, increasing input data detail from previous studies by over 400-fold. We analyze the large spatial variations seen within countries and across the continent for key MDG indicator groups, focusing on children under 5 and women of childbearing age, and find that substantial differences in health and development indicators can result through using only national level statistics, compared to accounting for subnational variation. Progress toward meeting the MDGs will be measured through national-level indicators that mask substantial inequalities and heterogeneities across nations. Cartographic approaches are providing opportunities for quantitative assessments of these inequalities and the targeting of interventions, but demographic spatial datasets to support such efforts remain reliant on coarse and outdated input data for accurately locating risk groups. We have shown here that sufficient data exist to map the distribution of key vulnerable groups, and that doing so has substantial impacts on derived metrics through accounting for spatial demographic heterogeneities that exist within nations across Africa.

Pakistan's expanded programme on immunization: An overview in the context of polio eradication and strategies for improving coverage	VACCINE			English	Review						Pakistan; EPI; Polio eradication; Overview	RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PRIMARY-HEALTH-CARE; CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION; CHILDREN; KARACHI; IMPACT; SERVICES; INFANT; COMPLETION; INCENTIVES	Since its inception in 1978, Pakistan's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) has contributed significantly towards child health and survival in Pakistan. However, the WHO-estimated immunization coverage of 88% for 3 doses of Diptheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine in Pakistan is likely an over-estimate. Many goals, such as polio, measles and neonatal tetanus elimination have not been met. Pakistan reported more cases of poliomyelits in 2011 than any other country globally, threatening the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Although the number of polio cases decreased to 58 in 2012 through better organized supplementary immunization campaigns, country-wide measles outbreaks with over 15,000 cases and several hundred deaths in 2012-13 underscore sub-optimal EPI performance in delivering routine immunizations. There are striking inequities in immunization coverage between different parts of the country. Barriers to universal immunization coverage include programmatic dysfunction at lower tiers of the program, socioeconomic inequities in access to services, low population demand, poor security, and social resistance to vaccines among population sub-groups. Recent conflicts and large-scale natural disasters have severely stressed the already constrained resources of the national EPI. Immunization programs remain low priority for provincial and many district governments in the country. The recent decision to devolve the national health ministry to the provinces has had immediate adverse consequences. Mitigation strategies aimed at rapidly improving routine immunization coverage should include improving the infrastructure and management capacity for vaccine delivery at district levels and increasing the demand for vaccines at the population level. Accurate vaccine coverage estimates at district/sub-district level and local accountability of district government officials are critical to improving performance and eradicating polio in Pakistan.

Methods: A critical review methodology was undertaken, using a systematic approach, aiming to identify the most appropriate tools in the field. Multi-step strategy was followed to gather relevant data, including bibliographical database, internet and hand searches. Results: Twenty-two studies, articles and documents were identified as meeting all inclusion criteria, representing four QAS, compared according to appropriateness, efficiency, and feasibility for general use. The European Quality in Social Services (EQUASS) was evaluated as meeting all of the desired features, such as proper certification, objective measuring, equality, education and training, established guidelines and person-centered approach. Conclusions: EQUASS initiative, developed according to European standards and implemented in resource-limited settings, was recognized as the most adaptive and appropriate system for Greek rehabilitation settings. Health policy makers are urged to take findings into consideration in establishing an integrated, quality-assured rehabilitation system throughout the country. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	Singh, K; Haney, E; Olorunsaiye, C				Singh, Kavita; Haney, Erica; Olorunsaiye, Comfort			Maternal Autonomy and Attitudes Towards Gender Norms: Associations with Childhood Immunization in Nigeria	MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article						Gender; Autonomy; Nigeria; Immunizations; Children	DETERMINANTS	Globally 2.5 million children under-five die from vaccine preventable diseases, and in Nigeria only 23 % of children ages 12-23 months are fully immunized. The international community is promoting gender equality as a means to improve the health and well-being of women and their children. This paper looks at whether measures of gender equality, autonomy and individual attitudes towards gender norms, are associated with a child being fully immunized in Nigeria. Data from currently married women with a child 12-23 months from the 2008 Nigeria demographic and health survey were used to study the influence of autonomy and gender attitudes on whether or not a child is fully immunized. Multivariate logistic regression was used and several key socioeconomic variables were controlled for including wealth and education, which are considered key inputs into gender equality. Findings indicated that household decision-making and attitudes towards wife beating were significantly associated with a child being fully immunized after controlling for socioeconomic variables. Ethnicity, wealth and education were also significant factors. Programmatic and policy implications indicate the potential for the promotion of gender equality as a means to improve child health. Gender equality can be seen as a means to enable women to access life-saving services for their children.

Second, multiparty systems also indicate a competitive party system, which provides incentives for parties to perform effectively while in office and propels parties to appeal to multiple segments of society by providing broader welfare services. The impact of party systems on human well-being is tested on a global sample of 68 democratic countries from 1975-2000. The findings show support for the hypothesized relationship between party systems and human well-being.

This study adds to the literature by examining equity in the distribution of high-technology medical equipment, such as CT and MRI, in China. Methods: A panel analysis was conducted with information about four study sites in 2006 and 2009. The four provincial-level study sites included Shanghai, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, and Hunan, representing different geographical, economic, and medical technology levels in China. A random sample of 71 hospitals was selected from the four sites. Data were collected through questionnaire surveys. Equity status was assessed in terms of CT and MRI numbers, characteristics of machine, and financing sources. The assessment was conducted at multiple levels, including international, provincial, city, and hospital level. In addition to comparison among the study sites, the sample was compared with OECD countries in CT and MRI distributions. Results: China had lower numbers of CTs and MRIs per million population in 2009 than most of the selected OECD countries while the increases in its CT and MRI numbers from 2006 to 2009 were higher than most of the OECD countries. The equity status of CT distribution remained at low inequality level in both 2006 and 2009 while the equity status of MRI distribution improved from high inequality in 2006 to moderate inequality in 2009. Despite the equity improvement, the distributions of CTs and MRIs were significantly positively correlated with economic development level across all cities in the four study sites in either 2006 or 2009. Our analysis also revealed that Shanghai, the study site with the highest level of economic development, had more advanced CT and MRI machine, more imported CTs and MRIs, and higher government subsidies on these two types of equipment. Conclusions: The number of CTs and MRIs increased considerably in China from 2006 to 2009. The equity status of CTs was better than that of MRIs although the equity status in MRI distribution got improved from 2006 to 2009. Still considerable inequality exists in terms of characteristics and financing of CTs and MRIs.

Despite the education sector receiving the largest national annual budget allocation (at least 20%), and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the business sector and even international aid agencies spending millions on school improvement projects, efforts at school improvement have not translated into the desired learning outcomes for students (reflected, for instance, in international comparison tests like TIMSS). This situation calls for deliberation on what constitutes value for money' in school improvement. Purpose In this paper we present a review of school improvement interventions in South Africa, with a view to discussing their efficiency and effectiveness in the local context. Design and methods The review of school improvement interventions in South Africa involved a systematic search of published and unpublished reports of South African schooling interventions, by both national education agencies and NGOs, aimed at improving the quality of schooling. Desktop searches were conducted on Google Scholar, targeting journals published in the last 10 years (2002 to 2011). Information on unpublished interventions was derived from sources outside of academic documents (e.g. annual reports and personal communications). Snowball sampling was used to reach as many projects as possible, starting from interventions in Johannesburg, which is the most populous city and economic centre of South Africa. Fifty published reports and 75 unpublished reports were reviewed. The information from each report was entered on a spreadsheet according to the aspects of schooling the intervention addressed. The data were then summarised using descriptive statistics and graphs. Conclusions Evidence from the review suggests that in the South African context, where access and equity in education are yet to be achieved for the majority of the population, value for money' is achieved most effectively when there is connectedness' across sectors (especially education, health and social services), and when value is in terms of gains for the whole of society or the common good.

(2) Is the relationship between such trust and students' Civic Knowledge contingent on the extent of corruption in their country, on how effective the government appears to be, and on standards of living, health and education? (3) Are students with better Civic Knowledge' more supportive than others of Equal Rights for all Ethnic Groups' and Gender Equality' and do they have higher Expected Adult Electoral Participation'? The answer to question (1) is NO'. To questions (2) and (3), the answers are YES'. The findings fit the explanation that better knowledge promotes more rationally based civic attitudes.

Most analyses of NCDs have used self-reported data, which is biased by differential access to healthcare services between groups of different socioeconomic status (SES). We sought to compare self-reported diagnoses versus standardised measures of NCD prevalence across SES groups in India. Methods: We calculated age-adjusted prevalence rates of common NCDs from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. We compared self-reported diagnoses to standardized measures of disease for five NCDs. We calculated wealth-related and education-related disparities in NCD prevalence by calculating concentration index (C), which ranges from -1 to +1 (concentration of disease among lower and higher SES groups, respectively). Findings: NCD prevalence was higher (range 5.2 to 19.1%) for standardised measures than self-reported diagnoses (range 3.1 to 9.4%). Several NCDs were particularly concentrated among higher SES groups according to self-reported diagnoses (C-srd) but were concentrated either among lower SES groups or showed no strong socioeconomic gradient using standardized measures (C-sm): age-standardised wealth-related C: angina C-srd 0.02 vs. C-sm -0.17; asthma and lung diseases C-srd -0.05 vs. C-sm -0.04 (age-standardised education-related C-srd 0.04 vs. C-sm -0.05); vision problems C-srd 0.07 vs. C-sm -0.05; depression C-srd 0.07 vs. C-sm -0.13. Indicating similar trends of standardized measures detecting more cases among low SES, concentration of hypertension declined among higher SES (C-srd 0.19 vs. C-sm 0.03). Conclusions: The socio-economic patterning of NCD prevalence differs markedly when assessed by standardized criteria versus self-reported diagnoses. NCDs in India are not necessarily diseases of affluence but also of poverty, indicating likely under-diagnosis and under-reporting of diseases among the poor. Standardized measures should be used, wherever feasible, to estimate the true prevalence of NCDs.

The development of effective anti-HPV vaccines, included in the portfolio of recommended vaccinations for any given community, led to the consolidation in many countries of immunization programs to prevent HPV-related cervical cancers. In recent years, increasing evidence in epidemiology and molecular biology have supported the oncogenic role of HPV in the development of other neoplasm including condylomas and penile, anal, vulvar, vaginal, and oro-pharyngeal cancers. Men play a key role in the paradigm of HPV infection: both as patients and as part of the mechanisms of transmission. Data show they are affected almost as often as women. Moreover, no screening procedures for HPV-related disease prevention are applied in men, who fail to undergo routine medical testing by any medical specialist at all. They also do not benefit from government prevention strategies. Discussion: A panel of experts convened to focus on scientific, medical, and economic studies, and on the achievements from health organizations' intervention programs on the matter. One of the goals was to discuss on the critical issues emerging from the ongoing global implementation of HPV vaccination. A second goal was to identify contributions which could overcome the barriers that impede or delay effective vaccination programs whose purpose is to eradicate the HPV infection both in women and men. Summary: The reviewed studies on the natural history of HPV infection and related diseases in women and men, the increasing experience of HPV vaccination in women, the analysis of clinical effectiveness vs economic efficacy of HPV vaccination, are even more supportive of the economic sustainability of vaccination programs both in women and men. Those achievements address increasing and needed attention to the issue of social equity in healthcare for both genders.

Methods: We used data from the 2011 and 2000 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey and the Global Burden of Disease study 2010, and the MODMATCH modified logit life table system developed by the World Health Organization to model mortality rates, life expectancy, and length of life for Ethiopian population groups stratified by wealth quintiles, gender and residence. We then estimated and compared within-group and between-group inequality in length of life using the Gini index and absolute length of life inequality. Results: Length of life inequality has decreased and life expectancy has increased for all population groups between 2000 and 2011. Length of life inequality within wealth quintiles is about three times larger than the between-group inequality of 9 years. Total length of life inequality in Ethiopia was 27.6 years in 2011. Conclusion: Longevity has increased and the distribution of health in Ethiopia is more equal in 2011 than 2000, with length of life inequality reduced for all population groups. Still there is considerable potential for further improvement. In the Ethiopian context with a poor and highly rural population, inequality in length of life within wealth quintiles is considerably larger than between them. This suggests that other factors than wealth substantially contribute to total health inequality in Ethiopia and that identification and quantification of these factors will be important for identifying proper measures to further reduce length of life inequality.

J	Devaux, M; Sassi, F				Devaux, Marion; Sassi, Franco			Social inequalities in obesity and overweight in 11 OECD countries	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						International comparison; obesity; socio-economic inequalities	BODY-MASS INDEX; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; HEALTH	Background: Evidence of inequalities in obesity and overweight is available mostly from national studies. This article provides a broad international comparison of inequalities by education level and socio-economic status, in men and women and over time. Methods: Data from national health surveys of 11 OECD countries were used. The size of inequalities was assessed on the basis of absolute and relative inequality indexes. A regression-analysis approach was used to assess differences between social groups in trends over time. Results: Of the countries examined, USA and England had the highest rates of obesity and overweight. Large social inequalities were consistently detected in all countries, especially in women. Absolute inequalities were largest in Hungary and Spain with a difference of 11.6 and 10% in obesity rates in men, and 18.3 and 18.9% in women, respectively, across the education spectrum. Relative inequalities were largest in France and Sweden with poorly educated men 3.2 and 2.8 times as likely to be obese as men with the highest education (18 and 17 times for women in Spain and Korea, respectively). Pro-poor inequalities in overweight were observed for men in USA, Canada, Korea, Hungary, Australia and England. Inequalities remained virtually stable during the last 15 years, with only small variations in England, Korea, Italy and France. Conclusion: Large and persistent social inequalities in obesity and overweight by education level and socio-economic status exist in OECD countries. These are consistently larger in women than in men.

There is growing recognition of the need to adopt effective, evidence-based strategies for working with young offenders. Music interventions may be particularly well suited to addressing risk factors in young people and reducing juvenile crime. This systematic review of international research seeks to contribute to the evidence base on the impact of music making on the health, well-being and behaviour of young offenders and those considered at risk of offending. It examines outcomes of music making identified in quantitative research and discusses theories from qualitative research that might help to understand the impact of music making in youth justice settings.

Methods The authors surveyed opinions among adult smokers in two survey waves (N=1376 and N=923) from the New Zealand arm of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey during 2007-2009. The authors report prevalence of support stratified by age, gender and ethnicity. The authors carried out multivariate analyses to identify significant associations among potential determinants (demographics, socioeconomic status, mental health and smoking-related beliefs and behaviours) of support. Results Most New Zealand smokers supported greater regulation of the tobacco industry (65%) and more government action on tobacco (59%). Around half (46%) supported banning sales of cigarettes in 10 years time, provided effective nicotine substitutes were available. In a fully adjusted model, significant associations with support for greater tobacco company regulation included Maori ethnicity, experience of financial stress and greater awareness about the harms of smoking. Significant associations with support for a ban on tobacco sales in 10 years time included increasing area-based deprivation level, increasing intention to quit and greater concern about the health effects of smoking. Conclusions The findings suggest that most smokers will support stronger government action to control the tobacco industry and that many support radical 'endgame' approaches. Greater support among Maori, more deprived and possibly Pacific smokers, is an important finding, which could inform the design and implementation of new policies given the very high smoking prevalence among these groups and hence high priority for targeted tobacco control interventions. Perceived difficulties in gaining public support should not impede the introduction of rigorous tobacco control measures needed to achieve a tobacco-free New Zealand.

Three leadership hubs were purposefully convened and included small groups of people (6-10) from diverse HIV and AIDS stakeholder groups in Jamaica: frontline nurses and nurse managers in primary and secondary care settings; researchers; health care decision makers; and other community members. People living with HIV or AIDS were among the hub members. Using a relational public health ethics framework, we outline some of the ethical challenges and opportunities experienced by the research team and the leadership hubs. Data included research assistant field notes and hub progress reports. Emerging ethical concerns were associated with relational personhood, social justice, relational autonomy, relational solidarity, and sustainability of the hub activities.

Consistency of risk factors and incidence rates for a measure of victimisation-related injury in different countries with similar access to healthcare services would provide indirect evidence for measure validity. Methods: Cohorts were derived from hospital administrative data for children aged less than 18 years who were admitted for acute injury to hospitals in England or Western Australia (WA) in 2000 to 2008. We compared the effects of age, sex and deprivation on the annual incidence of acute admission for VR injury defined by a cluster of ICD-10 codes reflecting characteristics that should alert clinicians to consider victimisation as a cause of injury. Four subcategories comprised codes specifically indicating child maltreatment, assault, undetermined cause, or adverse social circumstances. Results: The incidence of VR injury followed a similar 'J'-shaped association with age in both countries with increasing rates from 10 years onwards and peaks in infancy and in 16-17 year-olds. In both countries, rates increased with deprivation. Girls had lower rates than boys except in the 11-15 age group where girls had higher rates than boys in WA but not in England. Adjusted incidence rates were similar in both countries for children aged 3 to 15 years old, but were higher in WA compared with England in children under 3 years old and in those aged 16-17 years. Higher rates in WA in 16-17 year-olds were explained by more admissions coded for the subcategories of adverse social circumstances, and to a lesser extent, assault, than in England. Children less than 3 years old were more often coded specifically for maltreatment in WA than in England. Conclusions: The similarities in risk factors and in the adjusted rates of victimisation-related injury admission in both countries suggest that the VR cluster of ICD-10 codes is measuring a similar underlying problem. Differential use of coding subcategories highlights the need to use the entire VR cluster for comparisons across settings.

J	Halleröd, B				Hallerod, Bjorn			Gender inequality from beyond the grave: intra-household distribution and wellbeing after spousal loss	AGEING & SOCIETY			English	Article						bereavement; gender; inequality; intra-household; longitudinal; wellbeing; widow; widower	OLDER-ADULTS; PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT; BEREAVEMENT; QUALITY; MONEY; PREDICTORS; WIDOWHOOD; COUPLES; HEALTH; IMPACT	The present article integrates research on spousal loss among older people and research on intra-household income distribution and relates pre-loss intra-household distribution of incomes to post-loss wellbeing. Data are drawn from the Swedish Panel Survey of Ageing and the Elderly (PSAE) and consist of couples that were married in the mid-1990s (N = 1,503) and that were either still married (N = 1,262) or who had experienced spousal loss (N = 241) in 2002-03. The results showed that large intra-household pre-loss income differences increased the occurrence of psycho-social problems among both widows and widowers. Hence, unequal intra-household distribution of resources makes the coping process harder for both men and women. It was also shown that unequal pre-loss distribution of incomes affected a measure of global wellbeing among widowers. Widows suffered to a greater degree from economic difficulties, but these difficulties were not related to pre- loss distribution of incomes. Thus, the overall results showed that a gendered labour market that generates an unequal intra- household distribution of incomes has repercussions not only for gender equality among intact households, but also for the coping process of both widows and widowers.

In the present study, we sought to broaden understanding of disposable income on adolescent smoking behaviors via both absolute and relative perspectives in the school context. Methods: We obtained data from the 2010 Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) in Taiwan. Information concerning sociodemographics, disposable income, smoking history, and contextual smoking exposure (e.g., school) were assessed via self-report. Recent-onset smokers were defined as those who had their first cigarette within two years of the survey. Complex survey and multilevel analyses were carried out to estimate association. Results: Adolescents with higher monthly disposable income were 2 similar to 5 times more likely to start smoking and become regular smokers. Having the least disposable income in a class appeared linked with increased risk of tobacco initiation by 40% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%-91%). Pupils' odds to start smoking were lowered to .70 when the majority of schoolmates had low disposable income (95% CI: .51-.99). Conclusions: Adolescent risk of smoking initiation may be differentially affected by individual- and contextual-level absolute and relative disposable income. Future research is needed to delineate possible mechanisms underlying unfavorable health behaviors associated with disposable incomes in early adolescence.

This is also true in low resource settings, where electronic communication provides an opportunity for sharing information about health and wellbeing and enhancing learning for healthcare professionals. Methods: A qualitative study whereby 51 year 3 and 4 student nurses at the University of Nairobi participated in 5 focus group discussions. Data were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a framework approach. Results: Four main themes were identified, 'moving with the times', 'global networking', 'inequity as a barrier' and 'transfer of internet learning into practice'. Conclusions: Information technology is already integral to students' lives both personally and professionally and the students had a strong desire to find out what is happening globally. The familiarity of the internet contributes to the acceptance of e-learning programs as part of educational curricula. Students felt that e-learning 'is here to stay' and wanted to 'embrace the concept.' E-learning was generally welcomed however students suggested that it should be 'supplementary' to face-to-face learning. In order to incorporate e-learning ethically in low resource settings, resources should be sustainable, for example CDROMs and DVDs which are not dependant on internet access. Researching the views of qualified midwives might be the next step in promoting this valuable teaching method. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Gender Equity and Health: Evaluating the Impact of Millennium Development Goal Three on Women's Health in South Asia	WOMEN & HEALTH			English	Article						gender; equity; equality; health; education; employment; government		Background: Researchers evaluated the progress of Millennium Development Goal Three, which promotes gender equity and empowering women, by assessing the targets for education, employment, and government, and their relation to women's health in South Asia. Methods: Researchers obtained data from the United Nations, Inter-Parliamentary Union, International Labor Organization, World Bank, and World Health Organization. First, they performed a literature review including manuscripts that quantified a Millenium Development Goal Three outcome in South Asia and were published after 1991. They derived women's health outcomes from World Health Organization databases. Spearman's rank test was used to evaluate the relationship between change in gender parity and change in women's health outcomes. Results: South Asia's average primary education Gender Parity Index (defined as the ratio of girls to boys enrolled in primary, secondary, and tertiary education and expressed as a value between 0 and 1.0) improved from 0.73 (SD 0.34) to 0.92 (SD 0.13) between 2000 and 2008. Secondary and tertiary education had a lower Gender Parity Index (average 2008 Gender Parity Index 0.87 (SD 0.21) and 0.59 (SD 0.23), respectively), but had also improved from 2000 (average Gender Parity Index = 0.77, SD 0.38) to 2008 (average Gender Parity Index = 0.52, SD 0.11). An average proportion of 22.1% (SD 12.58) of women participated in waged, non-agricultural employment and 16.6% (SD 10.3) in national parliaments. No clear association was found between change in gender equity and women's health in South Asia between 2000 and 2008. Conclusion: Some progress has been made toward gender equity in South Asia, although the results have been mixed and inequities persist, especially in employment and government. While gender equity does not appear to have been related to female health outcomes, both must be addressed simultaneously as priority development targets and remain prerequisites to achieving the overall Millennium Development Goals.

J	Fox, M; Thomson, M				Fox, Marie; Thomson, Michael			REALISING SOCIAL JUSTICE IN PUBLIC HEALTH LAW	MEDICAL LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Public Health Law; Social Justice; Gender; Capabilities Approach; HIV; AIDS; Right to Health	MALE CIRCUMCISION; HIV PREVENTION; GENDER; HIV/AIDS; POLITICS; EQUITY; WOMEN; AIDS; MEN	Law has played an important, but largely constitutive, role in the development of the public health enterprise. Thus, law has been central to setting up the institutions and offices of public health. The moral agenda has, however, been shaped to a much greater extent by bioethics. While social justice has been placed at the heart of this agenda, we argue that there has been little place within dominant conceptions of social justice for gender equity and womens interests which we see as crucial to a fully realised vision of social justice. We argue that, aside from particular interventions in the field of reproduction, public health practice tends to marginalise womenua claim we support by critically examining strategies to combat the HIV pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. To counter the marginalisation of womens interests, this article argues that Amartya Sens capabilities approach has much to contribute to the framing of public health law and policy. Sens approach provides an evaluative and normative framework which recognises the importance of both gender and health equity to achieving social justice. We suggest that domestic law and international human rights provisions, in particular the emerging human right to health, offer mechanisms to promote capabilities, and foster a robust and inclusive conception of social justice.

Method: Generic literature on measurement methods and the more specialised literature on application of the ICF over the last decade inform the consideration of these questions. The context of recording or measurement is examined, including the moral and legal framework of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and the technical framework of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Results: Whatever the setting in which describing, recording or measuring is being undertaken - in policy development, service planning and management, clinical management or population health monitoring - determining the purpose is the key starting point. Purpose (why) frames the consideration of content (what), method (how) and source (who). Many generic measurement methods can be applied in the disability field, but there are challenges particular to the field. The perspectives of people with disabilities and "patients" require consideration, especially with the trend to person-centred care and the social justice principles emanating from the UNCRPD. Conclusions: Considering these basic questions is a pre-requisite to meaningful recording and measurement of functioning and disability. Future challenges include: incorporating environmental factors into measurement; setting thresholds on the disability spectrum; and combining the views of the person concerned with those of various professionals.

However, service area analysis, typically, employs arbitrary travel-distance thresholds. Through this study we provide an empirical investigation into the durations and distances that respondents are willing to travel in order to engage in various sports and recreation activities. This research uses time-diary data, augmented with global positioning system information, to investigate individually based and objectively measured travel thresholds (which define travelsheds) for various sports and recreation activities in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Results accord with national time-diary data, and indicate that duration-based and distance-based travelsheds are generally in the order of 15-30 minutes and 4-20 km, respectively. Georeferenced time-diary data provide unique insights into travel thresholds, which may be used to help improve accessibility and thereby increase the frequency and duration of physical activity engagement.

Design Review of literature on brand segmentation. Analysis of 1999-2009 data to explore the extent to which tax increases are shifted to consumers, if this differs by brand segment and whether cigarette price indices accurately reflect cigarette prices. Setting UK. Participants UK smokers. Measurements Real cigarette prices, volumes and net-of-tax- revenue by price segment. Findings TTCs categorise brands into four price segments: premium, economy, mid and ultra-low price' (ULP). TTCs have sold ULP brands since 2006; since then, their real price has remained virtually static and market share doubled. The price gap between premium and ULP brands is increasing because the industry differentially shifts tax increases between brand segments; while, on average, taxes are overshifted, taxes on ULP brands are not always fully passed onto consumers (being absorbed at the point each year when tobacco taxes increase). Price indices reflect the price of premium brands only and fail to detect these problems. Conclusions Industry-initiated cigarette price changes in the UK appear timed to accentuate the price gap between premium and ULP brands. Increasing the prices of more expensive cigarettes on top of tobacco tax increases should benefit public health, but the growing price gap enables smokers to downtrade to cheaper tobacco products and may explain smoking-related inequalities. Governments must monitor cigarette prices by price segment and consider industry pricing strategies in setting tobacco tax policies.

GENES AND NUTRITION			English	Review						Personalized nutrition; Ethics; Food; Health		In personalized nutrition, food is a tool for good health, implying an instrumental relationship between food and health. Food receives a secondary value, while health would appear to be a descriptive biological concept. This article gives an introduction to cultural understandings of food and health. The wider definition of food and health is explored in relation to the commonly used scientific approach that tends to take a more reductionist approach to food and health. The different discourses on food and health are being discussed in relation to ethical aspects of personalized nutrition. The success of personalized nutrition is likely dependent upon the ability to integrate the scientific approach with everyday cultural, emotional, ethical, and sensual understandings of food. Health theories can be divided into two principal rival types-biostatistical and holistic. Biostatistical focuses on survival, while holistic focuses on ability as a precondition for health. Arguments in favor of a holistic and individualistic theory of health and illness are presented. This implies a focus on the ability of the individual to realize his or her "vital goals." A holistic and individualistic health concept may have a reinforcing effect on the individualized approach in personalized nutrition. It allows focus on individual health premises and related dietary means of health promotion, as well as an individualized perspective on the objectives of health promotion. An individualistic notion of health also indicates that people with high levels of vital goals benefit more easily. To reach beyond these groups is likely difficult. This potential injustice should be balanced with global preventive medical programs.

Methods We compared growth data of 4-year-old to 6-year-old children born 1997-2002 in UK (n = 15 168), Sweden (n = 6749) and rural China (n = 10 327). SD scores (SDS) were calculated against the WHO Growth Standard. Obesity and overweight were defined by the International Obesity Taskforce cut-offs, and stunting, underweight and thinness by height, weight or body mass index (BMI)<-2 SDS. Associations with maternal education were standardised by calculating the Slope Index of Inequality (SII). Results Mean SDS height, weight and BMI in the UK (-0.01, 0.42, 0.62, respectively) and Sweden (0.45, 0.59, 0.45) were higher than in China (-0.98, -0.82, -0.29). Higher maternal education was consistently associated with taller offspring height SDS (SII: UK 0.25; Sweden 0.17; China 1.06). Underweight and stunting were less common in the UK (prevalence: 0.6% and 2.2%, respectively) and Sweden (0.3% and 0.6%) than in China (9.5% and 16.4%), where these outcomes were inversely associated with maternal education (SII: -25.8% and -12.7%). Obesity prevalence in the UK, Sweden and China was 4.8%, 3.7% and 0.4%, respectively. Maternal education was inversely associated with offspring obesity in the UK (SII: -3.3%) and Sweden (-2.8%), but not in China (+0.3%). Conclusions Higher maternal education was associated with more favourable growth in young children: lower obesity and overweight in the UK and Sweden, and lower stunting and underweight in rural China. Public health strategies to optimise growth in early childhood need to acknowledge socioeconomic factors, but possibly with a different emphasis in different settings.

This article describes how the provision of ancillary care can link international clinical research to the reduction of global health disparities. It identifies the ancillary care obligations supported by a theory of global justice, showing that Jennifer Ruger's health capability paradigm requires the delivery of ancillary care to trial participants for a limited subset of conditions that cause severe morbidity and mortality. Empirical research on the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit's (SMRU) vivax malaria treatment trial was then undertaken to demonstrate whether and how these obligations might be upheld in a resource-poor setting. Our findings show that fulfilment of the ancillary care obligations is feasible where there is commitment from chief investigators and funders and is strongly facilitated by SMRU's dual role as a research unit and medical non-governmental organization.

J	Maes, K; Kalofonos, I				Maes, Kenneth; Kalofonos, Ippolytos			Becoming and remaining community health workers: Perspectives from Ethiopia and Mozambique	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Community health workers; Volunteers; HIV/AIDS; Ethiopia; Mozambique; Motivations; Care relationships	ADDIS-ABABA; SOUTHERN AFRICA; HIV/AIDS CARE; FOOD-PRICES; VOLUNTEER; AIDS; PROGRAMS; SUSTAINABILITY; INTERVENTIONS; PERCEPTIONS	Many global health practitioners are currently reaffirming the importance of recruiting and retaining effective community health workers (CHWs) in order to achieve major public health goals. This raises policy-relevant questions about why people become and remain CHWs. This paper addresses these questions, drawing on ethnographic work in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, between 2006 and 2009, and in Chimoio, a provincial town in central Mozambique, between 2003 and 2010. Participant observation and in-depth interviews were used to understand the life histories that lead people to become CHWs, their relationships with intended beneficiaries after becoming CHWs, and their social and economic aspirations. People in Ethiopia and Mozambique have faced similar political and economic challenges in the last few decades, involving war, structural adjustment, and food price inflation. Results suggest that these challenges, as well as the socio-moral values that people come to uphold through the example of parents and religious communities, influence why and how men and women become CHWs. Relationships with intended beneficiaries strongly influence why people remain CHWs, and why some may come to experience frustration and distress. There are complex reasons why CHWs come to seek greater compensation, including desires to escape poverty and to materially support families and other community members, a sense of deservingness given the emotional and social work involved in maintaining relationships with beneficiaries, and inequity vis-A-vis higher-salaried elites. Ethnographic work is needed to engage CHWs in the policy process, help shape new standards for CHW programs based on rooting out social and economic inequities, and develop appropriate solutions to complex CHW policy problems.

J	Fredrickson, A				Fredrickson, Angie			The California Coastal Act and Ports: The Unintended Environmental Justice Implications of Preserving California's Coastline	COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						California Coastal Act; Coastal Zone Management Act; environmental justice; Port of Long Beach; ports		Consistent with the policies set forth in the Coastal Zone Management Act, the California Coastal Act seeks to balance the utilization and conservation of coastal resources, taking into account the social and economic needs of the citizens of California. One way the statute pursues this balance is through its provisions for ports. These provisions have functioned as a type of smart growth planning for ports, encouraging densification of existing port districts and possibly averting maritime commercial and industrial sprawl along the California coast. One unintended consequence of the encouraged consolidation of port activities, when combined with the rapid growth in international trade over the last four decades, has been disproportionally large environmental and health impacts on low-income and minority communities surrounding ports. This article examines how the Port of Long Beach's conformance with the California Coastal Act has resulted in ongoing environmental justice concerns. It discusses approaches employed by the Port of Long Beach to reduce environmental justice concerns resulting from significant and unavoidable environmental impacts and offers suggestions for how to address this issue.

J	Margolis, R; Myrskylä, M				Margolis, Rachel; Myrskylae, Mikko			Family, money, and health: Regional differences in the determinants of life satisfaction over the life course	ADVANCES IN LIFE COURSE RESEARCH			English	Article						Life satisfaction; Life cycle; Subjective well-being; Cross-national; Aging	HAPPINESS; FERTILITY; INEQUALITY; CHILDREN	We examine how family, money, and health explain variation in life satisfaction over the life cycle across seven global regions using data from the World Values Survey. With a life domain approach, we study whether the importance of the life domains varies by region and age groups and whether the variation explained by each factor is due to the magnitude or prevalence of each factor. Globally, family, money, and health explain a substantial fraction of life satisfaction, increasing from 12 percent in young adulthood to 15 percent in mature adulthood. Health is the most important factor, and its importance increases with age. Income is unimportant above age 50. Remarkably, the contribution of family is small across ages. Across regions health is most important in the wealthier, and income in the poorer regions of the world. Family explains a substantial fraction of life satisfaction only in Western Europe and Anglophone countries. Findings highlight that the population-level importance of family, money, and health in explaining variation in life satisfaction across regions is mainly attributable to the individual-level life satisfaction differences between people of different statuses rather than differences in the distribution of various states such as poor health across regions.

J	Barclay, L				Barclay, Linda			Cognitive Impairment and the Right to Vote: A Strategic Approach	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY			English	Article							JUSTICE; PEOPLE	Most democratic countries either limit or deny altogether voting rights for people with cognitive impairments or mental health conditions. Against this weight of legal and practical exclusion, disability advocacy and developments in international human rights law increasingly push in the direction of full voting rights for people with cognitive impairments. Particularly influential has been the adoption by the UN of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007. Article 29 declares that states must ensure that persons with disabilities can effectively and fully participate in political and public life on an equal basis with others, directly or through freely chosen representatives, including the right and opportunity for persons with disabilities to vote and be elected'. This article also argues for the right of all people to vote, including people with cognitive impairments, by adopting a uniquely strategic approach. Firstly, some of the strategic limitations of existing arguments in favour of extending the franchise are highlighted. Most such arguments are flawed because they run the risk of inviting disparaging philosophical commentary which compares disabled people to animals, or because they are based on implausible empirical claims, or because they inadvertently tie the case for voting rights for the disabled to other cases unlikely to ever enjoy widespread acceptance. This article, instead, justifies extending voting rights to all people with cognitive impairments based on a simple cost-benefit analysis that avoids all of these problems.

The study makes several crucial distinctions. First, it distinguishes subjective status in one's community and subjective status in the United States generally, thereby exploring differences between the local and global meanings of incarceration. Second, it distinguishes crime, arrest, and incarceration, thereby exploring the added effects of contact with the criminal justice system, apart from offending. The results reveal that contact with the criminal justice system results in progressively lower status: those who committed a crime report lower subjective status than those who did not, those who were arrested report lower status than those who only committed a crime, and those who were incarcerated report lower status than those who were only arrested. Although these differences along the crime-to-sentencing continuum are strong, the effects of crime, arrest, and incarceration are, if anything, even stronger among African Americans than whites. The results also suggest that the effects of incarceration are similar to if not greater than those of other stigmatizing statuses, including having spent time in a psychiatric hospital. The effects of arrest and incarceration are not driven entirely by the social or economic consequences of incarceration, although these consequences further deflate subjective status among former inmates.

J	Chakraborty, NM; Firestone, R; Bellows, N				Chakraborty, Nirali M.; Firestone, Rebecca; Bellows, Nicole			Equity monitoring for social marketing: use of wealth quintiles and the concentration index for decision making in HIV prevention, family planning, and malaria programs	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							CHILD; INEQUALITIES; EXPANSION; AFRICA	Background: The majority of social marketing programs are intended to reach the poor. It is therefore essential that social marketing organizations monitor the health equity of their programs and improve targeting when the poor are not being reached. Current measurement approaches are often insufficient for decision making because they fail to show a program's ability to reach the poor and demonstrate progress over time. Further, effective program equity metrics should be benchmarked against a national reference population and consider exposure, not just health outcomes, to measure direct results of implementation. This study compares two measures of health equity, concentration indices and wealth quintiles, using a defined reference population, and considers benefits of both measures together to inform programmatic decision making. Methods: Three datasets from recent cross-sectional behavioral surveys on malaria, HIV, and family planning from Nepal and Burkina Faso were used to calculate concentration indices and wealth quintiles. Each sample was standardized to national wealth distributions based on recent Demographic and Health Surveys. Wealth quintiles were generated and concentration indices calculated for health outcomes and program exposure in each sample. Chi-square and t-tests were used to assess statistical significance of results. Results: Reporting wealth quintiles showed that recipients of Population Services International (PSI) interventions were wealthier than national populations. Both measures indicated that desirable health outcomes were usually concentrated among wealthier populations. Positive and significant concentration indices in all three surveys indicated that wealth and program exposure were correlated; however this relationship was not necessarily linear. In analyzing the equity of modern contraceptive use stratified by exposure to family planning messages in Nepal, the outcome was equitable (concentration index = 0.006, p = 0.68) among the exposed, while the wealthy were more likely to use modern contraceptives (concentration index = 0.071, p < 0.01) among the unexposed. Conclusions: Using wealth quintiles and concentration indices together for equity monitoring improves usability of findings for decision making. Applying both metrics, and analyzing equity of exposure along with health outcomes, provides results that have statistical and programmatic significance. Benchmarking equity data against national data improves generalizability. This approach benefits social marketers and global health implementers to improve strategic decision making and programs' ability to reach the poor.

A common coding system and standards for the description of services are needed to allow local data to be incorporated into evidence-informed policy, and to permit equity and mobility to be assessed. The aim of this project has been to design such a classification and a related tool for the coding of services for Long Term Care (DESDE-LTC), based on the European Service Mapping Schedule (ESMS). Methods: The development of DESDE-LTC followed an iterative process using nominal groups in 6 European countries. 54 researchers and stakeholders in health and social services contributed to this process. In order to classify services, we use the minimal organization unit or "Basic Stable Input of Care" (BSIC), coded by its principal function or "Main Type of Care" (MTC). The evaluation of the tool included an analysis of feasibility, consistency, ontology, inter-rater reliability, Boolean Factor Analysis, and a preliminary impact analysis (screening, scoping and appraisal). Results: DESDE-LTC includes an alpha-numerical coding system, a glossary and an assessment instrument for mapping and counting LTC. It shows high feasibility, consistency, inter-rater reliability and face, content and construct validity. DESDE-LTC is ontologically consistent. It is regarded by experts as useful and relevant for evidence-informed decision making. Conclusion: DESDE-LTC contributes to establishing a common terminology, taxonomy and coding of LTC services in a European context, and a standard procedure for data collection and international comparison.

J	Mussa, AH; Pfeiffer, J; Gloyd, SS; Sherr, K				Mussa, Abdul H.; Pfeiffer, James; Gloyd, Stephen S.; Sherr, Kenneth			Vertical funding, non-governmental organizations, and health system strengthening: perspectives of public sector health workers in Mozambique	HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH			English	Article						Brain drain; Africa; Health sector; Aid effectiveness; Vertical disease programming; HIV/AIDS; Ministry of health; Non-governmental organizations; PEPFAR	DANGERS; AFRICA; ACCESS; WORLD	Background: In the rapid scale-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment, many donors have chosen to channel their funds to non-governmental organizations and other private partners rather than public sector systems. This approach has reinforced a private sector, vertical approach to addressing the HIV epidemic. As progress on stemming the epidemic has stalled in some areas, there is a growing recognition that overall health system strengthening, including health workforce development, will be essential to meet AIDS treatment goals. Mozambique has experienced an especially dramatic increase in disease-specific support over the last eight years. We explored the perspectives and experiences of key Mozambican public sector health managers who coordinate, implement, and manage the myriad donor-driven projects and agencies. Methods: Over a four-month period, we conducted 41 individual qualitative interviews with key Ministry workers at three levels in the Mozambique national health system, using open-ended semi-structured interview guides. We also reviewed planning documents. Results: All respondents emphasized the value and importance of international aid and vertical funding to the health sector and each highlighted program successes that were made possible by recent increased aid flows. However, three serious concerns emerged: 1) difficulties coordinating external resources and challenges to local control over the use of resources channeled to international private organizations; 2) inequalities created within the health system produced by vertical funds channeled to specific services while other sectors remain under-resourced; and 3) the exodus of health workers from the public sector health system provoked by large disparities in salaries and work. Conclusions: The Ministry of Health attempted to coordinate aid by implementing a "sector-wide approach" to bring the partners together in setting priorities, harmonizing planning, and coordinating support. Only 14% of overall health sector funding was channeled through this coordinating process by 2008, however. The vertical approach starved the Ministry of support for its administrative functions. The exodus of health workers from the public sector to international and private organizations emerged as the issue of greatest concern to the managers and health workers interviewed. Few studies have addressed the growing phenomenon of "internal brain drain" in Africa which proved to be of greater concern to Mozambique's health managers.

An ethical framework for the prevention of overweight and obesity: a tool for thinking through a programme's ethical aspects	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; STIGMA; INTERVENTIONS; PREVALENCE; ADULTS; TRENDS	Introduction: It is important to be aware of the ethical pitfalls in programmes to prevent overweight and obesity, such as stigmatization, blaming the victim and reinforcement of health inequalities. In this article, we present an ethical framework for facilitating a structured analysis to the extent to which a programme prevents overweight or obesity is ethically acceptable. Methods: First, we made an inventory of ethical issues in programmes to prevent overweight and obesity. Secondly, we studied the available ethical frameworks that address the area of public health. Finally, we designed an ethical framework for the prevention of overweight and obesity, which was tested in two international workshops. Results: At the heart of the framework is a list of eight questions on the morally relevant features of a programme: its effects on physical health, psychosocial well-being, informed choice, cultural values, equality, privacy, responsibility and liberty. Answering these questions provides a map of the potential ethical pitfalls of a specific programme. This mapping should be followed by a structured discussion of the arguments and their importance, and the decision whether, and if so under what conditions, the programme should be implemented. Conclusion: Considering the ethical aspects of the programmes to prevent obesity or overweight is extremely important in the face of the urgent and extensive health problem of overweight and obesity. Our framework is a practical tool for systematic ethical evaluation. It is applicable to a broad range of programmes in different stages of development and implementation.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of country-level characteristics and individual socio-economic status (SES) on individual alcohol consumption in 33 countries. Methods: Data on 101 525 men and women collected by cross-sectional surveys in 33 countries of the GENACIS study were used. Individual SES was measured by highest attained educational level. Alcohol use measures included drinking status and monthly risky single occasion drinking (RSOD). The relationship between individuals' education and drinking indicators was examined by meta-analysis. In a second step the individual level data and country data were combined and tested in multilevel models. As country level indicators we used the Purchasing Power Parity of the gross national income, the Gini coefficient and the Gender Gap Index. Results: For both genders and all countries higher individual SES was positively associated with drinking status. Also higher country level SES was associated with higher proportions of drinkers. Lower SES was associated with RSOD among men. Women of higher SES in low income countries were more often RSO drinkers than women of lower SES. The opposite was true in higher income countries. Conclusion: For the most part, findings regarding SES and drinking in higher income countries were as expected. However, women of higher SES in low and middle income countries appear at higher risk of engaging in RSOD. This finding should be kept in mind when developing new policy and prevention initiatives.

The first study, based on responses from 262 German residents, found that participants with a strong personal belief in a just world perceived a lower economic impact in light of price increases following a tax increase. This effect remained stable after controlling for the socioeconomic variables of gender, age, household income, and education. The second study, based on a sample of 177 German residents, found that residents with a strong personal belief in a just world perceived a lower economic impact in light of the global subprime mortgage crisis. Again, this effect remained stable after controlling for the socioeconomic variables of gender, age, household income, and education. Furthermore, the personal belief in a just world influenced perceived economic impact over time and the relationship between personal belief in a just world and perceived economic impact was partially mediated by differences between life satisfaction in the future as measured in a first wave and current life satisfaction as measured in a second wave.

Quality of life of Bahraini women with breast cancer: a cross sectional study	BMC CANCER			English	Article						Breast cancer; Bahrain; Quality of life; Bahraini women; Middle East; EORTC	EUROPEAN-ORGANIZATION; EORTC QLQ-C30; HEALTH-CARE; DIAGNOSIS; SURVIVORS; AGE; POPULATION; ADJUSTMENT; TRIAL	Background: Breast cancer can impact survivors in many aspects of their life. Scarce information is currently available on the quality of life of cancer survivors in Bahrain. The objective of this study is to describe the quality of life of Bahraini women with breast cancer and its association with their sociodemographic and clinical data. Methods: This is a cross sectional study in which the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Cancer Specific version translated into Arabic was administered to a random sample of 337 Bahraini women with breast cancer. Relevant descriptive statistics were computed for all items. The equality of means across the categories of each categorical independent variable was tested using parametric tests (ANOVA and independent t-test) or non-parametric tests (Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney tests) of association where appropriate. Results: Of the total sample, 239 consented to participation. The mean and median age of participants were 50.2 (SD +/- 11.1) and 48.0 respectively. Participants had a mean score for global health of 63.9 (95% CI 61.21-66.66). Among functional scales, social functioning scored the highest (Mean 77.5 [95% CI 73.65-81.38]) whereas emotional functioning scored the lowest (63.4 [95% CI 59.12-67.71]). The most distressing symptom on the symptom scales was fatigability (Mean 35.2 [95% CI 31.38-39.18]). Using the disease specific tool it was found that sexual functioning scored the lowest (Mean 25.9 [95% CI 70.23-77.90]). On the symptom scale, upset due to hair loss scored the highest (Mean 46.3 [95% CI 37.82-54.84]). Significant mean differences were noted for many functional and symptom scales. Conclusion: Bahraini breast cancer survivors reported favorable overall global quality of life. Factors associated with a major reduction in all domains of quality of life included the presence of metastases, having had a mastectomy as opposed to a lumpectomy and a shorter time elapsed since diagnosis. Poorest functioning was noted in the emotional and sexual domains. The most bothersome symptoms were fatigability, upset due to hair loss and arm symptoms. This study identifies the categories of women at risk of poorer quality of life after breast cancer and the issues that most need to be addressed in this Middle East society.

The R&D Working Group noted that implementation research is highly complex and requires participation of stakeholders from diverse backgrounds to ensure effective planning, execution, interpretation, and adoption of research outcomes. Unlike other scientific disciplines, implementation research is highly contextual and depends on social, cultural, geographic, and economic factors to make the findings useful for local, national, and regional applications. This paper presents the broad framework for implementation research in support of immunization and sets out a series of research questions developed through a Delphi process (during a DoVC-supported workshop in Sitges, Spain) and a literature review.

Children who remain unreached are those who need vaccination - and other health services - most. Reaching these children and other underserved target groups will require a reorientation of current approaches and resource allocation. At the country level, evidence-based and context-specific strategies must be developed to promote equity in ways that strengthen the system that facilitates vaccination, are sustainable and extend benefits across the life cycle. At the global level, more attention must go on ensuring sustainable and affordable supply for low- and middle-income countries to vaccine products that are appropriate for the contexts where needs are greatest. Finally, data must be disaggregated and used at all levels to monitor and guide progress to reach the unreached. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The country forayed into manufacturing vaccines starting with a few public-sector manufacturers in the late 1960s but has emerged as the major supplier of basic Expanded Programme on Immunization vaccines to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) because of substantial private-sector investment in the area. The Indian vaccine industry is now able to produce new and more complex vaccines such as the meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, rotavirus vaccine and influenza A (HI NI) vaccines. This has been possible because of an attractive investment environment, effective and innovative governmental support, international partnerships and the growing in-country technical work force. A large number of vaccines, including those mentioned, is available and administered in the private sector within the country, but India has been slow in introducing new vaccines in its publically funded programs. Growth in the economy and technological accomplishments are not reflected in a reduction in health inequalities, and India continues to contribute significantly to global child mortality figures. This paper reviews the development of the Indian vaccine industry, policy support for it and its current status. It also highlights opportunities and challenges for the introduction of new and underutilized vaccines at home. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Sen Gupta, Sanjukta; Nair, G.

When Burkina Faso adopted the-DOTS strategy for the control of tuberculosis, the intention was to provide free tuberculosis care. In 2007-2008, interviews were used to collect information from 242 smear-positive patients With pulmonary tuberculosis who were enrolled in the national tuberculosis control programme in six rural districts. The median direct costs associated with tuberculosis were estimated at 101 United States dollars (US$) per patient. These costs represented 23% of the mean annual income of a patient's household. During the course of their care, three quarters of the interviewed patients apparently faced "catastrophic" health expenditure. Inadequacies in the health system and policies appeared to be responsible for nearly half of the direct costs (US$ 45 per patient). Although the households of patients developed coping strategies, these had far-reaching, adverse effects on the quality of lives of the households' members and the socioeconomic stability of the households. Each tuberculosis patient lost a median of 45 days of work as a result of the illness. For a population living on or below the poverty line, every failure in health-care delivery increases the risk of"catastrophic"health expenditure, exacerbates socioeconomic inequalities, and reduces the probability of adequate treatment and cure. In Burkina Faso, a policy of "free" care for tuberculosis-patients has not met with complete success. These observations should help define post-2015 global strategies for tuberculosis care, prevention and control.

At the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), HIA was discussed as a critical method for linking health to "green economy" and "institutional framework" strategies for sustainable development. In countries having a high human development index (HDI), HIA has been added to the overall assessment suite that typically includes potential environmental and social impacts, but it is rarely required as part of the environmental and social impact assessment for large development projects. When they are performed, project-driven HIAs are governed by a combination of project proponent and multilateral lender performance standards rather than host country requirements. Not surprisingly, in low-HDI countries HIA is missing from the programme and policy arena in the absence of an external project driver. Major drivers of global change (e.g. population growth and urbanization, growing pressure on natural resources and climate change) inordinately affect low- and medium-HDI countries; however, in such countries HIA is conspicuously absent. If the cloak of HIA invisibility is to be removed, it must be shown that HIA is useful and beneficial and, hence, an essential component of the 21st century's sustainable development agenda. We analyse where and how HIA can become fully integrated into the impact assessment suite and argue that the impact of HIA must not remain obscure.

Improving access to eye health services in rural Timor-Leste	RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH			English	Article						access; eye health; outreach services; Timor-Leste	VISION; CARE	Context: Delivering eye health services to people in rural areas, especially in fragile, post-conflict countries, is a major challenge. This article reports on the implementation and evaluation of an innovative district-based outreach service. The main project partners were the Timor-Leste Ministry of Health and an international non-government organization, with assistance from a local non-government organization. Issue: An eye care nurse in Covalima District, a remote location 178 km from Timor-Leste's capital, Dili, was provided with a motor-bike for transport and regular support for outreach eye services to sub-district facilities. Data collected over the first year of operation were examined and included: services provided, spectacles dispensed, health promotion activities conducted and the cost of providing these. The project was also evaluated for its relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability. Lessons learned: In the first 12 months, 5 5 outreach visits were conducted across the district's seven sub-districts during which 140 5 people received vision screening, and 777 spectacles were dispensed. In addition to meeting the five evaluation criteria, compared with the hospital-based eye clinic the outreach service resulted in significantly greater gender equity among eye health service beneficiaries. This pilot project demonstrates what can be achieved when a Ministry of Health (central and district level) and non-government organizations (international and local) work in partnership to support a dedicated health care provider.

National and international obesity organizations have identified obesity stigma as a key barrier to effectively addressing the obesity epidemic and have called for theory driven interventions to reduce it. Both the Canadian Obesity Network (http://www.obesitynetwork.ca) and the Obesity Society (http://www.obesity.org) have strategic directions, mission statements and collaborations that strongly oppose weight bias and recognize the potential of such bias to negatively impact obesity treatment. Comprehensive reviews of the literature in the area of weight bias have been published and have subsequently raised awareness of the potential impact of weight bias and discrimination on the health and well-being of individuals living with obesity. The purpose of this review is to highlight drivers of weight bias and to discuss its impact on obesity treatment.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is more strongly associated with the risk of progression to T2D than generalized obesity. Therefore examining MS may help to better understand the differences in T2D between the two countries. We assessed whether the Dutch and English differences in T2D prevalence reflect similar differences in MS in Whites, South-Asian Indians and African-Caribbeans living in these two countries. Methods: Secondary analyses of population-based studies of 3010 participants aged 35-60 years. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were estimated using regression models. Results: In general, the Dutch ethnic groups had a higher prevalence of MS than their English counterparts. Adjusted PRs were 1.37[95% confidence interval (CI)1.03-1.82] and 1.52 (1.06-2.19) in White-Dutch men and women compared to White-English men and women; 2.20 (1.14-4.26) and 1.46 (0.96-2.24) in Dutch-African-Caribbean men and women compared to English-African-Caribbean men and women and 0.97 (0.74-1.27) and 1.42 (1.00-2.03) in Dutch-Indian men and women compared with their English-Indian peers, respectively. Similar patterns were also observed for some MS components, e.g. raised fasting glucose in men and central obesity in women. Conclusion: The comparatively high prevalence of MS among Dutch ethnic groups may contribute to their high prevalence of T2D. The high levels of some MS components, e.g. raised fasting glucose in men and central obesity in women add to the high prevalence of MS in Dutch ethnic groups.

H.; Sheikh, Aziz			Principles for research on ethnicity and health: the Leeds Consensus Statement	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							INEQUALITIES; RACE	Background: There is substantial evidence that health and health-care experiences vary along ethnic lines and the need to understand and tackle ethnic health inequalities has repeatedly been highlighted. Research into ethnicity and health raises ethical, theoretical and methodological issues and, as the volume of research in this area grows, so too do concerns regarding its scientific rigour and reporting, and its contribution to reducing inequalities. Guidance may be helpful in encouraging researchers to adopt standard practices in the design, conduct and reporting of research. However, past efforts at introducing such guidance have had limited impact on research practice, and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives on the key challenges and solutions may undermine attempts to derive and promote guiding principles. Methods: A consensus building Delphi exercise-the first of its kind in this area of research practice-was undertaken with leading academics, practitioners and policymakers from a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds to assess whether consensus on key principles could be achieved. Results: Ten key principles for conducting research on ethnicity and health emerged, covering: the aims of research in this field; how such research should be framed and focused; key design-related considerations; and the direction of future research. Despite some areas of dispute, participants were united by a common concern that the generation and application of research evidence should contribute to better health-care experiences and health outcomes for minority ethnic people. Conclusion: The principles provide a strong foundation to guide future ethnicity-related research and build a broader international consensus.

The present article describes the first home-visiting program in France to specifically target mental health questions in families living in vulnerable contexts. The CAPEDP project, involving 440 women and their families, took place in Paris and its inner suburbs from 2006 to 2011. To be eligible for inclusion, women had to be (i) under 26 years old, (ii) less that 27 weeks pregnant, (iii) sufficiently fluent in French to give truly informed consent to participate in the study and benefit from the intervention and (iv) presenting with one or more of the following social vulnerability factors: low income, low educational level, and/or intending to bring up the child without the child's father. The intervention consisted of 44 home visits from the third trimester of pregnancy through to the child's second birthday. The aim of the intervention was to promote infant mental health and reduce the incidence of infant mental health problems at the age of two years. The intervention paid particular attention to postnatal maternal depression and promoting parenting skills and attachment security, particularly through the use of video during home-visits. A major issue was that of adapting international best practice recommendations with regard to home-visiting programs to the particularities of the existing French social and health care system. An original aspect of the intervention was to use trained clinical psychologists to conduct all home visits.

J	Hevia, M; Vacaflor, CH				Hevia, Martin; Herrera Vacaflor, Carlos			EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AGAINST STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS IN THE FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON GLOBAL HEALTH: A PROPOSAL	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								A Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) seeks to have a profound, effective, and broad impact: bringing access to health rights to the largest global community possible. One of the main issues the FCGH will address is how to make the right to health justiciable. An FCGH must articulate functional remedies for violations of the right to health by state or non-state actors. This paper analyzes one approach to ensuring the recognition of the rights defended in a future FCGH. Following the incremental development approach inspired by the architecture of other successful framework convention protocols, we propose the inclusion of access to health justice guidelines in an FCGH. This proposal is based on the amparo remedy, a figure already extant in the legislation of several Latin American countries; since its incorporation, these countries have witnessed a significant increase in litigation defending health rights. This is only one of many important advantages to broadly adopting guidelines based on the amparo remedy. The proposed guidelines would serve as a basic agreement on broad principles on access to health justice.

Proponents of the FCGH suggest that it could further the right to health through its incorporation of rights into national laws and policies, using litigation and community empowerment to advance rights claims and prominently establish the right to health as central to global health governance. Building on efforts to expand development and influence of the right to health through the implementation of the FCGH, in this article we find that human rights correspondingly holds promise in justifying the FCGH. By employing human rights as a means to develop and implement the FCGH, the existing and evolving frameworks of human rights can complement efforts to reform global health governance, with the FCGH and human rights serving as mutually reinforcing bases of norms and accountability in global health.

J	Friedman, EA; Gostin, LO; Buse, K				Friedman, Eric A.; Gostin, Lawrence O.; Buse, Kent			ADVANCING THE RIGHT TO HEALTH THROUGH GLOBAL ORGANIZATIONS: THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF A FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON GLOBAL HEALTH	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								Organizations, partnerships, and alliances form the building blocks of global governance. Global health organizations thus have the potential to play a formative role in determining the extent to which people are able to realize their right to health. This article examines how major global health organizations, such as WHO, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, UNAIDS, and GAVI approach human rights concerns, including equality, accountability, and inclusive participation. We argue that organizational support for the right to health must transition from ad hoc and partial to permanent and comprehensive. Drawing on the literature and our knowledge of global health organizations, we offer good practices that point to ways in which such agencies can advance the right to health, covering nine areas: 1) participation and representation in governance processes; 2) leadership and organizational ethos; 3) internal policies; 4) norm-setting and promotion; 5) organizational leadership through advocacy and communication; 6) monitoring and accountability; 7) capacity building; 8) funding policies; and 9) partnerships and engagement. In each of these areas, we offer elements of a proposed Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH), which would commit state parties to support these standards through their board membership and other interactions with these agencies. We also explain how the FCGH could incorporate these organizations into its overall financing framework, initiate a new forum where they collaborate with each other, as well as organizations in other regimes, to advance the right to health, and ensure sufficient funding for right to health capacity building. We urge major global health organizations to follow the leadership of the UN Secretary-General and UNAIDS to champion the FCGH. It is only through a rights-based approach, enshrined in a new Convention, that we can expect to achieve health for all in our lifetimes.

By fusing activism, political leadership, domestic and international investment, and accountability for results, the course of the epidemic has been radically shifted. People living with HIV and others directly affected by the epidemic have exerted immense leadership since the first days of the response: they have fought to end discrimination on the basis of sero-status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, migration status, drug use, or participation in sex work. Some of this mobilization has taken the form of strategic litigation, drawing human rights down into concrete demands and defining social, health, legal, and economic policy. The global AIDS response has shown that at the core of health lie considerations of social justice, human rights, and accountability. As momentum builds for a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH), we believe there is an opportunity to take stock of lessons learned from the response to HIV and ensure that they are replicated and institutionalized in an eventual Convention. We argue that the most critical aspect to the success of the HIV response has been the leadership and activism of civil society. Conventions do not lead to results on their own, and there should be every expectation that the FCGH will be no different. Success requires active monitoring of progress and shortcomings, combined with political and social mobilization to expand investment and access to the services and underlying conditions that protect and advance health. While the FCGH must make civil society support and engagement an indispensable principle, the AIDS movement can contribute substantive content and mobilization for its adoption. A broad international legal framework for health can help address some of the key legal, policy, regulatory, and programmatic challenges that continue to hinder effective responses to HIV. Thus, the AIDS response potentially has much to gain from the normative and institutional framework, and the expanded commitment to realizing the right to health that can be generated under such a Convention.

HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							MOBILIZATION; DISEASES	The idea of a Framework Convention for Global Health (FCGH), using the treaty-making powers of the World Health Organization (WHO), has been promoted as an opportunity to advance global health equity and the right to health. The idea has promise, but needs more thought regarding risks, obstacles, and strategies. The reform of global health governance must be based on a robust analysis of the political economy out of which the drivers of inequality and the denial of the right to health arise. Some of the published commentary has focused on using the proposed FCGH to institutionalize a paradigm change regarding international aid for health care, i.e., reconceptualizing such aid as obligatory, based on human solidarity rather than strategic considerations, based on global stability and national security. We warn against limiting the project to questions of inter-governmental financial transfers because of the risk of neglecting the underlying structural determinants of health injustice. Such neglect would help to legitimize an unjust and unsustainable global economic regime. We raise further questions about the strategic logic informing any campaign for a FCGH. The governments of the United States and Europe have put considerable effort into weakening WHO through tight donor controls, and it would require heavy pressure to persuade them to sign on to a FCGH. Generating such pressure would require strong popular mobilization around the local and diverse priorities of different communities across the globe, and recognition of a common need for effective regulation at the global level. We argue for a broad-based campaign from which the need for more effective global health regulation (and a FCGH) would emerge as a common theme arising from myriad more specific claims. This type of campaign would respond to local needs, and would also be understood within a global, political, and economic perspective.

Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN) - prospective validation of risk prediction models for adult patients with acute traumatic brain injury to use to evaluate the optimum location and comparative costs of neurocritical care: a cohort study	HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT			English	Article							ACUTE SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CHRONIC HEALTH EVALUATION; LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; SOCIETY APACHE-II; INTENSIVE-CARE; POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRES; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY	Objectives: To validate risk prediction models for acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to use the best model to evaluate the optimum location and comparative costs of neurocritical care in the NHS. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Sixty-seven adult critical care units. Participants: Adult patients admitted to critical care following actual/suspected TBI with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of < 15. Interventions: Critical care delivered in a dedicated neurocritical care unit, a combined neuro/general critical care unit within a neuroscience centre or a general critical care unit outside a neuroscience centre. Main outcome measures: Mortality, Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOSE) questionnaire and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, 3-level version (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire at 6 months following TBI. Results: The final Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN) study data set contained 3626 admissions. After exclusions, 3210 patients with acute TBI were included. Overall follow-up rate at 6 months was 81%. Of 3210 patients, 101 (3.1%) had no GCS score recorded and 134 (4.2%) had a last pre-sedation GCS score of 15, resulting in 2975 patients for analysis. The most common causes of TBI were road traffic accidents (RTAs) (33%), falls (47%) and assault (12%). Patients were predominantly young (mean age 45 years overall) and male (76% overall). Six-month mortality was 22% for RTAs, 32% for falls and 17% for assault. Of survivors at 6 months with a known GOSE category, 44% had severe disability, 30% moderate disability and 26% made a good recovery. Overall, 61% of patients with known outcome had an unfavourable outcome (death or severe disability) at 6 months. Between 35% and 70% of survivors reported problems across the five domains of the EQ-5D-3L. Of the 10 risk models selected for validation, the best discrimination overall was from the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI Lab model (IMPACT) (c-index 0.779 for mortality, 0.713 for unfavourable outcome). The model was well calibrated for 6-month mortality but substantially underpredicted the risk of unfavourable outcome at 6 months. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between dedicated neurocritical care units and combined neuro/general critical care units. In lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis, dedicated neurocritical care units had higher mean lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at small additional mean costs with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 14,000 pound per QALY and incremental net monetary benefit (INB) of 17,000 pound. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve suggested that the probability that dedicated compared with combined neurocritical care units are cost-effective is around 60%. There were substantial differences in case mix between the 'early' (within 18 hours of presentation) and 'no or late' (after 24 hours) transfer groups. After adjustment, the 'early' transfer group reported higher lifetime QALYs at an additional cost with an ICER of 11,000 pound and INB of 17,000 pound. Conclusions: The risk models demonstrated sufficient statistical performance to support their use in research but fell below the level required to guide individual patient decision-making. The results suggest that management in a dedicated neurocritical care unit may be cost-effective compared with a combined neuro/general critical care unit (although there is considerable statistical uncertainty) and support current recommendations that all patients with severe TBI would benefit from transfer to a neurosciences centre, regardless of the need for surgery.

"There Must be Some Way Out of Here": Why the Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities is Potentially the Best Weapon in the Fight Against Sanism	PSYCHIATRY PSYCHOLOGY AND LAW			English	Article						mental disability law; sanism; international human rights law; therapeutic jurisprudence; Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities	MENTAL-HEALTH; REPRESENTATION; DIGNITY; COUNSEL; LAW	It is impossible to consider the impact of anti-discrimination law on persons with mental disabilities without a full understanding of how sanism permeates all aspects of the legal system - judicial opinions, legislation, the role of lawyers, juror decision-making - and the entire fabric of society. For those unfamiliar with the term, I define "sanism" as an irrational prejudice of the same quality and character as other irrational prejudices that cause and are reflected in prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic bigotry,(1) that permeates all aspects of mental disability law and affects all participants in the mental disability law system: litigants, fact finders, counsel, and expert and lay witnesses.(2) Notwithstanding over two decades of anti-discrimination laws(3) and, in many jurisdictions, an impressive corpus of constitutional case law and state statutes,(4) the attitudes of judges, jurors and lawyers often reflect the same level of bigotry that defined this area of law half a century ago.(5) The reasons for this are complex and, to a great extent, flow from centuries of prejudice - often hidden prejudice, often socially acceptable prejudice(6) - that has persisted in spite of prophylactic legislative and judicial reforms, and - at least superficially - an apparent uptick in public awareness. I have railed multiple times about the "irrational," "corrosive", "malignant" and "ravaging" effects of sanism, but its "pernicious power" still poisons all of mental disability law.(7) The recently-ratified Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is the most revolutionary international human rights document - ever - that applies to persons with disabilities. The Disability Convention furthers the human rights approach to disability and recognizes the right of people with disabilities to equality in most every aspect of life. It firmly endorses a social model of disability - a clear and direct repudiation of the medical model that traditionally was part-and-parcel of mental disability law. It calls for "respect for inherent dignity" and "non-discrimination." Subsequent articles declare "freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment," "freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse," and a right to protection of the "integrity of the person." In this paper, I consider the impact that the Convention is likely to have on sanism. First, I will briefly discuss both our sanist past and our sanist present. Then, I will consider how the CRPD has the greatest potential for combating sanism, and for changing social attitudes. In this latter inquiry, I will also draw on the tools of therapeutic jurisprudence. Then, I will offer some brief and modest conclusions.

While explanations for this gender gap have been studied extensively at the individual level, few researchers have studied macro-level determinants of depression in men and women. In the current study we aim to examine the micro-macro linkage of the relationship between gender equality and depression by gender in Europe, using data from the European Social Survey, 2006-2007 (N=39,891). Using a multilevel framework we find that a high degree of macro-level gender equality is related to lower levels of depression in both women and men. It is also related to a smaller gender difference in depression, but only for certain social subgroups and only for specific dimensions of gender equality.

Association between having no sons and using no contraception among a nationally representative sample of young wives in Nepal	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Contraception use; Family planning; Nepal; Son preference	METHOD CHOICE; HEALTH; PREFERENCE; MORTALITY; EQUITY; IMPACT; GIRLS; INDIA	Objective: To examine whether a lack of sons predicts non-use of contraception among young wives in Nepal. Methods: Data were obtained from married females aged 15-24 years who participated in the Nepal 2011 Demographic and Health Survey (n=2439). Multivariate models were used to test predictions of modern contraception use with the following variables: having no sons, social inequities (wealth, education, rural residence, and caste), gender inequities (early age at marriage, spousal age, and education gaps), respondent age, parity, and geographic region. Results: Most wives (79%) reported using no modern contraception. Non-use was more likely among those with no living sons (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.2), and those who married as a minor (AOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.02-1.9) and/or resided in a rural area (AOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.5). Having no daughters was negatively associated with non-use of contraception (AOR,. 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9). Conclusion: Contraception use is not common among young wives in Nepal. It is, however, more likely among wives with sons and less likely among wives with daughters, demonstrating that son preference continues to affect contraception use among the next generation of mothers in Nepal.

Age Differences in Trust: An Investigation Across 38 Countries	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Age difference; developing status; individualism; inequality; trust	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; UNITED-STATES; SOCIOEMOTIONAL SELECTIVITY; SOCIAL PARTNERS; TIME; HEALTH; COMMITMENT; BEHAVIOR; SUPPORT	Population aging is a global challenge in the 21st century. As social relationships contribute significantly to older adults well-being and trust lays the foundation of constructive social interactions, it is theoretically and practically significant to examine age differences in trust in a worldwide sample. The current study examined age differences in generalized trust and trust toward family members, friends, neighbors, and strangers, using data from the World Value Survey based on 57,497 individuals from 38 countries. Age was positively related to generalized trust and trust toward the four target groups across the 38 countries. Age differences in trust toward friends, neighbors, and strangers were also moderated by contextual factors (i.e., income inequality, developing status, and individualism). The results suggest that, across countries, enhancing trust toward others may be one mechanism through which older adults maintain emotional connectedness with others. Future studies are encouraged to investigate the mechanism underlying the age differences in trust.

Individuals' attitude toward price-based priority access in health care	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						The Netherlands; Health care allocation policies; Price-based access to care; Price-based priority access; Priority access pricing; Collective health outcome evaluations	COMMON METHOD VARIANCE; EFFICIENCY TRADE-OFF; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; PERCEIVED FAIRNESS; PREFERENCES; EQUITY; PERCEPTIONS; GOODS; MORTALITY	Increased competition in the health care sector has led hospitals and other health care institutions to experiment with new access allocation policies that move away from traditional expert based allocation of care to price-based priority access (i.e., the option to pay more for faster care). To date, little is known about individuals' attitude toward price-based priority access and the evaluation process underlying this attitude. This paper addresses the role of individuals' evaluations of collective health outcomes as an important driver of their attitude toward (price-based) allocation policies in health care. The authors investigate how individuals evaluate price-based priority access by means of scenario-based survey data collected in a representative sample from the Dutch population (N = 1464). They find that (a) offering individuals the opportunity to pay for faster care negatively affects their evaluations of both the total and distributional collective health outcome achieved, (b) however, when health care supply is not restricted (i.e., when treatment can be offered outside versus within the regular working hours of the hospital) offering price-based priority access affects total collective health outcome evaluations positively instead of negatively, but it does not change distributional collective health outcome evaluations. Furthermore, (c) the type of health care treatment (i.e., life saving liver transplantation treatment vs. life improving cosmetic ear correction treatment - priced at the same level to the individual) moderates the effect of collective health outcome evaluations on individuals' attitude toward allocation policies. For policy makers and hospital managers the results presented in this article are helpful because they provide a better understanding of what drives individuals' preferences for health care allocation policies. In particular, the results show that policies based on the "paying more for faster care" principle are more attractive to the general public when treatment takes place outside the regular working hours of a hospital.

Location is generally recognised as the most important determinant of residential property value. Extending the well-established relationship between poor health and socio-economic disadvantage and the role of residential property in the overall wealth of individuals, this study tested the predictive value of the Relative Location Factor (RLF), a SES measure designed to reflect the relationship between location and residential property value, and six cardiometabolic disease risk factors, central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL), hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, and high low density lipoprotein (LDL). These risk factors were also summed and expressed as a cumulative cardiometabolic risk (CMR) score. Methods: RLF was calculated using a global hedonic regression model from residential property sales transaction data based upon several residential property characteristics, but deliberately blind to location, to predict the selling price of the property. The predicted selling price was divided by the actual selling price and the results interpolated across the study area and classified as tertiles. The measures used to calculate CMR were collected via clinic visits from a population-based cohort study. Models with individual risk factors and the cumulative cardiometabolic risk (CMR) score as dependent variables were respectively tested using log binomial and Poisson generalised linear models. Results: A statistically significant relationship was found between RLF, the cumulative CMR score and all but one of the risk factors. In all cases, participants in the most advantaged and intermediate group had a lower risk for cardiometabolic diseases. For the CMR score the RR for the most advantaged was 19% lower (RR = 0.81; CI 0.76-0.86; p < 0.0001) and the middle group was 9% lower (RR = 0.91; CI 0.86-0.95; p < 0.0001) than the least advantaged group. Conclusions: This paper advances the understanding of the nexus between place, health and SES by providing an objective spatially informed SES measure for testing health outcomes and reported a robust association between RLF and several health measures.

J	Cylus, J; Papanicolas, I; Constantinou, E; Theodorou, M				Cylus, Jonathan; Papanicolas, Irene; Constantinou, Elisavet; Theodorou, Mamas			Moving forward: Lessons for Cyprus as it implements its health insurance scheme	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Cyprus; Health reform; National health insurance; Universal coverage	INCENTIVES; QUALITY	The Republic of Cyprus is the only country in the European Union (EU) whose health system is comprised of public and private sectors of relatively similar sizes. The division within the health system, combined with a lack of efficient payment mechanisms and monitoring systems, contributes to inequalities in access to care, and inefficient allocation and utilization of resources. In part to address these issues, a new General Health Insurance Scheme (GHIS), was proposed by stakeholders from the Cypriot government along with a team of international consultants in 1992 and eventually approved by the Parliament in 2001. However implementation of the GHIS has been repeatedly delayed since that time due to cost concerns. In 2012, following recommendations by the European Commission, the Cypriot Cabinet decided to recommit to the reform. In light of this development, the recent Cyprus application for accession to the EU support mechanism due to the economic crisis, and the international spotlight associated with Cyprus' EU Presidency, this article discusses the anticipated Cypriot health system reform-which is now slated to go into effect in 2016-and examines lessons from other countries.

J	Rainham, D; Cantwell, R; Jason, T				Rainham, Daniel; Cantwell, Rory; Jason, Timothy			Nature Appropriation and Associations with Population Health in Canada's Largest Cities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						sustainability; population health; natural capital; ecological footprint analysis; nature appropriation	INCOME INEQUALITY; SUSTAINABILITY; OBESITY; SMOKING; TRENDS	Earth is a finite system with a limited supply of resources. As the human population grows, so does the appropriation of Earth's natural capital, thereby exacerbating environmental concerns such as biodiversity loss, increased pollution, deforestation and global warming. Such concerns will negatively impact human health although it is widely believed that improving socio-economic circumstances will help to ameliorate environmental impacts and improve health outcomes. However, this belief does not explicitly acknowledge the fact that improvements in socio-economic position are reliant on increased inputs from nature. Gains in population health, particularly through economic means, are disconnected from the appropriation of nature to create wealth so that health gains become unsustainable. The current study investigated the sustainability of human population health in Canada with regard to resource consumption or "ecological footprints" (i.e., the resources required to sustain a given population). Ecological footprints of the 20 largest Canadian cities, along with several important determinants of health such as income and education, were statistically compared with corresponding indicators of human population health outcomes. A significant positive relationship was found between ecological footprints and life expectancy, as well as a significant negative relationship between ecological footprints and the prevalence of high blood pressure. Results suggest that increased appropriation of nature is linked to improved health outcomes. To prevent environmental degradation from excessive appropriation of natural resources will require the development of health promotion strategies that are de-coupled from ever-increasing and unsustainable resource use. Efforts to promote population health should focus on health benefits achieved from a lifestyle based on significantly reduced consumption of natural resources.

Drawing on resources from social and political philosophy, I argue that we can gain useful insight in bioethics if we understand solidarity as a political relation grounded not on shared social (political, economic) location but rather on shared visions for the sorts of worlds in which collective health and dignity proliferate. I consider what traction this conception of solidarity might give for thinking about social justice issues in the context of political movements for "reproductive justice."

J	Bretschneider, W; Eiger, B; Wangmo, T				Bretschneider, Wiebke; Eiger, Bernice; Wangmo, Tenzin			Ageing Prisoners' Health Care: Analysing the Legal Settings in Europe and the United States	GERONTOLOGY			English	Article						Ageing prisoners; Health care; Legal guidelines; Human rights	OLDER; RIGHTS; BARS	Background: Relatively little is known about the current health care situation and the legal rights of ageing prisoners worldwide. To date, only a few studies have investigated their rights to health care. However, elderly prisoners need special attention. Objective:The aim of this article is to critically review the health care situation of older prisoners by analysing the relevant national and international legal frameworks with a particular focus on Switzerland, England and Wales, and the United States (US). Methods: Publications on legal frameworks were searched using Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, HeinOnline, and the National Criminal Justice Reference Service. Searches utilizing combinations of keywords relating to ageing prisoners were performed. Relevant reports and policy documents were obtained in order to understand the legal settings in Switzerland, England and Wales, and the US. All articles, reports, and policy documents published in English and German between 1774 to June 2012 were included for analysis. Using a comparative approach, an outline was completed to distinguish positive policies in this area. Regulatory approaches were investigated through evaluations of soft laws applicable in Europe and US Supreme Court judgements. Results: Even though several documents could be interpreted as guaranteeing adequate health care for ageing prisoners, there is no specific regulation that addresses this issue completely. The Vienna International Plan of Action on Ageing contributes the most by providing an in-depth analysis of the health care needs of older persons. Still, critical analysis of retrieved documents reveals the lack of specific legislation regarding the health care for ageing prisoners. Conclusion: No consistent regulation delineates the provision of health care for ageing prisoners. Neither national nor international institutions have enforceable laws that secure the precarious situation of older adults in prisons. To initiate a change, this work presents critical issues that must be addressed to protect the right to health care and well-being of ageing prisoners. Additionally, it is important to design legal structures and guidelines which acknowledge and accommodate the needs of ageing prisoners. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

Material and Methods. National surveys (26 556 anonymous questionnaires analyzed) of schoolchildren aged 11, 13, and 15 years were conducted in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010 in the framework of the international Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study. Results. In 1994-2010, a significant increase in smoking prevalence was observed both among boys (11.3% to 21.5%, P<0.05) and girls (3.6% to 14.8%, P<0.05). Weekly alcohol consumption increased from 9.6% to 12.9% (P<0.05) among boys and from 4.3% to 7.9% (P<0.05) among girls. The prevalence of "ever use" of any psychoactive substance (data for 15-year-old group only) increased both in boys (14.6% to 33.5%) and girls (6.7% to 18.4%). Urban girls smoked more often than their rural peers. For both genders, such a residential gradient was observed in the use of alcohol and drugs. The respondents from intact families used drugs less frequently than the adolescents from not intact families. The adolescents from affluent families smoked less often, while the prevalence of alcohol and drug use was higher (except weekly alcohol use in girls). Conclusions. The study has demonstrated a significant increase in the prevalence of smoking, drinking, and drug use among Lithuanian school-aged children during the period of transition to market economy. This study provides some insight that should be addressed in equity-oriented control policies of substance use.

Accordingly, this features a prominent role for expanded partnerships between the faith-based and public health sectors. Such an agenda would revise the current status quo for the Surgeon General, whose celebrated bully pulpit is currently focused more on encouraging "downstream" compliance with federal guidelines related to lifestyle behavior modification. A new faith-based agenda, by contrast, could more effectively advocate for core features of the traditional public health ethic, including primary prevention, the multiple determinants of population health, communitarianism and social justice, and a global perspective, supported by the historic prophetic role of the faith traditions.

J	Pratt, B; Loff, B				Pratt, Bridget; Loff, Bebe			LINKING INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH TO GLOBAL HEALTH EQUITY: THE LIMITED CONTRIBUTION OF BIOETHICS	BIOETHICS			English	Article						international research; justice; global health; research ethics; social determinants of health; health equity	TECHNOLOGY; POLICY; INNOVATION; SCIENCE; AGENDA	Health research has been identified as a vehicle for advancing global justice in health. However, in bioethics, issues of global justice are mainly discussed within an ongoing debate on the conditions under which international clinical research is permissible. As a result, current ethical guidance predominantly links one type of international research (biomedical) to advancing one aspect of health equity (access to new treatments). International guidelines largely fail to connect international research to promoting broader aspects of health equity namely, healthier social environments and stronger health systems. Bioethical frameworks such as the human development approach do consider how international clinical research is connected to the social determinants of health but, again, do so to address the question of when international clinical research is permissible. It is suggested that the narrow focus of this debate is shaped by high-income countries' economic strategies. The article further argues that the debate's focus obscures a stronger imperative to consider how other types of international research might advance justice in global health. Bioethics should consider the need for non-clinical health research and its contribution to advancing global justice.

Study Design and Setting: We consulted with experts and conducted a literature search to identify a priority-setting method that could be adapted to address the health equity and SDH. We selected the Global Evidence Mapping priority-setting method, and through consultations and consensus, we adapted the method to meet our objectives. This involves developing an evidence map of the existing systematic reviews on osteoarthritis; conducting one face-to-face workshop with patients and another one with clinicians, researchers, and patients; and conducting an online survey of patients to rank the top 10 research questions. We piloted the adapted method with the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group to set research priorities for osteoarthritis. Results: Our focus was on systematic reviews: we identified 34 high-priority research questions for osteoarthritis systematic reviews. Prevention and self-management interventions, mainly diet and exercise, are top priorities for osteoarthritis systematic reviews. Evaluation against our predefined objectives showed that this method did prioritize SDH (50% of the research questions considered SDH). There were marked gaps: no high-priority topics were identified for access to care until patients had advanced disease lifestyle changes once the disease was diagnosed. This method was felt feasible if conducted annually. Conclusion: We confirmed the utility of an adapted priority-setting method that is feasible and considers SDH. Further testing of this method is needed to assess whether considerations of health equity are prioritized and involve disadvantaged groups of the population. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This inequity is especially felt in low income countries in sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia where 99% of the global burden of maternal death is borne. A goal of MDG 5 is to reduce maternal mortality and have a skilled attendant at every birth by 2015. A critical skill is ongoing intrapartum monitoring of labour progress and maternal/fetal well-being. The WHO partograph was designed to assess these parameters. Design and setting: a retrospective review of charts (n = 1,845) retrieved consecutively over a 2 month period in a tertiary teaching hospital in Ghana was conducted to assess the adequacy of partograph use by skilled birth attendants and the timeliness of action taken if the action line was crossed. WHO guidelines were implemented to assess the adequacy of partograph use and how this affected maternal neonatal outcomes. Further, the timeliness and type of action taken if action line was crossed was assessed. Findings: partographs were adequately completed in accordance with WHO guidelines only 25.6% (472) of the time and some data appeared to be entered retrospectively. Partograph use was associated with less maternal blood loss and neonatal injuries. When the action line was crossed (464), timely action was taken only 48.7% of the time and was associated with less assisted delivery and a fewer low Apgar scores and NICU admissions. Conclusion: when adequately used and timely interventions taken, the partograph was an effective tool. Feasibility of partograph use requires more scrutiny; particularly identification of minimum frequency for safe monitoring and key variables as well as a better understanding of why skilled attendants have not consistently 'bought in' to partograph use. Frontline workers need access to ongoing and current education and strategically placed algorhythims. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tobacco endgame strategies: challenges in ethics and law	TOBACCO CONTROL			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; MARKET	There are complex legal and ethical tradeoffs involved in using intensified regulation to bring smoking prevalence to near-zero levels. The authors explore these tradeoffs through a lens of health justice, paying particular attention to the potential impact on vulnerable populations. The ethical tradeoffs explored include the charge that heavy regulation is paternalistic; the potentially regressive impact of heavily taxing a product consumed disproportionately by the poor; the simple loss of enjoyment to heavily addicted smokers; the health risks posed by, for example, regulating nicotine content in cigarettes-where doing so leads to increased consumption. Turning to legalistic concerns, the authors explore whether endgame strategies constitute a form of 'regulatory taking'; whether endgame strategies can be squared with global trade/investment laws; whether free speech rights are infringed by aggressive restrictions on the advertisement and marketing of cigarettes.

J	Blanc, AK; Winfrey, W; Ross, J				Blanc, Ann K.; Winfrey, William; Ross, John			New Findings for Maternal Mortality Age Patterns: Aggregated Results for 38 Countries	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE	Background: With recent results showing a global decline in overall maternal mortality during the last two decades and with the target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals only four years away, the question of how to continue or even accelerate the decline has become more pressing. By knowing where the risk is highest as well as where the numbers of deaths are greatest, it may be possible to re-direct resources and fine-tune strategies for greater effectiveness in efforts to reduce maternal mortality. Methods: We aggregate data from 38 Demographic and Health Surveys that included a maternal mortality module and were conducted in 2000 or later to produce maternal mortality ratios, rates, and numbers of deaths by five year age groups, separately by residence, region, and overall mortality level. Findings: The age pattern of maternal mortality is broadly similar across regions, type of place of residence, and overall level of maternal mortality. A "J" shaped curve, with markedly higher risk after age 30, is evident in all groups. We find that the excess risk among adolescents is of a much lower magnitude than is generally assumed. The oldest age groups appear to be especially resistant to change. We also find evidence of extremely elevated risk among older mothers in countries with high levels of HIV prevalence. Conclusions: The largest number of deaths occurs in the age groups from 20-34, largely because those are the ages at which women are most likely to give birth so efforts directed at this group would most effectively reduce the number of deaths. Yet equity considerations suggest that efforts also be directed toward those most at risk, i.e., older women and adolescents. Because women are at risk each time they become pregnant, fulfilling the substantial unmet need for contraception is a cross-cutting strategy that can address both effectiveness and equity concerns.

However, the public health community has, yet, to address how people define and understand gender equality and how they enact the process of empowerment in their lives. This study uses safe homes and respect for everyone (SHARE), an anti-violence intervention in rural Rakai, Uganda, as a case study to investigate perceptions of gender equality. Investigators analysed 12 focus groups of adult women and men to explore how macro-level concepts of gender equality are being processed on an interpersonal level and the effects on health outcomes. Respondents generally agreed that women lack basic rights. However, they also expressed widespread disagreement about the meanings of gender equality, and reported difficulties integrating the concepts of gender equality into their interpersonal relationships. Community members reported that equality, with the resulting shift in gender norms, could expose women to adverse consequences such as violence, infidelity and abandonment with increased sexual health risks, and potential adverse effects on education. Efforts to increase women's rights must occur in conjunction with community-based work on understandings of gender equality.

Conducted in Western Australia in 2009, the consultation was designed specifically for the Noongar Aboriginal community, drawing on Indigenous research methods and sociocultural theory. The paper discusses the study's findings, considers its Australian policy and international contexts, and explores challenges to providing integrated child and family services for Aboriginal families. It identifies key elements of successful service delivery and highlights the significance of consultation and collaboration in developing culturally appropriate services. The paper concludes that the widely recognised need to 'close the gap' in Indigenous health and education services is not being met with sufficient funding, and notes the ever-widening gap between purported policy imperatives and the process of addressing inequalities.

INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY			English	Review						Capabilities; global health; health justice; People's Health Assembly; social justice		This essay discusses two important recent books on health justice and makes the case for their relevance to global health and to social and political mobilization for health reform. Health and Social Justice (Ruger, 2010) and Health Justice (Venkatapuram, 2011) approach theories of capabilities and justice as the substantive ground of human health. They substantiate and more fully specify the capabilities paradigm, its shared basis with health rights and its relevance to health reforms and the growing global health justice movement. The recent turning point for global health invites a meeting point with the capabilities paradigm. The capabilities approach offers conceptual and practical potential for 'global health', linking normative, substantive and procedural claims for health justice and health rights.

These factors are representative of social, economic, organizational and political inequities. Associated with an improved understanding of multiple levels of HIV risk has been the recognition of the need to implement multi-level HIV prevention strategies. Prevention sciences research and programming aiming to decrease HIV incidence requires epidemiologic studies to collect data on multiple levels of risk to inform combination HIV prevention packages. Discussion: Proximal individual-level risks, such as sharing injection devices and unprotected penile-vaginal or penile-anal sex, are necessary in mediating HIV acquisition and transmission. However, higher order social and structural-level risks can facilitate or reduce HIV transmission on population levels. Data characterizing these risks is often far more actionable than characterizing individual-level risks. We propose a modified social ecological model (MSEM) to help visualize multi-level domains of HIV infection risks and guide the development of epidemiologic HIV studies. Such a model may inform research in epidemiology and prevention sciences, particularly for key populations including men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PID), and sex workers. The MSEM builds on existing frameworks by examining multi-level risk contexts for HIV infection and situating individual HIV infection risks within wider network, community, and public policy contexts as well as epidemic stage. The utility of the MSEM is demonstrated with case studies of HIV risk among PID and MSM. Summary: The MSEM is a flexible model for guiding epidemiologic studies among key populations at risk for HIV in diverse sociocultural contexts. Successful HIV prevention strategies for key populations require effective integration of evidence-based biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions. While the focus of epidemiologic studies has traditionally been on describing individual-level risk factors, the future necessitates comprehensive epidemiologic data characterizing multiple levels of HIV risk.

Enhancing the Australian healthcare sector's responsiveness to environmental sustainability issues: suggestions from Australian healthcare professionals	AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW			English	Article						Environmental health; healthcare ethics; health education; holistic health; professional education; social justice	MODELS	Objective. Identify strategies to implement change across the Australian healthcare sector to better support social and natural environments. Methods. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with Australian healthcare professionals. Results. Interviewees described multiple barriers to implementing change and numerous strategies to overcome these barriers. They argued that action must be taken at the individual and systemic levels to produce substantial and effective change. The strategies recommended fall into four main categories: altering workplace cultures and professional identities, community engagement, political activity, and change from within. The overarching goals of these strategies are to reduce negative impacts on the natural environment, and increase social equity within and across generations. Conclusions. By implementing the strategies described, a more cohesive effort to address sustainability issues across the sector can be made. This may improve local and global health, within current and future generations.

Detrimental impact of socioeconomic status on exercise capacity in adults with congenital heart disease	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						Congenital heart disease; Cardiopulmonary exercise testing; Public health	NERVOUS ACTIVITY LATE; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; GLOBAL IMPAIRMENT; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; AEROBIC CAPACITY; RATE RECOVERY; ASSOCIATION; POPULATION; INEQUALITIES; INTOLERANCE	Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), access to physical activity resources, urban-rural dwelling, levels of pollution and exercise capacity in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. Background: Exercise intolerance is prevalent in ACHD and the contributing factors are poorly understood. Methods: A total of 1268 ACHD patients living in England who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing at our center were included. Neighborhood deprivation (English Indices of Deprivation), urban-rural dwelling, availability of green space, distance to the closest gym/fitness center and levels of pollution were estimated based on administrative data. Results: Urban-rural dwelling, availability of green space and levels of pollution were unrelated to exercise capacity. Lower SES was associated with a significantly lower peak oxygen consumption (P<0.002) and heart rate reserve (P<0.004). This association was non-linear and most pronounced in ACHD patients with cardiac defects ofmedium complexity living in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Low SES was associated with higher prevalence of diabetes (P=0.015) and smoking (P=0.01). Coronary artery disease was rare in this young population and low SES was found to be related to exercise capacity independently of the presence of coronary artery disease. Conclusions: Living in poorer areas is associated with exercise intolerance in contemporary ACHD patients. Although low SES is linked to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the deleterious effects of SES on exercise capacity seem to be only partially mediated via coronary artery disease. Reducing social inequalities in ACHD patients may have a positive effect on quality of life and long-term prognostic implications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reducing skill shortage problems boosts employment participation with a flow-on effect to the health and well-being of societies. Employment distributes a society's wealth among its citizens with a level of equity. This paper focuses on skill shortages in the labour force in Vietnam (in particular professional and technical qualifications) and basic capabilities in the manufacturing and service sectors. This is a qualitative research study involving an extensive literature review using secondary data. It concludes that skills shortages present significant challenges for the Vietnamese government. Plausible solutions to these identified challenges include focusing on substantial revisions to the national education and training systems in consultation with numerous associated stakeholders. The problem is both a national and an institutional human resource management (HRM) issue; such consultation should involve government policy-makers, industry associations, unions, educational and HRM specialists.

J	Chant, S				Chant, Sylvia			Cities through a "gender lens": a golden "urban age" for women in the global South?	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION			English	Article						cities; gender; inequality; poverty; property; slums; space	FEMINIZATION; POVERTY; HEALTH; MOBILITY; AFRICA; SPACE; WATER; WORK; TIME	Although urban women generally enjoy some advantages over their rural counterparts, a range of gender inequalities and injustices persist in urban areas that constrain their engagement in the labour market and in informal enterprises and inhibit the development of capabilities among younger women. These include unequal access to decent work, human capital acquisition, financial and physical assets, intra-urban mobility, personal safety and security, and representation in formal structures of urban governance. But the nature of these varies for different groups of women, not only on account of poverty status and where they live in the city, but also according to age, household characteristics, degree of engagement in income-generating activities and so on. This paper reviews what we have learnt from the literature on gender and urban development. It discusses disparities in access to education and vocational training and to land and housing ownership through a "gender lens". It considers service deficiencies and associated time burdens, which limit income generation among women. Violence and gender, and gender divisions in access to different spaces within the city and in engagement in urban politics, are also covered. These factors cast doubt on whether women's contributions to the prosperity often associated with urbanization are matched by commensurate returns and benefits.

Methods: The data were taken from the nationally representative Thailand Health & Welfare Survey 2007. Data of 10096 Thai elderly (aged over 60years) were selected. Descriptive analyses of the features of dental care utilization among Thai elderly were carried out, in addition to the concentration index (Cindex) being used to quantify the extent of socioeconomic-related inequality in dental care utilization. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with inequality in dental care. Results: Socioeconomic-related inequality in dental care utilization among Thai elderly was shown. Also, utilization was more concentrated among wealthier older adults, as shown by the positive value of Cindex (equals 0.244). The poor elderly, however, were more likely to utilize dental care at public facilities, particularly primary care facilities. Multivariate analysis showed that certain demographic, socioeconomic and geographic characteristics were particularly associated with poorrich differences in dental care utilization among Thai elderly. Conclusions: Although socioeconomic-related inequality in dental care utilization among Thai elderly exists, the pro-poor utilization at public facilities, particularly primary care facilities, substantiates the concerted effort to reducing inequality in dental care utilization for Thai elderly.

J	Romero-Lankao, P; Qin, H; Borbor-Cordova, M				Romero-Lankao, Patricia; Qin, Hua; Borbor-Cordova, Mercy			Exploration of health risks related to air pollution and temperature in three Latin American cities	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Risk society; Environmental justice; Urban vulnerability; Health impacts; Air quality and climate; Bogota; Mexico City; Santiago	HEAT-RELATED MORTALITY; MEXICO-CITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CASE-CROSSOVER; URBAN CENTERS; SAO-PAULO; VULNERABILITY; MICROCLIMATES; EXPOSURES; SANTIAGO	This paper explores whether the health risks related to air pollution and temperature extremes are spatially and socioeconomically differentiated within three Latin American cities: Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, Mexico, and Santiago, Chile. Based on a theoretical review of three relevant approaches to risk analysis (risk society, environmental justice, and urban vulnerability as impact), we hypothesize that health risks from exposure to air pollution and temperature in these cities do not necessarily depend on socio-economic inequalities. To test this hypothesis, we gathered, validated, and analyzed temperature, air pollution, mortality and socioeconomic vulnerability data from the three study cities. Our results show the association between air pollution levels and socioeconomic vulnerabilities did not always correlate within the study cities. Furthermore, the spatial differences in socioeconomic vulnerabilities within cities do not necessarily correspond with the spatial distribution of health impacts. The present study improves our understanding of the multifaceted nature of health risks and vulnerabilities associated with global environmental change. The findings suggest that health risks from atmospheric conditions and pollutants exist without boundaries or social distinctions, even exhibiting characteristics of a boomerang effect (i.e., affecting rich and poor alike) on a smaller scale such as areas within urban regions. We used human mortality, a severe impact, to measure health risks from air pollution and extreme temperatures.

J	Chatty, D; Mansour, N; Yassin, N				Chatty, Dawn; Mansour, Nisrine; Yassin, Nasser			Bedouin in Lebanon: Social discrimination, political exclusion, and compromised health care	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Lebanon; Middle East; Bedouin; Access to health care; Social discrimination; Political exclusion; Compromised health care; Rural health care	INEQUALITIES; CHALLENGES; JORDAN; DETERMINANTS; MORTALITY	Global inequalities in health have long been associated with disparities between rich and poor nations. The middle-income countries of the Levant (Lebanon, Syria and Jordan) have developed models of health care delivery that mirror the often complex make-up of their states. In Lebanon, which is characterized by political clientelism and sectarian structures, access to health care is more contingent on ethnicity and religious affiliation than on poverty. This case study of the Bedouin of the Middle Bekaa Valley of Lebanon is based on interviews with policymakers, health care providers and the Bedouin as part of a study funded by the European Commission between 2006 and 2010. The study explores the importance of considering social discrimination and political exclusion in understanding compromised health care. Three decades after the Declaration of Alma Ata (1978), which declared that an acceptable level of health care for all should be attained by the year 2000, the Bedouin community of Lebanon remains largely invisible to the government and, thus, invisible to national health care policy and practice. They experience significant social discrimination from health practitioners and policymakers alike. Their unfair treatment under the health system is generally disassociated from issues of wealth or poverty; it is manifested in issues of access and use, discrimination, and resistance and agency. Overcoming their political exclusion and recognizing the social discrimination they face are steps that can be taken to protect and promote equal access to basic reproductive and child health care. This case study of the Bedouin in Lebanon is also relevant to the health needs of other marginalized populations in remote and rural areas. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Indices can be used to summarize the multiple dimensions of the neighborhood socioeconomic status. This work proposes a statistical procedure to create a neighborhood socioeconomic index. Methods: The study setting is composed of three French urban areas. Socioeconomic data at the census block scale come from the 1999 census. Successive principal components analyses are used to select variables and create the index. Both metropolitan area-specific and global indices are tested and compared. Socioeconomic categories are drawn with hierarchical clustering as a reference to determine "optimal" thresholds able to create categories along a one-dimensional index. Results: Among the twenty variables finally selected in the index, 15 are common to the three metropolitan areas. The index explains at least 57% of the variance of these variables in each metropolitan area, with a contribution of more than 80% of the 15 common variables. Conclusions: The proposed procedure is statistically justified and robust. It can be applied to multiple geographical areas or socioeconomic variables and provides meaningful information to public health bodies. We highlight the importance of the classification method. We propose an R package in order to use this procedure.

GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							ELIMINATION	After a decade of rapid growth in average incomes, many countries have attained middle income country (MIC) status.At the same time, poverty has not fallen as much as one might expect and as a result most of the world's poor now live in MICs. In fact, there are up to a billion poor people or a new bottom billion' living not in the world's poorest countries but in MICs. Not only has the global distribution of poverty shifted to MICs, so has the global disease burden. This article examines the implications of this new bottom billion' the fact that up to a billion of the world's poorest people now live in MICs for global health efforts, and recommends a tailored middle income strategy for the Global Fund and GAVI. The article describes trends in the global distribution of poverty, preventable infectious diseases, and health aid response to date; revisits the rationale for health aid through agencies like GAVI and the Global Fund; and proposes a new MICs strategy and components, concluding with recommendations. Policy Implications center dot Eliminating the country income threshold as an across-the-board criterion for allocating global health funding. center dot Setting up regional pooled procurement or pricing mechanisms. center dot Building evidence based, priority setting institutions in MICs. center dot Establishing increased accountability mechanisms and providing technical support for MICs. center dot Increasing the allocative efficiency of health aid while ensuring equity.

Methods: EC counseling and supplies were offered to 322 women aged 18-25 years participating in a longitudinal reproductive health study. Participants completed interviews at enrollment and were followed for 1 year. EC acceptability and use were assessed, and factors associated with use were identified. Results: 206/320 (64.4%) participants did not desire pregnancy but only 46/321 (14.3%) used an intrauterine device or contraceptive pills. Only 25 (7.8%) had heard of ECs. Overall, 123 (38.2%) participants requested advance provisions of ECs after counseling. Over a year, 37/263 (14.1%) women used ECs, usually within 3 days of unprotected sex (33 [89.2%]), and 32 (86.5%) took both pills together or 1 day apart. Thirty-six (97.3%) felt glad and 31 (83.8%) were relieved after taking ECs. Twenty-five (67.6%) women who used ECs sought permission from their husbands. The only factor associated with EC use was couples' pregnancy intentions (odds ratio 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.43-15.58; P <= 0.01). Conclusion: Indian women with access to ECs generally used them correctly and found them acceptable. Efforts to expand EC knowledge and access should be coupled with efforts to promote gender equality in the reproductive sphere. (C) 2012 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

Between 1994 and 2006, the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study surveyed 117 nationally representative samples of adolescents about their involvement in school bullying over the previous 2 months. Country prevalence rates of bullying were matched to data on income inequality and homicides. With time and country differences held constant, income inequality positively related to the prevalence of bullying others at least twice (b = 0.25), victimisation by bullying at least twice (b = 0.29) and both bullied and victimisation at least twice (b = 0.40). The relation between income inequality and victimisation was partially mediated by country differences in homicides. Understanding the social determinants of school bullying facilitates anti-bullying policy by identifying groups at risk and exposing its cultural and economic influences. This study found that cross-national differences in income inequality related to the prevalence of school bullying in most age and gender groups due, in part, to a social milieu of interpersonal violence.

Simultaneously, issues such as professional silos, static medical curricula, and perceptions of "information overload" have made it difficult for medical training and continued professional development (CPD) to adapt to the changing needs of healthcare professionals in increasingly patient-centered, collaborative, and/or remote delivery contexts. In response to these challenges, increasing numbers of medical education and CPD programs have adopted e-learning approaches, which have been shown to provide flexible, low-cost, user-centered, and easily updated learning. The effectiveness of e-learning varies from context to context, however, and has also been shown to make considerable demands on users' motivation and "digital literacy" and on providing institutions. Consequently, there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of e-learning in healthcare as part of ongoing quality improvement efforts. This article outlines the key issues for developing successful models for analyzing e-health learning.

J	Walwyn, DR				Walwyn, David R.			Determining quantitative targets for public funding of tuberculosis research and development	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Review							DRUG DEVELOPMENT; INNOVATION; PRICE; COST	South Africa's expenditure on tuberculosis (TB) research and development (R&D) is insignificant relative to both its disease burden and the expenditure of some comparator countries with a minimal TB incidence. In 2010, the country had the second highest TB incidence rate in the world (796 per 100,000 population), and the third highest number of new TB cases (490,000 or 6% of the global total). Although it has a large TB treatment program (about $588 million per year), TB R&D funding is small both in absolute terms and relative to its total R&D expenditure. Given the risk and the high cost associated with drug discovery R&D, such neglect may make strategic sense. However in this analysis it is shown that TB R&D presents a unique opportunity to the national treasuries of all high-burden countries. Using two separate estimation methods (global justice and return on investment), it is concluded that most countries, including South Africa, are under-investing in TB R&D. Specific investment targets for a range of countries, particularly in areas of applied research, are developed. This work supports the outcome of the World Health Organization's Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development: Financing and Coordination, which has called for "a process leading to the negotiation of a binding agreement on R&D relevant to the health needs of developing countries".

From 2008 to 2010, a mass distribution campaign delivered nine million long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) free-of-charge to children under-five years of age in Tanzania mainland. In 2010 and 2011, a Universal Coverage Campaign (UCC) led by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) was implemented to cover all sleeping spaces not yet reached through previous initiatives. Methods: The UCC was coordinated through a unit within the National Malaria Control Programme. Partners were contracted by the MoHSW to implement different activities in collaboration with local government authorities. Volunteers registered the number of uncovered sleeping spaces in every household in the country. On this basis, LLINs were ordered and delivered to village level, where they were issued over a three-day period in each zone (three regions). Household surveys were conducted in seven districts immediately after the campaign to assess net ownership and use. Results: The UCC was chiefly financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria with important contributions from the US President's Malaria Initiative. A total of 18.2 million LLINs were delivered at an average cost of USD 5.30 per LLIN. Overall, 83% of the expenses were used for LLIN procurement and delivery and 17% for campaign associated activities. Preliminary results of the latest Tanzania HIV Malaria Indicator Survey (2011-12) show that household ownership of at least one ITN increased to 91.5%. ITN use, among children under-five years of age, improved to 72.7% after the campaign. ITN ownership and use data post-campaign indicated high equity across wealth quintiles. Conclusion: Close collaboration among the MoHSW, donors, contracted partners, local government authorities and volunteers made it possible to carry out one of the largest LLIN distribution campaigns conducted in Africa to date. Through the strong increase of ITN use, the recent activities of the national ITN programme will likely result in further decline in child mortality rates in Tanzania, helping to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4 and 6.

J	Duteau, J				Duteau, Jennifer			Improving the Uptake of Independent Dialysis using the Humanbecoming Theoretical Approach	SEMINARS IN DIALYSIS			English	Article							PATIENT; CARE	Soaring healthcare costs, increasing rates of chronic illness, and an aging population have left Canada struggling to meet the growing demands for quality health care. Hospitals battle to cope with altering patient demand, higher costs, provincially imposed global budgets, fast developing technology, rigid rules, new drugs, and social inequalities that lead to poor health. Canadian population health trends have played an important role in examining innovation opportunities that can dictate terms for the effective re-design of Canada's health system. Independent (home) dialysis is associated with cost savings and improved quality of life in comparison with hospital-based hemodialysis treatment. Despite this, independent dialysis has failed to increase at the same rate as hospital-based treatment for chronic kidney disease. One probable reason is the lack of healthcare providers to truly understand the patient experience of living with chronic kidney disease. Qualitative data have shown that patients living with chronic kidney disease desire independence and minimal impact to their quality of life. Parse's Humanbecoming theory has been widely accepted in nursing practice as a theoretical base in which to gain an understanding of the lived experience. The values and assumptions of the Humanbecoming theory are also congruent with patient-centered care practice and transferable to all areas of healthcare practice and disciplines.

A spatial model to quantify the mortality impact of service delivery in Sub-Saharan Africa: an ecological design utilizing data from South Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article						Service delivery; Mortality; Poverty; Income inequality; Population density	INFANT-MORTALITY; ADULT MORTALITY; GLOBAL BURDEN; HEALTH; POLICY; DETERMINANTS; INSTITUTIONS; CHILDHOOD; COUNTRIES; POVERTY	Background: Sub Saharan Africa is confronted with a wide range of interlinked health and economic problems that include high levels of mortality and poor service delivery. The objective of the paper is to develop a spatial model for Sub-Saharan Africa that can quantify the mortality impact of (poor) service delivery at sub-district level in order to integrate related health and local level policy interventions. In this regard, an expanded composite service delivery index was developed, and the data were analysed using a Bayesian Poisson spatial model. Results: The results indicate significant differences in the risk of mortality and poor service delivery at sub-district level. In particular, the results indicate clusters of high mortality and poor service delivery in two of the bigger, poorer provinces with large rural communities. Conversely, two of the wealthier provinces have lower levels of mortality and higher levels of service delivery, but income inequality is more widespread. The bivariate and multivariate models, moreover, reflect significant positive linkages (p < 0.01) between increased mortality and poor service delivery after adjusting for HIV/AIDS, income inequality, population density and the protective influence of metropolitan areas. Finally, the hypothesized provision of a basket of services reduced the mortality rate in South Africa's 248 sub-districts by an average of 5.3 (0.3-15.4) deaths per 1000. Conclusion: The results indicate that the model can accurately plot mortality and service delivery "hotspots' at subdistrict level, as well as explain their associations and causality. A mortality reduction index shows that mortality in the highest risk sub-districts can be reduced by as much as 15.4 deaths per 1000 by providing a range of basic services. The ability to use the model in a wider SSA context and elsewhere is also feasible given the innovative use of available databases. Finally, the paper illustrates the importance of developing policy in SSA that can simultaneously solve both economic and health problems.

J	Snyder, J; Crooks, VA; Turner, L; Johnston, R				Snyder, Jeremy; Crooks, Valorie A.; Turner, Leigh; Johnston, Rory			Understanding the impacts of medical tourism on health human resources in Barbados: a prospective, qualitative study of stakeholder perceptions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article								Background: Medical tourism is a global health practice where patients travel internationally with the intention of receiving medical services. A range of low, middle, and high income countries are encouraging investment in the medical tourism sector, including countries in the Caribbean targeting patients in North America and Europe. While medical tourism has the potential to provide economic and employment opportunities in destination countries, there are concerns that it could encourage the movement of health workers from the public to private health sector. Methods: We present findings from 19 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders across the public health care, private health care, government, allied business, and civil society sectors. These interviews were conducted in-person in Barbados and via phone. The interview transcripts were coded and a thematic analysis developed. Results: Three themes were identified: 1) Stakeholder perceptions of the patterns and plans for health human resource usage by current and planned medical tourism facilities in Barbados. We found that while health human resource usage in the medical tourism sector has been limited, it is likely to grow in the future; 2) Anticipated positive impacts of medical tourism on health human resources and access to care in the public system. These benefits included improved quality control, training opportunities, and health worker retention; and 3) Anticipated negative impacts of medical tourism on health human resources and access to care in the public system. These impacts included longer wait times for care and a shift in planning priorities driven by the medical tourism sector. Conclusions: Stakeholders interviewed who were connected to medical tourism expansion or the tourism sector took a generally positive view of the likely impacts of medical tourism on health human resources in Barbados. However, stakeholders associated with the public health system and health equity expressed concern that medical tourism may spread inequities in this country. The mechanisms by which observed negative health equity impacts in other countries will be avoided in Barbados are unclear. Continued study in Barbados and comparison with the regulatory frameworks in other countries is needed to help enhance positive and mitigate negative impacts of medical tourism on health human resources in Barbados. These findings will likely have import for other Caribbean nations investing in medical tourism and beyond.

By the same token, CVD is a looming threat that is creating a double burden in most of the countries where these populations originate from. The causes of the rising burden are unclear, but they are likely to be multifaceted. Traditionally, ethnicity and health research have mostly concentrated on comparing the health of ethnic minority groups with the majority populations of the countries in which they live. This is an important area of research which illuminates ethnic inequalities in health. However, a few studies on international comparisons show that a lot can be learned from comparing similar ethnic groups living in different industrialised countries. Equally, comparing ethnic minority and migrant populations to similar populations in their countries of origin will generate new knowledge about factors that predispose them to poor health outcomes. Thus, to make progress in the field of ethnicity and health research, we need a new conceptual framework that simultaneously studies migrant/ethnic groups in the country of settlement, in similar countries of settlement, and in the countries of ancestral origin. Such studies need to go beyond the commonest design of cross-sectional studies to include more cohort studies, interventions and linkage studies. This article discusses (1) the burden of CVD in ethnic minority and migrant populations; (2) approaches to understanding predisposing factors; and (3) application of the results to give insight into the potential threats that their countries of origin are likely to face.

Design Pooled cross-sectional data from the Global Youth Tobacco Surveys, conducted in low- and middle-income countries, were used to conduct multi-level logistic analyses that accounted for the nesting of students in schools and of schools in countries. Participants A total of 169283 students aged 1315 from 63 low- and middle-income countries. Measurements Current smoking was defined as having smoked at least one cigarette in the past 30 days. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was our measure of absolute income. Contemporaneous and lagged (10-year) Gini coefficients, as well as the income share ratio of the top decile of incomes to the bottom decile, were our measures of income inequality. Findings Our analyses reveal a significant positive association between levels of income and youth smoking. We find that a 10% increase in GDP per capita increases the odds of being a current smoker by at least 2.5%, and potentially considerably more. Our analyses also suggest a relationship between the distribution of incomes and youth smoking: youth from countries with more unequal distributions of income tend to have higher odds of currently smoking. Conclusions There is a positive association between gross domestic product and the odds of a young person in a low- and middle-income country being a current smoker. Given the causal links between smoking and a wide range of youth morbidities, the association between smoking and income inequality may underlie a substantial portion of the health disparities observed that are currently experiencing rapid economic growth.

Measures of inequalities are socioeconomic status, ethnic background, and living area. Recent findings Despite decreasing overall perinatal and maternal mortality in high-income countries, perinatal and maternal health inequalities persist. Inequalities in fetal, neonatal, and maternal adverse outcome relate to specific groups of risk factors. They commonly have a background in so-called structural risk factors, that is low level of education and income, being a migrant and living in disadvantaged areas. Structural risk factors therefore drive inequalities, and simultaneously represent the common perspective to judge perinatal and maternal health gaps. The effect of risk factors is further magnified in urban areas through risk accumulation. As mother and child share their background, neonatal, and maternal adverse health outcome patterns coincide, resulting in similar inequalities and similar epidemiological trends. The structural background explains the difficulty of improving this. Summary Inequalities in perinatal and maternal outcome persist in women from lower socioeconomic groups, from specific ethnic groups, and from those living in deprived areas. In view of the lifelong consequences, these marked social disparities pose an important challenge for the political decision makers and the healthcare system.	[de Graaf, Johanna P.; Steegers, Eric A.

How different determinants affect health is much debated. Contrasting suggestions include, for example, a major link with socio-economic inequalities, lack of social status and psychosocial stress or the extent of the welfare state. Others emphasise the need to understand the socio-cultural contexts of specific situations. Diet-related health is a good example of the relationship between poor health outcomes and deprivation. The aim of this paper is to explore the specific conditions and contexts that might reduce or exacerbate the provision of a healthy diet to children under 5 years in a range of nurseries supported by the Sure Start Local Programmes initiative in Liverpool. An ethnographic approach was taken to gather data from six nurseries, combining observation at the nurseries with interviews with owners and or managers (10), cooks (6), staff (12) and parents (2). The findings reveal the complex way different issues work together to support or hinder a nursery to develop a healthy eating culture and how relative inequalities, in general, are outworked. While recognising the importance of social status leading to poor health due to psychosocial stress, the findings tend to emphasise the importance of a strong welfare state and taking an early years of life-course approach in reducing health inequalities.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that public healthcare shall be extended to the whole population in conditions of effective equality and overcoming geographical and social imbalances, based on a comprehensive approach to the healthcare system. All of this - while we are aware of the current situation of economic crisis - should be taken into account before carrying out adjustments that will harm the health of citizens and options or alternatives that will not affect equity and healthcare should be weighed up. In conclusion, management models that enable the empowerment of nursing are more justified than ever before, because it is nurses who mostly defend positions of patient advocacy towards attitudes of greater commitment and participation.

Genomics for Public Health Improvement: Relevant International Ethical and Policy Issues around Genome-Wide Association Studies and Biobanks	PUBLIC HEALTH GENOMICS			English	Article						Biobanks; Ethics; Genome-wide associations; Policy	MEDICINE	Genome-wide association studies and biobanks are at the forefront of genomics research and possess unprecedented potential to improve public health. However, for public health genomics to ultimately fulfill its potential, technological and scientific advances alone are insufficient. Scientists, ethicists, policy makers, and regulators must work closely together with research participants and communities in order to craft an equitable and just ethical framework, and a sustainable environment for effective policies. Such a framework should be a ` hybrid' form which balances equity and solidarity with entrepreneurship and scientific advances. A good balance between research and policy on one hand, and privacy, protection and trust on the other is the key for public health improvement based on advances in genomics science.

Growth in private payments for health care by Canadian households	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Fees and charges; Health expenditures; Fees; Dental; Fees; Medical; Fees; Pharmaceutical	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; DENTAL-CARE; EQUITY; COST; COVERAGE; FINANCE	Introduction: Despite first-dollar public coverage for hospital and physician services, Canadians spend more privately on health care than citizens of most other developed countries. We quantified recent growth in private payments by Canadian households for health care. Methods: Using data from 163,081 respondents to Statistics Canada's annual Survey of Household Spending from 1998 to 2009, we calculated inflation-adjusted per-household spending on private health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket payments on six types of health care services. Further, we estimated the prevalence and some socio-economic determinants of households spending over 10% of after-tax income on health care using logistic regression. Results: We found that Canadian households spent $19.8 billion on private payments for health care in 2009. This represents an average of $1523 per household-a37% increase over 1998. The top three spending categories in 2009 were private health insurance premiums ($5.9 billion), dental ($4.9 billion) and prescription drugs ($4.2 billion). Even after adjusting for inflation, expenditure on every category of health care spending increased between 1998 and 2009. The proportion of households spending more than 10% of after-tax income on health care increased by 56% (from 3.3% to 5.2%). Households including a senior, with a low income, and in British Columbia or the Atlantic Provinces were significantly more likely to reach this threshold. Interpretation: Over the period studied, the burden of private health care expenditures increased substantially for Canadian households. As direct charges reduce the use of necessary health care services, investigation into the health consequences of these increases is warranted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

HEART			English	Article							ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ETHNIC-DIFFERENCES; HEART-DISEASE; WHITE PATIENTS; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; CASE-FATALITY; CHEST-PAIN; FOLLOW-UP; MORTALITY; ANGINA	Objective To determine whether the effect of South Asian ethnicity differs between studies of incidence and prognosis of coronary disease. Design Systematic literature review and meta-analysis, and cohort analysis from a national acute coronary syndrome (ACS) registry linked to mortality (National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research/Myocardial Infarction National Audit Project). Setting International for the review, and England and Wales for the cohort analysis. Patients The numbers of South Asians included in the meta-analysis were 111 555 (incidence) and 14 531 (prognosis) of whom 8251 were from the ACS cohort. Main outcome measures Incidence studies: non-fatal myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease; prognostic studies: mortality; HRs for 1-year all-cause death in ACS cohort. Results South Asians had higher incidence of coronary disease compared with white subjects (HR 1.35 95% CI 1.30 to 1.40) based on meta-analysis of nine studies. Among 10 studies on prognosis, South Asians had better prognosis compared with white subjects (HR 0.78 95% CI 0.74 to 0.82). In the ACS cohort, the impact of diabetes (42.4% of South Asians, 16.9% of white subjects) on 1-year mortality was stronger in South Asians than white subjects (age-adjusted HR 1.83 95% CI 1.59 to 2.11 vs 1.53 95% CI 1.49 to 1.57). However, prognosis was better in South Asians even among diabetics, older people and those living in areas of the highest social deprivation. Conclusions South Asian ethnicity is associated with higher incidence of coronary disease, but lower mortality once coronary disease is manifest. The dissociation between effects on incidence and prognosis suggests that public health initiatives to reduce inequalities in mortality between South Asian and white populations should focus on primary prevention.

Increasing contraceptive use and reducing unmet need for family planning are central to improving maternal health (UN Millennium Development Goal 5). In less-developed regions of the world, especially Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, human and financial resources are limited, modern contraceptive use is relatively low, unmet need for modern contraception is high, and consequently maternal morbidity and mortality are high. However, the international community is showing renewed commitment to family planning, a number of high impact program practices have been identified, and a number of Sub-Saharan African countries (e.g. Ethiopia, Malawi, and Rwanda) have successfully made family planning much more widely and equitably available. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) has joined with other international and donor organizations in calling for increased funding and more effective programming to improve maternal health and family planning in low-resource countries. Continued engagement by FIGO, its member societies, and its individual members will be helpful in addressing the numerous barriers that impede universal access to modern contraception in low-resource countries.

Objectives: Our aim was to assess the main predictors of inequity in seeking Health Care Utilities (HCU) locally. Patients and Methods: Data gathered from the HCU survey, which was conducted in the Markazi province of Iran during 2008, was used in the present study. A systematic sampling method, based on the Iranian household framework, was applied in order to choose 758 households as well as 2711 individuals. The household wealth index constructed by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and robust login link function in Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) model were used in order to determine the predictors of inequity. Results: 66.4% of those in need sought outpatient health care from which 97.7% received appropriate services. After adjustment for the clustering effect of household as well as confounding effect of the covariates, GEE model showed that there were inequities in HCU for females (OR = 2.44, CI; 1.24-4.81) and subjects with inpatient need (OR = 2.14, CI: 1.23-3.72). Being in the lowest quintile of household wealth index was associated with the lower use of outpatient health services (OR = 0.45, CI; 0.23-0.88). Conclusions: In spite of improvements in the national health indicator, different groups of people use health care services differently, but these inequities in HCU are related to social and individual factors. Also, it is clear that health sector facilities and the accessibility to health services are not the only predictors.

The viability of international guidelines for the management of children with epilepsy should be reviewed within each African country, and adapted to comply with the regional capacity. Such recommendations can be used to lobby for resources. More training centers should be developed in Africa, so that specialists can be trained within Africa, in skills relevant to the continent, in collaboration with "out of Africa" visiting-specialists to develop the concept of "train the trainers." At least 1 child neurology specialist per 100 000 of the population is required. Specific to Africa are the challenges from stigma, prejudice, and misconceptions. "Epilepsy teams," inclusive of the traditional healers, would enable management of increased numbers of children, and challenge policy such that it is the right of the child with epilepsy to have reliable access to appropriate antiepileptic drugs, support, and health care equity between the rural and urban settings.

The comparability of the HRS family of studies that have been modeled on the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is discussed. The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TILDA) is introduced, and the comparability of TILDA data with respect to the HRS family and other studies is described, along with what TILDA will add to international aging research. Data from the 2010 waves of TILDA, HRS and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing are used to compare the physical and cognitive health of older Irish adults with that of the U.S. and English populations. The study shows that the physical and cognitive health of older people in Ireland is closer to that of their English counterparts than of those in the United States and that similar health inequalities exist in all three countries.

The objective of this study was to assess the social determinants of health preventing adults >= 65 years old from accessing and accepting seasonal influenza vaccination. Methods: A systematic search was performed in January 2011 using MEDLINE, ISI - Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (1980-2011). Reference lists of articles were also examined. Selection criteria included qualitative and quantitative studies written in English that examined social determinants of and barriers against seasonal influenza vaccination among adults >= 65 years. Two authors performed the quality assessment and data extraction. Thematic analysis was the main approach for joint synthesis, using identification and juxtaposition of themes associated with vaccination. Results: Overall, 58 studies were analyzed. Structural social determinants such as age, gender, marital status, education, ethnicity, socio-economic status, social and cultural values, as well as intermediary determinants including housing-place of residence, behavioral beliefs, social influences, previous vaccine experiences, perceived susceptibility, sources of information, and perceived health status influenced seasonal influenza vaccination. Healthcare system related factors including accessibility, affordability, knowledge and attitudes about vaccination, and physicians' advice were also important determinants of vaccination. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the ability of adults >= 65 years to receive seasonal influenza vaccine is influenced by structural, intermediate, and healthcare-related social determinants which have an impact at the health system, provider, and individual levels.

We aimed to estimate the incidence of admissions and deaths for such infections in children younger than 5 years in 2010. Methods We estimated the incidence of admissions for severe and very severe ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age and region, with data from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and March 31, 2012, and from 28 unpublished population-based studies. We applied these incidence estimates to population estimates for 2010, to calculate the global and regional burden in children admitted with severe ALRI in that year. We estimated in-hospital mortality due to severe and very severe ALRI by combining incidence estimates with case fatality ratios from hospital-based studies. Findings We identified 89 eligible studies and estimated that in 2010, 11.9 million (95% CI 10.3-13.9 million) episodes of severe and 3.0 million (2.1-4.2 million) episodes of very severe ALRI resulted in hospital admissions in young children worldwide. Incidence was higher in boys than in girls, the sex disparity being greatest in South Asian studies. On the basis of data from 37 hospital studies reporting case fatality ratios for severe ALRI, we estimated that roughly 265 000 (95% CI 160 000-450 000) in-hospital deaths took place in young children, with 99% of these deaths in developing countries. Therefore, the data suggest that although 62% of children with severe ALRI are treated in hospitals, 81% of deaths happen outside hospitals. Interpretation Severe ALRI is a substantial burden on health services worldwide and a major cause of hospital referral and admission in young children. Improved hospital access and reduced inequities, such as those related to sex and rural status, could substantially decrease mortality related to such infection. Community-based management of severe disease could be an important complementary strategy to reduce pneumonia mortality and health inequities.

Strong association between unemployment and poor health status among individuals is widely recognised. We investigated whether the prevalence of poor health at a population level increased concurrent to the rise in unemployment during the economic recession, and whether the impact on health varied by geographical and socioeconomic circumstances. Method: Health, demographic and socioeconomic measures on 1.36 million survey responses aged 16-64 were extracted from the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of the United Kingdom, collected every three months, from January 2006 to December 2010. The likelihood of self-reporting poor health status and specific types of health problems (depression, mental illness, cardiovascular and respiratory) across time were estimated separately using logistic regression. Explanatory variables included economic status (International Labour Organization definition), occupational class, age, gender, country of birth, ethnicity, educational qualifications, couple status, household tenure, number of dependents, and geographical region. Results: Unemployment (age-gender adjusted) rose from 4.5% in January 2008 to 7.1% by September 2009. The reporting of poor health status increased from 25.7% in July 2009 to 29.5% by December 2010. Similar increases were found for cardiovascular and respiratory health problems; not depression or mental illness. The prevalence of poor health status among the unemployed decreased from 28.8% in July 2008, to 24.9% by March 2009; but this was followed by an increase in poor health experienced across all regions and by all socioeconomic groups, including those who remained employed, regardless of their occupational class. Interpretation: Although our study found no exacerbation of pre-recession health inequalities, the rise in poor health status not only for the unemployed, but also among people who remained employed, regardless of their occupational class, justifies concern voiced among many public health commentators.

While liberalisation of abortion law is essential to the reduction of unsafe abortion, a number of challenges exist beyond this important step. This paper investigates how popular health system reforms consonant with neoliberal agendas can challenge access to safe abortion. We use Mongolia, a country that has liberalised abortion law, yet, limited access to safe abortion, as a case study. Mongolia embraced market reforms in 1990 and subsequently reformed its health system. We document how common reforms in the areas of finance and regulation can compromise the safety of abortions as they foster challenges that include inconsistencies in service delivery that further foment health inequities, adoption of reproductive health programmes that are incompatible with the local sociocultural context, unregulated growth of the private sector and poor enforcement of standards and technical guidelines for safe abortion. We then discuss how this case study suggests the conversations that reproductive health policy-makers must have with those engineering health sector reform to ensure access to safe abortion in a liberalised environment.

Development and Implementation of Health Technology Assessment: A Policy Study	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health Technology Assessment; Development; Health equity; Iran		Background: To provide an overview of the development of health technology assessment (HTA) in Iran since 2007, and to facilitate further development of HTA and its integration into policy making. Methods: Data of this study were collected through key documents (e. g. literature, laws, and other official documentation) and analyzed by experts of opinion in form of qualitative methods. Results: Health technology assessment entered to the political agenda in Iran only in 2007 with a strong impetus of an evidence-based medicine movement with the bellow objectives: Institutionalization of evidence-based decision making in Ministry of Health, Creating an localization for structural HTA in Health system of Iran, Setting up training courses in order to educate capable manpower to full up the capacity of the universities, Establishment of a new field in HTA subject in medical universities for MSc and PhD degree, International communication about HTA through national website and possible participation in international Congress. Conclusion: HTA has been established in the healthcare system of Iran but what is needed is a clear political will to push forward the objectives of HTA in Iran. Similar to other countries, advance the regulation on the adoption of new health technologies to improve not only technical or allocate efficiency, but also health equity.	[Doaee, S.

However, empirical studies in the area remain sparse. The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences and needs of LGBT people over the age of 55 years living in Ireland and this article reports on specific mental health issues. Mixed methods were used involving 144 surveys and 36 semi-structured in-depth interviews. The findings revealed that a significant number of the survey respondents had experienced a mental health problem at some point in their lives with interview participants providing further details of their concerns. It is recommended that policy makers address the mental health needs of older LGBT people in future strategic directives and develop standards of care that support the principles of equality, inclusion and respect for diversity.

These regions combine a considerable set of barriers to containing the epidemic, including shortage of healthcare workers, poor medical infrastructures, insufficient screening and poor access to care and treatment. At a time when morbidity and mortality of chronic liver disease has been widely improved in wealthy countries by new innovative strategies and potent antiviral drugs, it is now urgent to face the challenges of better management of chronic hepatitis in resource-poor countries from the perspectives of global health and social justice.

A two-level hierarchical model found that the odds of experiencing a brief depressive episode in the last 12 months was significantly higher for Southern/Ex- dictatorship countries than for Southeast Asian (odds ratio (OR) = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05-0.27) and Eastern European (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.22-0.58) regimes after controlling for gender, age, education, marital status, and economic development. In adjusted interaction models, compared to Southern/Ex-dictatorship males (reference category), the odds ratios of depression were significantly lower among Southeast Asian males (OR = 0.16, 95% CI 0.08-0.34) and females (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.53) and Eastern European males (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.26-0.63) and significantly higher among females in Liberal (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.14-3.49) and Southern (OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.86-3.15) regimes. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating middle-income countries into comparative welfare regime research and testing for interactions between welfare regimes and gender on mental health.

J	Mandil, A; Chaaya, M; Saab, D				Mandil, Ahmed; Chaaya, Monique; Saab, Dahlia			Health status, epidemiological profile and prospects: Eastern Mediterranean region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Eastern Mediterranean Region; epidemiology; burden of disease; health profile; morbidity; mortality	MORTALITY	Background This article aims at providing an overview of the current epidemiological situation in the heterogeneous Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). It is one in a series of eight articles appointed by the International Epidemiological Association to improve the epidemiological situation. Methods Several resources were used to extract morbidity, mortality and risk factors data that contribute mostly to the burden of disease and highlight health inequalities. Medline search was used to estimate epidemiological publications output by country. Indexing status of Index Medicus for the Eastern Mediterranean (IMEMR) journals in Medline/PubMed was checked. A questionnaire was designed to collect data from epidemiological associations on type of work and workforce. Authors' knowledge and networks were used to get a perspective on the training, research and funding sources. Results Large inequalities exist between EMR nations especially ones pertaining to social conflicts. The EMR age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate per 1000 population is higher than the global one, with most contribution of communicable diseases in low-and middle-income countries (45%) and non-communicable diseases in high-income countries (64%). Iran and Pakistan have the highest number of publications from 1996-2012, but Kuwait has the highest rate of publications per 100 000 population. The majority of IMEMR journals are not indexed in Medline/PubMed. Masters in Public Health is the most common form of training. Conclusions Efforts are required to ameliorate the epidemiological situation. There is a dire need for health evidence-based policy change and for field training of epidemiologists.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the quality of tuberculosis (TB) evaluation for men and women presenting to primary health care facilities in high-burden settings. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using indicators derived from the International Standards of Tuberculosis Care (ISTC) to compare the quality of TB evaluation services provided to men and women. RESULTS: Of 161 230 patient visits between January 2009 and December 2010, 112 329 (69.7%) were women. We considered 3308 (2.1%) patients with cough >= 2 weeks as TB suspects, of whom 1871 (56.6%) were women. Female TB suspects were less likely to be referred for sputum smear examination (45.9% vs. 61.6%, SUMMARY P < 0.001), to complete sputum smear examination if referred (73.7% vs. 78.3%, P = 0.024) and to receive comprehensive evaluation and care as defined by the ISTC (33.0% vs. 45.6%, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, clinic site and visit date, women remained less likely to be referred for sputum smear examination (risk ratio [RR] 0.81, 95%CI 0.74-0.89, P < 0.001) and to receive ISTC-recommended care (RR 0.79, 95%CI 0.72-0.86, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Strategies to ensure that women receive appropriate TB evaluation could provide a valuable opportunity for increasing case detection while also promoting equitable and universal access to care.

SMPP is a Japanese aid-funded technical cooperation project aimed at developing local capacities to tackle maternal and newborn health problems in rural areas. We assessed whether the project interventions, in particular, community-based activities under the Model Union approach, had a favorable impact on women's access to and knowledge of maternal health care during pregnancy and childbirth. The project comprises a package of interlinked interventions to facilitate safe motherhood practices at primary and secondary care levels. The primary-level activities focused on community mobilization through participatory approaches. The secondary-level activities aimed at strengthening organizational and personnel capacities for delivering emergency obstetric care (EmOC) at district and sub-district level hospitals. The project impact was estimated by difference-in-differences logistic regressions using two rounds of cross-sectional household survey data. The results showed that the project successfully increased the utilization of antenatal visits and postpartum EmOC services and also enhanced women's knowledge of danger signs during pregnancy and delivery. The project also reduced income inequalities in access to antenatal care. In contrast, we found no significant increase in the use of skilled birth attendants (SBA) in the project site. Nonetheless, community mobilization activities and the government's voucher scheme played a complementary role in promoting the use of SBA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite mounting evidence showing that treatment with praziquantel is safe, beneficial, and could be delivered within ongoing public health interventions, young children still do not have satisfactory access to this drug, and a significant treatment gap exists. Progress towards resolution of this unfortunate health inequity is highlighted, including the development of an appropriate paediatric praziquantel formulation, and present blocks are identified on securing this issue within the international health agenda.

J	Marshall, RE; Farahbakhsh, K				Marshall, Rachael E.; Farahbakhsh, Khosrow			Systems approaches to integrated solid waste management in developing countries	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Systems approaches; Integrated solid waste management; Developing countries; Industrialized countries; Post-normal science; Complex adaptive systems	COMPLEXITY; SCIENCE; CHALLENGES; GUATEMALA; TRENDS; LIFE	Solid waste management (SWM) has become an issue of increasing global concern as urban populations continue to rise and consumption patterns change. The health and environmental implications associated with SWM are mounting in urgency, particularly in the context of developing countries. While systems analyses largely targeting well-defined, engineered systems have been used to help SWM agencies in industrialized countries since the 1960s, collection and removal dominate the SWM sector in developing countries. This review contrasts the history and current paradigms of SWM practices and policies in industrialized countries with the current challenges and complexities faced in developing country SWM. In industrialized countries, public health, environment, resource scarcity, climate change, and public awareness and participation have acted as SWM drivers towards the current paradigm of integrated SWM. However, urbanization, inequality, and economic growth; cultural and socio-economic aspects; policy, governance, and institutional issues; and international influences have complicated SWM in developing countries. This has limited the applicability of approaches that were successful along the SWM development trajectories of industrialized countries. This review demonstrates the importance of founding new SWM approaches for developing country contexts in post-normal science and complex, adaptive systems thinking. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, while there is some commonality between rural areas, there is increasing recognition that a one size fits all approach to rural health is ineffective as it fails to align healthcare with local population need. Community participation is proposed as a strategy to engage communities in developing locally responsive healthcare. Current policy in several countries reflects a desire for meaningful, high level community participation, similar to Arnstein's definition of citizen power. There is a significant gap in understanding how higher level community participation is best enacted in the rural context. The aim of our study was to identify examples, in the international literature, of higher level community participation in rural healthcare. Methods: A scoping review was designed to map the existing evidence base on higher level community participation in rural healthcare planning, design, management and evaluation. Key search terms were developed and mapped. Selected databases and internet search engines were used that identified 99 relevant studies. Results: We identified six articles that most closely demonstrated higher level community participation; Arnstein's notion of citizen power. While the identified studies reflected key elements for effective higher level participation, little detail was provided about how groups were established and how the community was represented. The need for strong partnerships was reiterated, with some studies identifying the impact of relational interactions and social ties. In all studies, outcomes from community participation were not rigorously measured. Conclusions: In an environment characterised by increasing interest in community participation in healthcare, greater understanding of the purpose, process and outcomes is a priority for research, policy and practice.

In the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) of Asia, high socio-economic diversity and fertile conditions for the emergence and spread of infectious diseases underscore the importance of transnational cooperation. Investigation of healthcare resource distribution and inequalities can help determine the need for, and inform decisions regarding, resource sharing and mobilisation. Methods: We collected data on healthcare resources deemed important for responding to pandemic influenza through surveys of hospitals and district health offices across four countries of the GMS (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Vietnam). Focusing on four key resource types (oseltamivir, hospital beds, ventilators, and health workers), we mapped and analysed resource distributions at province level to identify relative shortages, mismatches, and clustering of resources. We analysed inequalities in resource distribution using the Gini coefficient and Theil index. Results: Three quarters of the Cambodian population and two thirds of the Laotian population live in relatively underserved provinces (those with resource densities in the lowest quintile across the region) in relation to health workers, ventilators, and hospital beds. More than a quarter of the Thai population is relatively underserved for health workers and oseltamivir. Approximately one fifth of the Vietnamese population is underserved for beds and ventilators. All Cambodian provinces are underserved for at least one resource. In Lao PDR, 11 percent of the population is underserved by all four resource items. Of the four resources, ventilators and oseltamivir were most unequally distributed. Cambodia generally showed higher levels of inequalities in resource distribution compared to other countries. Decomposition of the Theil index suggests that inequalities result principally from differences within, rather than between, countries. Conclusions: There is considerable heterogeneity in healthcare resource distribution within and across countries of the GMS. Most inequalities result from within countries. Given the inequalities, mismatches, and clustering of resources observed here, resource sharing and mobilization in a pandemic scenario could be crucial for more effective and equitable use of the resources that are available in the GMS.

The country government and partners, including international donors, typically contract international and local NGOs to deliver the BPHS. Evidence from routine data suggests that a BPHS approach results in rapid increases in service coverage, coordination, equity, and efficiency. However, studies also show progress may then slow down, the cause of which is not immediately obvious from routine data. Qualitative research can provide insight into possible barriers in the implementation process, particularly the role of health workers delivering the BPHS services. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of health service providers and policy makers on the implementation of the BPHS in post-conflict Liberia, using SRH services as a tracer and Lipsky's work on "street-level bureaucrats" as a theoretical framework. In July-October 2010, 63 interviews were conducted with midwives, officers-in-charge, and supervisors in two counties of Liberia, and with policy makers in Monrovia. The findings suggest health workers had a limited understanding of the BPHS and associated it with low salaries, difficult working conditions, and limited support from policy makers. Health workers responded by sub-optimal delivery of certain services (such as facility-based deliveries), parallel private services, and leaving their posts. These responses risk distorting and undermining the BPHS implementation. There were also clear differences in the perspectives of health workers and policy makers on the BPHS implementation. The findings suggest the need for greater dialogue between policy makers and health workers to improve understanding of the BPHS and recognition of the working conditions in order to help achieve the potential benefits of the BPHS in Liberia.

Missed opportunities: childhood learning disabilities as early indicators of risk among homeless adults with mental illness in Vancouver, British Columbia	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							SUBSTANCE USE; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT	Objectives: It is well documented that early-learning problems and poor academic achievement adversely impact child development and a wide range of adult outcomes; however, these indicators have received scant attention among homeless adults. This study examines self-reported learning disabilities (LD) in childhood as predictors of duration of homelessness, mental and substance use disorders, physical health, and service utilisation in a sample of homeless adults with current mental illness. Design: This study was conducted using the baseline sample from a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Setting: Participants were sampled from the community in Vancouver, British Columbia. Participants: The total sample included 497 adult participants who met criteria for absolute homelessness or precarious housing and a current mental disorder based on a structured diagnostic interview. Learning disabilities in childhood were assessed by asking adult participants whether they thought they had an LD in childhood and if anyone had told them they had an LD. Only participants who responded positively to both questions (n=133) were included in the analyses. Outcome measures: Primary outcomes include current mental disorders, substance use disorders, physical health, service utilisation and duration of homelessness. Results: In multivariable regression models, self-reported LD during childhood independently predicted self-reported educational attainment and lifetime duration of homelessness as well as a range of mental health, physical health and substance use problems, but did not predict reported health or justice service utilisation. Conclusions: Childhood learning problems are overrepresented among homeless adults with complex comorbidities and long histories of homelessness. Our findings are consistent with a growing body of literature indicating that adverse childhood events are potent risk factors for a number of adult health and psychiatric problems, including substance abuse. Trials registration number: This trial has been registered with the International Standard Randomised Control Trial Number Register and assigned ISRCTN42520374.

Methods: Data from Demographic Health Surveys collected in Albania (2008-09), Armenia (2005), Azerbaijan (2006) and Ukraine (2007) were used to estimate age-adjusted differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), hypertension (HTN), elevated blood pressure, and optimal blood pressure across a standardized wealth index, level of educational attainment, and urban versus rural residence. Results: The wealthiest Albanian females had lower average SBP, DBP, PP (all p<0.01) and HTN status (odds ratio [OR]=0.3, CI: 0.2-0.5, p<0.001) compared to the poorest; similar education gradients were also found. Such disparities also existed for Albanian men. Among Armenian women, urban (OR=1.4, 1.1-1.8, p<0.01), more educated (OR=0.7, CI: 0.6-0.9, p<0.01), and wealthier (OR=1.8, 1.4-2.4, p<0.001) women were more likely to have optimal blood pressure. Urban Armenian men were also more likely to have optimal blood pressure (OR=1.8, 1.2-2.9, p<0.01). Wealthier and urban Azerbaijani had lower risk of elevated blood pressure and Azerbaijani women displayed strong wealth gradients with higher quintiles of wealth associated with lower continuous blood pressure measures. There were no socioeconomic gradients for Ukrainian males or females. Conclusions: There is compelling evidence that wealth and education gradients affect the probability of HTN for women in Albania, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, and for men in Albania.

The relevance of globalization to nursing: a concept analysis	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						Ecology; Globalization; Health Promotion; Nursing; Social Justice; Sustainability	HEALTH; EDUCATION; KNOWLEDGE; PROFESSION; COMMUNITY; FUTURE; ISSUES; IMPACT; CARE	GROOTJANS J. & NEWMAN S. (2013) The relevance of globalization to nursing: a concept analysis. International Nursing Review60, 7885 Background: This paper emerged alongside the development of learning materials for a new unit of study on global health and nursing. The proposed unit was for inclusion in a graduate entry master of nursing course leading to registration. It became evident that there has been growing attention within the nursing literature to the demands of an increasingly globalized world and the subsequent challenges confronting nursing as a profession. At the same time, the literature is inconsistent and contains mixed messages with regard to how nurses and nursing might respond to these challenges. Aim: This paper aims to (i) present the findings of a narrative analysis of the current nursing discourse on globalization, and (ii) to identify directional cohesiveness for the nursing profession in the seemingly disparate literature. Method: Concept analysis following extensive literature review. Findings: Several nursing authors argue that nurses globally are increasingly sharing concerns expressed by nurses at a local level. Concerns such as the future sustainability of the profession and more specifically practice concerns such as the continuing failure of nurses to adequately deal with social justice issues requires careful consideration by every nurse. While strategies recommended for dealing with these concerns lack a cohesive thread, some interesting themes and innovative recommendations have emerged. For example, the need for nurses to consider replacing environmental considerations with ecological considerations and that nurses consider preventative nursing practice beyond the immediate needs of clients and from a more global perspective.

J	Reinhardt, JD; Wahrendorf, M; Siegrist, J				Reinhardt, Jan D.; Wahrendorf, Morten; Siegrist, Johannes			Socioeconomic position, psychosocial work environment and disability in an ageing workforce: a longitudinal analysis of SHARE data from 11 European countries	OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							EFFORT-REWARD IMBALANCE; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; SOCIAL SUPPORT; HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; SF-36; ICF	Objectives Prevention of disability in the ageing workforce is essential for sustaining economic growth in Europe. In order to provide information on entry points for preventive measures, it is important to better understand sociodemographic, socioeconomic and work-related determinants of disability in older employees. We aimed to test the hypothesis that low socioeconomic position and exposure to a stressful psychosocial work environment at baseline contribute to later disability. We further assumed that the association of socioeconomic position with disability is partly mediated by exposure to adverse working conditions. Methods We studied longitudinal data from the first two waves of the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe comprising 11 European countries. Sociodemographic, socioeconomic and work-related factors (low control, effort-reward imbalance) and baseline disability of 2665 male and 2209 female employees aged between 50 and 64 years were used to predict disability 2 years later. Following the International Classification of Functioning (ICF), disability was subdivided into the components 'impairment' and 'restriction in activities and participation'. Two multilevel Poisson regressions were fitted to the data. Results After adjusting for baseline disability and relevant confounding variables, low socioeconomic position and chronic stress at work exerted significant effects on disability scores 2 years later. We found some support for the hypothesis that the association of socioeconomic position with disability is partly mediated by work stress. Conclusions Investing in reduction of work stress and reducing social inequalities in health functioning are relevant entry points of policies that aim at maintaining work ability in early old age.

The understanding of the spatial relationships between ChO and socio-environmental status is critical in order to control this epidemic. In this paper, we investigate these relationships and consider empirical evidence from Athens, Greece. We examine the association between ChO and socioeconomic status (education level, family income) and living conditions (population density, land cover of green and recreational areas) by using both global and local statistical analyses. For this purpose, we used survey obesity data collected in 2007 from 18,296 students in the primary schools of Athens. Moreover, we investigated the significance and spatial inequalities of the association between ChO and socio-environmental conditions of the study area. The results from global statistical modeling showed that education level is the most significant predictor of ChO. Furthermore, local Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling revealed that areas characterized by low educational level, high population density, low family income and limited coverage of green/recreation zones constituted an "obesogenic" environment. The findings of the proposed analysis promote our understanding of the factors influencing childhood obesity and may prove beneficial for the development of policies that target ChO.

Death and destruction alter the structure and dynamics of households, including their demographic profiles and traditional gender roles. To date, attention to the gender impacts of conflict has focused almost exclusively on sexual and gender-based violence. We show that a far wider set of gender issues must be considered to better document the human consequences of war and to design effective postconflict policies. The emerging empirical evidence is organized using a framework that identifies both the differential impacts of violent conflict on males and females (first-round impacts) and the role of gender inequality in framing adaptive responses to conflict (second-round impacts). Wars mortality burden is disproportionately borne by males, whereas women and children constitute a majority of refugees and the displaced. Indirect war impacts on health are more equally distributed between the genders. Conflicts create households headed by widows who can be especially vulnerable to intergenerational poverty. Second-round impacts can provide opportunities for women in work and politics triggered by the absence of men. Households adapt to conflict with changes in marriage and fertility, migration, investments in childrens health and schooling, and the distribution of labor between the genders. The impacts of conflict are heterogeneous and can either increase or decrease preexisting gender inequalities. Describing these gender differential effects is a first step toward developing evidence-based conflict prevention and postconflict policy.

J	Granados, JAT				Granados, Jose A. Tapia			Health at advanced age: Social inequality and other factors potentially impacting longevity in nine high-income countries	MATURITAS			English	Review						Life expectancy; Population health; Health of the elderly; Health policy; International comparisons	POPULATION HEALTH; CHANGING RELATION; MORTALITY; UNEMPLOYMENT; DETERMINANT; LEVEL; LIFE	This article surveys the evolution of health at advanced age in nine high-income countries over the last three decades, and the variables that might explain that evolution. Life expectancy at age 65 for males and females is used as summary indicator to conceptualize "health at advanced age." A comparison of the nine countries - Canada, Denmark, France, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States - reveals excellent health performance for Japan, which has the greatest proportion of elderly people in the population and also the best health indicators for both males and females; the United States and Denmark perform poorly. Of all nine countries, the United States has the youngest population, the highest income per capita, and the greatest expenditure on health care, but also the highest levels of income inequality and relative poverty, and lacked universal health care coverage during the study period. Experts have considered that these three factors have probably contributed to the poor progress in the health of the elderly in the United States in recent decades. Tobacco consumption appears to be a key influence on the health of the elderly and probably explains to a large extent - with a lag of several decades - the differential evolution of health in these countries.

Inter-jurisdictional cooperation on pharmaceutical product listing agreements: views from Canadian provinces	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Prescription drugs; Reimbursement mechanisms; Risk sharing; International cooperation; Canada		Background: Confidential product listing agreements (PLAs) negotiated between pharmaceutical manufacturers and individual health care payers may contribute to unwanted price disparities, high administrative costs, and unequal bargaining power within and across jurisdictions. In the context of Canada's decentralized health system, we aimed to document provincial policy makers' perceptions about collaborative PLA negotiations. Methods: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with a senior policy maker from nine of the ten Canadian provinces. We conducted a thematic analysis of interview transcripts to identify benefits, drawbacks, and barriers to routine collaboration on PLA negotiations. Results: Canadian policy makers expressed support for joint negotiations of PLAs in principle, citing benefits of increased bargaining power and reduced inter-jurisdictional inequities in drug prices and formulary listings. However, established policy institutions and the politics of individual jurisdictional authority are formidable barriers to routine PLA collaboration. Achieving commitment to a joint process may be difficult to sustain among heterogeneous and autonomous partners. Conclusions: Though collaboration on PLA negotiation is an extension of collaboration on health technology assessment, it is a very significant next step that requires harmonization of the outcomes of decision-making processes. Views of policy makers in Canada suggest that sustaining routine collaborations on PLA negotiations may be difficult unless participating jurisdictions have similar policy institutions, capacities to implement coverage decisions, and local political priorities.

J	Ismail, S				Ismail, Sharif			INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND HEALTH IN EGYPT AND TUNISIA: CHANGE OR CONTINUITY?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							INEQUITY	The revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia appeared to herald a re-casting of International Monetary Fund and World Bank policy across the region. Public pronouncements by the heads of both institutions in the months following February 2011 acknowledged flaws in their approach to macroeconomic advice, against a background of worsening socioeconomic indicators, widespread youth unemployment, and widening health inequalities. Evidence on the ground, however, suggests continuity rather than change in international financial institution policies in Egypt and Tunisia, notwithstanding the emergence of a powerful new player-the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In the long term, new electoral realities and hardening public opposition in both countries seem likely to force a fundamentally different relationship between regional governments and the major international financial institutions than existed before 2011.

New research in health equity is required, especially amongst economic migrants from developing countries. Studies conducted on the use of health services by migrant populations highlight existing gaps in understanding which factors affect access to these services from a qualitative perspective. We aim to describe the views of the migrants regarding barriers and determinants of access to health services in the international literature (1997-2011). Methods: A systematic review was conducted for Qualitative research papers (English/Spanish) published in 13 electronic databases. A selection of articles that accomplished the inclusion criteria and a quality evaluation of the studies were carried out. The findings of the selected studies were synthesised by means of metasynthesis using different analysis categories according to Andersen's conceptual framework of access and use of health services and by incorporating other emergent categories. Results: We located 3,025 titles, 36 studies achieved the inclusion criteria. After quality evaluation, 28 articles were definitively synthesised. 12 studies (46.2%) were carried out in the U. S and 11 studies (42.3%) dealt with primary care services. The participating population varied depending mainly on type of host country. Barriers were described, such as the lack of communication between health services providers and migrants, due to idiomatic difficulties and cultural differences. Other barriers were linked to the economic system, the health service characteristics and the legislation in each country. This situation has consequences for the lack of health control by migrants and their social vulnerability. Conclusions: Economic migrants faced individual and structural barriers to the health services in host countries, especially those with undocumented situation and those experimented idiomatic difficulties. Strategies to improve the structures of health systems and social policies are needed.

J	Sohn, M				Sohn, Myongsei			Globalization of Public Health Law and Ethics	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						WHO Constitution; The Asian Institute for Bioethics and Health Law; legal analysis tool		The Constitution of the World Health Organization (1946) states that the "enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social position." The international legal framework for this right was laid by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and reaffirmed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (1966) and the Declaration of Alma-Ata (1978). In recent years, the framework has been developed on 10 key elements: national and international human rights, laws, norms, and standards; resource constraints and progressive realization; obligations of immediate effect; freedoms and entitlements; available, accessible, acceptable, and good quality; respect, protect, and fulfill; non-discrimination, equality, and vulnerability; active and informed participation; international assistance and cooperation; and monitoring and accountability. Whereas public health law plays an essential role in the protection and promotion of the right to health, the emergence of SARS (2003) highlighted the urgent need to reform national public health laws and international obligations relating to public health in order to meet the new realities of a globalized world, leading to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (2003) and the revision of the WHO International Health Regulations (2005). The Asian Institute for Bioethics and Health Law, in conjunction with the Republic of Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare and the WHO International Digest of Health Legislation, conducted a comparative legal analysis of national public health laws in various countries through a project entitled Domestic Profiles of Public/Population Health Legislation (2006), which underscored the importance of recognizing the political and social contexts of distinct legal cultures, including Western, Asian, Islamic, and African.

Forecasting High-Priority Infectious Disease Surveillance Regions: A Socioeconomic Model	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						communicable diseases; disease outbreaks; socioeconomic factors; public health; epidemiology	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; INEQUALITY; INCOME; EPIDEMIOLOGY; EMERGENCE; MORTALITY	Background. Few researchers have assessed the relationships between socioeconomic inequality and infectious disease outbreaks at the population level globally. We use a socioeconomic model to forecast national annual rates of infectious disease outbreaks. Methods. We constructed a multivariate mixed-effects Poisson model of the number of times a given country was the origin of an outbreak in a given year. The dataset included 389 outbreaks of international concern reported in the World Health Organization's Disease Outbreak News from 1996 to 2008. The initial full model included 9 socioeconomic variables related to education, poverty, population health, urbanization, health infrastructure, gender equality, communication, transportation, and democracy, and 1 composite index. Population, latitude, and elevation were included as potential confounders. The initial model was pared down to a final model by a backwards elimination procedure. The dependent and independent variables were lagged by 2 years to allow for forecasting future rates. Results. Among the socioeconomic variables tested, the final model included child measles immunization rate and telephone line density. The Democratic Republic of Congo, China, and Brazil were predicted to be at the highest risk for outbreaks in 2010, and Colombia and Indonesia were predicted to have the highest percentage of increase in their risk compared to their average over 1996-2008. Conclusions. Understanding socioeconomic factors could help improve the understanding of outbreak risk.

Family Health Nursing: A Response to the Global Health Challenges	JOURNAL OF FAMILY NURSING			English	Article						family health nursing; family health nurse; global health challenge; global health care workforce; international collaboration	EDUCATION	The European Family Health Nursing Project is a revitalized World Health Organization initiative led by the University of the West of Scotland. Partner countries include Armenia, Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain. European Union Lifelong Learning funding was received in 2011 to facilitate a consistency of approach in the development of a definition of family health nursing, required core competencies and capabilities, and consequent education and training requirements. Global health challenges have informed the development of the project: increasingly aging populations, the increasing incidence in noncommunicable diseases that are currently the main cause of death, and the significant progress made in the way health systems have developed to meet the demands in relation to access and equality of health services. Governments and policy makers should develop a health workforce based on the principles of teamwork and interdisciplinarity while recognizing the core contribution of the "specialist generalist" role in the primary care setting.

Methods: The study was based on a sample of 15,362 men and 20,272 women from the nationally representative European Quality of Life Survey conducted in 31 European countries in 2007. SRH was measured using a single item and dichotomised into good (very good, good) and poor (fair, bad, very bad) health. Education was classified into seven categories according to the International Standard Classification of Education. Relative index of inequality, multilevel logistic regression analyses, and interaction tests were conducted. Results: Educational differences in SRH were found in almost all countries. After adjustment for covariates, no differences were found in Austria, Denmark, or the Netherlands. The highest differences were observed for both genders in Ireland and Macedonia. Women had significant larger educational differences in SRH than men in Portugal but significant lower differences in Czech Republic and Lithuania. Conclusions: The study underlined that the magnitude of educational differences in SRH varied according to gender and country.

Yet, it was not until the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London that every country's delegation included a female competitor. The gender gap in sport, although closing, remains, due to biological differences affecting performance, but it is also influenced by reduced opportunity and sociopolitical factors that influence full female participation across a range of sports around the world. Until the cultural environment is equitable, scientific discussion related to physiological differences using methods that examine progression in male and female world-record performances is limited. This commentary is intended to provide a forum to discuss issues underlying gender differences in sport performance from a global perspective and acknowledge the influence of cultural and sociopolitical factors that continue to ultimately affect female performance.

Methods: We used claims data extracted from Medicaid Analytic Extract files to identify appendicitis diagnoses in children and adolescents based on International Classification of Diseases-9 codes and appendectomy procedures based on Current Procedural Terminology codes in the hurricane-affected states of Mississippi and Louisiana. County-level summary data obtained from 2005 Area Resource Files were used to determine high and low hurricane-affected areas. We estimated logistic regression models, mutually adjusting for race, sex, and age, to examine disparities and mixed logistic regression models to determine whether county-level effects contributed to perforation rates. Results: There were nine counties in the high-impact area and 133 counties in the low-impact area. Living in the high-or low-impact area was not associated with a statistically different rate of perforation before or after Hurricane Katrina; however, living in the high-impact area was associated with a change from a lower risk (odds ratio [OR] 0.62) of perforation prehurricane to a higher risk (OR 1.14) posthurricane compared with those living in the low-impact areas. African Americans had statistically higher perforation rates than whites in the high-impact areas both before (OR 1.46) and after (OR 1.71) Hurricane Katrina. Conclusions: Health professionals and hospital systems were able to maintain effective levels of care before and after Hurricane Katrina; however, perforation rates in African Americans suggest ongoing racial disparities during disasters.

The level of inequity also varies by cultural and socio-economic contexts. To tailor RH services to the needs of youths, relevant solutions are required. This study aimed to assess baseline information on access to and utilization of RH services and unmet needs among youths living in resource-limited, suburban communities of Mandalay City, Myanmar. Methods: A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in all resource-limited, suburban communities of Mandalay City, Myanmar. A total of 444 randomly selected youths aged between 15 and 24 years were interviewed for three main outcomes, namely accessibility to and utilization of RH services and youth's unmet needs for these services. Factors associated with these outcomes were determined using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Although geographical accessibility was high (79.3%), financial accessibility was low (19.1%) resulting in a low overall accessibility (34.5%) to RH services. Two-thirds of youths used some kind of RH services at least once in the past. Levels of unmet needs for sexual RH information, family planning, maternal care and HIV testing were 62.6%, 31.9%, 38.7% and 56.2%, respectively. Youths living in the south or south-western suburbs, having a deceased parent, never being married or never exposed to mass media were less likely to access RH services. Being a young adult, current student, working as a waste recycler, having ever experienced a sexual relationship, ever being married, ever exposed to mass media, having a high knowledge of RH services and providers or a high level of accessibility to RH services significantly increased the likelihood of utilization of those services. In addition to youths' socio-demographic characteristics, exposure to mass media, norm of peer exposure and knowledge on types of providers and services significantly influenced the unmet needs of youths towards RH services. Conclusion: Despite the availability of RH services, youth's accessibility to and utilization of those services were unsatisfactory. The levels of youths' unmet RH needs were alarmingly high.

J	Tsosie, R				Tsosie, Rebecca			INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE: SCIENCE, ETHICS, AND HUMAN RIGHTS	WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW			English	Article							POPULATION GENOMICS; AMERICAN; INDIANS; HISTORY; TRIBES	This Article explores the use of science as a tool of public policy and examines how science policy impacts indigenous peoples in the areas of environmental protection, public health, and repatriation. Professor Tsosie draws on Miranda Fricker's account of "epistemic injustice" to show how indigenous peoples have been harmed by the domestic legal system and the policies that guide the implementation of the law in those three arenas. Professor Tsosie argues that the theme of "discovery," which is pivotal to scientific inquiry, has governed the violation of indigenous peoples' human rights since the colonial era. Today, science policy is overtly "neutral," but it may still be utilized to the disadvantage of indigenous peoples. Drawing on international human rights law, Professor Tsosie demonstrates how public policy could shift from treating indigenous peoples as "objects" of scientific discovery to working respectfully with indigenous governments as equal participants in the creation of public policy. By incorporating human rights standards and honoring indigenous self-determination, domestic public policy can more equitably respond to indigenous peoples' distinctive experience. Similarly, scientists and scientific organizations can incorporate human rights standards into their disciplinary methods and professional codes of ethics as they respond to the ethical and legal implications of their work.

J	Roa, AC; de Santana, JP				Roa, Alejandra Carrillo; de Santana, Jose Paranagu			Regional integration and south-south cooperation in health in Latin America and the Caribbean	REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						International cooperation; technical cooperation; horizontal cooperation; Latin America		This paper analyzes whether south-south cooperation is legitimately a recent practice or merely an improved version of previous regional integration processes in Latin America and the Caribbean. The authors reviewed and systematized the historic development of subregional integration processes in Latin America and the Caribbean and focused on health cooperation in the following contexts: the Central American Integration System, the Andean Community of Nations, the Caribbean Community, the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, the Southern Common Market, and the Union of South American Nations. The study concludes that the conceptual and methodologic foundations of south-south cooperation in health were born from and nurtured by the processes of regional integration in Latin America and the Caribbean. This paper posits that regional political and economic integration initiatives bring potential benefits to the health sector and act as an important mechanism to develop south-south cooperation in this domain. The study recommends furthering this type of research to provide information that will allow national and multilateral agencies, or other stakeholders, to formulate and implement better policies for international health cooperation that target reducing inequities and promoting health and well-being for all people.

Sharing experiences to improve bereavement support and clinical care after stillbirth: report of the 7th annual meeting of the international stillbirth alliance	ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						Grief; improving care; perinatal audit; staff support; stillbirth	DUAL PROCESS MODEL; NEONATAL DEATH; POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION; PERINATAL AUTOPSY; FETAL DEATHS; AUDIT; PROFESSIONALS; DEPRESSION; PREGNANCY; PARENTS	Stillbirth remains a global health challenge which is greatly affected by social and economic inequality, particularly the availability and quality of maternity care. The International Stillbirth Alliance (ISA) exists to raise awareness of stillbirth and to promote global collaboration in the prevention of stillbirth and provision of appropriate care for parents whose baby is stillborn. The focus of this ISA conference was to share experiences to improve bereavement support and clinical care. These issues, relevant throughout the globe, are not discrete but closely interrelated, with both similarities and differences depending on the specific country and cultural context. Counting stillbirths and understanding the causes of stillbirth are essential not only for providing optimal care and support to parents whose babies die, but also for reducing the future burden of stillbirth. This summary highlights novel work from obstetricians, midwives, psychologists, parents and peer support organizations that was presented at the ISA meeting. It covers topics including the bereavement process, peer support for parents, support and training for staff, evidence for clinical care, and the need for accurate data on stillbirths and perinatal audits. Representatives from the maternity services of the region presented their outcome data and shared their experiences of clinical and bereavement care. Data and developments in practice within stillbirth and bereavement care must be widely disseminated and acted upon by those responsible for maternity care provision, both to prevent stillbirths and to provide high-quality care when they do occur.

J	Ingram, A				Ingram, Alan			After the Exception: HIV/AIDS Beyond Salvation and Scarcity	ANTIPODE			English	Article						HIV; AIDS; exception; neoliberalism; governmentality; global health; security	AIDS	Access to treatment for HIV/AIDS became a flashpoint for global justice struggles in the late 1990s. An expanding international response, premised to a significant extent on the idea of HIV/AIDS as an exceptional global problem, has since delivered treatment, care and prevention to growing numbers of people. HIV/AIDS exceptionalism, however, has increasingly been questioned, many aspects of the response have been critiqued and donor funding has started to decline. I argue that, having been framed as an exceptional humanitarian emergency, the question of HIV/AIDS as a global problem is increasingly located within a discourse of scarcity. Tracking the growing entanglement of global HIV/AIDS relief with neoliberal governmentality and the emergence of something I term therapeutic neoliberalism, I argue that the shift from a rationality of salvation to one of administration poses new challenges for global health activism. Questioning the discourse of scarcity remains essential to an alternative global health agenda.

Recognizing that NCDs are a global health and development priority, Heads of State and government adopted the Political Declaration on NCDs (resolution A/RES/66/2) at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2011. The Political Declaration of the United Nations High Level meeting on NCDs, World Health Organization (WHO) reports on NCDs and WHO Country Cooperation Strategy documents. NCDs are a growing threat to health and development. Cost of action and inaction are known. Accountability of all stakeholders including the private sector is essential for an effective global public health response. More clarity is needed on the private sector contribution to the response to safeguard public health from any potential conflict of interest. A country-led public health policy response should include, at a minimum, national scale-up of very cost-effective, high impact NCD interventions to improve health outcomes and health equity with universal coverage as a long-term public health goal. Policy reform and accelerated national scale-up action, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries, must be guided by translation research and feedback information from monitoring and evaluation.

Canada recognized the importance of mobilizing research, and informing programs and policies focused on promoting the health of males and females across their lifespans by creating a national research institute that is focused on the study of gender, sex and health. No other country has created a national research institute dedicated to gender and health. Other countries may benefit from the strategies used by this Canadian research institute to create and sustain success, including: (i) mechanisms for defining national research priorities; (ii) tools to optimize research excellence; (iii) vehicles to build research capacity and develop a research community; (iv) processes to convert new knowledge into practice, programs and policies; (v) creation of partnerships at both the national and international levels and (vi) solutions to challenges and obstacles. The development of a vibrant research community and powerful national and international collaborations promotes gender and health equity.

In this observational study we hypothesise that OW might influence ANS profile even in a population performing high volume of supervised exercise. We study 103 young soccer players, homogeneous in terms of gender (all male), cultural background, school, age (11.2 +/- 1 years) and exercise routine, since they all belong to the same soccer club, thus guaranteeing equality of supervised training and similar levels of competitiveness. ANS is evaluated by autoregressive spectral analysis of heart rate and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) variabilities. We estimate also the accumulated weekly Metabolic Equivalents and time spent in sedentary activities. We subdivide the entire population in two subgroups (normal weight and OW) based on the International Obesity Task Force criteria. In OW soccer players (10.7% of total group) we observe an altered profile of autonomic cardiovascular regulation, characterised by higher values of SAP (113 +/- 4 vs 100 +/- 1 mm Hg, 39.7 +/- 3 vs 66.2 +/- 10%), higher Low Frequency variability power of SAP (an index of vasomotor sympathetic regulation) (12 +/- 3 vs 4.5 mm Hg-2) and smaller spontaneous baroreflex gain (an index of cardiac vagal regulation) (19 +/- 3 vs 33 +/- 3 ms/mm Hg) (all (p<0.02)). Moreover Correlation analysis on the entire study population shows a significant link between anthropometric and autonomic indices. These data show that OW is associated to a clear autonomic impairment even in children subjected to an intense aerobic training.

The diversity of regulation and public financing of IVF in Europe and its impact on utilization	HUMAN REPRODUCTION			English	Article						IVF; regulation; public financing; utilization; Europe	ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY; HEALTH-CARE; REGISTERS	How do the different forms of regulation and public financing of IVF affect utilization in otherwise similar European welfare state systems? Countries with more liberal social eligibility regulations had higher levels of IVF utilization, which diminished as the countries policies became more restrictive. Europe is a world leader in the development and utilization of IVF, yet surveillance reveals significant differences in uptake among countries which have adopted different approaches to the regulation and and public financing of IVF. A descriptive and comparative analysis of legal restrictions on access to IVF in 13 of the EU15 countries that affirmatively regulate and publicly finance IVF. Using 2009 data from the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology study of regulatory frameworks in Europe and additional legislative research, we examined and described restrictions on access to IVF in terms of general eligibility, public financing and the scope of available services. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to identify patterns of regulation and groups of countries with similar regulatory patterns and to explore the effects on utilization of IVF, using data from the most recent European and international IVF monitoring reports. Regulations based on social characteristics of treatment seekers who are not applicable to other medical treatments, including relationship status and sexual orientation, appear to have the greatest impact on utilization. Countries with the most generous public financing schemes tend to restrict access to covered IVF to a greater degree. However, no link could be established between IVF utilization and the manner in which coverage was regulated or the level of public financing. Owing to the lack of data regarding the actual level of public versus private financing of IVF it is impossible to draw conclusions regarding equity of access. Moreover, the regulatory and utilization data were not completely temporally matched in what can be a quickly changing regulatory landscape. Whether motivated by cost, eligility restrictions or the availability of particular services, cross-border treatment seeking is driven by regulatory policies, underscoring the extra-territorial implications of in-country political decisions regarding access to IVF. There was no funding source for this study. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.	[Brigham, K.

Lack of adequate access and high cost of essential medicines and technologies in many countries increases morbidity and mortality and cost of care that forces people and families into poverty due to disability and out-of-pocket expenses. This review illustrates the potential of value-added global health care comparative effectiveness research in shaping health systems and health care delivery paradigms in the "global south". Enabling the development of effective CER systems globally paves the way for tangible local and regional definitions of equity in health care because CER fosters the sharing of critical assets, resources, skills, and capabilities and the development of collaborative of multi-sectorial frameworks to improve health outcomes and metrics globally.

(2013) Healthcare context and nursing workforce in a main city of Angola. International Nursing Review 60, 37-44 Background Angola is one of the largest African countries with continuing levels of insecurity, considerable weakness in terms of respect for human rights, destroyed infrastructure and low transparency and social accountability levels. The health system displays gaps and nursing represents the main contingent among human resources in health. Aim This research aims to understand the healthcare context in Angola from the perspective of Brazilian nurses who were involved in helping their Angolan colleagues. This general view of health services is followed by a description of nursing workforce particularities at a tertiary health service in the province of Luanda. Methods Data were extracted from the database of the Global Network of World Health Organization Collaborating Centres for Nursing and Midwifery Development, constructed based on technical visits to Angola in 2009. Information related to health service characteristics was used, focusing on nursing human resource activities at two tertiary, one secondary and one primary health institutions located in the province of Luanda. The study data were analysed through descriptive statistics. Findings Among the problems the nursing workforce faces, the lack of human, material and financial resources stands out, as well as insufficient professional qualification, excessive work journeys, low remunerations, non-valuation of professionals, leading to unsatisfactory work environments and discouraged human resources. Conclusions Nursing in Angola is conquering its professional space. Therefore, regulatory policies are fundamental, defining the rights and obligations of all categories involved, with a view to determining nurses' function in the health team, including respect for and acknowledgement of their role in the community.

Following a brief review of the governments inheritance from its predecessor, we review the assessments made in the other papers in this issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy: the change in the macroeconomic policy framework (which apparently worked well for a decade but was then struck by the global financial crisis); labour market, social security, and education policies and inequality; public investment and public service delivery (especially health); and corporate taxation. We discuss the constraints under which the government operated, how much it broke with the past, and the new frameworks it introduced. We identify strengths and weaknesses and draw lessons from the governments record about the need to remain receptive to other and critical ideas, on the one hand, and the need for Labour to spell out the kind of economy and society it wants to see develop, on the other.

Methods The authors modified the priority-setting method of the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) to obtain input from nearly 300 researchers, health programme managers and donors with wide-ranging backgrounds and experiences and from all geographic regions. In a three-Phase process, they asked these experts to: (i) rank outcome areas in order of importance; (ii) formulate research questions within each area, and (iii) rank the formulated questions. Findings Seven areas of adolescent sexual and reproductive health were identified as important: (i) maternal health; (ii) contraception; (iii) gender-based violence; (iv) treatment and care of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; (v) abortion; (vi) integration of family planning and HIV-related services and (vii) sexually transmitted infections. Experts generated from 30 to 40 research questions in each area, and to prioritize these questions, they applied five criteria focused on: clarity, answerability, impact, implementation and relevance for equity. Rankings were based on overall mean scores derived by averaging the scores for individual criteria.-Experts agreed strongly on the relative importance of the questions in each area. Conclusion Research questions on the prevalence of conditions affecting adolescents are giving way to research questions on the scale-up of existing interventions and the development of new ones. CHNRI methods can be used by donors and health programme managers to prioritize research on adolescent sexual and reproductive health.

Restructuring brain drain: strengthening governance and financing for health worker migration	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						brain drain; health worker migration; health policy; global health; global health governance; health system strengthening	HUMAN-RESOURCES; WORKFORCE	Background: Health worker migration from resource-poor countries to developed countries, also known as "brain drain", represents a serious global health crisis and a significant barrier to achieving global health equity. Resource-poor countries are unable to recruit and retain health workers for domestic health systems, resulting in inadequate health infrastructure and millions of dollars in healthcare investment losses. Methods: Using acceptable methods of policy analysis, we first assess current strategies aimed at alleviating brain drain and then propose our own global health policy based solution to address current policy limitations. Results: Although governments and private organizations have tried to address this policy challenge, brain drain continues to destabilise public health systems and their populations globally. Most importantly, lack of adequate financing and binding governance solutions continue to fail to prevent health worker brain drain. Conclusions: In response to these challenges, the establishment of a Global Health Resource Fund in conjunction with an international framework for health worker migration could create global governance for stable funding mechanisms encourage equitable migration pathways, and provide data collection that is desperately needed.

SDM is a collaborative process that engages health care professional(s) and the client in making health decisions and is fundamental for informed consent and patient-centred care. The objective of this study is to explore Aboriginal women's health and social decision-making needs and to engage Aboriginal women in culturally adapting an SDM approach. Methods: Using participatory research principles and guided by a postcolonial theoretical lens, the proposed mixed methods research will involve three phases. Phase I is an international systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions for Aboriginal peoples' health decision-making. Developed following dialogue with key stakeholders, proposed methods are guided by the Cochrane handbook and include a comprehensive search, screening by two independent researchers, and synthesis of findings. Phases II and III will be conducted in collaboration with Minwaashin Lodge and engage an urban Aboriginal community of women in an interpretive descriptive qualitative study. In Phase II, 10 to 13 Aboriginal women will be interviewed to explore their health/social decision-making experiences. The interview guide is based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework and previous decisional needs assessments, and as appropriate may be adapted to findings from the systematic review. Digitally-recorded interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analyzed inductively to identify participant decision-making approaches and needs when making health/social decisions. In Phase III, there will be cultural adaptation of an SDM facilitation tool, the Ottawa Personal Decision Guide, by two focus groups consisting of five to seven Aboriginal women. The culturally adapted guide will undergo usability testing through individual interviews with five to six women who are about to make a health/social decision. Focus groups and individual interviews will be digitally-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed inductively to identify the adaptation required and usability of the adapted decision guide. Discussion: Findings from this research will produce a culturally sensitive intervention to facilitate SDM within a population of urban Aboriginal women, which can subsequently be evaluated to determine impacts on narrowing health/social decision-making inequities.

Discussion: The first part sets the context by examining the growing complexity that characterizes the global health field, where women's needs occupy center stage. Part two briefly describes a critical conceptual evolution, i.e. from maternal to reproductive to women's health. In the third and last section, the novel "women and health" (W&H) approach and its translation into policies and programs in the context of a structural health reform in Mexico is discussed. W&H simultaneously focuses on women's health needs and women's critical roles as both formal and informal providers of health care, and the links between these two dimensions. Summary: The most important message of this paper is that broad changes in health systems offer the opportunity to address women's health needs through innovative approaches focused on promoting gender equality and empowering women as drivers of change.

Initial draft recommendations issued in November 2009 were followed by a full revised guideline in July 2010. The 2010 recommendations on PMTCT have important implications in terms of planning, human capacity and resources. Ministries of health therefore had to adapt their national guidelines to reflect the 2010 PMTCT recommendations, and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation tracked the adaptation process in the 14 countries where it provides technical support. In doing so it sought to understand common issues, challenges, and the decisions reached and to properly target its technical assistance. In 2010, countries revised their national guidelines in accordance with WHO's most recent PMTCT recommendations faster than in 2006; all 14 countries included in this analysis formally conducted the revision within 15 months of the 2010 PMTCT recommendations' release. Governments used various processes and fora to make decisions throughout the adaptation process; they considered.factors such as feasibility, health delivery infrastructure, compatibility with 2006 WHO guidelines, equity and cost. Challenges arose; in some cases the new recommendations were implemented before being formally adapted into national guidelines and no direct guidance was available in various technical areas. As future PMTCT guidelines are developed, WHO, implementing partners and other stakeholders can use the information in this paper to plan their support to ministries of health.

Factors associated with this phenomenon vary significantly depending on the context. Some research into the health of immigrants has been conducted in Latin America, mostly from a qualitative perspective. This population-based study is the first quantitative study to explore healthcare provision entitlement and use of healthcare services by immigrants in Chile and compare them to the Chilean-born. Methods: Data come from the nationally representative CASEN (Socioeconomic characterization of the population in Chile) surveys, conducted in 2006 and 2009. Self-reported immigrants were compared to the Chilean-born, by demographic characteristics (age, sex, urban/rural, household composition, ethnicity), socioeconomic status (SES: education, household income, contractual status), healthcare provision entitlement (public, private, other, none), and use of primary services. Weighted descriptive, stratified and adjusted regression models were used to analyse factors associated with access to and use of healthcare. Results: There was an increase in self-reported immigrant status and in household income inequality among immigrants between 2006 and 2009. Over time there was a decrease in the rate of immigrants reporting no healthcare provision and an increase in reporting of private healthcare provision entitlement. Compared to the Chilean-born, immigrants reported higher rates of use of antenatal and gynaecological care, lower use of well-baby care, and no difference in the use of Pap smears or the number of attentions received in the last three months. Immigrants in the bottom income quintile were four times more likely to report no healthcare provision than their equivalent Chilean-born group (with different health needs, i.e. vertical inequity). Disabled immigrants were more likely to have no healthcare provision compared to the disabled Chilean-born (with similar health needs, i.e. horizontal inequity). Factors associated with immigrants' access to, and use of, healthcare were sex, urban/rural status, education and country of origin. Conclusion: There were significant associations between SES, and access to and use of healthcare among immigrants in Chile and a higher prevalence of no health care provision entitlement among poor and disabled immigrants compared to the Chilean-born. Changing associations between access and use of healthcare and SES among immigrants in Chile over time may reflect changes in their socio-demographic composition or in the survey methodology between 2006 and 2009.

A total of 1885 children, 952 girls and 933 boys, aged 3.0-10.0 years, were observed. The children's weight and height were measured, and their parents filled out the "Environmental Module" questionnaire of the International Physical Activity Prevalence Study. Age and sex-speci'fic BMI cut-off points were used to define being overweight/obese. Environmental characteristics were combined into 2 composite neighborhood indices that were used as predictors in logistic regression models. Girls living in neighborhoods perceived as having poorly built environmental conditions had increased odds of being obese (OR=1.47; p<0.005), and girls living in neighborhoods perceived as being unsafe and dangerous had also increased odds of being obese (OR=1.339; p<0.005). These relationships were not evident for boys. Improvements in the neighborhood environment could be a strategy for tackling the growing epidemic of childhood obesity and can simultaneously contribute to reduce health iniquities across population subgroups.

Furthermore, the core issues appear universally consistent. This paper combines the theoretical base for defining these injustices with reports in the international health literature about the impact of coal mining on local communities. It explores and analyses mechanisms of coal mining related injustice, conflicting priorities and power asymmetries between political and industry interests versus inhabitants of mining communities, and asks what would be required for considerations of health to take precedence over wealth.

Likewise, nearly all health-care interventions occur in clinics and hospitals. An underdeveloped area for public health-related planning that carries international implications is the cultural heritage sector, and specifically museums and art galleries. This paper presents a rationale for the use of museums and art galleries as sites for public health interventions and health promotion programmes through discussing the social role of these organisations in the health and well-being of the communities they serve. Recent research from several countries is reviewed and integrated into a proposed framework for future collaboration between cultural heritage, health-care and university sectors to further advance research, policy development and evidence-based practice.

Shared cultural norms for justice in water institutions: Results from Fiji, Ecuador, Paraguay, New Zealand, and the US	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cross-cultural; Cultural consensus; Fairness; Institutions; Justice; Water	CONSENSUS THEORY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BELIEFS; PRIVATIZATION; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; MODELS	It is widely agreed that current institutions are insufficient to meet global water challenges, and extensive institutional reforms are needed. To achieve effective local water management, institutional rules should be congruent with local cultural norms. Conversely, a major potential challenge is posed by tensions between institutional rules and local cultural norms for justice. We propose and demonstrate a new approach to cross-cultural analysis designed to investigate this tension, which can assess when local cultural norms are likely to facilitate or impede the acceptance of specific institutional rules. Using data from 238 respondents in five global sites (in Fiji, Ecuador, Paraguay, New Zealand, and the U.S.) analyzed using cultural consensus analysis, we find evidence of culturally-shared norms of justice in water institutions in at least six domains: a human right to water, water governance, water access, environmental stewardship, aspects of water markets, and aspects of water quality and health. Additionally, local cultural models across sites differed on only two topics: (1) ownership and allocation and (2) restrictions and enforcement. Indigenous heritage is the best single predictor of views on controversial institutional rules dealing with water restrictions/enforcement and ownership/allocation. This approach can help build effective water management solutions by identifying cases in which specific institutional reforms are congruent with local cultural norms (or not), and when those will matter most.

And although a clear consensus on the hypothesis is yet to emerge, a new wave of empirical studies has strengthened the case for seeing income inequality as a social determinant of health. This article examines the current trajectory of the income inequality - health literature, and explores two issues that will be critical to its development in the coming years: (1) the need to re-examine the epistemological grounding of this research area, with a corresponding shift towards blurring the division between positivism and critical realism, and (2) the value of re-considering the geo-political 'frame' of studies in this field, with a move towards a truly global analysis of the health effects of income inequality.

J	Carey, G; Riley, T; Crammond, B				Carey, Gemma; Riley, Therese; Crammond, Brad			The Australian Government's 'Social Inclusion Agenda': the intersection between public health and social policy	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						marginalisation; participation; social policy	INCOME INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; NETWORKS	Social exclusion and social inclusion have been popular policy themes in the UK and Europe, and made more modest appearances in countries such as Canada and New Zealand, for over a decade. In 2007, the Australian Government became the latest country in this trend of structuring social policy around issues of exclusion, launching its 'Social Inclusion Agenda' (SIA). The SIA aims to increase social and economic participation through a reorientation of social services and increased attention to issues of equity. At the same time, there has been international consensus on the importance of the social determinants of health (such as education, income and gender) for individuals and populations. The SIA has the potential to make a substantive contribution to the social determinants of health and hence the health and wellbeing of the population. However, much will depend on the extent to which international discourses of inclusion, exclusion, structural inequality and third way politics are taken up, adapted or discarded in the Australian context. At this formative stage of the SIA's development, the public health community is in a unique position to contribute to the development and direction of the SIA to secure the potential health gains it offers. This article outlines the formulation of social inclusion policy in Australia, and discusses the potential promises and pitfalls of a social inclusion approach. Our examination of the Australian experience of social inclusion policy provides an opportunity to reflect on the relationship between social inclusion and health internationally.

We distinguish between direct and indirect channels of influence, and develop a conceptual model that builds on the literature analyzing the impacts of globalization on social determinants of health. The most pertinent direct pathways discussed are economic contraction, health budget cutbacks, rise in unemployment, and qualitative transformations of health systems. We also outline how other indirect channels of influence are likely to affect health equity, including cutbacks to welfare programs, labor market transformations, the emergence of an ideological climate conducive to austerity politics, and reductions in official development assistance. We conclude by suggesting that the current intensification of neoliberal policy implementation is likely to undermine health equity, and that a different path toward economic recovery is required to ensure equitable access to health care.

This study uses survey data to calculate household socio-economic-status (SES) indices in seven countries where national drinking-water quality surveys are available. These are used to assess inequalities in access as indicated by type of improved water source, use of safe water, and a combination of these. In Bangladesh, arsenic exposure through drinking-water is not significantly related to SES (p = 0.06) among households using tubewells, whereas in Peru, chlorine residual in piped systems varies significantly with SES (p < 0.0001). In Ethiopia, Nicaragua, and Nigeria, many poor households access nonpiped improved sources, which may provide unsafe water, resulting in greater inequality of access to "safe" water compared to "improved" water sources. Concentration indices increased from 0.08 to 0.15, 0.10 to 0.14, and 0.24 to 0.26, respectively, in these countries. There was minimal difference in Jordan and Tajikistan. Although the results are likely to be underestimates as they exclude individual-level inequalities, they show that use of a binary "improved"/"unimproved" categorization masks substantial inequalities. Future international monitoring programmes should take account of inequality in access and safety.

Developing an undergraduate curriculum in Special Care Dentistry - by consensus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION			English	Article						special care dentistry; education; curriculum; Delphi; international classification of functioning	DENTAL EDUCATION; DELPHI TECHNIQUE; INTELLECTUAL-DISABILITY; SPECIAL NEEDS; GUIDELINES; OBJECTIVES; WORKSHOP; ORACLE	It has been reported that healthcare providers often lack the skills set to provide care for people with disabilities, leading to inequalities in health and reduced access to health care. Newly graduating dentists are likely to see a significant number of patients with special healthcare needs in the course of their practicing lives. However, there is evidence of national and international variation in the availability of education and training at the undergraduate level in this important, emerging area. The quality and content of undergraduate education in Special Care Dentistry has been shown to correlate with students' confidence and their expressed willingness, towards providing care for patients with special healthcare needs in their future practice. The aim of this study was to use information from a three-round Delphi process, continued into a face-to-face meeting, to establish consensus on what constitutes the essential core knowledge, skills and attitudes required by a newly qualified dentist so that they are able to deliver patient care to diverse populations following graduation. A high level of agreement was established amongst an international panel of experts from 30 countries. The final core items identified by the panel showed a paradigm shift away from the traditional emphasis on medical diagnosis within a curriculum towards an approach based on the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) with patient-centred treatment planning for people with disabilities and special healthcare needs according to function or environment. Many of the core skills identified by the panel are transferable across a curriculum and should encourage a person-centred approach to treatment planning based on the function, needs and wishes of the patient rather than their specific diagnosis.

J	Wright, N; Stickley, T				Wright, N.; Stickley, T.			Concepts of social inclusion, exclusion and mental health: a review of the international literature	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						health and social policy; mental health; nursing theory; social policy; social support	WORK	Social inclusion and exclusion are concepts which have been widely associated with politics and policy in the first decade of the 2000s. People with mental health problems have become the focus of a range of social inclusion initiatives. A literature review was conducted to explore the peer-reviewed evidence relating social inclusion/exclusion and mental health. In total 36 papers were included in the review from the UK, Canada, Australia and Scandinavia. The papers had used a range of different approaches to research and evaluation. The included papers associated being socially included to: social roles and responsibilities such as employment, participation in social activities, environmental work and voting. Although some papers engaged in a critical discussion of the concept, many offered only simplistic accounts or definitions. Social inclusion is such a widely used term within political and policy discourses that it is surprising so little research is available within the mental health realm. There was a lack of clarity related to the concept of social exclusion and the qualitative studies focused entirely on the experiences of being excluded within an institutional or semi-institutional setting. The relationship between exclusion, inequality and injustice is identified and the relevance of the concept to current and future mental health policy is questioned.

We aimed to describe the investments awarded to UK institutions for infectious disease research. Methods We systematically searched databases and websites for information on research studies from funding institutions and created a comprehensive database of infectious disease research projects for the period 1997-2010. We categorised studies and funding by disease, cross-cutting theme, and by a research and development value chain describing the type of science. Regression analyses were reported with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to establish the relation between research investment, mortality, and disease burden as measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Findings We identified 6170 funded studies, with a total research investment of UK 2.6 pound billion. Studies with a dear global health component represented 35.6% of all funding (927 pound million). By disease, HIV received 461 pound million (17.7%), malaria 346 pound million (13.3%), tuberculosis 149 pound million (5.7%), influenza 80 pound minion (3.1%), and hepatitis C 60 pound million (2.3%). We compared funding with disease burden (DALYs and mortality) to show low levels of investment relative to burden for gastrointestinal infections (254 pound million, 9.7%), some neglected tropical diseases (184 pound million, 7.1%), and antimicrobial resistance (96 pound million, 3.7%). Virology was the highest funded category (1 pound billion, 38.4%). Leading funding sources were the Wellcome Trust (688 pound million, 26.4%) and the Medical Research Council (673 pound million, 25.8%). Interpretation Research funding has to be aligned with prevailing and projected global infectious disease burden. Funding agencies and industry need to openly document their research investments to redress any inequities in resource allocation.

Health professional schools striving towards social accountability founded the Training for Health Equity Network (THEnet). Aim: This article describes the development of THEnet evaluation framework for socially accountable health professional education, presents the framework to be used as a tool by other schools and discusses the findings of pilot implementation at five schools. Methods: The framework was designed collaboratively and built on Boelen and Woollard's conceptualization, production and usability model. It includes key components, linked to aspirational statements, indicators and suggested measurement tools. Five schools completed pilot implementation, involving workshops, document/data review and focus group discussions with faculty, students and community members. Results: Three sections of the framework consider: How does our school work?; What do we do? and What difference do we make? Pilot testing proved that the evaluation framework was acceptable and feasible across contexts and produced findings useful at school level and to compare schools. The framework is designed as a formative exercise to help schools take a critical look at their performance and progress towards social accountability. Initiatives to implement the framework more widely are underway. The framework effectively aids in identifying strengths, weaknesses and gaps, with a view to schools striving for continuous self-improvement. Conclusion: THEnet evaluation framework is applicable and useful across contexts. It is possible and desirable to assess progress towards social accountability in health professional schools and this is an important step in producing health professionals with knowledge, attitudes, and skills to meet the challenges of priority health needs of underserved populations.

Perceived risks around choice and decision making at end-of-life: A literature review	PALLIATIVE MEDICINE			English	Review						Choice behaviour; decision making; end-of-life; palliative care; risk factors	SPECIALIST PALLIATIVE CARE; HEALTH-CARE; OLDER-PEOPLE; HOSPICE CARE; NEEDS; HOME; VIEWS; PREFERENCES; INFORMATION; EXPERIENCES	Background: the World Health Organization identifies meeting patient choice for care as central to effective palliative care delivery. Little is known about how choice, which implies an objective balancing of options and risks, is understood and enacted through decision making at end-of-life. Aim: to explore how perceptions of 'risk' may inform decision-making processes at end-of-life. Design: an integrative literature review was conducted between January and February 2010. Papers were reviewed using Hawker et al.'s criteria and evaluated according to clarity of methods, analysis and evidence of ethical consideration. All literature was retained as background data, but given the significant international heterogeneity the final analysis specifically focused on the UK context. Data source: the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Assia, British Nursing Index, High Wire Press and CINAHL were explored using the search terms decision*, risk, anxiety, hospice and palliative care, end-of-life care and publication date of 1998-2010. Results: thematic analysis of 25 papers suggests that decision making at end-of-life is multifactorial, involving a balancing of risks related to caregiver support; service provider resources; health inequalities and access; challenges to information giving; and perceptions of self-identity. Overall there is a dissonance in understandings of choice and decision making between service providers and service users. Conclusion: the concept of risk acknowledges the factors that shape and constrain end-of-life choices. Recognition of perceived risks as a central factor in decision making would be of value in acknowledging and supporting meaningful decision making processes for patients with palliative care needs and their families.

UNICEF maintains a set of global databases representing nearly 200 countries and covering the areas of child mortality, child health, maternal health, nutrition, immunization, water and sanitation, HIV/AIDS, education and child protection. These databases consist of internationally comparable and statistically sound data, and are updated annually through a process that draws on a wealth of data provided by UNICEF's wide network of > 150 field offices. The databases are composed primarily of estimates from household surveys, with data from censuses, administrative records, vital registration systems and statistical models contributing to some key indicators as well. The data are assessed for quality based on a set of objective criteria to ensure that only the most reliable nationally representative information is included. For most indicators, data are available at the global, regional and national levels, plus sub-national disaggregation by sex, urban/rural residence and household wealth. The global databases are featured in UNICEF's flagship publications, inter-agency reports, including the Secretary General's Millennium Development Goals Report and Countdown to 2015, sector-specific reports and statistical country profiles. They are also publicly available on www.childinfo.org, together with trend data and equity analyses.

The purpose of this study was to review the evidence on factors and interventions which are effective in promoting coverage and access to cataract and other health services, focusing on developing countries. Methods: A thorough literature search for systematic reviews was conducted. Information resources searched were Medline, The Cochrane Library and the Health System Evidence database. Medline was searched from January 1950 to June 2010. The Cochrane Library search consisted of identifying all systematic reviews produced by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care. These reviews were assessed for potential inclusion in the review. The Health Systems Evidence database hosted by MacMaster University was searched to identify overviews of systematic reviews. Results: No reviews met the inclusion criteria for cataract surgery The literature search on other health sectors identified 23 systematic reviews providing robust evidence on the main factors facilitating universal coverage. The main enabling factors influencing access to services in developing countries were peer education, the deployment of staff to rural areas, task shifting, integration of services, supervision of health staff, eliminating user fees and scaling up of health insurance schemes. Conclusion: There are significant research gaps in eye care. There is a pressing need for further high quality primary research on health systems-related factors to understand how the delivery of eye care services and health systems' capacities are interrelated.

Community member perspectives from transgender women and men who have sex with men on pre-exposure prophylaxis as an HIV prevention strategy: implications for implementation	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Men who have sex with men (MSM); Male-to-female (MTF) transgender women; HIV/AIDS; Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP); Qualitative research; Health disparities	DEPARTMENT-OF-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; LIMITED KNOWLEDGE; CONDOM USE; RISK; GAY; INFECTION; POSTEXPOSURE; MOBILIZATION	Background: An international randomized clinical trial (RCT) on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-prevention intervention found that taken on a daily basis, PrEP was safe and effective among men who have sex with men (MSM) and male-to-female transgender women. Within the context of the HIV epidemic in the United States (US), MSM and transgender women are the most appropriate groups to target for PrEP implementation at the population level; however, their perspectives on evidenced-based biomedical research and the results of this large trial remain virtually unknown. In this study, we examined the acceptability of individual daily use of PrEP and assessed potential barriers to community uptake. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with an ethnoracially diverse sample of thirty HIV-negative and unknown status MSM (n = 24) and transgender women (n = 6) in three California metropolitan areas. Given the burden of disease among ethnoracial minorities in the US, we purposefully oversampled for these groups. Thematic coding and analysis of data was conducted utilizing an approach rooted in grounded theory. Results: While participants expressed general interest in PrEP availability, results demonstrate: a lack of community awareness and confusion about PrEP; reservations about PrEP utilization, even when informed of efficacious RCT results; and concerns regarding equity and the manner in which a PrEP intervention could be packaged and marketed in their communities. Conclusions: In order to effectively reduce HIV health disparities at the population level, PrEP implementation must take into account the uptake concerns of those groups who would actually access and use this biomedical intervention as a prevention strategy. Recommendations addressing these concerns are provided.

J	Wardle, LD				Wardle, Lynn D.			INVOLUNTARY IMPORTS: <i>WILLIAMS</i>, <i>LUTWAK</i>, THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT, FEDERALISM, AND "THICK" AND "THIN" CONCEPTIONS OF MARRIAGE	FORDHAM LAW REVIEW			English	Article							FULL FAITH; FAMILY; CONSTITUTION; RECOGNITION; CREDIT; LIFE; LAW	Profound conflicts may arise when persons enter into a same-sex marriage in one jurisdiction where such marriages are permitted and then attempt to import that marital status into another jurisdiction where same-sex marriage is not allowed. The Supreme Court established the standards for horizontal (interstate) recognition of marital status in Williams v. North Carolina I and II and the standards for vertical (state-federal, or federal-international) recognition of marriage were set in Lutwak v. United States. DOMA codifies both principles. The 2012 First Circuit decision invalidating DOMA in Massachusetts v. U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is criticized for misrepresenting the facts and misapplying federalism principles and equality precedent. There are compelling justifications to protect the traditional "thick" conception of marriage as a gender-integrating institution rich with meaning and responsibility, and to reject the new "thin" conception of marriage with diminished requirements, duties, and more subjective content. Courts should be resistant to letting political movements distort sound judicial analysis. Prudence on the part of the same-sex movement, including an effort to accomplish its goals legislatively rather than through the courts, and respectful tolerance of differing views, may increase the value and longevity of this social movement's contributions to the development of the law.

J	Hoffman, SJ				Hoffman, Steven J.			Mitigating Inequalities of Influence among States in Global Decision Making	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							HEALTH SECURITY; CIVIL-SOCIETY; POLITICS; ORGANIZATIONS; CAPACITY; DISEASE	International institutions should be as equal as they claim to be, especially since many of them assert superordinate normative authority based on having egalitarian governance structures. However, when defining equality with respect to states' real-world influence in determining substantive outcomes, it is evident that there is an equality-influence gap between the rhetoric of parity among states and the reality of international politics. This is problematic because it undermines trust in those international institutions that falsely claim to embody equality among states when empirically they do not. Focusing on the United Nations System, this paper identifies three main causes of this disproportional influence among states in global decision making: (a) external imbalances in political capital; (b) internal economic barriers; and (c) surreptitious influence through non-state actors, funding and training. Six pragmatic strategies are proposed for mitigating these inequalities: (1) building capacity for leadership in global advocacy; (2) supporting global networks owned by developing countries; (3) equalizing multi-party partnerships; (4) facilitating evidence-informed global decision making; (5) enhancing accountability and independent evaluation; and (6) encouraging further discussion on institutional reforms. Notwithstanding sovereign equality's deep flaws, it is hoped that challenging the egalitarian presumptions of global decision making will encourage further debate on this issue among those who can act upon it.

Our objectives were to assess the annual prevalence, characteristics and reasons for unmet healthcare need in the Thai population in 2010 and to compare our findings with relevant international literature. Methods: A standard set of OECD unmet need questionnaires was used in a nationally-representative household survey conducted in 2010 by the National Statistical Office. The prevalence of unmet need among respondents with various socio-economic characteristics was estimated to determine an inequity in the unmet need and the reasons behind it. Results: The annual prevalence of unmet need for outpatient and inpatient services in 2010 was 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively. Despite this low prevalence, there are inequities with relatively higher proportion of the unmet need among Universal Coverage Scheme members, and the poor and rural populations. There was less unmet need due to cost than there was due to geographical barriers. The prevalence of unmet need due to cost and geographical barriers among the richest and poorest quintiles were comparable to those of selected OECD countries. The geographical extension of healthcare infrastructure and of the distribution of health workers is a major contributing factor to the low prevalence of unmet need. Conclusions: The low prevalence of unmet need for both outpatient and inpatient services is a result of the availability of well-functioning health services at the most peripheral level, and of the comprehensive benefit package offered free of charge by all health insurance schemes. This assessment prompts a need for regular monitoring of unmet need in nationally-representative household surveys.

J	Brown, GW				Brown, Garrett Wallace			Distributing Who Gets What and Why: Four Normative Approaches to Global Health	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							SECURITY	When surveying policy documents on global health one is often struck by a general lack of theorizing about why we have moral duties to promote equitable global health initiatives and in regards to what prioritized values should represent the satisfaction of these moral duties. Although there is general agreement that current inequalities in global health provision exist, and agreement that some form of response is necessary, there is little consensus about what should be done to rectify this situation. The purpose of this article is to explore four normative arguments about why we might have global health responsibilities and to examine their relationship with distributive principles for the alleviation of global health inequalities. Through this examination it will be argued that current theorizing about global health rests on opposing ontological perspectives about what global health should prioritize and that these presuppositions result in distinctively antagonistic normative demands about how we should distribute, who gets what and why.

J	Therborn, G				Therborn, Goran			THE KILLING FIELDS OF INEQUALITY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								The article presents a multidimensional analysis of inequality, in a global perspective, distinguishing vital, existential, and material resources inequality. These dimensions are interrelated and interacting, but irreducible to each other, and have had different historical trajectories, within and between nations. Over the last half-century, the contrast between advances of existential equalization, on one hand, and persistent, even increasing, vital inequality of life expectancy and health is striking. Inequalities are produced by specific mechanisms, of which distanciation, exclusion, hierarchization, and exploitation are the most important. They have each their corresponding mechanism of equality, of rapprochement or approximation, of inclusion, of organizational flattening or de-hierarchization, and of redistribution, rehabilitation, and recompensation. The mechanisms and their results are illustrated empirically in a systematic global overview.

Greece represents a country with an oversupply of physicians, having the highest concentration of physicians among European Union countries. The study aims to analyze the factors influencing the high number of physicians in Greece and make policy recommendations. The analysis was conducted through international literature review and database searches. Neither the demography of the physician population in terms of age, gender composition, and geographic dispersion, nor the epidemiology of the Greek population, can explain the relatively high number of physicians in Greece. Despite the physician surplus, Greece faces serious geographical inequities regarding the distribution of physicians. There are also imbalances within the specialist category, with certain specialists (e.g., cardiologists) being in oversupply compared to other European countries, while others (e.g., general practitioners) remain weakly represented. Inadequate planning of human resources for health, inadequate health financing policy regarding primary care, gatekeeping mechanisms, and medical power constitute the primary themes explaining the trends of physicians' population in Greece.

Public secrets in public health: Knowing not to know while making scientific knowledge	AMERICAN ETHNOLOGIST			English	Article							AFRICAN TRADITIONAL THOUGHT; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; MEDICAL-RESEARCH; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; WESTERN SCIENCE; ETHICS; HIV; INTERVENTIONS; PROGRAMS; ECONOMY	Unknown knowns-or "public secrets"-may play an integral part in publicly funded medical science. In one large transnational field research site in Africa, such unknowing pertains to vital material inequalities across the relations of scientific production. These inequalities are open to experience but remain often unacknowledged in public speech and scientific texts. This silence is not usually achieved by suppressing knowledge but through linguistic convention and differentiation between places and moments of knowing and ignorance. Switching between known and unknown according to situation and interlocutor is an important, largely implicit skill that maintains relations necessary to conduct clinical research-linking bodies, lives, institutions, and technologies across differentials of resources, expertise, and power. Unknowing, then, facilitates research; and it shapes the resulting work and perpetuates the political and economic contradictions that pervade the context and the research endeavor itself. Unknowing thus poses a challenge for conventional anthropological modes of critique and engagement. [Africa, science, medical research, ignorance, ethics, justice]	[Geissler, P.

Point-of-care testing for sexually transmitted infections: recent advances and implications for disease control	CURRENT OPINION IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Review						HIV; point-of-care; sexually transmitted infection; syphilis; testing	VIRUS-ANTIBODY ASSAYS; NEISSERIA-GONORRHOEAE; CHLAMYDIA-TRACHOMATIS; DIAGNOSTIC-TEST; PERFORMANCE; RISK; ACCEPTABILITY; CLINICS	Purpose of review Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a major global public health issue, with more than 448 million incident bacterial infections each year. We review recent advances in STI point-of-care (POC) testing and implications for STI prevention and control. Recent findings Accurate immunochromatographic assays to detect HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and syphilis antibodies have made home or supervised self-testing possible. Several studies have demonstrated feasibility and excellent test characteristics for HIV, HCV and syphilis POC tests. Rapid oral HIV tests are now available for purchase at retail sites across the United States. Combined HIV and syphilis tests using a single finger prick blood sample are under evaluation. Summary Oral POC STI tests with comparable performance to blood-based POC tests are available for self-testing. POC tests can expand screening, improve syndromic management and reduce loss to follow up. POC STI tests have the potential to facilitate prompt treatment and partner services. POC STI tests create opportunities for new social and financial models of community-based testing services. Increasing equity and access to testing will create challenges in linkage to care, quality assurance, partner services and surveillance. These important developments warrant research to understand appropriate contexts for implementation.

However, questions still remain around the consequence of working longer into old age. We examine mortality by work status around retirement ages in countries with different welfare regimes; Finland (social democratic), Turin (Italy; conservative), and England and Wales (liberal). Death rates and rate ratios (RRs) (reference rates = 'in-work'), 1970 s-2000 s, were estimated for those aged 45-64 years using the England and Wales longitudinal study, Turin longitudinal study, and the Finnish linked register study. Mortality of the not-in-work was consistently higher than the in-work. Death rates for the not-in-work were lowest in Turin and highest in Finland. Rate ratios were smallest in Turin (RR men 1972-76 1.73; 2002-06 1.63; women 1.22; 1.68) and largest in Finland (RR men 1991-95 3.03; 2001-05 3.80; women 3.62; 4.11). Unlike RRs for men, RRs for women increased in every country (greatest in Finland). These findings signal that overall, employment in later life is associated with lower mortality, regardless of welfare regime.

Meeting the global demands of epidemiologic transition - The indispensable role of cancer prevention	MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY			English	Review						Cancer prevention; Cancer burden; Risk factors; Epidemiology	HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; THYROID-CANCER; HEPATITIS-B; CERVICAL-CANCER; UNITED-STATES; PROSTATE; DISEASE; BURDEN; WOMEN; TRIAL	The number of new cancer cases each year is projected to rise worldwide by about 70% by 2030 due to demographic changes alone, with the largest increases in the lower-income countries. Wider adoption of specific aspects of westernized lifestyles would translate to still greater increases in certain cancer types. In many countries the burden of cancer and other non-communicable diseases will add to communicable diseases and malnutrition to impose a "double burden" on the poorest. These trends represent major challenges to health, poverty, sustainable development and equality. Prevention is, however, possible based on implementing existing knowledge about risk factors and the natural history of the disease. Both primary and secondary cancer prevention offer therefore many opportunities to combat the projected increases. Tobacco control, reductions in obesity and physical inactivity, reduced consumption of alcohol, vaccination against hepatitis B and human papilloma viruses, safe sex, avoidance of environmental and occupational carcinogens and excessive sun exposure as well as the early detection and screening for breast, cervix and colorectal cancers would all make significant contributions. At the same time, for a number of major cancers (e.g., colon, prostate, kidney, pancreas, brain, lympho-haematological malignancies) research is needed to identify as yet unknown risk factors whilst for existing prevention strategies additional work is needed on their implementation into health services. Finally, there is a remarkable opportunity for advances in understanding the molecular basis of carcinogenesis to provide new tools and insights into aetiology and prevention. It is only by complementing efforts to improve treatment with those aimed at prevention that the impending epidemic of this disease can be addressed.

As the field of global public health grows, the potential of CBPR to build capacity and to engage communities in identification of problems and development and implementation of solutions in sub-Saharan Africa has yet to be fully tapped. The Orphaned and Separated Children's Assessments Related to their Health and Well-Being (OSCAR) project is a longitudinal cohort of orphaned and non-orphaned children in Kenya. This paper will describe how CBPR approaches and principles can be incorporated and adapted into the study design and methods of a longitudinal epidemiological study in sub-Saharan Africa using this project as an example. Methods: The CBPR framework we used involves problem identification, feasibility and planning; implementation; and evaluation and dissemination. This case study will describe how we have engaged the community and adapted CBPR methods to OSCAR's Health and Well-being Project's corresponding to this framework in four phases: 1) community engagement, 2) sampling and recruitment, 3) retention, validation, and follow-up, and 4) analysis, interpretation and dissemination. Results: To date the study has enrolled 3130 orphaned and separated children, including children living in institutional environments, those living in extended family or other households in the community, and street-involved children and youth. Community engagement and participation was integral in refining the study design and identifying research questions that were impacting the community. Through the participation of village Chiefs and elders we were able to successfully identify eligible households and randomize the selection of participants. The on-going contribution of the community in the research process has been vital to participant retention and data validation while ensuring cultural and community relevance and equity in the research agenda. Conclusion: CBPR methods have the ability to enable and strengthen epidemiological and public health research in sub-Saharan Africa within the social, political, economic and cultural contexts of the diverse communities on the continent. This project demonstrates that adaptation of these methods is crucial to the successful implementation of a community-based project involving a highly vulnerable population.

NOT ALL IDEOLOGIES ARE CREATED EQUAL: EPISTEMIC, EXISTENTIAL, AND RELATIONAL NEEDS PREDICT SYSTEM-JUSTIFYING ATTITUDES	SOCIAL COGNITION			English	Article							TERROR MANAGEMENT THEORY; MORTALITY SALIENCE; POLITICAL ORIENTATION; 2 DECADES; JUSTIFICATION; UNCERTAINTY; PERSONALITY; SUPPORT; THREAT; SELF	Whereas most social psychological perspectives assume that needs to manage uncertainty, existential anxiety, and social cohesion should motivate any form of ideological zeal, System Justification Theory predicts that these needs are positively associated with the endorsement of system-justifying beliefs, opinions, and values but negatively associated with the endorsement of system-challenging ideological outcomes. For the first time we test a full theoretical model in which system justification mediates the effects of individual differences in epistemic, existential, and relational needs on attitudes toward public policy issues and social movements. Specifically, we conducted a national survey of 182 Americans and found that, as hypothesized, lower need for cognition, greater death anxiety, and a stronger desire to share reality each contributed significantly and independently to economic system justification, which, in turn, contributed to support for the Tea Party (a movement aimed at restoring America's "traditional values") and opposition to Occupy Wall Street (a movement seeking to reduce social and economic inequality and minimize corporate influence on government). Economic system justification also mediated the effects of these needs on the endorsement of status quo positions with respect to health care, immigration, global climate change, and the "Ground Zero mosque." These findings suggest that epistemic, existential, and relational needs lead disproportionately to support for system-justifying, rather than system-challenging, policies and movements.

Such a theory would enable analysis and evaluation of the current global health system and would ethically and empirically ground proposals for reforming it to more closely align with moral values. Global health governance has been framed as an issue of national security, human security, human rights, and global public goods. The global health governance literature is essentially untethered to a theorized framework to illuminate or evaluate governance. This article ties global health justice and ethics to principles for governing the global health realm, developing a theoretical framework for global and domestic institutions and actors.

Critical determinants of the epilepsy treatment gap: A cross-national analysis in resource-limited settings	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Treatment gap; Resource-limited settings; Cross-national analysis	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CHILD-MORTALITY; GLOBAL BURDEN; RURAL CHINA; STIGMA; DIFFERENTIALS; HEALTH; BRAZIL; COMMUNITY; ZAMBIA	Purpose: Epilepsy is one of the most common serious neurologic disorders worldwide. Our objective was to determine which economic, health care, neurology, and epilepsy-specific resources were associated with untreated epilepsy in resource-constrained settings. Methods: A systematic review of the literature identified community-based studies in resource-constrained settings that calculated the epilepsy treatment gap, the proportion with untreated epilepsy, from prevalent active epilepsy cases. Economic, health care, neurology, and epilepsy-specific resources were taken from existing datasets. Poisson regression models with jackknifed standard errors were used to create bivariate and multivariate models comparing the association between treatment status and economic and health resource indicators. Relative risks were reported. Key Findings: Forty-seven studies of 8,285 individuals from 24 countries met inclusion criteria. Bivariate analysis demonstrated that individuals residing in rural locations had significantly higher risks of untreated epilepsy (relative risk [RR] 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.262.11). Significantly lower risks of untreated epilepsy were observed for higher physician density (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.550.78), presence of a lay (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.600.91) or professional association for epilepsy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.590.91), or postgraduate neurology training program (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.550.82). In multivariate models, higher physician density maintained significant effects (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.520.88). Significance: Even among resource-limited regions, people with epilepsy in countries with fewer economic, health care, neurology, and epilepsy-specific resources are more likely to have untreated epilepsy. Community-based epilepsy care programs have improved access to treatment, but in order to decrease the epilepsy-treatment gap, poverty and inequalities of health care, neurology, and epilepsy resources must be dealt with at the local, national, and global levels.

This is partly due to the absence of a strategic commitment by the health authorities. The Ministry of Public Health commissioned the ETHEALTH (EThnicity & HEALTH) group to formulate relevant recommendations to the public authorities with a view to reducing health inequalities among ethnic minorities. This paper describes the political process and the outcomes of the ETHEALTH expert group. Results: After ten meetings, the ETHEALTH group came up with 46 recommendations, which were presented at a national press conference in December 2011. Target groups concerned by these recommendations covered both irregular migrants and migrants entitled to the national insurance coverage. Recommendations were supported by the need of combining universal approaches to health care with more specific approaches. The scope of the recommendations concerned health care as well as prevention, health promotion and access to health care. When analysing the content of the recommendations, some ETHEALTH recommendations were not fully measurable, and time-related; they were, however, quite specific and realistic within the Belgian context. The weak political commitment of an executive agency was identified as a major obstacle to the implementation of the recommendations. Conclusions: The ETHEALTH group was an example of scientific advice on a global health issue. It also demonstrated the feasibility of coming up with a comprehensive strategy to decrease ethnic health inequalities, even in a political context where migration issues are sensitive. Two final lessons may be highlighted at the end of the first phase of the ETHEALTH project: firstly, the combination of scientific knowledge and practical expertise makes recommendations SMART; and, secondly, the low level of commitment on the part of policymakers might jeopardise the effective implementation of the recommendations.

J	Kirigia, JM; Zere, E; Akazili, J				Kirigia, Joses Muthuri; Zere, Eyob; Akazili, James			National health financing policy in Eritrea: a survey of preliminary considerations	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							FRAMEWORK	Background: The 58th World Health Assembly and 56th WHO Regional Committee for Africa adopted resolutions urging Member States to ensure that health financing systems included a method for prepayment to foster financial risk sharing among the population and avoid catastrophic health-care expenditure. The Regional Committee asked countries to strengthen or develop comprehensive health financing policies. This paper presents the findings of a survey conducted among senior staff of selected Eritrean ministries and agencies to elicit views on some of the elements likely to be part of a national health financing policy. Methods: This is a descriptive study. A questionnaire was prepared and sent to 19 senior staff (Directors) in the Ministry of Health, Labour Department, Civil Service Administration, Eritrean Confederation of Workers, National Insurance Corporation of Eritrea and Ministry of Local Government. The respondents were selected by the Ministry of Health as key informants. Results: The key findings were as follows: the response rate was 84.2% (16/19); 37.5% (6/16) and 18.8% said that the vision of Eritrean National Health Financing Policy (NHFP) should include the phrases 'equitable and accessible quality health services' and 'improve efficiency or reduce waste' respectively; over 68% indicated that NHFP should include securing adequate funding, ensuring efficiency, ensuring equitable financial access, protection from financial catastrophe, and ensuring provider payment mechanisms create positive incentives to service providers; over 80% mentioned community participation, efficiency, transparency, country ownership, equity in access, and evidence-based decision making as core values of NHFP; over 62.5% confirmed that NHFP components should consist of stewardship (oversight), revenue collection, revenue pooling and risk management, resource allocation and purchasing of health services, health economics research, and development of human resources for health; over 68.8% indicated cost-sharing, taxation and social health insurance as preferred revenue collection mechanisms; and 68.75% indicated their preferred provider payment mechanism to be a global (lump sum) budget. Conclusion: This study succeeded in gathering the preliminary views of senior staff of selected Eritrean ministries and agencies regarding the likely elements of the NHFP, i.e. the vision, objectives, components, provider payment mechanisms, and health financing agency and its governance. In addition to stakeholder surveys, it would be helpful to inform the development of the NHFP with other pieces of evidence, including cost-effectiveness analysis of health services and interventions, financial feasibility analysis of financing options, a survey of the political and professional acceptability of financing options, national health accounts, and equity analyses.

Housing equity for health equity: a rights-based approach to the control of Lassa fever in post-war Sierra Leone	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						Lassa fever; Arenavirus; Mastomys natalensis; Housing equity; Health equity; Public health; Global health	MASTOMYS-NATALENSIS; WEST-AFRICA; RODENTS; VIRUS; RISK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TANZANIA	Poor quality housing is an infringement on the rights of all humans to a standard of living adequate for health. Among the many vulnerabilities of those without adequate shelter is the risk of disease spread by rodents and other pests. One such disease is Lassa fever, an acute and sometimes severe viral hemorrhagic illness endemic in West Africa. Lassa virus is maintained in the rodent Mastomys natalensis, commonly known as the "multimammate rat," which frequently invades the domestic environment, putting humans at risk of Lassa fever. The highest reported incidence of Lassa fever in the world is consistently in the Kenema District of Sierra Leone, a region that was at the center of Sierra Leone's civil war in which tens of thousands of lives were lost and hundreds of thousands of dwellings destroyed. Despite the end of the war in 2002, most of Kenema's population still lives in inadequate housing that puts them at risk of rodent invasion and Lassa fever. Furthermore, despite years of health education and village hygiene campaigns, the incidence of Lassa fever in Kenema District appears to be increasing. We focus on Lassa fever as a matter of human rights, proposing a strategy to improve housing quality, and discuss how housing equity has the potential to improve health equity and ultimately economic productivity in Sierra Leone. The manuscript is designed to spur discussion and action towards provision of housing and prevention of disease in one of the world's most vulnerable populations.	[Kelly, J.

Genetic Research and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						Genetic research; Ethical issues; Indigenous; Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander; Research governance	INDIGENOUS PEOPLES; HEALTH; ISSUES; FOUNDATION; POLITICS; PROGRESS; LESSONS; DISEASE; LEGAL; LAND	While human genetic research promises to deliver a range of health benefits to the population, genetic research that takes place in Indigenous communities has proven controversial. Indigenous peoples have raised concerns, including a lack of benefit to their communities, a diversion of attention and resources from non-genetic causes of health disparities and racism in health care, a reinforcement of "victim-blaming" approaches to health inequalities, and possible misuse of blood and tissue samples. Drawing on the international literature, this article reviews the ethical issues relevant to genetic research in Indigenous populations and considers how some of these have been negotiated in a genomic research project currently under way in a remote Aboriginal community. We consider how the different levels of Indigenous research governance operating in Australia impacted on the research project and discuss whether specific guidelines for the conduct of genetic research in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are warranted.

Next, we sketch the two main theoretical perspectives on the channels by which inequality exerts its effects: on the one hand, the psychosocial, which stresses the role of individual status and stratification, and, on the other hand, the neo-material, which puts the focus on resources at people's disposal. In our view the two are not mutually exclusive. Thirdly, we present each of the contributions and relate their results to these main perspectives. We find support for the view that inequality can magnify not only the differences between individuals or households in the resources at their disposal, but also the association between these resources and politics, well-being and social stratification.

J	Qi, YQ				Qi, Yaqiang			The impact of income inequality on self-rated general health: Evidence from a cross-national study	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY			English	Article						Income inequality; Self-rated health; Absolute income; Relative income	POPULATION HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; SOCIOECONOMIC DETERMINANTS; LIFE EXPECTANCY; ADULT MORTALITY; ASSOCIATION; MULTILEVEL; CANADA; MORBIDITY; HIERARCHY	Previous studies report a strong negative association between income inequality and population health at the aggregate level. However, it is still in hot debate whether this ecological association indicates a genuine, causal effect of income inequality on health, as asserted by the Wilkinson hypothesis, or it simply reflects a nonlinear effect of individual income on health, as suggested by the absolute income hypothesis. Drawing data from the 2005 round of the World Values Survey, I analyze the relationship between individual income, income inequality, and self-rated general health in a multilevel framework. Results show no independent detrimental effect of country income inequality on individual self-rated general health. In contrast, self-rated general health is strongly associated with absolute material conditions both at the individual and at the country level. Therefore, this study gives more evidence to the absolute income hypothesis, i.e., the strong ecological association between income inequality and population health is more likely a reflection of the nonlinear effect of individual income on health rather than a genuine effect of income inequality.

J	Parkinson, C; White, M				Parkinson, Clive; White, Mike			Inequalities, the arts and public health: Towards an international conversation	ARTS & HEALTH			English	Article						international; participatory arts; public health; inequalities; intrinsic/instrumental benefits		This paper considers how participatory arts informed by thinking in public health can play a significant part internationally in addressing inequalities in health. It looks beyond national overviews of arts and health to consider what would make for meaningful international practice, citing recent initiatives of national networks in English-speaking countries and examples of influential developments in South America and the European Union. In the context of public health thinking on inequalities and social justice, the paper posits what would make for good practice and appropriate research that impacts on policy. As the arts and health movement gathers momentum, the paper urges the arts to describe their potency in the policy-making arena in the most compelling ways to articulate their social, economic and cultural values. In the process, it identifies the reflexive consideration of participatory practice - involving people routinely marginalised from decision-making processes - as a possible avenue into this work.

Move it to improve it (Mitii): study protocol of a randomised controlled trial of a novel web-based multimodal training program for children and adolescents with cerebral palsy	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						REHABILITATION MEDICINE	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION; MEASURING MOBILITY LIMITATIONS; ABILITY CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; HAND FUNCTION; DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; INTRARATER RELIABILITY; ENVIRONMENT MEASURE	Introduction Persons with cerebral palsy require a lifetime of costly and resource intensive interventions which are often limited by equity of access. With increasing burden being placed on health systems, new methods to deliver intensive rehabilitation therapies are needed. Move it to improve it (Mitii) is an internet-based multimodal programme comprising upper-limb and cognitive training with physical activity. It can be accessed in the client's home at their convenience. The proposed study aims to test the efficacy of Mitii in improving upper-limb function and motor planning. Additionally, this study hopes to further our understanding of the central neurovascular mechanisms underlying the proposed changes and determine the cost effectiveness of Mitii. Methods and analysis Children with congenital hemiplegia will be recruited to participate in this waitlist control, matched pairs, single-blind randomised trial. Children be matched at baseline and randomly allocated to receive 20weeks of 30min of daily Mitii training immediately, or waitlisted for 20weeks before receiving the same Mitii training (potential total dose=70h). Outcomes will be assessed at 20weeks after the start of Mitii, and retention effects tested at 40weeks. The primary outcomes will be the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) and unimanual upper-limb capacity using the Jebsen-Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTTHF). Advanced brain imaging will assess use-dependant neuroplasticity. Measures of body structure and functions, activity, participation and quality of life will be used to assess Mitii efficacy across all domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework. Ethics and dissemination This project has received Ethics Approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of The University of Queensland (2011000608) and the Royal Children's Hospital Brisbane (HREC/11/QRCH/35). Findings will be disseminated widely through conference presentations, seminars and peer-reviewed scientific journals.

J	Danto, EA				Danto, Elizabeth Ann			"The Environment as a Cause of Disease in Children": Josef Friedjung's Transnational Influence on Modern Child Welfare Theory	CHILD WELFARE			English	Article								Josef K. Friedjung's Advanced Pediatrics-A Companion to Traditional Textbooks (Erlebte Kinderheilkunde-eine Erganzung er gebrauchlichen Lehrbucher), published in 1919 in Vienna, has cast a long but nearly-vanished shadow over modern child welfare theory. The originality of his focus on "the whole child" was in some ways a commentary on Sigmund Freud, but its overtly progressive political character gave Friedjung's argument visible applicability within the field of urban social welfare. As a pediatrician and an ardent cosmopolitan, Friedjung was wining to consider conflicting values between traditional family systems and the state. Had the Nazis not forced him into exile in Palestine, where he died in 1946, Friedjung's pioneering oeuvre would have joined our child welfare narrative long ago. Fortunately today archival evidence on which this study draws, fragmented as it is in both German and English, does confirm that the first and second generation psychoanalysts, Friedjung among them, built a mental health movement around a social justice core closely allied to the cultural context of central Europe from 1918 to 1933. In many ways, child welfare as we know it emerged as a practical implementation of that ideology.

J	Thomson, H; Thomas, S; Sellstrom, E; Petticrew, M				Thomson, Hilary; Thomas, Sian; Sellstrom, Eva; Petticrew, Mark			Housing improvements for health and associated socio-economic outcomes	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							EXCESS WINTER MORTALITY; LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; FUEL POVERTY; NEIGHBORHOOD RENEWAL; RETROFITTING HOUSES; URBAN REGENERATION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MENTAL-HEALTH; STAYING WELL	Background The well established links between poor housing and poor health indicate that housing improvement may be an important mechanism through which public investment can lead to health improvement. Intervention studies which have assessed the health impacts of housing improvements are an important data resource to test assumptions about the potential for health improvement. Evaluations may not detect long term health impacts due to limited follow-up periods. Impacts on socio-economic determinants of health may be a valuable proxy indication of the potential for longer term health impacts. Objectives To assess the health and social impacts on residents following improvements to the physical fabric of housing. Search methods Twenty seven academic and grey literature bibliographic databases were searched for housing intervention studies from 1887 to July 2012 (ASSIA; Avery Index; CAB Abstracts; The Campbell Library; CINAHL; The Cochrane Library; COPAC; DH-DATA: Health Admin; EMBASE; Geobase; Global Health; IBSS; ICONDA; MEDLINE; MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; NTIS; PAIS; PLANEX; PsycINFO; RIBA; SCIE; Sociological Abstracts; Social Science Citations Index; Science Citations Index expanded; SIGLE; SPECTR). Twelve Scandinavian grey literature and policy databases (Libris; SveMed+; Libris uppsok; DIVA; Artikelsok; NORART; DEFF; AKF; DSI; SBI; Statens Institut for Folkesundhed; Social.dk) and 23 relevant websites were searched. In addition, a request to topic experts was issued for details of relevant studies. Searches were not restricted by language or publication status. Selection criteria Studies which assessed change in any health outcome following housing improvement were included. This included experimental studies and uncontrolled studies. Cross-sectional studies were excluded as correlations are not able to shed light on changes in outcomes. Studies reporting only socio-economic outcomes or indirect measures of health, such as health service use, were excluded. All housing improvements which involved a physical improvement to the fabric of the house were included. Excluded interventions were improvements to mobile homes; modifications for mobility or medical reasons; air quality; lead removal; radon exposure reduction; allergen reduction or removal; and furniture or equipment. Where an improvement included one of these in addition to an included intervention the study was included in the review. Studies were not excluded on the basis of date, location, or language. Data collection and analysis Studies were independently screened and critically appraised by two review authors. Study quality was assessed using the risk of bias tool and the Hamilton tool to accommodate non-experimental and uncontrolled studies. Health and socio-economic impact data were extracted by one review author and checked by a second review author. Studies were grouped according to broad intervention categories, date, and context before synthesis. Where possible, standardized effect estimates were calculated and statistically pooled. Where meta-analysis was not appropriate the data were tabulated and synthesized narratively following a cross-study examination of reported impacts and study characteristics. Qualitative data were summarized using a logic model to map reported impacts and links to health impacts; quantitative data were incorporated into the model. Main results Thirty-nine studies which reported quantitative or qualitative data, or both, were included in the review. Thirty-three quantitative studies were identified. This included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 10 non-experimental studies of warmth improvements, 12 non-experimental studies of rehousing or retrofitting, three non-experimental studies of provision of basic improvements in low or mIddle Income countries (LMIC), and three non-experimental historical studies of rehousing from slums. Fourteen quantitative studies (42.4%) were assessed to be poor quality and were not included in the synthesis. Twelve studies reporting qualitative data were identified. These were studies of warmth improvements (n = 7) and rehousing (n = 5). Three qualitative studies were excluded from the synthesis due to lack of clarity of methods. Six of the included qualitative studies also reported quantitative data which was included in the review. Very little quantitative synthesis was possible as the data were not amenable tometa-analysis. This was largely due to extreme heterogeneity both methodologically as well as because of variations in the intervention, samples, context, and outcome; these variations remained even following grouping of interventions and outcomes. In addition, few studies reported data that were amenable to calculation of standardized effect sizes. The data were synthesised narratively. Data from studies of warmth and energy efficiency interventions suggested that improvements in general health, respiratory health, and mental health are possible. Studies which targeted those with inadequate warmth and existing chronic respiratory disease were most likely to report health improvement. Impacts following housing-led neighbourhood renewal were less clear; these interventions targeted areas rather than individual households in most need. Two poorer quality LMIC studies reported unclear or small health improvements. One better quality study of rehousing from slums (pre-1960) reported some improvement in mental health. There were few reports of adverse health impacts following housing improvement. A small number of studies gathered data on social and socioeconomic impacts associated with housing improvement. Warmth improvements were associated with increased usable space, increased privacy, and improved social relationships; absences from work or school due to illness were also reduced. Very few studies reported differential impacts relevant to equity issues, and what data were reported were not amenable to synthesis. Authors' conclusions Housing investment which improves thermal comfort in the home can lead to health improvements, especially where the improvements are targeted at those with inadequate warmth and those with chronic respiratory disease. The health impacts of programmes which deliver improvements across areas and do not target according to levels of individual need were less clear, but reported impacts at an area level may conceal health improvements for those with the greatest potential to benefit. Best available evidence indicates that housing which is an appropriate size for the householders and is affordable to heat is linked to improved health and may promote improved social relationships within and beyond the household. In addition, there is some suggestion that provision of adequate, affordable warmth may reduce absences from school or work. While many of the interventions were targeted at low income groups, a near absence of reporting differential impacts prevented analysis of the potential for housing improvement to impact on social and economic inequalities.

First, an alignment process is used to calibrate the acute inpatient attendance and nights spent in hospital variables produced by a spatial microsimulation model at both the national and the subnational levels. Comparing the results of the national and subnational alignment allows us to examine whether spatial variation exists. Second, after establishing that hospital utilization displays a significant spatial pattern, we use a nationally representative survey to determine which individual-level factors significantly affect inpatient attendance and the number of nights spent in hospitals. Using the calibrated data from the aforementioned spatial microsimulation model, we examine whether the spatial patterns of those variables found to influence hospital utilization match the spatial pattern of actual hospital utilization rates at the small area, electoral division level. That is, are the individuals/ areas with the highest demand for acute hospital services utilizing acute hospital services? Finally, the results of this research are discussed in relation to both the national and international literature.

A multi-layered governance framework for incorporating social science insights into adapting to the health impacts of climate change	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						climate change adaptation; global health; multi-sectoral; social networks; governance; social sciences; methods	GLOBAL HEALTH; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; COMANAGEMENT; DETERMINANTS; EQUITY; LEVEL; FIT	Background: Addressing climate change and its associated effects is a multi-dimensional and ongoing challenge. This includes recognizing that climate change will affect the health and wellbeing of all populations over short and longer terms, albeit in varied ways and intensities. That recognition has drawn attention to the need to take adaptive actions to lessen adverse impacts over the next few decades from unavoidable climate change, particularly in developing country settings. A range of sectors is responsible for appropriate adaptive policies and measures to address the health risks of climate change, including health services, water and sanitation, trade, agriculture, disaster management, and development. Objectives: To broaden the framing of governance and decision-making processes by using innovative methods and assessments to illustrate the multi-sectoral nature of health-related adaptation to climate change. This is a shift from sector-specific to multi-level systems encompassing sectors and actors, across temporal and spatial scales. Design: A review and synthesis of the current knowledge in the areas of health and climate change adaptation governance and decision-making processes. Results: A novel framework is presented that incorporates social science insights into the formulation and implementation of adaptation activities and policies to lessen the health risks posed by climate change. Conclusion: Clarification of the roles that different sectors, organizations, and individuals occupy in relation to the development of health-related adaptation strategies will facilitate the inclusion of health and wellbeing within multi-sector adaptation policies, thereby strengthening the overall set of responses to minimize the adverse health effects of climate change.

Unsurprisingly, the discussions on goals, topics, priorities and monitoring and evaluation are gaining momentum. But this is a critical juncture. Over a decade of development programming offers a unique opportunity to reflect on its structure, function and purpose in a contemporary global context. This article examines the topic from an analytical health perspective and identifies universal health equity as an operational and analytical priority to encourage attention to the root causes of unnecessary and unfair illness and disease from the perspectives of those for whom the issues have most direct relevance.

Anchoring vignettes is a technique that allows identifying and adjusting self-rating responses for reporting heterogeneity (RH). Objective: This article aims to test two crucial assumptions of vignette equivalence (VE) and response consistency (RC) that are required to be met before vignettes can be used to adjust self-rating responses for RH. Design: We used self-ratings, vignettes, and objective measures covering domains of mobility and cognition from the WHO study on global AGEing and adult health, administered to older adults aged 50 years and above from eight low-and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia. For VE, we specified a hierarchical ordered probit (HOPIT) model to test for equality of perceived vignette locations. For RC, we tested for equality of thresholds that are used to rate vignettes with thresholds derived from objective measures and used to rate their own health function. Results: There was evidence of RH in self-rating responses for difficulty in mobility and cognition. Assumptions of VE and RC between countries were violated driven by age, sex, and education. However, within a country context, assumption of VE was met in some countries (mainly in Africa, except Tanzania) and violated in others (mainly in Asia, except India). Conclusion: We conclude that violation of assumptions of RC and VE precluded the use of anchoring vignettes to adjust self-rated responses for RH across countries in Asia and Africa.

However, there is a global dearth of high-quality, policy-relevant and actionable data on inequities within populations, which means that development solutions seldom focus on the people who need them most. INTREC (INDEPTH Training and Research Centres of Excellence) was established with this concern in mind. It aims to provide training for researchers from the INDEPTH network on associations between health inequities, the social determinants of health (SDH), and health outcomes, and on presenting their findings in a usable form to policy makers. Objective: As part of a baseline situation analysis for INTREC, this paper assesses the current status of SDH training in three of the African INTREC countries - Ghana, Tanzania, and South Africa - as well as the gaps, barriers, and opportunities for training. Methods: SDH-related courses from the three countries were identified through personal knowledge of the researchers, supplemented by snowballing and online searches. Interviews were also conducted with, among others, academics engaged in SDH and public health training in order to provide context and complementary material. Information regarding access to the Internet, as a possible INTREC teaching medium, was gathered in each country through online searches. Results: SDH-relevant training is available, but 1) the number of places available for students is limited; 2) the training tends to be public-health-oriented rather than inclusive of the broader, multi-sectoral issues associated with SDH; and 3) insufficient funding places limitations on both students and on the training institutions themselves, thereby affecting participation and quality. We also identified rapidly expanding Internet connectivity in all three countries, which opens up opportunities for e-learning on SDH, though the current quality of the Internet services remains mixed. Conclusions: SDH training is currently in short supply, and there is a clear role for INTREC to contribute to the training of a critical mass of African researchers on the topic. This work will be accomplished most effectively by building on pre-existing networks, institutions, and methods.

J	Khan, T; Thomas, LS; Naidoo, S				Khan, Taskeen; Thomas, Leena S.; Naidoo, Shan			Analysing post-apartheid gender and racial transformation in medical education in a South African province	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						medical education; transformation; race; gender; inequalities		Introduction: In light of global concerns about insufficient numbers of doctors, midwives, and nurses, the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the scale-up of the production of medical professionals who are competent and responsive to community needs as urgent and necessary. Coincident with this imperative, South African medical schools have also had to consider redressing apartheid-era inequities in access to medical education and changing the racial and gender profile of medical graduates to be representative of the population. In this article, we explore progress and challenges with regard to transformation, defined as intentional and planned changes aimed at addressing historical disadvantages, in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive analysis was conducted using data on medical school admissions and graduations from the Health and Education Departments for the period 1999-2011. Admission and graduation statistics of 1999, 2005, 2008, and 2011 were analysed according to race and gender. Results: The results show that there has been progress in transforming the race and gender composition of medical students and graduates, in line with the transformation strategies of the South African government. In 1999, black African enrolments and graduates were conspicuously low in two of the three medical schools in the Gauteng province. By 2011, an almost six-fold increase in black African student enrolments was seen in one medical school that was previously designated as a white institution. In contrast, at the historically black medical school, whites only represented 0.40% of enrolments in 1999 and 7.4% in 2011. Since 1999, the number and proportion of female medical enrolments and graduates has also increased substantially. Conclusion: While there has been progress with redressing historical disparities and inequities in terms of race and gender, further efforts are needed to ensure that student intakes and graduations are in line with the South African population profile.

It is a pressing concern in Latin America, where social determinants of health aggravate existing inequities in access to health services. Nicaragua faces serious mental health needs and challenges. One key strategy for addressing gaps in mental health services is building capacity at the primary healthcare and system levels. Objective: Using the framework of best practice literature, this article analyses the four-year collaborative process between the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua in Leon (UNAN-Leon) and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Canada, which is aimed at improving mental healthcare in Nicaragua. Design: Based on a critical analysis of evaluation reports, key documents, and discussion among partners, the central steps of the collaboration are analysed and main successes and challenges identified. Results: A participatory needs assessment identified local strengths and weaknesses, expected outcomes regarding competencies, and possible methodologies and recommendations for the development of a comprehensive capacity-building programme. The partners delivered two international workshops on mental health and addiction with an emphasis on primary healthcare. More recently, an innovative Diploma and Master programme was launched to foster interprofessional leadership and effective action to address mental health and addiction needs. Collaborative activities have taken place in Nicaragua and Canada. Discussion: To date, international collaboration between Nicaragua and CAMH has been successful in achieving the jointly defined goals. The process has led to mutual knowledge sharing, strong networking, and extensive educational opportunities. Evidence of effective and respectful global health capacity building is provided. Lessons learned and implications for global health action are identified and discussed.

Consultation and remediation in the north: meeting international commitments to safeguard health and well-being	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH			English	Article						mining; remediation; contaminants; consultation; Giant Mine; community participation; Yellowknife; health; well-being		Background. International commitments exist for the safeguarding of health and the prevention of ill health. One of the earliest commitments is the Declaration of Alma-Ata (1978), which provides 5 principles guiding primary health care: equity, community participation, health promotion, intersectoral collaboration and appropriate technology. These broadly applicable international commitments are premised on the World Health Organization's multifaceted definition of health. The environment is one sector in which these commitments to safeguarding health can be applied. Giant Mine, a contaminated former gold mine in the Northwest Territories, Canada, represents potential threats to all aspects of health. Strategies for managing such threats usually involve an obligation to engage the affected communities through consultation. Objective. To examine the remediation and consultation process associated with Giant Mine within the context of commitments to safeguard health and well-being through adapting and applying the principles of primary health care. Methods. Semi-structured interviews with purposively selected key informants representing government proponents and community members were conducted. Results. In reviewing themes which emerged from a series of interviews exploring the community consultation process for the remediation of Giant Mine, the principles guiding primary health were mapped to consultation in the North: (a) "equity" is the capacity to fairly and meaningfully participate in the consultation; (b) "community participation" is the right to engage in the process through reciprocal dialogue; (c) "health promotion" represents the need for continued information sharing towards awareness; (d) "intersectoral collaboration" signifies the importance of including all stakeholders; and (e) "appropriate technology" is the need to employ the best remediation actions relevant to the site and the community. Conclusions. Within the context of mining remediation, these principles form an appropriate framework for viewing consultation as a means of meeting international obligations to safeguard health.

Methods: We reviewed child labor laws for 185 states in 2008 and 2012. We assessed how many countries had a minimum age of employment of 15 or over and tested the association between these laws and secondary enrolment rates, after controlling for per-capita GDP, level of urbanization, and compulsory lower secondary education. Results: A minimum age of employment of 15 or higher was significantly associated with increased secondary enrolment for girls, boys, and overall. Conclusions: Combining a legislated minimum age of employment of 15 or higher with compulsory education may strengthen children's opportunity to achieve a secondary education. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

SCOPING THE HEALTH DIMENSIONS OF "FLEXIClURITY" LABOR MARKET POLICIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							EMPLOYMENT; INEQUALITIES	Flexicurity, or the integration of labor market flexibility with social security and active labor market policies, has figured prominently in economic and social policy discussions in Europe since the mid-1990s. Such policies are designed to transcend traditional labor-capital conflicts and to form a mutually supportive nexus of flexibility and security within a climate of intensified competition and rapid technological change. International bodies have marketed flexicurity as an innovative win-win strategy for employers and workers alike, commonly citing Denmark and the Netherlands as exemplars of best practice. In this article, we apply a social determinants of health framework to conduct a scoping review of the academic and gray literature to: (a) better understand the empirical associations between flexicurity practices and population health in Denmark and (b) assess the relevance and feasibility of implementing such policies to improve health and reduce health inequalities in Ontario, Canada. Based on 39 studies meeting our full inclusion criteria, preliminary findings suggest that flexicurity is limited as a potential health promotion strategy in Ontario, offers more risks to workers' health than benefits, and requires the strengthening of other social protections before it could be realistically implemented within a Canadian context.

JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						social enterprise; health inequalities; public health; 'assets-based' approach; salutogenesis		In this article we attempt to make sense of recent policy directions and controversies relating to the 'social enterprise' and 'health' interface. In doing so, we outline the unrecognised potential of social enterprise for generating health and well-being improvement, and the subsequent challenges for government, the sector itself, and for the research community. Although we focus primarily upon the UK policy landscape, the key message - that social enterprise could represent an innovative and sustainable public health intervention - is a useful contribution to the ongoing international debate on how best to address the challenge of persistent and widening health inequalities.

We studied cross-national epidemiologic trends over time in the occurrence of frequent physical fighting, demographic variations in reported trends, and national wealth and income inequality as correlates. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were administered in school settings in 2002, 2006, and 2010. Participants (N = 493 874) included eligible and consenting students aged 11, 13, and 15 years in sampled schools from 30 mainly European and North American countries. Individual measures included engagement in frequent physical fighting, age, gender, participation in multiple risk behaviors, victimization by bullying, and family affluence. Contextual measures included national income inequality, absolute wealth and homicide rates. Temporal measure was survey cycle (year). RESULTS: Frequent physical fighting declined over time in 19 (63%) of 30 countries (from descriptive then multiple Poisson regression analyses). Contextual measures of absolute wealth (relative risk 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.93-0.99 per 1 SD increase in gross domestic product per capita) but not income inequality (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.05 per 1 SD increase) related to lower levels of engagement in fighting. Other risk factors identified were male gender, younger age (11 years), multiple risk behaviors, victimization by bullying, and national homicide rates. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2002 and 2010, adolescent physical fighting declined in most countries. Specific groups of adolescents require targeted violence reduction programs. Possible determinants responsible for the observed declines are discussed.

QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article						health care; financial incentives; pay for performance; quality care; quality indicators; quality of health care		As industrialized countries around the world encounter rising health care costs with little to show in quality and health outcome improvements, they increasingly are turning to pay-for-performance mechanisms to align provider action with quality, equity, and efficiency goals. The primary objective of most pay-for-performance schemes is to improve quality of care, and the logic of linking financial rewards to quality and performance metrics makes sense. However, despite broad international experience with pay-for-performance, evidence of its impact is limited, frequently conflicting, focuses largely on improvements in the provision and structure of care rather than health outcomes, and tends to generate more questions than it does answers.

J	Martin, B				Martin, Brian			Euthanasia tactics: patterns of injustice and outrage	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						Euthanasia; Injustice; T4 programme; Tactics; Death with dignity	ASSISTED SUICIDE; DEATH	Struggles over euthanasia can be examined in terms of tactics used by players on each side of the issue to reduce outrage from actions potentially perceived as unjust. From one perspective, the key injustice is euthanasia itself, especially when the person or relatives oppose death. From a different perspective, the key injustice is denial of euthanasia, seen as a person's right to die. Five types of methods are commonly used to reduce outrage from something potentially seen as unjust: covering up the action; devaluing the target; reinterpreting the action, including using lying, minimising consequences, blaming others and benign framing; using official channels to give an appearance of justice; and using intimidation. Case studies considered include the Nazi T4 programme, euthanasia in contemporary jurisdictions in which it is legal, and censorship of Exit International by the Australian government. By examining euthanasia struggles for evidence of the five types of tactics, it is possible to judge whether one or both sides use tactics characteristic of perpetrators of injustice. This analysis provides a framework for examining tactics used in controversial health issues.

The region generates enormous activity involving the movement of local and domestic goods. Given the expected growth in international trade and movement of domestic goods, significant growth in truck volumes and rail traffic to facilitate the reliable movement of goods and to support economic growth is anticipated in the region. As the movement of goods is a major contributor to local and regional environmental issues such as air pollution and health risk, a regional priority is not only to mitigate the environmental impacts of the system involving the movement of goods but also to ensure that, pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, equity exists in the distribution of environmental benefits and burdens from federally funded programs involving the movement of goods and projects. Therefore, to prevent disproportionately high and adverse environmental effects and health risks from affecting minority and low-income populations as a result of the movement of goods, the Southern California Association of Governments analyzed the environmental justice implications of the system involving the movement of goods included in the regional transportation plan. The objective of this paper is to identify the minority and low-income populations affected, to analyze their spatial distributions along major truck corridors and freight rail corridors, and to address the environmental justice implications of the system involving the movement of goods in Southern California.

Development and use of standardised data collection tools to support and inform musculoskeletal practice	MANUAL THERAPY			English	Article						Standardised data collection (SDC); Tool development; Uses of SDC	QUALITY; INJURIES; HEALTH	Clinicians all over the world are increasingly being faced with the need to demonstrate and account for the way in which clinical services are delivered and the quality of the delivery. It is also imperative to develop a comprehensive profile of who is accessing these services, who benefits from these services; how much these services cost in terms of clinicians time, the use of other healthcare resources and the effectiveness of interventions utilised in relation to quality outcomes. Clinicians are themselves keen to have mechanisms to identify what approaches are being utilised in their own practice setting, how they work best and how they can be improved from a professional development perspective. They are also anxious to improve their skills based on informed reflective practice and identify gaps in their knowledge and skills. This masterclass identifies how standardised data collection (SDC) tools can be utilised in practice to gather the information required in a robust, agreed and accessible way. It summarises a method of SDC tool development and gives some examples of how SDC has been implemented in physiotherapy National Health Services and in physiotherapy private practice in the United Kingdom. The global relevance is that increasingly all physiotherapy services are being held and will be accountable for the quality and equity of care. In addition clinicians can find it useful to have benchmarks with which to compare their own and their departmental performance in terms of clinical activities and outcomes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Socio-economic differences in self-reported insomnia and stress in Finland from 1979 to 2002: a population-based repeated cross-sectional survey	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Self-reported insomnia; Self-reported stress; Socio-economic differences; Repeated cross-sectional survey; Time trend	CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY; MIDDLE-AGED MEN; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; SLEEP DISTURBANCES; EARLY RETIREMENT; RESPONSE RATES; FOLLOW-UP; HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; TRENDS	Background: Over the decades, global public health efforts have sought to reduce socio-economic health differences, including differences in mental health. Only a few studies have examined changes in socio-economic differences in psychological symptoms over time. The aim of this study was to assess trends in socio-economic differences in self-reported insomnia and stress over a 24-year time period in Finland. Methods: The data source is a repeated cross-sectional survey "Health Behaviour and Health among the Finnish Adult Population" (AVTK), from the years 1979 to 2002, divided into five study periods. Indicators for socio-economic status included employment status from the survey, and educational level and household income from the Statistics Finland register data. We studied the age group of 25-64 years (N = 70115; average annual response rate 75%). Outcome measures were single questions of self-reported insomnia and stress. Results: The overall prevalence of insomnia was 18-19% and that of stress 16-19%. Compared to the first study period, 1979-1982, the prevalence of stress increased until study period 1993-1997. The prevalence of insomnia increased during the last study period, 1998-2002. Respondents who were unemployed or had retired early reported more insomnia and stress over time among both men and women. Lower education was associated with more insomnia especially among men; and conversely, with less stress among both sexes. Compared to the highest household income level, those in the intermediate levels of income had less stress whereas those in the lowest income levels had more stress among both sexes. Income level differences in insomnia were less consistent. In general, socio-economic differences in self-reported insomnia and stress fluctuated some, but did not change substantially over the study period 1979-2002. Conclusions: Self-reported insomnia and stress were more common during later study periods. The socio-economic differences in insomnia and stress have remained fairly stable over a 24-year time period. However, some of the associations in socio-economic differences were curvilinear and converse. Future studies are needed to explore the complex socio-economic gradients, especially in stress.

Rather than advocating in favour or against human rights-based approaches, the article purports to understand how and why such approaches are being articulated and disseminated. First, it argues that the representation of the global smoking epidemic as a human rights issue has been the product of a small, international network of public health experts and lawyers: the human rights and tobacco control collective or community (HTC). The article describes in particular the HTC's membership, its style of thinking and its efforts to articulate and disseminate human rights-based approaches to tobacco control. Second, the article argues that the aim of the HTC when framing tobacco control as a human rights issue was not to generate public attention for and the political will to tackle the global smoking epidemic, as the literature on framing and human rights presupposes. Instead, as the article shows, the HTC framed tobacco control as a human rights problem to tap into the powerful, judicial monitoring and enforceability mechanisms that make up international human rights.

Design/methodology/approach - Following recent work which uses secondary data sources for supply chain research at the country-level, data were obtained from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund databases. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to compute country-level efficiencies and ANOVA was used to do regional comparisons. Findings - The analysis shed light on country-level dimensions of logistics infrastructure and trade performance. It also provided insights regarding environmental (e.g. CO2 emissions) and social equity (e.g. health expenditure) dimensions for different regions. Research limitations/implications - Panel data rather than longitudinal data were used to draw the conclusions. A more exhaustive study could consider a multi-year timeframe. A limited number of dimensions were examined. As the study was exploratory, further work could consider a more extensive number of dimensions. Practical implications - The study has important implications for policy makers, since the attractiveness of various resource endowments like those considered here (environmental, social, supply chain logistics) can be seen to be associated with trade performance. Originality/value - This is one of the few studies to explore efficiency differences (enacted through DEA and ANOVA analyses), differentiating the research from the usual country clustering approaches. It also contributes to the understanding of differences between countries from a macro perspective, which provides insights for firms intending to expand their supply chains.

J	Patrick, R; Capetola, T; Townsend, M; Nuttman, S				Patrick, Rebecca; Capetola, Teresa; Townsend, Mardie; Nuttman, Sonia			Health promotion and climate change: exploring the core competencies required for action	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						climate change; health promotion; competencies		Climate change poses serious threats to human health and well-being. It exacerbates existing health inequities, impacts on the social determinants of health and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. In the Australian region these include remote Aboriginal communities, Pacific Island countries and people with low incomes. Given health promotions remit to protect and promote health, it should be well placed to respond to emerging climate-related health challenges. Yet, to date, there has been little evidence to demonstrate this. This paper draws on the findings of a qualitative study conducted in Victoria, Australia to highlight that; while there is clearly a role for health promotion in climate change mitigation and adaptation at the national and international levels, there is also a need for the engagement of health promoters at the community level. This raises several key issues for health promotion practice. To be better prepared to respond to climate change, health promotion practitioners first need to re-engage with the central tenets of the Ottawa Charter, namely the interconnectedness of humans and the natural environment and, secondly, the need to adopt ideas and frameworks from the sustainability field. The findings also open up a discussion for paradigmatic shifts in health promotion thinking and acting in the context of climate change.

(2012) Strategies to support breastfeeding: a review. International Nursing Review Background: Mothers need to be given support, confidence and encouragement to successful breastfeeding. The importance of breastfeeding support has been addressed in numerous studies. However, reviews to explore strategies to support breastfeeding are sparse. Aim: The study aims to explore strategies to support breastfeeding. It was also aimed to reveal how the international papers compare with the Turkish situation. Methods: Searches of CINAHL, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science databases, Cochrane databases, Turkish health databases were conducted for data collection. The search was limited to articles published between the years 1995 and 2011, focusing on the strategies related to the support received by mothers. Two experts independently read and analysed 38 articles. Findings: Thirty-eight papers were included in this review. The findings identified strategies to support breastfeeding. These include collaboration with community and family members; confidence building; appropriate ratio of staffing levels; development of communication skills; and closing the gap in inequalities in health. Conclusion: Mothers benefit from strategies that encourage breastfeeding, with guidance that supports their self-efficacy and feelings of being capable and empowered, and is tailored to their individual needs.

(2012) Immersion research education: students as catalysts in international collaboration research. International Nursing Review Background: This paper describes an international nursing and health research immersion program. Minority students from the USA work with an international faculty mentor in teams conducting collaborative research. The Minority Health International Research Training (MHIRT) program students become catalysts in the conduct of cross-cultural research. Aim: To narrow the healthcare gap for disadvantaged families in the USA and partner countries. Methods: Faculty from the USA, Germany, Italy, Colombia, England, Austria and Thailand formed an international research and education team to explore and compare family health issues, disparities in chronic illness care, social inequities and healthcare solutions. USA students in the MHIRT program complete two introductory courses followed by a 3-month research practicum in a partner country guided by faculty mentors abroad. The overall program development, student study abroad preparation, research project activities, cultural learning, and student and faculty team outcomes are explored. Results: Cross-fertilization of research, cultural awareness and ideas about improving family health occur through education, international exchange and research immersion. Faculty research and international team collaboration provide opportunities for learning about research, health disparities, cultural influences and healthcare systems. The students are catalysts in the research effort, the dissemination of research findings and other educational endeavours. Five steps of the collaborative activities lead to programmatic success. Conclusions: MHIRT scholars bring creativity, enthusiasm, and gain a genuine desire to conduct health research about families with chronic illness. Their cultural learning stimulates career plans that include international research and attention to vulnerable populations.	[Anderson, K.

J	Kramer, A; Nosbusch, JM; Rice, J				Kramer, Alice; Nosbusch, Jane Morgan; Rice, Jessica			Safe Mom, Safe Baby <i>A Collaborative Model of Care for Pregnant Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence</i>	JOURNAL OF PERINATAL & NEONATAL NURSING			English	Article						case management; collaboration; intimate partner violence; pregnancy; program evaluation	PHYSICAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; MATERNAL COMPLICATIONS; INTERVENTION PROGRAM; CASE-MANAGEMENT; BIRTH-WEIGHT; ABUSE; RISK; PREVALENCE; MOTHERS	Violence during pregnancy is a national and global health-related problem. Intimate partner violence significantly increases the risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Abused pregnant women are 1.4 times more likely to deliver a preterm or low-birth-weight infant requiring extended and resource-intense care in tertiary settings. Despite the prevalence of intimate partner violence during pregnancy, very little is written about established clinical programs designed to address this problem. This article presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a nurse-led, evidence-based initiative respected for enhancing the health and safety of abused pregnant women. This interdisciplinary program combines registered nurse case management, the advocacy services of a community-based domestic violence agency, and perinatal care into a seamless continuum of professional services. Program interventions focus on helping clients navigate (1) their perinatal experiences across healthcare settings and (2) the complexities of criminal justice, legal, and social service systems within the community. Program-related data collected and evaluated for performance improvement purposes are discussed, and innovative educational programming is described.

Hence the concept has an implicit power imbalance based on 'expert' knowledge. In 2011, a health research strengthening workshop was undertaken at Atoifi Adventist Hospital, Solomon Islands to further strengthen research skills of the Hospital and College of Nursing staff and East Kwaio community leaders through partnering in practical research projects. The workshop was based on participatory research frameworks underpinned by decolonising methodologies, which sought to challenge historical power imbalances and inequities. Our research question was, "Is research capacity strengthening a two-way process?" Methods: In this qualitative study, five Solomon Islanders and five Australians each responded to four open-ended questions about their experience of the research capacity strengthening workshop and activities: five chose face to face interview, five chose to provide written responses. Written responses and interview transcripts were inductively analysed in NVivo 9. Results: Six major themes emerged. These were: Respectful relationships; Increased knowledge and experience with research process; Participation at all stages in the research process; Contribution to public health action; Support and sustain research opportunities; and Managing challenges of capacity strengthening. All researchers identified benefits for themselves, their institution and/or community, regardless of their role or country of origin, indicating that the capacity strengthening had been a two-way process. Conclusions: The flexible and responsive process we used to strengthen research capacity was identified as mutually beneficial. Using community-based participatory frameworks underpinned by decolonising methodologies is assisting to redress historical power imbalances and inequities and is helping to sustain the initial steps taken to establish a local research agenda at Atoifi Hospital. It is our experience that embedding mutuality throughout the research capacity strengthening process has had great benefit and may also benefit researchers from more resourced and less resourced countries wanting to partner in research capacity strengthening activities.

Healthy life expectancy for 187 countries, 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden Disease Study 2010	LANCET			English	Article							MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; MENTAL-DISORDERS; EUROPEAN-UNION; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; TRENDS; POPULATION; COMPRESSION; MORBIDITY	Background Healthy life expectancy (HALE) summarises mortality and non-fatal outcomes in a single measure of average population health. It has been used to compare health between countries, or to measure changes over time. These comparisons can inform policy questions that depend on how morbidity changes as mortality decreases. We characterise current HALE and changes over the past two decades in 187 countries. Methods Using inputs from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2010, we assessed HALE for 1990 and 2010. We calculated HALE with life table methods, incorporating estimates of average health over each age interval. Inputs from GBD 2010 included age-specific information for mortality rates and prevalence of 1160 sequelae, and disability weights associated with 220 distinct health states relating to these sequelae. We computed estimates of average overall health for each age group, adjusting for comorbidity with a Monte Carlo simulation method to capture how multiple morbidities can combine in an individual. We incorporated these estimates in the life table by the Sullivan method to produce HALE estimates for each population defined by sex, country, and year. We estimated the contributions of changes in child mortality, adult mortality, and disability to overall change in population health between 1990 and 2010. Findings In 2010, global male HALE at birth was 58.3 years (uncertainty interval 56.7-59.8) and global female HALE at birth was 61.8 years (60.1-63.4). HALE increased more slowly than did life expectancy over the past 20 years, with each 1-year increase in life expectancy at birth associated with a 0.8-year increase in HALE. Across countries in 2010, male HALE at birth ranged from 27.9 years (17.3-36.5) in Haiti, to 68.8 years (67.0-70.4) in Japan. Female HALE at birth ranged from 37.1 years (26.9-43.7) in Haiti, to 71.7 years (69.7-73.4) in Japan. Between 1990 and 2010, male HALE increased by 5 years or more in 42 countries compared with 37 countries for female HALE, while male HALE decreased in 21 countries and 11 for female HALE. Between countries and over time, life expectancy was strongly and positively related to number of years lost to disability. This relation was consistent between sexes, in cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis, and when assessed at birth, or at age 50 years. Changes in disability had small effects on changes in HALE compared with changes in mortality. Interpretation HALE differs substantially between countries. As life expectancy has increased, the number of healthy years lost to disability has also increased in most countries, consistent with the expansion of morbidity hypothesis, which has implications for health planning and health-care expenditure. Compared with substantial progress in reduction of mortality over the past two decades, relatively little progress has been made in reduction of the overall effect of non-fatal disease and injury on population health. HALE is an attractive indicator for monitoring health post-2015.

We applied the classic Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics to demonstrate a novel mathematical relationship of income to childhood (aged 0-5 years) and adult (aged 15-60 years) survival. We treat income as a substrate that is catalyzed to increase survival (from technologies that income buys) for 180 countries from 1970 and 2007. Michaelis-Menten kinetics permit estimates of maximal survival and, uniquely, the critical income needed to achieve half of the period-specific maximum. Maximum child and adult survival rose by about 1% per year. Critical incomes fell by half for children, but doubled for men. HIV infection and smoking account for some, but not all, of the rising critical incomes for adult survival. Altering the future cost curve for adult survival will require more widespread use of current interventions, most notably tobacco control, but also research to identify practicable low-cost drugs, diagnostics, and strategies.

Consortium, S	The Global Rating Scale in clinical practice: A comprehensive quality assurance programme for endoscopy departments	DIGESTIVE AND LIVER DISEASE			English	Article						Benchmark; Checklist; Endoscopy; Global Rating Scale; Quality assurance	COLONOSCOPY PRACTICE; PATIENT EXPERIENCES; CARE; ACCESS; RISK	Background: The Global Rating Scale is an endoscopy quality assurance programme, successfully implemented in England. It remains uncertain whether it is applicable in another health care setting. Aim: To assess the applicability of the Global Rating Scale as benchmark tool in an international context. Methods: Eleven Dutch endoscopy departments were included for a Global Rating Scale-census, performed as a cross-sectional evaluation, July 2010. Two Global Rating Scale-dimensions - 'clinical quality' and 'patient experience' - were assessed across six items using a range of levels: from level-D (basic) to level-A (excellent). Construct validity was assessed by comparing department-specific colonoscopy audit data to GRS-levels. Results: For 'clinical quality', variable scores were achieved in items 'safety' (9% = B, 27% = C, 64% = D) and 'communication' (46% = A, 18% = C, 36% = D). All departments achieved a basic score in 'quality' (100% = D). For 'patient experience', variable scores were achieved in 'timeliness' (18%=A, 9%=B, 73%=D) and 'booking-choice' (36%=B, 46%=C, 18%=D). All departments achieved basic scores in 'equality' (100%=D). Departments obtaining level-C or above in 'information', 'comfort', 'communication', 'timeliness' and 'aftercare', achieved significantly better audit outcomes compared to those obtaining level-D (p<0.05). Conclusion: The Global Rating Scale is appropriate to use outside England. There was significant variance. across departments in dimensions. Most Global Rating Scale-levels were in line with departments' audit outcomes, indicating construct validity. (C) 2012 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: We studied dental care utilisation among 17,136 men and 21,414 women in the third Nord-Trondelag Health Survey (2006-08). Respondents aged 20 years and above were included in the study, and analyses were also performed within subgroups of age and gender (20-39, 40-59, and >= 60 years). Income-related horizontal inequity was estimated by means of concentration indices. Education-related inequity was estimated as relative risks. Results: We found consistent pro-rich income inequity among men and women of all ages. The level of income inequity was highest among men and women >= 60 years, and in this group the income gradient was steepest between the poorest and the middle quintiles. Pro-educated inequity was found exclusively among men and women >= 60 years. General attendance was high (77%). Conclusion: The overall level of income-related inequity in dental services utilisation was low compared to other European countries as reported in two recent international studies of socioeconomic inequalities in dental care utilisation. Pro-rich and pro-educated inequity is a public health challenge mainly in the older part of the population.

J	Bringedal, B; Tufte, PA				Bringedal, Berit; Tufte, Per Arne			Social and diagnostic inequality in health	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Diagnoses; sick leave; social inequality; sociocultural bias	PHYSICIANS; RECOMMENDATIONS; DISEASE; RACE	Aims: Empirical studies of social inequalities in health commonly take the diagnosing of disease for granted. Social inequalities in health are seen as the result of social processes, yet the diagnosis itself is rarely considered to contribute to such inequality. We argue that the influence of sociocultural and cognitive bias in the diagnosing process follows a social pattern, such that certain diagnoses are disproportionally over- or underrepresented in different socioeconomic groups due to interpretive bias of underlying symptoms. Methods: Norwegian data on sick leave for diffuse musculoskeletal and diffuse psychiatric disease in 2006 were analysed to study the distribution of the two diagnoses in different status groups. Socioeconomic status was measured by years of education. Diagnoses and occupational codes were based on national registers; diagnoses in accordance with the International Classification of Primary Care second edition. We compared occupations in technical sectors to occupations in the health sector and the relative number of cases of sick leave controlled for years of education, gender, occupational sector, and diagnosis. Data were analysed by cross-tabulation, ratio of diffuse psychiatric/musculoskeletal diseases, and logistic regression. Results: The ratio of diffuse psychiatric/musculoskeletal diseases increases with education and decreases if the employee works in a technical job. Conclusion: The results challenge the traditional explanation that job features alone can explain the distribution of disease and suggest that a part of the persistent social inequality in health can be caused by the diagnosing process. In order to reach a better understanding of the processes behind the social inequalities in health, the diagnosing process itself should also be studied.

Kelly			Surgical and Anesthesia Capacity in Bolivian Public Hospitals: Results from a National Hospital Survey	WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article							SURGERY; HEALTH; CARE; EMERGENCY; UGANDA	Underdeveloped nations suffer from significant deficiencies in surgical and anesthesia care. Although surgical inequities are a pressing issue internationally, the extent of these inequities is unknown due to a lack of data. The aim of this study was to assess surgical and anesthesia capacity in Bolivia as part of a multinational study assessing surgical and anesthesia infrastructure in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. A standardized survey tool was used to obtain national-level health-care data at the Bolivian Ministry of Health. Hospital-specific data were obtained through interviews with key administrators and providers at 18 public basic and general hospitals in Bolivia. There are 1,270 obstetrician/gynecologists and 1,807 surgeons in Bolivia. In contrast, there are 500 anesthesiologists, placing a large anesthesia burden on the country. Basic hospitals and general hospitals performed an average of 730 and 2,858 operations per year, respectively. One basic hospital was unable to perform any surgeries due to a lack of surgical manpower. All but two hospitals reported some lack of infrastructure, equipment, or pharmaceutical capacity. The ability to collect health outcomes was inconsistent in most hospitals. Surgical capacity varies throughout Bolivia. There are relatively large numbers of surgery providers but an insufficient number of anesthesiologists, suggesting a specific need for further development in anesthesia. Though there are many areas of strength within the Bolivian public health-care system, this survey identified several areas to which national policy and international collaboration can contribute in order to more adequately address major causes of surgical morbidity and mortality.

J	van der Poel, SZ				van der Poel, Sheryl Ziemin			Historical Walk: The HRP Special Programme and Infertility	GYNECOLOGIC AND OBSTETRIC INVESTIGATION			English	Article							ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY; HEALTH	Background/Aims: The HRP Special Programme (HRP) began addressing 'reproduction' problems (infertility) at the same time as 'fertility regulation' (contraception). Methods: This report is based upon data collected from official HRP Scientific and Technical Reports. Results: In the 1970s, HRP supported research on human and nonhuman primate models to address the basic biology of reproduction. Importantly, however, it was the multicountry clinical research studies sponsored by HRP during the 1970s and 1980s which led to the identification of not only the large burden of disease but also global patterns of causation of infertility. The next decade saw the development of WHO guidelines and manuals for diagnosis, management, and treatment of infertile women and men, with HRP-sponsored operations research focused on adaptation within primary health care settings. Consensus consultations held during 2001 through 2011 resulted in recommendations to stakeholders, as well as the identification of barriers and inequities in access to infertility care services. Conclusion: With renewed focus on infertility through the current development of revised guidelines and manuals, and the desire to support critical clinical research protocols, including adaptation and implementation research for management and monitoring tools being developed through international partners, HRP will continue to support future success stories in family, maternal, child, and reproductive health.

Many more are suffering grievously from treatable medical conditions. These burdens can be substantially reduced by supplementing the rules governing pharmaceutical innovation. Established by the World Trade Organization's TRIPS Agreement, these rules cause advanced medicines to be priced beyond the reach of the poor and steer medical research away from diseases concentrated among them. We should complement these rules with the Health Impact Fund (HIF). Financed by many governments, the HIF would offer any new pharmaceutical product the opportunity to participate, during its first 10 years, in the HIF's annual reward pools, receiving a share equal to its share of the assessed health impact of all HIF-registered products. In exchange, the innovator would have to agree to make this product available worldwide at the lowest feasible cost of manufacture. Fully consistent with TRIPS, the HIF achieves three key advances. It directs some pharmaceutical innovation toward the most serious diseases, including those concentrated among the poor. It makes all HIF-registered medicines cheaply available to all. And it incentivizes innovators to promote the optimal use of their HIF-registered medicines. Magnifying one another's effects, these advances would engender large global health gains.

COERCION, AUTONOMY, AND THE PREFERENTIAL OPTION FOR THE POOR IN THE ETHICS OF ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						bioethics; developing world; health systems; informed consent; justice; resource allocation; rights		The debate concerning whether to legalize and regulate the global market in human organs is hindered by a lack of adequate bioethical language. The author argues that the preferential option for the poor, a theological category, can provide the grounding for an inductive moral epistemology adequate for reforming the use of culturally Western bioethical language. He proposes that the traditional, Western concept of bioethical coercion ought to be modified and expanded because the conditions of the market system, as viewed from the perspective of organ vendors systemically deprived of access to sufficient resources, are sufficiently exploitative as to diminish the possibility of these vendors giving informed consent. Moreover, empirical studies conducted by professionals in medicine, sociology, psychiatry, economics, and medical anthropology continue to contribute support to the growing interdisciplinary consensus that functionally coercive structural factors exert the most significant influence upon a vendor's decision to sell an organ within any market, regardless of legality or degree of regulation. Therefore any proposal to legalize and regulate the organ market remains patently unethical because doing so would likely function to constrain further the agency of poor potential vendors.

The first concerns Cheng Guorong, a 34-year-old vagrant beggar with mental health issues who became an international fashion icon known as "Brother Sharp" in 2010 after an amateur photographer posted candid photographs of him walking down a street on an internet forum. The second case involves two migrant buskers in Beijing who performed to an audience of around 1 billion viewers worldwide on China Central Television Station's annual Spring Festival Gala in 2011, after a friend posted a mobile phone video clip of them singing on his microblog. These cases show how the mediated contexts provided by the World WideWeb, combined with the corollary growth of a young digital-technology-savvy population, are generating new entertainment-orientated communities and celebrity-making practices in China. It also shows how these seemingly apolitical entertainment practices are refashioning public debates about the politics of prosperity and equality.

Objectives To identify social determinants of health (SDH) associated with cervical screening for women living in middle and low-income countries, to inform responses to improve SDH and screening coverage, and to identify research gaps. Methods A scoping literature review. We located original research articles on SDH associated with cervical cancer screening through bibliographic databases, supplemented by hand searching (n = 166 + 4). Included were those conducted in middle and low-income countries and published in English, Portuguese and Spanish academic journals between January 2000 and June 2011 (n = 37). Excluded were those from high-income countries or focusing on screening-diagnostic techniques or HPV vaccine. Narrative synthesis examined the results in relation to a SDH framework. Results A number of factors influence access along the pathway to cervical cancer screening. Structural (cultural and societal values, socioeconomic position, ethnicity), intermediary (geographic location, health seeking behaviours, psychosocial factors, nature of the health system), and cross-cutting (social cohesion) SDH were all important. No single factor could entirely explain the observed cervical screening patterns. Conclusion Cervical cancer screening among women living in middle and low-income countries are influenced by the interaction among several different SDH. The majority of researchers studying cervical cancer screening focused on exploring single socio-demographic variables, which is typical of positivist, biomedical and epidemiological research. An inter-sectionality approach may provide a richer understanding of the complexities that influence women's pathways to cervical cancer screening and assist design of international programmes and policies from a social justice perspective.

Socio-demographic and behavioural inequalities in the impact of dental pain among adults: a population-based study	COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						adults; dental pain; epidemiology; impact; socio-economic factors	OROFACIAL PAIN; ORAL-HEALTH; SOCIAL IMPACT; DISPARITIES; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; SMOKING; COMMUNITY; TOBACCO; DISEASE	Objectives To assess socio-demographic and behavioural inequalities in the impact of dental pain on daily activities, as well as to estimate the prevalence and intensity of dental pain. Methods A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out in Florianopolis, Southern Brazil, with 1720 adults aged 20-59 years in 20092010. Interviews were performed at adults' households, which included socio-demographics and behavioural characteristics, such as smoking status and alcohol abuse, along with mental health, self-reported health, number of retained teeth, dental pain occurrence (including its intensity and its impact on daily life). The association between the impact of dental pain and the covariates was tested using multinomial logistic regression. Results The global prevalence of dental pain was 14.8% (95% CI, 12.916.7). Adjusted analysis showed that women, those who self-classified as dark-skinned Blacks, those with low family income, current smokers and those with common mental disorders reported a higher impact of dental pain than their counterparts. Among subjects reporting dental pain, 12.7% indicated the maximum intensity, whereas 6.0% had some daily activity disrupted by it, such as difficulties in chewing certain foods (38.0%), sleep disturbance (21.0%), difficulty to work (21.0%) and difficulty in performing household tasks (8.0%). Prevalence ratios of impact of dental pain between the poorest income group and richest income group (2.4), between the highest and lowest schooling group (2.6), and between dark-skinned Blacks and Whites (2.1) were of higher magnitude than the dental pain prevalence ratios among the same groups (1.7, 1.3 and 1.4, respectively). Conclusions The impact of dental pain showed a social gradient. Inequalities between socio-economic groups found in this study should be taken into account, as the impact of dental pain leads to reduced daily activities and poor quality of life.

J	Fried, S; Harrison, B; Starcevich, K; Whitaker, C; O'Konek, T				Fried, Susana; Harrison, Brianna; Starcevich, Kelly; Whitaker, Corinne; O'Konek, Tiana			INTEGRATING INTERVENTIONS ON MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY AND HIV: A HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED FRAMEWORK AND APPROACH	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								Maternal mortality and morbidity (MMM) and HIV represent interlinked challenges arising from common causes, magnifying their respective impacts and producing related consequences. Accordingly, an integrated response will lead to the most effective approach for both. Shared structural drivers include gender inequality; gender-based violence (including sexual violence); economic disempowerment; and stigma and discrimination in access to services or opportunities based on gender and HIV. Further, shared system-related drivers also contribute to a lack of effective access to acceptable, high-quality health services and other development resources from birth forward. HIV and MMM are connected in both outcomes and solutions: in sub-Saharan Africa, HIV is the leading cause of maternal death, while the most recent global report on HIV identifies prevention of unintended pregnancy and access to contraception as two of the most important HIV-related prevention efforts. 1 Both are central to reducing unsafe abortion-another leading cause of maternal death globally, and particularly in Africa. A human rights-based framework helps to identify these shared determinants. A human rights-based approach works to establish the health-related human rights standards to which all women are entitled, as well to outline the indivisible and intersecting human rights principles which inform and guide efforts to prevent, protect from, respond to, and provide remedy for human rights violations-in this case related to HIV and maternal mortality and morbidity. The Millennium Declaration and Development Goals (MDGs) help to both set quantifiable goals for achieving the components identified within the human rights-based framework and document the international consensus that no single goal-such as those addressing HIV and MMM-can be achieved without progress on all development goals.

An Analysis of Twenty-Four European Countries	HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Health economics; health care financing/insurance/premiums; comparative health systems/international health; health care organizations and systems	MEDICAL-CARE; DEMAND; COSTS	Objective To identify whether, by what means, and the extent to which historically, government health care expenditure growth in Europe has changed following economic crises. Data Sources Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Health Data 2011. Study Design Cross-country fixed effects multiple regression analysis is used to determine whether statutory health care expenditure growth in the year after economic crises differs from that which would otherwise be predicted by general economic trends. Better understanding of the mechanisms involved is achieved by distinguishing between policy responses which lead to cost-shifting and all others. Findings In the year after an economic downturn, public health care expenditure grows more slowly than would have been expected given the longer term economic climate. Cost-shifting and other policy responses are both associated with these slowdowns. However, while changes in tax-derived expenditure are associated with both cost-shifting and other policy responses following a crisis, changes in expenditure derived from social insurance have been associated only with changes in cost-shifting. Conclusions Disproportionate cuts to the health sector, as well as reliance on cost-shifting to slow growth in health care expenditure, serve as a warning in terms of potentially negative effects on equity, efficiency, and quality of health services and, potentially, health outcomes following economic crises.

Benefits of educational attainment on adult fluid cognition: international evidence from three birth cohorts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Educational benefits; cognitive selection; class reproduction; life course; cognitive health; adolescent cognition	FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES; SOCIAL CONDITIONS; INTELLIGENCE; ACHIEVEMENT; INEQUALITY; ABILITIES; SCHOOL	Background Educational attainment is highly correlated with social inequalities in adult cognitive health; however, the nature of this correlation is in dispute. Recently, researchers have argued that educational inequalities are an artefact of selection by individual differences in prior cognitive ability, which both drives educational attainment and tracks across the rest of the life course. Although few would deny that educational attainment is at least partly determined by prior cognitive ability, a complementary, yet controversial, view is that education has a direct causal and lasting benefit on cognitive development. Methods We use observational data from three birth cohorts, with cognition measured in adolescence and adulthood. Ordinary least squares regression was used to model the relationship between adolescent cognition and adult fluid cognition and to test the sensitivity of our analyses to sample selection, projection and backdoor biases using propensity score matching. Results We find that having a university education is correlated with higher fluid cognition in adulthood, after adjustment for adolescent cognition. We do not find that adolescent cognition, gender or parental social class consistently modify this effect; however, women benefited more in the 1946 sample from Great Britain. Conclusions In all three birth cohorts, substantial educational benefit remained after adjustment for adolescent cognition and parental social class, offsetting an effect equivalent of 0.5 to 1.5 standard deviations lower adolescent cognition. We also find that the likelihood of earning a university degree depends in part on adolescent cognition, gender and parental social class. We conclude that inequalities in adult cognition derive in part from educational experiences after adolescence.	[Clouston, Sean A.

Food Insecurity and Mental Disorders in a National Sample of U.S. Adolescents	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						food insecurity; poverty; hunger; adolescence; mental health	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; HEALTH; POVERTY; INCOME; DEPRESSION; DEPRIVATION; VERSION; INFANT	Objective: To examine whether food insecurity is associated with past-year DSM-IV mental disorders after controlling for standard indicators of family socioeconomic status (SES) in a U.S. national sample of adolescents. Method: Data were drawn from 6,483 adolescent parent pairs who participated in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement, a national survey of adolescents 13 to 17 years old. Frequency and severity of food insecurity were assessed with questions based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Security Scale (standardized to a mean of 0, variance of 1). DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed with the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Associations of food insecurity with DSM-IV/Composite International Diagnostic Interview diagnoses were estimated with logistic regression models controlling for family SES (parental education, household income, relative deprivation, community-level inequality, and subjective social status). Results: Food insecurity was highest in adolescents with the lowest SES. Controlling simultaneously for other aspects of SES, standardized food insecurity was associated with an increased odds of past-year mood, anxiety, behavior, and substance disorders. A 1 standard deviation increase in food insecurity was associated with a 14% increase ill the odds of past-year mental disorder, even after controlling for extreme poverty. The association between food insecurity and mood disorders was strongest in adolescents living in families with a low household income and high relative deprivation. Conclusions: Food insecurity is associated with a wide range of adolescent mental disorders independently of other aspects of SES. Expansion of social programs aimed at decreasing family economic strain might be one useful policy approach for improving youth mental health. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

J	Zhao, W				Zhao, Wei			Economic inequality, status perceptions, and subjective well-being in China's transitional economy	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY			English	Article						Economic inequality; Social status; Subjective well-being; Contextual inequality; China; Market transition	INCOME INEQUALITY; HEALTH; REFORM; SOCIETIES; HAPPINESS; LIFE	Situated in the dynamic institutional environment of China's transitional economy, this study investigates the intricate relationships among economic inequality, status perceptions, and subjective well-being. Empirical evidence is drawn from national survey data collected from urban China. Statistical analyses show that multiple indicators of economic well-being exert a significant effect on self-perceived social status and status change and on subjective well-being. Positive status perceptions further enhance one's subjective well-being. Some of these effects are also moderated by contextual inequality. This study advances the literature by moving beyond income-based measures to examine the consequences of economic disparity. It also shows that status perceptions are the key nexus to probe the impacts of economic well-being and the sources of life satisfaction. Findings further direct our attention to important interplays between the individual-level socioeconomic conditions and the contextual inequality in achieving a deeper understanding of the consequences of socioeconomic inequality.

J	Whelan, CT; Maître, B				Whelan, Christopher T.; Maitre, Bertrand			Understanding material deprivation: A comparative European analysis	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY			English	Article						Material deprivation; Income inequality; EU-SILC; Socio-economic disadvantages	INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; POVERTY; DETERMINANT; LESSONS	In this paper, taking advantage of the inclusion of a special module on material deprivation in EU-SILC 2009. we provide a comparative analysis of patterns of deprivation. Our analysis identifies six relatively distinct dimensions of deprivation with generally satisfactory overall levels of reliability and mean levels of reliability across countries. Multi-level analysis based on 28 European countries reveals systematic variation in the importance of within and between country variation for a range of deprivation dimensions. The basic deprivation dimension is the sole dimension to display a graduated pattern of variation across countries. It also reveals the highest correlations with national and household income, the remaining deprivation dimensions and economic stress. It comes closest to capturing an underlying dimension of generalized deprivation that can provide the basis for a comparative European analysis of exclusion from customary standards of living. A multilevel analysis revealed that a range of household characteristics and household reference person socio-economic factors were related to basic deprivation and controlling for contextual differences in such factors allowed us to account for substantial proportions of both within and between country variance. The addition of macro-economic factors relating to average levels of disposable income and income inequality contributed relatively little further in the way of explanatory power. Further analysis revealed the existence of a set of significant interactions between micro socioeconomic attributes and country level gross national disposable income per capita. The impact of socio-economic differentiation was significantly greater where average income levels were lower. Or, in other words, the impact of the latter was greater for more disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Our analysis supports the suggestion that an emphasis on the primary role of income inequality to the neglect of differences in absolute levels of income may be misleading in important respects.

J	Witter, S				Witter, Sophie			Health financing in fragile and post-conflict states: What do we know and what are the gaps?	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Review						Post-conflict; Health financing; Fragile states	USER FEES; SERVICES; PROVIDERS; POLICY; PERFORMANCE; INSURANCE; COUNTRIES; CAMBODIA; SYSTEM; CARE	There has been a growing concern with post-conflict and fragile states over the past decade, both in relation to their high level of health and development needs but also for the risk they pose to the wider international community. This paper presents an exploratory literature review to analyse the themes and findings of recent writing on one important pillar of the health system - health financing - in these countries. It finds that here is a growing but still very limited literature. Most of the insights from existing literature relate to the role of donors. There is a need for more work on access to care and equity over the post-conflict period, the mix and sequencing of financing mechanisms, resource allocation, regulation, public financial management, payment systems and incentives at facility and health worker levels, and on overall health financing strategies and their possible contribution to wider state-building. Topics which have received attention, such as contracting and non-state actors, could benefit from more rigorous analysis with a longer time perspective. A longitudinal approach, which examines how decisions taken in the immediate post-conflict period may or may not influence longer term developments, would provide important insights. As health systems in fragile and post-conflict states are often forced to innovate, they can generate useful lessons for other settings too. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Buse, K; Blackshaw, R; Ndayisaba, MGH				Buse, Kent; Blackshaw, Ruth; Ndayisaba, Marie-Goretti Harakeye			Zeroing in on AIDS and global health Post-2015	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						HIV; AIDS; Post-2015; Shared responsibility Global solidarity; Health justice; Human rights		December 1st marks World AIDS Day with the theme 'Getting to zero'. Three years ago, UNAIDS articulated what was then considered to be an ambitious vision, the aspiration for zero new HIV infections and zero-AIDS related deaths underpinned by zero discrimination. As we imagine the Post-2015 development agenda, we can and should reconceptualise this vision as a set of concrete goals. This Viewpoint argues that today's rapidly changing world, including its shifting geo-political and economic landscape, requires policy responses that are context-sensitive. We highlight the Shared Responsibility-Global Solidarity agenda, as pioneered by the African Union in its recent Roadmap on AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, to illustrate ways in which global health can be re-thought to tackle twenty-first century challenges. In light of the emerging debate on what a Post-2015 development agenda and accountability framework should look like, we argue that the AIDS response offers lessons as a pathfinder which can pave the way for global health responses in which the most marginalised are at the centre of the debate, human rights are protected under the rule of law, strong accountability is in place for results for people, and community and participatory processes are the norm. These hard-learned and -won principles of the AIDS response are critical if we are to realize a world in which there is zero inequality and health justice for all.

J	Goodridge, D; Hawranik, P; Duncan, V; Turner, H				Goodridge, Donna; Hawranik, Pamela; Duncan, Vicky; Turner, Hollie			Socioeconomic disparities in home health care service access and utilization: A scoping review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Review						Home health care; Community-based care; Equity; Disparities; Socioeconomic status	NURSE-PRACTITIONERS; OLDER-PEOPLE; EQUITY; PATTERNS; WORKERS; CANADA; DEATH	Home health care services are expanding at a rapid pace in order to meet the needs of the growing population of older adults and those with chronic illnesses. Because of current restrictions on home health care as an insured service in some countries, individuals may be required to pay for some or all of their home care services out of pocket. These payments may potentially limit access to needed home care services for persons in the lowest socioeconomic strata. Previous research demonstrates a clear socioeconomic gradient in access to acute and primary care services, where those most in need of services are the most disadvantaged and under-serviced. There has been little attention paid thus far, however, to the way in which socioeconomic status may affect the receipt of home health care services. Objective: To determine what is known from existing literature about socioeconomic disparities in home health care access and utilization. Design: A scoping review was used to map the extent and nature of the literature in this area. Data sources: A search of the databases CINAHL, Medline, SocIndex and Sociological Abstracts as well as Dissertations International. Review methods: A total of 206 potentially relevant articles were published between 2000 and April 2011. Two reviewers independently reviewed the articles, leaving 15 research articles to be included in the scoping review. Results: The majority of articles reported secondary analyses of administrative datasets related to utilization of home health care. Several studies examined access and utilization using qualitative approaches. The distinction between professional and supportive home care services was not always clear in the articles. Individual and composite measures of socioeconomic status were reported, with the most frequently used indicator being income. Several studies used more complex composite ecological indicators of socieconomic status. There was general agreement that utilization of home health services favored persons with greater economic disadvantage. Education, rurality and race were less frequently reported. Conclusions: In contrast to well-documented socioeconomic gradient seen with primary and acute care services, we found general agreement that persons of lower socioeconomic status are favored and not disadvantaged in terms of home health care services.

We report a hospital-based estimate for 2005-2007 of the major causes of death in children in this age-group in south-west Nigeria. Methods: We used retrospective data from the intensive care unit of a second-tier health facility to extract the presenting complaints, clinical diagnosis, treatment courses, prognosis and outcome among children aged 6-59months. SPSS-19 was used for data analysis. Results: Of the 301 children (58% males, 42% females) admitted into the ICU within the period of study, 173 (26%) presented with complaints related to the gastrointestinal system, 138 (21%) with respiratory symptoms and 196 (29%) with complaints of fever. Overall, 708 investigations were requested for among which were full blood count (215, 30%) and blood slides for malaria parasite (166, 23%). Infection ranked highest (181, 31%) in clinicians' diagnosis, followed by haematological health problems (109, 19%) and respiratory illnesses (101, 17%). There were negative correlations between outcome of the illness and patient's weight (r=-0.195, p=0.001) and a strong positive correlation between prognosis and outcome of admission (r=0.196, p=0.001). Of the 59 (20%) children that died, presentation of respiratory tract illnesses were significantly higher in females (75%) than in males (39%) (chi(2) = 7.06; p=0.008) and diagnoses related to gastrointestinal pathology were significantly higher in males (18%) than in females (0%) (chi(2)= 4.07; p=0.05). Majority of the deaths (21%) occurred among children aged 1.0 to 1.9years old and among weight group of 5.1-15.0kg. Conclusion: The major causes of deaths among under-five years old originate from respiratory, gastrointestinal and infectious diseases -diseases that were recognized as major causes of childhood mortality about half a century earlier. Realization of MDG4 -to reduce child mortality by two-thirds -is only possible if the government and donor agencies look beyond the health sector to find hidden causative factors such as education and housing and within the health sector such as vibrant maternal, new-born, and child health interventions.

We calculated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to estimate the global burden of cancer in 2008. Methods We used population-based data, mostly from cancer registries, for incidence, mortality, life expectancy, disease duration, and age at onset and death, alongside proportions of patients who were treated and living with sequelae or regarded as cured, to calculate years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). We used YLLs and YLDs to derive DALYs for 27 sites of cancers in 184 countries in 12 world regions. Estimates were grouped into four categories based on a country's human development index (HDI). We applied zero discounting and uniform age weighting, and age-standardised rates to enable cross-country and regional comparisons. Findings Worldwide, an estimated 169.3 million years of healthy life were lost because of cancer in 2008. Colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers were the main contributors to total DALYs in most world regions and caused 18-50% of the total cancer burden. We estimated an additional burden of 25% from infection-related cancers (liver, stomach, and cervical) in sub-Saharan Africa, and 27% in eastern Asia. We noted substantial global differences in the cancer profile of DALYs by country and region; however, YLLs were the most important component of DALYs in all countries and for all cancers, and contributed to more than 90% of the total burden. Nonetheless, low-resource settings had consistently higher YLLs (as a proportion of total DALYs) than did high-resource settings. Interpretation Age-adjusted DALYs lost from cancer are substantial, irrespective of world region. The consistently larger proportions of YLLs in low HDI than in high HDI countries indicate substantial inequalities in prognosis after diagnosis, related to degree of human development. Therefore, radical improvement in cancer care is needed in low-resource countries.

These funds are allocated at multiple levels, resulting in a highly complicated distribution process. An oversight agency allocates funds to various national-level decision-makers who then allocate funds to regional-level decision-makers who in turn distribute the monies to local organizations, programs, or risk groups. Simple allocation techniques are often preferred by the decision-makers at each administrative level, but such methods can lead to sub-optimal allocation of funds. Thus, incentives could be provided to decisionmakers in order to encourage optimal allocation of HIV/AIDS prevention resources. We formulate an incentive-based resource allocation model that takes into consideration strategic interactions between decision-makers in a multiple-level resource-allocation process. We analyze each decision-maker's behavior at the equilibrium and summarize the results that characterize the optimal solution to the resource-allocation problem. Our intended audiences are technical experts, decision-makers, and policy-makers in governments who can make use of incentives to encourage effective decisions regarding HIV/AIDS policy modeling and budget allocation at local levels.

The value of education in special care dentistry as a means of reducing inequalities in oral health	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION			English	Review						special care dentistry; dental education; international classification of functioning disability and health; special needs; primary health care; disabled persons; oral health	SPECIAL-NEEDS PATIENTS; DENTAL EDUCATION; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES; DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITIES; PEOPLE; CHILDREN; SERVICES; ACCESS; PRACTITIONERS; PERCEPTIONS	People with disability are subject to inequality in oral health both in terms of prevalence of disease and unmet healthcare needs. Over 18% of the global population is living with moderate to severe functional problems related to disability, and a large proportion of these persons will require Special Care Dentistry at some point in their lifetime. It is estimated that 90% of people requiring Special Care Dentistry should be able to access treatment in a local, primary care setting. Provision of such primary care is only possible through the education and training of dentists. The literature suggests that it is vital for the dental team to develop the necessary skills and gain experience treating people with special needs in order to ensure access to the provision of oral health care. Education in Special Care Dentistry worldwide might be improved by the development of a recognised academic and clinical discipline and by providing international curricula guidelines based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF, WHO). This article aims to discuss the role and value of promoting and harmonising education in Special Care Dentistry as a means of reducing inequalities in oral health.

This study proposes a method for constructing a French European deprivation index, which will be replicable in several European countries and is related to an individual deprivation indicator constructed from a European survey specifically designed to study deprivation. Methods and Results Using individual data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey, goods/services indicated by individuals as being fundamental needs, the lack of which reflect deprivation, were selected. From this definition, which is specific to a cultural context, an individual deprivation indicator was constructed by selecting fundamental needs associated both with objective and subjective poverty. Next, the authors selected among variables available both in the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey and French national census those best reflecting individual experience of deprivation using multivariate logistic regression. An ecological measure of deprivation was provided for all the smallest French geographical units. Preliminary validation showed a higher association between the French European Deprivation Index (EDI) score and both income and education than the Townsend index, partly ensuring its ability to measure individual socioeconomic status. Conclusion This index, which is specific to a particular cultural and social policy context, could be replicated in 25 other European countries, thereby allowing European comparisons. EDI could also be reproducible over time. EDI could prove to be a relevant tool in evidence-based policy-making for measuring and reducing social disparities in health issues and even outside the medical domain.

Clinical guidelines contribute to the health inequities experienced by individuals with intellectual disabilities	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Intellectual disabilities; Clinical guidelines; Health inequalities	EQUITY; NETHERLANDS; PEOPLE; CARE	Background: Clinical practice guidelines are developed to improve the quality of healthcare. However, clinical guidelines may contribute to health inequities experienced by disadvantaged groups. This study uses an equity lens developed by the International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) to examine how well clinical guidelines address inequities experienced by individuals with intellectual disabilities. Methods: Nine health problems relevant to the health inequities experienced by persons with intellectual disabilities were selected. Clinical guidelines on these disorders were identified from across the world. The INCLEN equity lens was used as the basis for a purpose-designed, semistructured data collection tool. Two raters independently examined each guideline and completed the data collection tool. The data extracted by each rater were discussed at a research group consensus conference and agreement was reached on a final equity lens rating for each guideline. Results: Thirty-six guidelines were identified, one of which (2.8%) explicitly excluded persons with intellectual disabilities. Of the remaining 35, six (17.1%) met the first criterion of the equity lens, identifying persons with intellectual disabilities at high risk for the specific health problem. Eight guidelines (22.9%) contained any content on intellectual disabilities. Six guidelines addressed the fourth equity lens criterion, by giving specific consideration to the barriers to implementation of the guideline in disadvantaged populations. There were no guidelines that addressed the second, third, and fifth equity lens criteria. Conclusions: The equity lens is a useful tool to systematically examine whether clinical guidelines address the health needs and inequities experienced by disadvantaged groups. Clinical guidelines are likely to further widen the health inequities experienced by persons with intellectual disabilities, and other disadvantaged groups, by being preferentially advantageous to the general population. There is a need to systematically incorporate methods to consider disadvantaged population groups into the processes used to develop clinical guidelines.

J	Hanass-Hancock, J; Grant, C; Strode, A				Hanass-Hancock, Jill; Grant, Catherine; Strode, Ann			Disability rights in the context of HIV and AIDS: a critical review of nineteen Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) countries	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION			English	Review						Africa; Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; HIV/AIDS; legal obligations	ACCESS; WOMEN; CARE; ICF	Purpose: Many Eastern and Southern African (ESA) states are obliged to review and amend their legal frameworks with regards to disability since signing and ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The HIV epidemic is one of the main health concerns in the region and is becoming increasingly associated with causing disabilities. In addition, people with disabilities are particularly at risk of exposure to HIV. Despite this, HIV programming has not yet included the interrelationship of disability and HIV. The principles within the CRPD may create much-needed international pressure and so provide a platform for the integration and inclusion of disability into HIV policies and programs. Method: This paper is based on a review of the legal framework in relation to HIV and disability in 19 ESA countries. It identifies 12 key articles of the Convention, which are particularly relevant to the interrelationship of HIV and disability. The paper assesses how these are integrated in the region's disability or HIV legal frameworks and identifies the main gaps within these legal systems. Results: While many country's constitutions, disability and HIV laws protect certain key rights, such as the rights to equality and nondiscrimination, employment and health, there are clear gaps in the legal responses to disability and HIV. In particular, legal frameworks fail to provide adequately for accessibility, mobility and access to justice and protection from violence for people with disabilities. This results in limited protection for people with disabilities from HIV exposure and access to services to address HIV-related health and welfare needs. Conclusions: The paper identifies the gaps and makes recommendations for implementing steps toward the integration of disability into HIV-related laws, policies and programs.

Two preventive tools are available that have the potential together to sharply decrease the impact of cervical cancer in LMIC. The combination of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical cancer screening within existing programs is possible. Although there is a great deal of concern about introducing and strengthening HPV prevention efforts in LMIC, recent projects have demonstrated feasibility. Thus, with appropriate prioritization and resources, HPV prevention can be introduced and scaled up. Comprehensive HPV prevention strategies, mainly those geared at preventing cervical cancer, should include both vaccination and screening. The integration of both screening and vaccination will save the most lives, and such strategies are endorsed by many international organizations. However, some vaccine and screening programs are financed almost entirely by special externally-based programs. These more closely resemble demonstration exercises than sustainable national programs. In order for successful demonstration projects to have a broad impact on prevention, sustainable national funding based on strong commitments is essential. There may be challenges to implementing HPV prevention programs, but none should be considered insurmountable. Many LMIC have successfully adopted an HPV prevention agenda despite prevailing pessimism. Failure to act on this issue can perpetuate inequity in sexually transmitted infection and cancer prevention.

In recent decades issues such as attrition, migration, and different types of imbalances in health workers were not only considered as international problems, but also took on new particular dimensions and complications. Rapid growth in establishing infrastructure of communications and many diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS and malaria, as well as shortages in skilled healthcare providers in developing countries, interested many health economists and health professionals to consider telemedicine as an approach to deliver some healthcare and to pursue its effects on human resources management in healthcare. The objective of this communication is to offer a better understanding of the value of telemedicine in human resources management in healthcare. This article briefly reviews related literature on potential contributions of telemedicine in mitigating four different types of imbalances in health workers and points out some of its capabilities. Although there is a great need for systematic, scientific, and analytical studies in effects of telemedicine on health workers, expansion of communication infrastructure throughout and especially in remote areas, political commitment, and provision of useful information and education to reduce problems of human resources for health are beneficial.

Conceptualising global health: theoretical issues and their relevance for teaching	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Global health; Medical education; Undergraduate; Curriculum; Globalization; Equity	COMPETENCES; EDUCATION	Background: There has long been debate around the definition of the field of education, research and practice known as global health. In this article we step back from attempts at definition and instead ask what current definitions tell us about the evolution of the field, identifying gaps and points of debate and using these to inform discussions of how global health might be taught. Discussion: What we now know as global health has its roots in the late 19th century, in the largely colonial, biomedical pursuit of 'international health'. The twentieth century saw a change in emphasis of the field towards a much broader conceptualisation of global health, encompassing broader social determinants of health and a truly global focus. The disciplinary focus has broadened greatly to include economics, anthropology and political science, among others. There have been a number of attempts to define the new field of global health. We suggest there are three central areas of contention: what the object of knowledge of global health is, the types of knowledge to be used and around the purpose of knowledge in the field of global health. We draw a number of conclusions from this discussion. First, that definitions should pay attention to differences as well as commonalities in different parts of the world, and that the definitions of global health themselves depend to some extent on the position of the definer. Second, global health's core strength lies in its interdisciplinary character, in particular the incorporation of approaches from outside biomedicine. This approach recognises that political, social and economic factors are central causes of ill health. Last, we argue that definition should avoid inclusion of values. In particular we argue that equity, a key element of many definitions of global health, is a value-laden concept and carries with it significant ideological baggage. As such, its widespread inclusion in the definitions of global health is inappropriate as it suggests that only people sharing these values may be seen as 'doing' global health. Nevertheless, discussion of values should be a key part of global health education. Summary: Our discussions lead us to emphasise the importance of an approach to teaching global health that is flexible, interdisciplinary and acknowledges the different interpretations and values of those practising and teaching the field.

J	Mizen, P; Tsoukas, S				Mizen, Paul; Tsoukas, Serafeim			The response of the external finance premium in Asian corporate bond markets to financial characteristics, financial constraints and two financial crises	JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE			English	Article						Financial constraints; External finance premium; Asian markets; Financial crises	MONETARY-POLICY; BUSINESS CYCLES; INVESTMENT; CHANNEL; PANEL; DEBT	Empirical investigation of the external finance premium has been conducted on the margin between internal finance and bank borrowing or equities but little attention has been given to corporate bonds, especially for the emerging Asian market. In this paper, we hypothesize that balance sheet indicators of creditworthiness could affect the external finance premium for bonds as they do for premia in other markets. Using bond-specific and firm-specific data for China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand during 1995-2009 we find that firms with better financial health face lower external finance premia in all countries. When we introduce firm-level heterogeneity, we show that financial variables appear to be both statistically and quantitatively more important for financially constrained firms. Finally, when we examine the effects of the 1997-1998 Asian crisis and the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, we find that the sensitivity of the premium is greater for constrained firms during the Asian crisis compared to other times.

Many of the leadership in the Asia Pacific region is becoming increasingly aware that improving the conditions for health would go a long way to sustaining economic prosperity in the region, as well as improving global and local health equity. There is no biological reason why males born in Cambodia can expect to live 23 years less than males born in Japan, or why females born in Tuvalu live 23 years shorter than females in New Zealand or why non-Indigenous Australian males live 12 years longer than Indigenous men. The nature and drivers of health inequities vary greatly among different social, cultural and geo-political contexts and effective solutions must take this into account. This paper utilizes the CSDH global recommendations as a basis for looking at the actions that are taking place to address the structural drivers and conditions of daily living that affect health inequities in the Asia Pacific context. While there are signs of action and hope, substantial challenges remain for health equity in Asia Pacific. The gains that have been made to date are not equally distributed and may be unsustainable as the world encounters new economic, social and environmental challenges. Tackling health inequities is a political imperative that requires leadership, political courage, social action, a sound evidence base and progressive public policy.

Climate Change and Food Security: Health Impacts in Developed Countries	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Review						adaptation; climate change; food safety; food security; nutrition; regulation	TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; PRODUCE; SOIL; UK	BACKGROUND: Anthropogenic climate change will affect global food production, with uncertain consequences for human health in developed countries. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the potential impact of climate change on food security (nutrition and food safety) and the implications for human health in developed countries. METHODS: Expert input and structured literature searches were conducted and synthesized to produce overall assessments of the likely impacts of climate change on global food production and recommendations for future research and policy changes. RESULTS: Increasing food prices may lower the nutritional quality of dietary intakes, exacerbate obesity, and amplify health inequalities. Altered conditions for food production may result in emerging pathogens, new crop and livestock species, and altered use of pesticides and veterinary medicines, and affect the main transfer mechanisms through which contaminants move from the environment into food. All these have implications for food safety and the nutritional content of food. Climate change mitigation may increase consumption of foods whose production reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Impacts may include reduced red meat consumption (with positive effects on saturated fat, but negative impacts on zinc and iron intake) and reduced winter fruit and vegetable consumption. Developed countries have complex structures in place that may be used to adapt to the food safety consequences of climate change, although their effectiveness will vary between countries, and the ability to respond to nutritional challenges is less certain. CONCLUSIONS: Climate change will have notable impacts upon nutrition and food safety in developed countries, but further research is necessary to accurately quantify these impacts. Uncertainty about future impacts, coupled with evidence that climate change may lead to more variable food quality, emphasizes the need to maintain and strengthen existing structures and policies to regulate food production, monitor food quality and safety, and respond to nutritional and safety issues that arise.

Much previous work on interactions within these fields has focused on economic migrants. In this paper we seek to understand the social fields occupied by British pensioners who have moved to Spain and how these interact with their health and their experience of the healthcare system. We explore the links between health, social fields, healthcare, place and social relationships. We use in-depth interviews conducted among those living in a variety of settings. We draw upon Bourdieu's concept of habitus and social fields and differentiate, between ways of being and ways of belonging in the fields. We identified three social fields. The first embraced interviewees' social networks back in the UK where implicit comparisons of healthcare were made. The second embraced their expatriate social networks in Spain which includes their conceptualization of a "healthy life", while the third included the interaction with Spanish institutions, including the healthcare system. This conceptual framework provides new insights for those considering retirement abroad, and those that want to understand how lifestyles and navigating distinct social fields influence health and the healthcare experience.

Methods As part of a wider study attempting to identify RCTs of public policy sector programmes and the reasons for variation between countries and sectors in their use, we carried out a pilot study which interviewed 10 policy makers and researchers in six countries to elicit views on barriers to and facilitators of the use of RCTs for social programmes. Results While in common with earlier studies, those interviewed expressed a need for unambiguous findings, timely results and significant effect sizes, users could, in fact, be ambivalent about robust methods and robust answers about what works, does not work or makes no difference, particularly where investment or a policy announcement was planned. Different national and policy sector cultures varied in their use of and support for RCTs. Conclusions In order to maximise the use of robust evaluations of public programmes across the world it would be useful to examine, systematically, crossnational and cross-sectoral variations in the use of different methods including RCTs and barriers to and facilitators of their use. Sound research methods, whatever their scientific value, are no guarantee that findings will be useful or used. ` Stories' have been shown to influence policy; those advocating the use of RCTs may need to provide convincing narratives to avoid repetition about their value.

With an increasingly diverse population, nursing students in the United States can gain a unique perspective on health disparities and challenges in providing healthcare for diverse populations. Nursing education has the opportunity to engage students in our global village by providing clinical and theory-based educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate nursing students. Some nursing educational settings in schools of nursing provide global nursing opportunities to explore the social responsibility of nursing. This paper details a specific framework and opportunities for engaging undergraduate and graduate nursing students in caring for the underserved in our global village. Opportunities in the Fulbright Student Exchange Program and Fulbright Senior Scholar Award mechanisms are discussed, and partnerships with international nursing programs are explored.

Vulnerable population and health status in a neighbourhood in Zaragoza (Spain)	HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY			English	Article						determinants; illness and health-care; inequalities in health and health-care; neighbourhoods	SELF-RATED HEALTH; SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; PERCEPTION; BEHAVIORS; MORTALITY; GROWTH; EQUITY; ACCESS; CARE	This paper aims to identify the inter-relationships between the social factors that influence epidemiological patterns in the city neighbourhood of Casablanca, Zaragoza (Spain). Data for a cross-sectional survey were collected between January 2008 and April 2008 from a representative random sample of 1032 residents aged more than 15 years. The study interview contained information scales on healthcare behaviours, treatment evaluation, the number of medical consultations in the weeks pervious to the interview and the perceived health status of the respondents, using The Health Perception Questionnaire. The global index (continuous variable) allowed inferences to be made on the individuals perception of his/her own health. The assessment of social vulnerability was based on the occupational, educational and economic conditions of the interviewees. An individual was considered to belong to a vulnerable subeconomic group if he/she had a personal income of 6000 euros or less; or had no formal education or had been educated up to primary school level only; or was not in paid employment at the time of the interview. A descriptive and comparative analysis of the vulnerable and non-vulnerable population groups for perceived and diagnosed health variables was undertaken using parametric and non-parametric tests. A total of 550 interviewees (53.3%) were considered vulnerable people. Low level of instruction (primary or no education) was the main characteristic of this group (356 subjects, 64.7% of those identified as vulnerable). Binary logistic regression was used to analyse the association between belonging to the vulnerable group and a number of health variables adjusted for gender, age and area of residence. The vulnerable group had worse levels of perceived health even when controlled for gender and area of residence. In Casablanca, the place of residence is an important social stratification indicator reflected in the characteristics of the vulnerable population group and its perceived health.

J	Huff-Rousselle, M				Huff-Rousselle, Maggie			The logical underpinnings and benefits of pooled pharmaceutical procurement: A pragmatic role for our public institutions?	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Review						Pooled procurement; Multi-country; Economies of scale; Monopsony; Buyers' cartel; Pharmaceuticals; Contraceptives; Essential drugs; Vaccines	VACCINES	Multi-national pharmaceutical companies have long operated across national boundaries, and exercised significant leverage because of the breadth and depth of their market control. The goals of public health can be better served by redressing the imbalance in market leverage between supply and demand. Consolidation of purchasing power across borders, as well as within countries across organizational entities, is one means to addressing this imbalance. In those existing pooled procurement models that consolidate purchasing across national boundaries, benefits have included: 1) reductions in unit purchase prices; 2) improved quality assurance; 3) reduction or elimination of procurement corruption; 4) rationalized choice through better-informed selection and standardization; 5) reduction of operating costs and administrative burden; 6) increased equity between members; 7) augmented practical utility in the role of the host institutions (regional or international) administering the system; and finally, 8) increased access to essential medical products within each participating country. Many barriers to implementation of a multi-country pooled procurement system are eliminated when the mechanism is established within a regional or international institution, especially where participating countries are viewed (and view themselves) as clients/members of the institution, so that they have some sense of ownership over the procurement mechanism. This review article is based on two literature reviews, conducted between 2007 and 2009 (including publications from 1996 through 2009), and interviews with key informants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Crowcroft, NS; Hamid, JS; Deeks, SL; Frank, J				Crowcroft, Natasha S.; Hamid, Jemila S.; Deeks, Shelley L.; Frank, John			Human papilloma virus vaccination programs reduce health inequity in most scenarios: a simulation study	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							CERVICAL-CANCER MORTALITY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; VACCINES; RISK; AGE	Background: The global and within-country epidemiology of cervical cancer exemplifies health inequity. Public health programs may reduce absolute risk but increase inequity; inequity may be further compounded by screening programs. In this context, we aimed to explore what the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine might have on health equity allowing for uncertainty surrounding the long-term effect of HPV vaccination programs. Methods: A simple static multi-way sensitivity analysis was carried out to compare the relative risk, comparing after to before implementation of a vaccination program, of infections which would cause invasive cervical cancer if neither prevented nor detected, using plausible ranges of vaccine effectiveness, vaccination coverage, screening sensitivity, screening uptake and changes in uptake. Results: We considered a total number of 3,793,902 scenarios. In 63.9% of scenarios considered, vaccination would lead to a better outcome for a population or subgroup with that combination of parameters. Regardless of vaccine effectiveness and coverage, most simulations led to lower rates of disease. Conclusions: If vaccination coverage and screening uptake are high, then communities are always better off with a vaccination program. The findings highlight the importance of achieving and maintaining high immunization coverage and screening uptake in high risk groups in the interest of health equity.

Advancing the Science of Medicines Regulation: The Role of the 21st-Century Medicines Regulator	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							DRUG; PERSPECTIVE	The history of medicines regulation is punctuated with sudden swings in focus mandated by a public injured by medicines and skeptical of regulators' abilities to protect them. As stakeholder communities and the science that undergirds medicines have both grown more sophisticated, seemingly conflicting mission equities, such as public health protection vs. promotion or population vs. individual patient product development focus, have created new challenges to defining the mission and role of twenty-first-century medicines regulators. The role of medicines regulators as a nationally focused, retrospective assessor of data is rapidly shifting to that of a prospective generator of public data and tools to help drive what has now become a global product development and regulatory enterprise that is fast gaining recognition as an integral part of any truly effective twenty-first-century health-care system. This article discusses this evolution and describes how regulatory science will help to both drive and define it.	[Lumpkin, M. M.; Hamburg, M.

Women in resource-poor settings face a double cancer burden: the backlog of preventable cancer, and the emerging challenge of cancers that cannot be prevented but whose impact could be dramatically reduced through early detection and treatment. Disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, and other health and non-health outcomes are exacerbated by gender inequity and compounded by discrimination and stigma. The combination of these barriers implies a multiplicative challenge for women who face cancer, particularly when the disease is associated with reproduction. The horizons of maternal and reproductive health should extend to include the life cycle of healthy changes and illness that are embodied in longer life for women. Numerous opportunities exist to strengthen health systems through sexual and reproductive and women and health platforms and better meet the challenge of cancer.

J	Quinn, N; Knifton, L				Quinn, Neil; Knifton, Lee			Positive Mental Attitudes: how community development principles have shaped a ten-year mental health inequalities programme in Scotland	COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL			English	Article								Positive Mental Attitudes (PMA) is a mental health inequalities initiative that has operated for over ten years in East Glasgow, the United Kingdoms highest concentrated area of socio-economic deprivation. The programme began as a grassroots initiative by a service user forum in the local community and has since developed a broad coalition of community support with mainstream funding and over fifty partners from a range of sectors. The work has built capacity within local community groups and agencies to deliver a wide range of community development (CD) initiatives with tens of thousands of people, which have also informed both national strategies and international programmes. We assess the programme in the context of wider theory and policy debates and explore the processes and tensions that exist within this sphere of work. We examine evaluation debates and what counts as success in the complex and contested area of mental health and CD. We call for a new public health movement, prioritizing health equity over health gain and driven by CD principles, and argue that the evidence from PMA can provide evidence-based pointers of what this should involve.

Reliability, validity, and prevalence of partner violence measured by the conflict tactics scales in male-dominant nations	AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Injury; Victimization; Dating; Measures; Gender equality; Dyadic perpetration type	FEMALE UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; UNITED-STATES; SOCIAL DESIRABILITY; INTIMATE PARTNERS; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; DATING PARTNERS; MENTAL-HEALTH; PHYSICAL AGGRESSION; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; SEXUAL COERCION	This article evaluates whether use of the Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS) with women in male-dominant nations results in reliable and valid data. Tabulation of ten published studies in male-dominant nations found a median alpha coefficient of reliability of .86. For university students in the 32 nation International Dating Violence Study, the median alpha for women is .82 and .78 for males. Similar alpha coefficients were found regardless of the national level of male-dominance. Validity was measured by estimating the sensitivity of the CTS in eliciting data on perpetration of physical assault, by evaluating the degree to which assaults reported by the women were acts of self-defense, and by construct validity analyses to test the hypothesis that being a victim of physical assault as measured by the CTS is associated with physical injury, depressive symptoms, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. The hypothesized relationships were found regardless of the degree of male dominance in a nation. The results support continued use of the CTS to investigate PV in the lives of women worldwide.

J	Awan, H; Malik, SM; Khan, NU				Awan, Haroon; Malik, Sadia Mariam; Khan, Niaz Ullah			The economic burden of blindness in Pakistan: A socio-economic and policy imperative for poverty reduction strategies	INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Review						Blindness; disability; equity; health economics; health policy; health and development; social exclusion	VISUAL IMPAIRMENT SURVEY; NATIONAL BLINDNESS; GLOBAL BLINDNESS	State and nonstate health programs in developing countries are often influenced by priorities that are defined in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In the wake of recessionary pressures, policy makers in the health sector are often seen to divert significant budgets to some specific health programs and make only token allocations for other health problems that are important but do not fall under the traditional MDG box of health priorities. This paper illustrates the economic argument for investment in one such program: The eye health program and employs a country case study of Pakistan to demonstrate that there are significant economic gains that are being foregone by not addressing the needs of the blind in poverty reduction strategies. By applying appropriate growth and discounting factors and using the average wage rate, the paper estimates the total productivity gains that are realizable over a period of 10 years if the blind population in Pakistan is rehabilitated and their carers released to participate in the mainstream economic activity. Our findings indicate that significant productivity gains accumulated over 10 years, range from Rs. 61 billion (US$ 709 million) to Rs. 421 billion (US$ 4.9 billion) depending upon whether the entire blind population or only those affected by a specific cause are rehabilitated. The per annum productivity gains of rehabilitating the entire blind population represents 0.74 of the current gross domestic product of Pakistan, which is higher than the total public spending on health. In order to reap these benefits, the subsequent absorption of the rehabilitated blind and their carers into mainstream economic activity is as important as their effective rehabilitation.

The new tendency is to facilitate a convergence between health system developers and disease-specific programme managers in terms of both thinking and action, and to reconcile both approaches: one focusing on integrated health systems and improving the health status of the population and the other aiming at improving access to health care. Eye care interventions particularly in developing countries have generally been vertically implemented (e.g. trachoma, cataract surgeries) often with parallel organizational structures or specialised disease specific services. With the emergence of health system strengthening in health strategies and in the service delivery of interventions there is a need to clarify and examine inputs in terms governance, financing and management. This present paper aims to clarify key concepts in health system strengthening and describe the various components of the framework as applied in eye care interventions.

This has brought health and social benefits unimaginable to our ancestors and sets us apart from all previous generations. Yet there is a wide-ranging body of evidence that suggests that modernity is now in decline, largely because its methods and mindset are increasingly recognized as unsustainable. Problems are manifest in the emergence of new public health epidemics such as obesity and addictive behaviours, the loss of well-being and increase in anxiety and depression in affluent society, and the persistence of ever-widening health and social inequalities at national and global levels. Still larger problems now confront us, such as climate change, peak oil and the loss of biodiversity, all of which are linked to the 'modern' way of life. We are potentially faced with the collapse of certain aspects of modern society: we are certainly faced with the prospect of inevitable change. While the broad public health community has an important role to play in developing workable solutions to such daunting problems, we argue that some profound changes will be needed in order for us to cope successfully. No blueprints for dealing with change exist, which means that we will need to learn our way into the future. In this paper we take a perspective on the role and nature of the future practitioner in public health and health promotion. We argue that future practitioners will need to develop new ways of thinking, being and doing; new perspectives and new forms of understanding the world. We believe our discipline - and people generally - to be capable of such development, as insights from multiple sources tell us that human nature is malleable, not fixed. We use this analysis to trace, as examples, the imagined lives of five women living in different eras over the course of history in a Western society, and the emergence of different mindsets or worldviews, as the social, economic and cultural context changes. Post-modern analysts might insist that we have no basis for making value judgements between such different worldviews. In this paper, however, we argue that future practitioners should be empathetic to different views and willing to move beyond them, as necessary. We will need to learn and develop in ways that are compatible with our intrinsic needs as human beings and the needs of our ecosystem. We conclude by suggesting just some of the supportive processes of change needed in mapping out a more sustainable future for the public health community.

Historically a sphere of governmental activity led by physicians and staffed by sanitarians and nurses, public health has evolved to become a multi-facetted field of societal activity. It engages many agencies and community action in reducing infectious and non-communicable diseases as well as many aspects of lifestyle and health equity. Education for an adequate professional workforce is one of its key functions. Schools of public health have fulfilled this role only partly even in developed countries, but in countries in transition and in low-income countries the problem is much more acute. We discuss the role of mentoring of new schools calling for strong public and private donor support for this as a key issue in global health.

Funding for malaria control 2006-2010: A comprehensive global assessment	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Malaria; Equity; Funding; International aid; Policy; Population at risk; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax	PLASMODIUM-VIVAX; SCALE-UP; FALCIPARUM; CRISIS; HEALTH; RISK	Background: The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in international and domestic funding for malaria control, coupled with important declines in malaria incidence and mortality in some regions of the world. As the ongoing climate of financial uncertainty places strains on investment in global health, there is an increasing need to audit the origin, recipients and geographical distribution of funding for malaria control relative to populations at risk of the disease. Methods: A comprehensive review of malaria control funding from international donors, bilateral sources and national governments was undertaken to reconstruct total funding by country for each year 2006 to 2010. Regions at risk from Plasmodium falciparum and/or Plasmodium vivax transmission were identified using global risk maps for 2010 and funding was assessed relative to populations at risk. Those nations with unequal funding relative to a regional average were identified and potential explanations highlighted, such as differences in national policies, government inaction or donor neglect. Results: US$8.9 billion was disbursed for malaria control and elimination programmes over the study period. Africa had the largest levels of funding per capita-at-risk, with most nations supported primarily by international aid. Countries of the Americas, in contrast, were supported typically through national government funding. Disbursements and government funding in Asia were far lower with a large variation in funding patterns. Nations with relatively high and low levels of funding are discussed. Conclusions: Global funding for malaria control is substantially less than required. Inequity in funding is pronounced in some regions particularly when considering the distinct goals of malaria control and malaria elimination. Efforts to sustain and increase international investment in malaria control should be informed by evidence-based assessment of funding equity.

J	Tal, O; Hakak, N				Tal, Orna; Hakak, Nina			EARLY AWARENESS AND ALERT SYSTEMS FOR MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN ISRAEL	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Horizon scanning; Medical technologies; Dilemmas in health policy; Health policy	EMERGING HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES	Background: Throughout the world, decision makers face the need to plan on the basis of uncertainty. Prospective updates on future trends of medical technology usage are tools to improve national health status. In Israel, this challenge is met by several steps taken to promote insight into the realm of emerging technologies. Israel's unique horizon strategy refers to three time spans: the immediate to short-term (for the coming year) updating the National List of Health Services (NLHS) and quarterly scanning; the medium-term (3 years to a decade) revitalizing hospital devices and infrastructure; and long-term planning (over a decade), such as the "Health Israel 2020 Project". Methods: A description of the Israeli setup of different time spans and tiers. Results: The matrix of players, loci, interests, population groups, and incentives creates a complex situation and the Ministry of Health has to regulate the different suppliers and tiers of insurance (obligatory, supplementary, and private), balancing need, equity, and cost containment in preparing for future health care. However, preparedness is not a sterile laboratory and is pervaded by numerous dilemmas and the search for adequate evidence for new less mature technologies is an on-going challenge. Conclusion: Bridging the forecasting chasm for the future requires analyzing needs, reinforcing evidence and seeing "around the corner" when synergizing between all the "actors" in the national arena. Expert consultation and international cooperation with similar horizon organizations can assist in paving the way for more successful planning efforts for future medical technology implementation.

This "brain drain" results in health workforce shortages, health system weakening, and economic loss and waste, threatening the well-being of vulnerable populations and effectiveness of global health interventions. Current structural imbalances in resource allocation and global incentive structures have resulted in 57 countries identified by WHO as having a "critical shortage" of health workers. Yet current efforts to strengthen domestic health systems have fallen short in addressing this issue. Instead, global solutions should focus on sustainable forms of equitable resource sharing. This can be accomplished by adoption of mandatory global resource and staff-sharing programs in conjunction with implementation of state-based health services corps. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Many medicines available in the developing world are only available to a small percentage of the population due to economic inequities. The profit-seeking behavior of pharmaceutical companies exacerbates this problem. In most cases, the price reductions required to make drugs affordable to a broader class of people in the developing world are not offset by the resultant increase in sales volume. Simply stated, in most of the developing world, it is more profitable to sell drugs to the very wealthy at high prices than it is to sell cheaper drugs to a greater number of people. As a result, medicines remain unaffordable for the vast majority of people in many parts of the world. While this might be an acceptable outcome for certain commodities, such as luxury goods, it is completely unacceptable for life-saving medicines. Therefore, in order to effectively address the global lack of access to medicines, the role pharmaceutical companies play in the international intellectual property regime must be critically examined.											39	27	32	0	21	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	1073-1105	1748-720X		J LAW MED ETHICS	J.

J	de Campos, TC				de Campos, Thana Cristina			Health as a Basic Human Need: Would This Be Enough?	JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS			English	Article								Although the value of health is universally agreed upon, its definition is not. Both the WHO and the UN define health in terms of well-being. They advocate a globally shared responsibility that all of us states, international organizations, pharmaceutical corporations, civil society, and individuals bear for the health (that is, the well-being) of the world's population. In this paper I argue that this current well-being conception of health is troublesome. Its problem resides precisely in the fact that the well-being conception of health, as an all-encompassing label, does not properly distinguish between the different realities of health and the different demands of justice, which arise in each case. In addressing responsibilities related to the right to health, we need to work with a more differentiated vocabulary, which can account for these different realities. A crucial distinction to bear in mind, for the purposes of moral deliberation and the crafting of political and legal institutions, is the difference between basic and non-basic health needs. This distinction is crucial because we have presumably more stringent obligations and rights in relation to human needs that are basic, as they justify stronger moral claims, than those grounded on non-basic human needs. It is important to keep this moral distinction in mind because many of the world's problems regarding the right to health relate to basic health needs. By conflating these needs with less essential ones, we risk confusing different types of moral claims and weakening the overall case for establishing duties regarding the right to health. There is, therefore, a practical need to reevaluate the current normative conception of health so that it distinguishes, within the broad scope of well-being, between what is basic and what is not. My aim here is to shed light onto this distinction and to show the need for this differentiation. I do so, first, by providing, on the basis of David Miller's concept of basic needs, an account of basic health needs and, secondly, by mounting a defense of the basic needs approach to the right to health, arguing against James Griffin who opposes the basic needs approach.

Who is utilizing anti-retroviral therapy in Ghana: An analysis of ART service utilization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Inequities; ART; Utilization; Sex; Regional; Ghana; HIV and AIDS	SCALE-UP; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; HEALTH; HIV; HIV/AIDS; CARE; MENS; MASCULINITY; AFRICA; ACCESS	Introduction: The global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV patients has led to concerns regarding inequities in utilization of ART services in resource-limited contexts. In this paper, we describe regional and sex differentials in the distribution of ART among adult HIV patients in Ghana. We highlight the need for interventions to address the gender-based and geographic inequities related to the utilization of ART services in Ghana. Methods: We reviewed National AIDS/STIs Control Program's ART service provision records from January 2003 through December 2010, extracting data on adults aged 15+ who initiated ART in Ghana over a period of eight years. Data on the number of patients on treatment, year of enrollment, sex, and region were obtained and compared. Results: The number of HIV patients receiving ART in Ghana increased more than 200-fold from 197 in 2003, to over 45,000 in 2010. However, for each of six continuous years (2005-2010) males comprised approximately one-third of adults newly enrolled on ART. As ART coverage has expanded in Ghana, the proportion of males receiving ART declined from 41.7% in 2004 to 30.1% in 2008 and to 27.6% in 2010. Also, there is disproportionate regional ART utilization across the country. Some regions report ART enrollment lower than their percent share of number of HIV infected persons in the country. Conclusions: Attention to the comparatively fewer males initiating ART, as well as disproportionate regional ART utilization is urgently needed. All forms of gender-based inequities in relation to HIV care must be addressed in order for Ghana to realize successful outcomes at the population level. Policy makers in Ghana and elsewhere need to understand how gender-based health inequities in relation to HIV care affect both men and women and begin to design appropriate interventions.

Method: Information regarding the use of care and rehabilitation during the 1st year after stroke was retrieved from the Stockholm County Council database and the medical data was taken from the medical records. The Barthel Index was used for self-ratings of dependence pre-stroke, and the Stroke Impact Scale was used to assess self-perceived disability and a global rating of recovery at 12 months. One hundred and ninety-two individuals were included. Results: Results showed that the younger group received more care and rehabilitation than the older group. In the older group, comorbid conditions and pre-stroke dependence, estimated in accordance with the Barthel Index, were more common. The older group reported larger impact on self-perceived disability regarding strength, mobility, self-care and domestic life, while self-perceived global recovery did not differ between the groups. Conclusion: Younger individuals received more care and rehabilitation, which indicates structural inequality in the provision of health care resources. However, as no difference in self-perceived global recovery was found between the groups; the disparity in the provision of health care may also be a consequence of greatest support being given to those in greatest need. By demonstrating the necessity of involving self-rated assessments of stroke impact at different points in time and in different age groups, the results of this study add to previous knowledge of age-related differences in the provision of health care and stroke outcome. Furthermore. this suggests a way to approach evaluation of equality in the provision of health care. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about how to enhance equity at the organizational level within the PHC sector. Drawing on research conducted at two PHC Centres in Canada whose explicit mandates are to provide services to marginalized populations, the purpose of this paper is to discuss (a) the key dimensions of equity-oriented services to guide PHC organizations, and (b) strategies for operationalizing equity-oriented PHC services, particularly for marginalized populations. Methods: The PHC Centres are located in two cities within urban neighborhoods recognized as among the poorest in Canada. Using a mixed methods ethnographic design, data were collected through intensive immersion in the Centres, and included: (a) in-depth interviews with a total of 114 participants (73 patients; 41 staff), (b) over 900 hours of participant observation, and (c) an analysis of key organizational documents, which shed light on the policy and funding environments. Results: Through our analysis, we identified four key dimensions of equity-oriented PHC services: inequity-responsive care; trauma-and violence-informed care; contextually-tailored care; and culturally-competent care. The operationalization of these key dimensions are identified as 10 strategies that intersect to optimize the effectiveness of PHC services, particularly through improvements in the quality of care, an improved 'fit' between people's needs and services, enhanced trust and engagement by patients, and a shift from crisis-oriented care to continuity of care. Using illustrative examples from the data, these strategies are discussed to illuminate their relevance at three inter-related levels: organizational, clinical programming, and patient-provider interactions. Conclusions: These evidence-and theoretically-informed key dimensions and strategies provide direction for PHC organizations aiming to redress the increasing levels of health and health care inequities across population groups. The findings provide a framework for conceptualizing and operationalizing the essential elements of equity-oriented PHC services when working with marginalized populations, and will have broad application to a wide range of settings, contexts and jurisdictions. Future research is needed to link these strategies to quantifiable process and outcome measures, and to test their impact in diverse PHC settings.

It has evolved into an essential caries management concept for improving quality and access to oral care globally. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have indicated that the high effectiveness of ART sealants using high-viscosity glass ionomers in carious lesion development prevention is not different from that of resin fissure sealants. ART using high-viscosity glass ionomer can safely be used to restore single-surface cavities both in primary and in permanent posterior teeth, but its quality in restoring multiple surfaces in primary posterior teeth cavities needs to be improved. Insufficient information is available regarding the quality of ART restorations in multiple surfaces in permanent anterior and posterior teeth. There appears to be no difference in the survival of single-surface high-viscosity glass-ionomer ART restorations and amalgam restorations. The use of ART results in smaller cavities and in high acceptance of preventive and restorative care by children. Because local anaesthesia is seldom needed and only hand instruments are used, ART is considered to be a promising approach for treating children suffering from early childhood caries. ART has been implemented in the public oral health services of a number of countries, and clearly, proper implementation requires the availability of sufficient stocks of good high-viscosity glass ionomers and sets of ART instruments right from the start. Textbooks including chapters on ART are available, and the concept is being included in graduate courses at dental schools in a number of countries. Recent development and testing of e-learning modules for distance learning has increasingly facilitated the distribution of ART information amongst professionals, thus enabling more people to benefit from ART. However, this development and further research require adequate funding, which is not always easily obtainable. The next major challenge is the continuation of care to the frail elderly, in which ART may play a part. ART, as part of the Basic Package of Oral Care, is an important cornerstone for the development of global oral health and alleviating inequality in oral care.

This article addresses the significance of, and justification for, this exclusion. It begins with a legislative background to the relevant limitation and subsequently examines its rationale according to prevailing legal, medical and sociological discourses. The article then considers the relevance of the discussion for disability rights. Although 'addiction', or the preferred term, 'substance dependence', is classified as a disability for international systems of disease classification, the relevance of substance dependence for discussion on disability rights, and of disability for discussion on substance dependence, has largely escaped critical comment.

Engaged Anthropology in 2011: A View from the Antipodes in a Turbulent Era	AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH	Like any particular year, 2011 proved one that provided engaged anthropologists with many issues with which to grapple. These included the aftereffects of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Wikileaks, the "Arab spring", and the Occupy movement. In this review article of engaged anthropology, I highlight the work of anthropologists as manifested in (1) published books and articles and (2) presentations at selected conferences and public events, some of which touch upon the above mentioned events as well as others that occurred in 2011. My essay focuses on the following themes: (1) corporate globalization, power, and inequalities in the world system; (2) global health; (3) climate change; (4) disasters; and (5) indigenity and indigenous rights in Australasia. I end my essay by revisiting the notion of "public anthropology" and juxtaposing this to what I view the much broader notion of "engaged anthropology."

The discourse to which all others are answerable is a technical discourse, even where matters of privacy and consent are concerned. Yet a focus on technical issues and a failure to think about ethics are cited as factors in the failure of the UK health record system. In this paper, while the prime concern is the Australian Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record (PCEHR), the discussion is relevant to and informed by the international context. The authors draw attention to ethical and conceptual issues that have implications for the success or failure of electronic health records systems. Important ethical issues to consider as Australia moves towards a PCEHR system include: issues of equity that arise in the context of personal control, who benefits and who should pay, what are the legitimate uses of PCEHRs, and how we should implement privacy. The authors identify specific questions that need addressing.

International comparisons suggest that U.S. rates reflect high levels of social disadvantage and misguided policies that frame teen parenting as costly for mothers, children, and taxpayers. Studies that control for background factors that predispose teens to become parents highlight the social inequities that contribute to early childbearing and unfavorable maternal-child outcomes, regardless of maternal age. After reviewing these studies, federal policies that target and scrutinize teenage and single mothers are described and critiqued for the ways they disregard the social determinants of early childbearing and further the marginalization and social exclusion of low-income families. This review calls for public health nurses to challenge the ideological assumptions driving downstream policies and to advocate for comprehensive reforms that reduce the wide and growing inequities in education, income, and health among U.S. citizens. Building the public support and political will to move upstream will remain daunting in light of the pervasive stereotypes of teen parents and the ideological assumptions that early childbearing and poor maternal-child outcomes stem more from individual choices and lifestyles than from social inequities.

Water Gives Life: Framing an Environmental Justice Movement in the Mainstream and Alternative Salvadoran Press	ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Global South; El Salvador; Metallic Mining; Transnational Corporations (TNCs); Environmental Justice Movements; Media Framing	SOCIAL-MOVEMENTS; LATIN-AMERICA; MEDIA; INJUSTICE; INEQUALITY; PARADIGM; POWER	This article explores mainstream and alternative press discourses of conflict over metallic mining in El Salvador. Through identifying mainstream and counter-frames, I show how an anti-mining movement achieved a position of short-term prominence within the dominant media discourse surrounding gold mining. However, even when the movement was able to break into the mainstream press, the resulting news coverage reproduced the nation-state's traditional power structure. In contrast, the alternative press challenged the neoliberal economic system, presenting a counter-narrative of community rights and a negligent national government that failed to protect the environment and health of its citizens. In this comparative analysis, I argue that by reframing dominant narratives of economic progress toward community rights and environmental justice, alternative media can act in synergy with environmental justice movements to discursively break a cycle of environmental inequity by collectively reimagining a more sustainable and just future.

This exploratory study assesses whether the health of MPS in Montreal, Canada, is similar to that reported in the international literature (see Health situation of migrants with precarious status: Review of the literature and implications for the Canadian context-Part A, Social Work in Public Health, 27(4), 330-344). The results of this study show that, as in other parts of the world, MPS in Canada appear to be confronted by multiple obstacles to health, many of which are linked to their precarious migration status and its impact on living conditions and access to health care. To reduce health inequalities, therefore, it is crucial to better understand and address the specific needs of this highly vulnerable population.

J	McCabe, A; Davis, A				McCabe, Angus; Davis, Ann			Community development as mental health promotion: principles, practice and outcomes	COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL			English	Article							HOSPITAL ANXIETY	There is growing international interest in community development (CD) approaches to addressing mental distress and promoting mental well-being, generated by major changes in mental health policy, provision and the growing voice of mental health service users. Yet CD practitioners have tended to view these as issues outside their sphere of expertise, interest or influence. This article investigates the oparallel worlds' of CD and mental health with a view to promoting a productive engagement between them. Drawing on primary research in England and also current international debates, it highlights three issues and draws on a local case study: first, a tendency for mental health promotion interventions to be rooted in models of community pathology rather than individual and collective strengths; secondly, the ways in which mental health policies focus on individual determinants and responsibilities for mental health and well-being, and fail to challenge structural inequalities; thirdly, how omeasures' of the impact of CD are compromised in a policy environment which stresses brief interventions and outcomes. It concludes by suggesting ways in which such parallel worlds may be brought productively together.

NZ has a poor history of housing regulation, so existing houses are often poorly insulated and rental properties are not required to have insulation or heating. Average indoor temperatures are cold by international standards and occupants regularly report they are cold, because they cannot afford to heat their houses. Fuel poverty is thought to be a factor in NZ's high rate of excess winter mortality (16%, about 1600 deaths a year) and excess winter hospitalisations (8%). We examined the link between indoor cold and health in two community trials, the Housing, Insulation, and Health Study and the Housing. Heating, and Health Study and both interventions demonstrated encouraging benefit/cost ratios. NZ governments have translated this and other research into major policy programmes designed to retrofit insulation and efficient heating into existing houses. However, houses are predominantly electrical resistance heated and a largely unregulated electricity market has seen rapidly rising residential electricity prices. These rising energy prices, combined with low rates of economic growth, rising unemployment and generally rising income inequality, are likely to further increase levels of fuel poverty in NZ, unless broader policy action is taken.

This paper explores different approaches applied across European countries focusing on the role that managerial tools may have in coping with this challenge. Method: The paper reports the results of recent studies on responses to financial crisis from European countries and which are the techniques they had applied to reallocate resources. Results: Although resources scarcity, some governments did not reduce the healthcare expenditure because they believe in its focal role on the economic development and on maintaining social cohesion and protection of vulnerable people. Other countries decided a strong reduction of costs which often has affected services delivered. In both cases authors suggest to avoid across-the-board cuts in favor of approach involving priority setting. Conclusion: The public sector has assumed new responsibilities following the global crisis and the rising demand for social services. Some countries shifted the healthcare costs from the public purse to private households undermining the survival of the health system and the universal coverage. A way to avoid this risk is based on the ability to share discussion about where to cut and where to reallocate resources.

Methods: All records of young people (aged 10 to 21 years) taken into detention in Brisbane Queensland over the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2009 were reviewed, and data were extracted documenting the mental health and related behaviours of those referred to the Mental Health, Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Service. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria were applied to a clinical interview. ICD-10 diagnostic outcomes and reason for referral are presented by Indigenous status and age. Results: Young male (under 14 years of age) Indigenous respondents are substantially over-represented in youth in detention. Indigenous youth in detention are disproportionately referred and diagnosed with a substance use problem. Referral and diagnosis of substance use problems was not as commonly found for non-Indigenous youth. Conclusions: Young Indigenous persons are substantially over-represented in those taken into detention in Queensland. This study shows significant differences in relation to mental health and substance use assessment outcomes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous young people in youth detention in Queensland. Further research focusing on service delivery for Indigenous young people should focus on their specific needs.

We outline here key dimensions of the debate, pointing to areas where human geographers can make a particularly strong contribution. These include: issues of adaptation and resilience; sustainability; environmental justice and socially unequal impacts of climate change; and psychological as well as physical impacts of environment on health. Key themes in the emerging research agenda include the significance of affect and emotion for the perception and communication of hazard and risk associated with the health impacts of climate change. Also, understanding exposure to health risks of climate change requires knowledge of complex and individually variable daily action spaces and residential mobility over the lifecourse. We argue for research that considers complex processes operating at various geographical scales, linking arguments about 'global health' with the more local and individual processes that contribute to health determinants. Much of the literature on health impacts of climate change demonstrates socially and geographically unequal effects, which often exacerbate existing health disparities. This highlights the links between this field of health geography and other geographical research concerned with sustainability and environmental justice.	[Curtis, S.

J	Wahlbeck, K; McDaid, D				Wahlbeck, Kristian; McDaid, David			Actions to alleviate the mental health impact of the economic crisis	WORLD PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Mental health; economic crisis; suicide prevention; social policy	SUICIDE RATES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; UNEMPLOYMENT; POPULATION; RECESSION; MORTALITY; INCOME; INEQUALITIES; DEPRESSION; SERVICES	The current global economic crisis is expected to produce adverse mental health effects that may increase suicide and alcohol-related death rates in affected countries. In nations with greater social safety nets, the health impacts of the economic downturn may be less pronounced. Research indicates that the mental health impact of the economic crisis can be offset by various policy measures. This paper aims to outline how countries can safeguard and support mental health in times of economic downturn. It indicates that good mental health cannot be achieved by the health sector alone. The determinants of mental health often lie outside of the remits of the health system, and all sectors of society have to be involved in the promotion of mental health. Accessible and responsive primary care services support people at risk and can prevent mental health consequences. Any austerity measures imposed on mental health services need to be geared to support the modernization of mental health care provision. Social welfare supports and active labour market programmes aiming at helping people retain or re-gain jobs can counteract the mental health effects of the economic crisis. Family support programmes can also make a difference. Alcohol pricing and restrictions of alcohol availability reduce alcohol harms and save lives. Support to tackle unmanageable debt will also help to reduce the mental health impact of the crisis. While the current economic crisis may have a major impact on mental health and increase mortality due to suicides and alcohol-related disorders, it is also a window of opportunity to reform mental health care and promote a mentally healthy lifestyle.

We aimed to assess how the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in health changes in relation to different rates of national progress in coverage of interventions for the health of mothers and children. Methods We assessed coverage in low-income and middle-income countries for which two Demographic Health Surveys or Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys were available. We calculated changes in overall coverage of skilled birth attendants, measles vaccination, and a composite coverage index, and examined coverage of a newly introduced intervention, use of insecticide-treated bednets by children. We stratified coverage data according to asset-based wealth quintiles, and calculated relative and absolute indices of inequality. We adjusted correlation analyses for time between surveys and baseline coverage levels. Findings We included 35 countries with surveys done an average of 9.1 years apart. Pro-rich inequalities were very prevalent. We noted increased coverage of skilled birth attendants, measles vaccination, and the composite index in most countries from the first to the second survey, while inequalities were reduced. Rapid changes in overall coverage were associated with improved equity. These findings were not due to a capping effect associated with limited scope for improvement in rich households. For use of insecticide-treated bednets, coverage was high for the richest households, but countries making rapid progress did almost as well in reaching the poorest groups. National increases in coverage were primarily driven by how rapidly coverage increased in the poorest quintiles. Interpretation Equity should be accounted for when planning the scaling up of interventions and assessing national progress.	[Victora, Cesar G.; Barros, Aluisio J. D.; Franca, Giovanny V.

But the question remains: what can motivate efforts of the international community and nation-states? Our focus is the grounding of solidarity with respect to global inequities in health. We explore what considerations could motivate acts of global solidarity in the specific context of health migration, and sketch briefly what form this kind of solidarity could take. First, we argue that the only plausible conceptualization of persons highlights their interdependence. We draw upon a conception of persons as ecological subjects and from there illustrate what such a conception implies with the example of nurses migrating from low and middle-income countries to more affluent ones. Next, we address potential critics who might counter any such understanding of current international politics with a reference to real-politik and the insights of realist international political theory. We argue that national governments while not always or even often motivated by moral reasons alone may nevertheless be motivated to acts of global solidarity by prudential arguments. Solidarity then need not be, as many argue, a function of charitable inclination, or emergent from an acknowledgment of injustice suffered, but may in fact serve national and transnational interests. We conclude on a positive note: global solidarity may be conceptualized to helpfully address global health inequity, to the extent that personal and transnational interdependence are enough to motivate national governments into action.

J	Wiggins, N				Wiggins, Noelle			Popular education for health promotion and community empowerment: a review of the literature	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						determinants of health; empowerment; inequalities in health; health education; literature review	CHILD NUTRITION; PREVENTION; PROGRAM; PROJECT; ISSUES; FREIRE; WOMEN; WORK	While there is now general agreement that the most effective way to promote health and decrease health inequities is by creating more just economic, social and political conditions, there is much less agreement about concrete ways in which public health practitioners can work with communities to address inequities such as poverty, racism and powerlessness. Practical strategies are desperately needed. Popular education, also known as Freirian and empowerment education, has been used successfully to create more equitable conditions around the world for 50 years. Its use to improve health has been documented in the public health literature since the early 1980s. Nonetheless, it remains largely unknown and its potential unrealized in mainstream public health circles in the industrialized world. In order to explore the potential of popular education as a tool to address inequities and improve health, a systematic review of the peer-reviewed international literature was conducted. Findings revealed that popular educationis an effective method for enhancing empowerment and improving health. However, the existing literature does not provide empirical evidence that popular education is more effective than traditional education at increasing health knowledge and empowerment and changing health behavior. In order to fully understand the potential of popular education as a tool to eliminate health inequities and to advocate effectively for its use, further studies are needed that utilize mixed methods, participatory approaches and experimental or quasi-experimental designs.

The aim of this project was to characterize some of the main differences among the national systems. Methods Data were collected using two questionnaires. The first one was distributed among leading centers of pediatric diabetes (one per country) with the aim of establishing an overview of the systems, national policies, quality control (QC) and financing of pediatric diabetes care. Responses were received from all 27 EU countries. The second questionnaire was widely disseminated among all 354 International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes members with a domicile in an EU country; it included questions related to individual pediatric diabetes centers. A total of 108 datasets were collected and processed from healthcare professionals who were treating more than 29?000 children and adolescents with diabetes. Data on the reimbursement policies were verified by representatives of the pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Results The collected data reflect the situation in 2009. There was a notable heterogeneity among the systems for provision of pediatric diabetes care across the EU. Only 20/27 EU countries had a pediatric diabetes register. Nineteen countries had officially recognized centers for pediatric diabetes, but only nine of them had defined criteria for becoming such a center. A system for QC of pediatric diabetes at the national level was reported in 7/26 countries. Reimbursement for treatment varied significantly across the EU, potentially causing inequalities in access to modern technologies. Conclusions The collected data help develop strategies toward improving equity and access to modern pediatric diabetes care across Europe.

The use of biomarkers in occupational health research, practice, and policy	TOXICOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Biomarkers; Biological monitoring; Policy; Mechanism	PSYCHOSOCIAL WORK-ENVIRONMENT; BIOLOGICAL MARKERS; URINARY BIOMARKERS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; EXPOSURE; DISEASE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SURVEILLANCE; CRITERIA; HAZARDS	Biomarkers are potentially useful tools for occupational health and safety research, practice, and policy. However, the full realization of this potential has not been achieved. In this paper, the progress made in these three usage areas is reviewed to identify what efforts can be taken to realize the full promise of biomarkers. Biomarker uses are described by a diverse taxonomy that builds on the categories of exposure, effect and susceptibility, and the continuum between exposure and disease prognosis. The most significant uses of biomarkers in occupational health have been in biological monitoring of workers. Other important uses have been in enhancing research and assessing mechanisms of action of occupational toxicants at low exposures. Seven critical areas will influence the extent to which the potential of biomarkers in occupational health and safety is realized. These include: (1) adequate investment in validation; (2) obtaining international agreement on exposure guidelines; (3) exploring the utility of biomarkers in regulation; (4) applying biomarkers to critical occupational safety and health questions; (5) developing the exposome; (6) utilizing biomarkers to address emerging occupational health issues; and (7) continuing to address the ethical and social justice issues related to biomarkers. Overall, if biomarkers are to make a major contribution to occupational health and safety then a more holistic approach to bringing them from the laboratory to practice will be needed.

J	Holman, PA; Ruud, T; Grepperud, S				Holman, Per Arne; Ruud, Torleif; Grepperud, Sverre			Horizontal equity and mental health care: a study of priority ratings by clinicians and teams at outpatient clinics	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							INTERRATER RELIABILITY; GLOBAL ASSESSMENT; GENERALIZABILITY; EXPERIENCES; CANADA	Background: In Norway, admission teams at Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs) assess referrals from General Practitioners (GPs), and classify the referrals into priority groups according to treatment needs, as defined in the Act of Patient Rights. In this study, we analyzed classification of similar referrals to determine the reliability of classification into priority groups (i.e., horizontal equity). Methods: Twenty anonymous case vignettes based on representative referrals were classified by 42 admission team members at 16 CMHCs in the South-East Health Region of Norway. All clinicians were experienced, and were responsible for priority setting at their centres. The classifications were first performed independently by the 42 clinicians (i.e., individual rating), and then evaluated utilizing team consensus within each CMHC (i.e., team rating). Interrater reliability was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) while the reliability of rating across raters and units (generalizability) were estimated using generalizability analysis. Results: The ICCs (2.1 single measure, absolute agreement) varied between 0.40 and 0.51 using individual ratings and between 0.39 and 0.58 using team ratings. Our findings suggest a fair (low) degree of interrater reliability, and no improvement of team ratings was observed when compared to individual ratings. The generalizability analysis, for one rater within each unit, yields a generalizability coefficient of 0.50 and a dependability coefficient of 0.53 (D study). These findings confirm that the reliability of ratings across raters and across units is low. Finally, the degree of inconsistency, for an average measurement, appears to be higher within units than between units (G study). Conclusion: The low interrater reliability and generalizability found in our study suggests that horizontal equity to mental health services is not ensured with respect to priority. Priority -setting in teams provides no significant improvement compared to individual rating, and the additional use of these resources may be questionable. Improved guidelines, tutorials, training and calibration of clinicians may be utilized to improve the reliability of priority-setting.

Keep Well, an anticipatory care programme aimed at reducing health inequalities in Scotland, commenced in 2006. There is currently little evidence exploring how frontline staff respond to the delivery of anticipatory care. Aim. To understand how staff view changes in practice resulting from the implementation of Keep Well. Methods. Qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposively selected sample of 12 Keep Well staff. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Results. Keep Well was viewed positively, especially in terms of increased knowledge and skills for staff and the benefits of a holistic health check to patients. Staff believed that Keep Well has improved their practice beyond the project. Concerns were raised, relating to potential inconveniences for patients, staff turnover, increased workload and procedures. There was a view that anticipatory care should continue to be delivered to deprived communities, provided that there are adequate resources, such as staff and funding, to do so. Conclusion. Keep Well staff believe that the project should continue to be offered as a 40-minute holistic health check targeted at patients in deprived areas.

Public health insurance coverage for the rural poor has increased, but rural women have fared worse because of lower status and lack of voice in shaping the services they need. Use of prenatal care, safe delivery and reproductive tract infections (RTIs) services is inadequate and service seeking for health problems remains lower for men. We present findings from a study of gender and health equity in rural China from 2002 to 2008 and offer recommendations from over a decade of applied research on reproductive health in rural China. Three studies, conducted in poor counties between 1994 and 2008, identified problems in access and pilot tested interventions and mechanisms to increase women's participation in health planning. They were done in conjunction with a World Bank programme and the global Gender and Health Equity Network (GHEN). Reproductive health service-seeking improved and the study interventions increased local government commitment to providing such services through new health insurance mechanisms. Findings from the studies were summarised into recommendations on gender and health for inclusion in new health reform efforts.

In this article, we start by outlining some key dimensions of change in demographic and epidemiological patterns as well as their drivers; second, we address in more depth the question of whether current scientific practice is generating all the questions needed to improve global health in the coming years, and define potentially effective strategies for positive change. Significant demographic changes (i.e., reductions in earlier mortality and fertility; ageing and urbanisation) are leading to the emergence of chronic diseases in the Global South, as well, although patterns are very diverse, and early mortality and disability will still remain high for a few decades in certain areas. Such inequality in health patterns seems to parallel globalisation processes, and results from the effects of social and structural determinants. To better understand those relationships, we must improve our thinking about causality as well as our standard views of what constitutes 'good evidence'.

Globalisation and global health governance: Implications for public health	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						globalisation; global health governance; public health; global health; global health initiatives		Globalisation is a defining economic and social trend of the past several decades. Globalisation affects health directly and indirectly and creates economic and health disparities within and across countries. The political response to address these disparities, exemplified by the Millennium Development Goals, has put pressure on the global community to redress massive inequities in health and other determinants of human capability across countries. This, in turn, has accelerated a transformation in the architecture of global health governance. The entrance of new actors, such as private foundations and multi-stakeholder initiatives, contributed to a doubling of funds for global health between 2000 and 2010. Today the governance of public health is in flux, with diminished leadership from multilateral institutions, such as the WHO, and poor coherence in policy and programming that undermines the potential for sustainable health gains. These trends pose new challenges and opportunities for global public health, which is centrally concerned with identifying and addressing threats to the health of vulnerable populations worldwide.

Community-level correlates of intimate partner violence against women globally: A systematic review	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Review						Intimate partner violence; Communities; Systematic review; Women; Global	DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; GENDER INEQUALITY; INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL; MULTILEVEL; PREVALENCE; PREDICTORS; HEALTH; CRIME; INDIA	Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is a problem facing women around the world, one that has implications for women's health and well-being. The relationship between communities and the occurrence of IPV is an expanding area of research. Although a large number of community characteristics have been examined in relation to IPV, the research as a whole lacks a coherent theoretical focus or perspective. In this systematic review, we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence regarding the community-level correlates of IPV against women. In our review of peer-reviewed research published between January 1, 1990 and January 31, 2011, we identify key community-level correlates, detect gaps, and offer recommendations for future research. Recognizing a difference in approach between U.S. and non-U.S. based research and an over-reliance on a primarily urban, U.S.-based perspective on communities and IPV, we advocate for a global perspective that better reflects the social and economic fabric of communities around the world. Specifically, future research should focus on the most promising, but currently under-studied, community-level correlates of IPV against women, namely gender inequality, gender norms, and adapted measures of collective efficacy/social cohesion.

Besides some relevant aspects of the distribution, such as inequality and dynamics, it mainly focuses on trends in polarisation and in exploring some key factors that might be behind these trends. The results of the study reveal that polarisation in EUIMD has followed a decreasing path and that factors like geographic location and government expenditure on health are those which better explain the polarisation phenomenon.

J	Arboleda-Flórez, J; Stuart, H				Arboleda-Florez, Julio; Stuart, Heather			From Sin to Science: Fighting the Stigmatization of Mental Illnesses	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE			English	Review						stigma; discrimination; stigmatization; stigma reduction	HEALTH PROFESSIONALS; STIGMA; DISCRIMINATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PEOPLE	Our paper provides an overview of current stigma discourse, the origins and nature of the stigma associated with mental illnesses, stigmatization by health providers, and approaches to stigma reduction. This is a narrative review focusing on seminal works from the social and psychological literature, with selected qualitative and quantitative studies and international policy documents to highlight key points. Stigma discourse has increasingly moved toward a human rights model that views stigma as a form of social oppression resulting from a complex sociopolitical process that exploits and entrenches the power imbalance between people who stigmatize and those who are stigmatized. People who have a mental illness have identified mental health and health providers as key contributors to the stigmatization process and worthy targets of antistigma interventions. Six approaches to stigma reduction are described: education, protest, contact-based education, legislative reform, advocacy, and stigma self-management. Stigma denigrates the value of people who have a mental illness and the social and professional support systems designed to support them. It creates inequities in funding and service delivery that undermine recovery and full social participation. Mental health professionals have often been identified as part of the problem, but they can redress this situation by becoming important partners in antistigma work.

J	Saguil, A; Stephens, M				Saguil, Aaron; Stephens, Mark			Interventions to Prevent Childhood Obesity	AMERICAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; HEALTH CONSEQUENCES; US CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; PREVALENCE; TRENDS	Background: Prevention of childhood obesity is an international public health priority given the significant impact of obesity on acute and chronic diseases, general health, development, and well-being. The international evidence base for strategies that governments, communities, and families can implement to prevent obesity and promote health has been accumulating, but remains unclear. Objectives: This review aims primarily to update the previous Cochrane review of childhood obesity prevention research and determine the effectiveness of evaluated interventions intended to prevent obesity in children, assessed by change in body mass index (BMI). Secondary aims were to examine the characteristics of the programs and strategies to answer the question, "What works for whom, why, and for what cost?" Search Methods: The searches were rerun in CENTRAL, Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and CINAHL in March 2010 and relevant Web sites were searched. Non-English-language papers were included and experts were contacted. Selection Criteria: The review includes data from childhood obesity prevention studies that used a controlled study design (with or without randomization). Studies were included if they evaluated interventions, policies, or programs in place for 12 weeks or more. If studies were randomized at a cluster level, six clusters were required. Data Collection and Analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were extracted on intervention implementation, cost, equity, and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured adiposity, physical activity-related behaviors, or diet-related behaviors. Adverse outcomes were recorded. A meta-analysis was conducted using available BMI or standardized BMI (zBMI) score data with subgroup analysis by age group (zero to five years, six to 12 years, and 13 to 18 years, corresponding to stages of developmental and childhood settings). Main Results: This review includes 55 studies (an additional 36 studies found for this update). The majority of the studies targeted children six to 12 years of age. The meta-analysis included 37 studies of 27,946 children and demonstrated that programs were effective at reducing adiposity, although not all individual interventions were effective, and there was a high level of observed heterogeneity (l(2) = 82 percent). Overall, children in the intervention group had a standardized mean difference in adiposity (measured as BMI or zBMI) of -0.15 kg per m(2) (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.21 to -0.09). Intervention effects by age subgroups were -0.26 kg per m(2) (95% CI, -0.53 to 0.00; zero to five years),.-0.15 kg per m2 (95% CI, -0.23 to -0.08; six to 12 years), and -0.09 kg per m2 (95% CI, -0.20 to 0.03; 13 to 18 years). Heterogeneity was apparent in all three age groups and could not be explained by randomization status or the type, duration, or setting of the intervention. Only eight studies reported on adverse effects, and no evidence of adverse outcomes, such as unhealthy dieting practices, increased prevalence of underweight, or body image sensitivities, was found. Interventions did not appear to increase health inequalities, although this was examined in fewer studies. Authors' Conclusions: The authors found strong evidence to support beneficial effects of childhood obesity prevention programs on BMI, particularly for programs targeted to children six to 12 years of age. However, given the unexplained heterogeneity and the likelihood of small study bias, these findings must be interpreted cautiously. A broad range of program components were used in these studies, and although it is not possible to distinguish which of these components contributed most to the beneficial effects observed, our synthesis indicates the following to be promising policies and strategies: School curriculum that includes healthy eating, physical activity, and positive body image Increased sessions for physical activity and the development of fundamental movement skills throughout the school,week Improvements in the nutritional quality of the food supply in schools Environments and cultural practices that support children eating healthier foods and being active throughout each day Support for teachers and other staff to implement health promotion strategies and activities (e.g., professional development, capacity-building activities) Parent support and home activities that encourage children to be more active, eat more nutritious foods, and spend less time in screen-based activities However, study and evaluation designs need to be strengthened, and reporting should be extended to capture process and implementation factors, outcomes in relation to measures of equity, longer-term outcomes, potential harms, and costs. Childhood obesity prevention research must now move toward identifying how effective intervention components can be embedded within health, education, and care systems, and achieve long-term sustainable impacts.

The results permit to conclude that, due to the lack of specific regulation and general rule of child labor prohibition, the restrictions that tend to protect the health and security of children and adolescents that act in the artistic niche (television, advertising, fashion, movies etc.) have been, in Brazil, at subjective criteria of the judges and, in many cases, in the hands of producers themselves. Brief considerations on how other countries regulate the theme are also presented (the USA, Portugal and Argentina).	[Cavalcante, S. R.; Vilela, R. A.

However, inequities, both between and within countries, persist. The review reported here, of inequities in health between and within countries across the 53 Member States of the WHO European region, was commissioned to support the development of the new health policy framework for Europe: Health 2020. Much more is understood now about the extent, and social causes, of these inequities, particularly since the publication in 2008 of the report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. The European review builds on the global evidence and recommends policies to ensure that progress can be made in reducing health inequities and the health divide across all countries, including those with low incomes. Action is needed-on the social determinants of health, across the life course, and in wider social and economic spheres-to achieve greater health equity and protect future generations.

The focus of the review was to identify key policy areas in the European region likely to be most effective in addressing social determinants of health and in reducing health inequities, building on the work of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. The aim was to make recommendations that can be actioned in all countries in the European region, taking account of their very different social and economic situations. The review was carried out by a consortium chaired by Michael Marmot of the Institute of Health Equity, University College London (London, UK) and supported by a joint secretariat from the Institute and the WHO European Regional Office. The review was informed and shaped by the work of 13 task groups and guided by a senior advisory board whose members are: Guillem Lopez Casanovas, Zsuzsa Ferge, Ilona Kickbusch, Johan Mackenbach, Tilek Meimanaliev, Amartya Sen, Vladimir Starodubov, Tomris Turmen, Denny Vagero, Margaret Whitehead, and ex-officio representatives of WHO, Agis Tsouros, and the European Commission, Michael Huebel. The task groups were based around the major social determinants of health. The available evidence was collated and interpreted by task groups, each comprising experts in the particular social determinant and related areas. The task groups and their chairs were early years, education and family (Alan Dyson and Naomi Eisenstadt), employment and working conditions (Johannes Siegrist), social exclusion, disadvantage, and vulnerability (Jennie Popay), GDP, taxation, income, and welfare (Olle Lundeberg), sustainability and community (Anna Coote), gender issues (Maria Kopp), older people (Emily Grundy), ill health prevention and treatment (Gauden Galea and Witold Zatonski), economics (Marc Suhrcke and Richard Cookson), governance and delivery mechanisms (Harry Burns and Erio Ziglio), global influences (Ronald Labonte), equity, equality, and human rights (Karien Stronks), and measurements and targets (Martin Bobak and Claudia Stein). The authors of the paper formed the UCL Secretariat, supported by Matilda Allen. The WHO Secretariat was led by Agis Tsouros, with Johanna Hanefeld, Piroska Ostlin, Asa Nihlen, Chris Brown, Isabel Yordi, Sarah Simpson, and Richard Alderslade.		38	874	909	4	236	ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC	NEW YORK	360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA	0140-6736			LANCET	Lancet	SEP 15	2012	380	9846					1011	1029		10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61228-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61228-8			19	Medicine, General & Internal	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	General & Internal Medicine	005JF	22964159				2025-01-01	WOS:000308746000031

Nursing Inquiry 2012; 19: 190201 ?Unmasking the predicament of cultural voyeurism: a postcolonial analysis of international nursing placements The growing interest in international nursing placements cannot be left unnoticed. After 11 years into this twenty-first century, violations of human rights and freedom of speech, environmental disasters, and armed conflicts still create dire living conditions for men and women around the world. Nurses have an ethical duty to address issues of social justice and global health as a means to fulfil nursings social mandate. However, international placements raise some concerns. Drawing on the works of postcolonial theorists in nursing and social sciences, we examine the risk of replicating colonialist practices and discourses of health in international clinical placements. Referring to Bakhtins notions of dialogism and unfinalizability, we envision a culturally safe nursing practice arising from dialogical encounters between the Self as an Other and with the Other as an Other. We suggest that exploring the intricacies of cultural and race relations in everyday nursing practice are the premises upon which nurses can understand the broader historic, racial, gendered, political and economic contexts of global health issues. Finally, we make suggestions for developing culturally safe learning opportunities at the international level without minimizing the impact of dialogical cultural encounters occurring at the local and community levels.

J	Thomas, C				Thomas, Carol			Theorising disability and chronic illness: Where next for perspectives in medical sociology?	SOCIAL THEORY & HEALTH			English	Article						medical sociology; sociology of disability; disability studies; impairment effects	REFLECTIONS; COMPLEXITY	The proposal in this article is that the time is ripe for a distinct sociology of disability to come into being as a new sub-discipline within mainstream sociology. This sociology of disability would be a variant of equality and diversity stud14ies in the discipline - located alongside the now familiar engagements with gender, 'race', sexuality, age and social class. The sociology of disability would encompass the study of disablism and impairment effects, with the former taking centre stage. This means that disability would cease to be located almost exclusively in a specialized sub-field of interpretative medical sociology - known for several decades as the sociology of chronic illness and disability. Rather, disability - like gender - would become a key dimension of global social divisions and inequity that can be approached from a multiplicity of analytical directions, using a rich mix of theoretical perspectives, methodologies and research techniques. This article will unpack some of the arguments in favour of such a move - dividing these into three argumentative threads for presentational purposes. Of course, no one can determine the direction taken by a discipline - it is a matter of argument, debate and initiative.

J	Johri, M; Chung, R; Dawson, A; Schrecker, T				Johri, Mira; Chung, Ryoa; Dawson, Angus; Schrecker, Ted			Global health and national borders: the ethics of foreign aid in a time of financial crisis	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Developing countries; Ethics; International Agencies; International Cooperation; Voluntary Health Agencies; World Health	DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE	Background: The governments and citizens of the developed nations are increasingly called upon to contribute financially to health initiatives outside their borders. Although international development assistance for health has grown rapidly over the last two decades, austerity measures related to the 2008 and 2011 global financial crises may impact negatively on aid expenditures. The competition between national priorities and foreign aid commitments raises important ethical questions for donor nations. This paper aims to foster individual reflection and public debate on donor responsibilities for global health. Methods: We undertook a critical review of contemporary accounts of justice. We selected theories that: (i) articulate important and widely held moral intuitions; (ii) have had extensive impact on debates about global justice; (iii) represent diverse approaches to moral reasoning; and (iv) present distinct stances on the normative importance of national borders. Due to space limitations we limit the discussion to four frameworks. Results: Consequentialist, relational, human rights, and social contract approaches were considered. Responsibilities to provide international assistance were seen as significant by all four theories and place limits on the scope of acceptable national autonomy. Among the range of potential aid foci, interventions for health enjoyed consistent prominence. The four theories concur that there are important ethical responsibilities to support initiatives to improve the health of the worst off worldwide, but offer different rationales for intervention and suggest different implicit limits on responsibilities. Conclusions: Despite significant theoretical disagreements, four influential accounts of justice offer important reasons to support many current initiatives to promote global health. Ethical argumentation can complement pragmatic reasons to support global health interventions and provide an important foundation to strengthen collective action.

However, the occupational health literature does not pay enough attention to psychosocial health hazards. This is especially true for stress among Thai contract farmers who experience psychosocial health hazards from the factors such as state policies, labor market, advanced technologies, and job environment such as employment and working conditions. The results of these factors contribute to stress and health inequality among Thai contract farmers under globalization. Objective: We constructed a psychosocial model that explains the cause of stress among Thai contract farmers resulting from globalization, which creates health hazards as defined in the occupational health field. Method: Primary data were collected from 200 Thai contract farmers using simple random sampling. The variables measured were general sociodemographic indicators, globalization, job environment, Thai labor market, and Thai state policy variables. 'The self-analyzed and self-evaluated stress' test was also used. The model of stress among Thai contract farmers was verified using Path analysis. Results: Transnational corporations and transnational economics had a direct effect on stress with a standardized regression weight of -0.200 and 0.209. Transnational corporations and state protection had a direct effect on natural resources with a standardized regression weight of -0.189 and -0.150. State protection and natural resources had a total effect on state regulation with a standardized regression weight of 0.784 and -0.092. Transnational practices and transnational economics had a total effect on the Thai labor market. Conclusion: The strength of the causal relationship between globalization and stress was investigated and indirect effects were found between several macrosocial variables examined and stress. These are new findings in the understanding of the distal causes of stress among Thai farmers.

Inconsistency in standards, particularly within a research network highlights the need to balance volunteers' health and wellness with the efficient conduct of research. Ten research centers (RC's) in East and Southern Africa affiliated with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) were studied using a mixed methods approach to understand variations, similarities and gaps in services provided, recipients of services, referral systems, and barriers to referral uptake. These data were then used to develop expected standards across the 10 RCs. Findings indicated that RCs consistently provided HIV risk reduction and family planning (FP) counseling, male condoms, management of sexually transmitted infections, CD-4 counts, and general medical care to volunteers and non-research volunteers. Services that were less consistently provided on-site included: female condoms, adult male circumcision (AMC), antiretroviral therapy (ART) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in case of rape. The FP options provided on-site varied, with few providing implants, intrauterine devices, tubal ligation, and vasectomy. Most RCs had established referral systems for ART, AMC, PEP, and FP, but few had referral points for psychosocial services. Few RCs had comprehensive guidelines on referrals other than those related to adverse events. Findings indicate that the greatest challenges for referral uptake were transportation and health care costs, poor quality and inconsistency of services at some referral points. Few RCs covered the cost of referrals for non-study related adverse events. A collaborative process between IAVI and the RCs was undertaken to reach consensus on expected standards of care. A set of required and recommended services to be provided on-site or by referral was developed. In developing such standards, we tried to balance scientific priorities, equity, contextual realities, community expectations, and cost-effectiveness.

The influence of the macro-environment on physical activity: a multilevel analysis of 38 countries worldwide	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY			English	Article						Physical activity; Environment; Multilevel analysis; World Health Survey	ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE; LEISURE-TIME; OBESITY; HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; PREVENTION	Background: As indicated by the ANGELO framework and similar models, various environmental factors influence population levels of physical activity (PA). To date attention has focused on the micro-level environment, while evidence on the macro-level environment remains scarce and mostly limited to high-income countries. This study aims to investigate whether environmental factors at macro-level are associated with PA among a broader range of countries. Methods: Data from the World Health Survey (WHS) was used to analyze 177,035 adults from 38 (mostly low and middle income) countries. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-S) was used to measure PA. Respondents were classified as active or inactive for vigorous PA, moderate PA and walking. Multilevel logistic regression was performed to assess associations between macro-level environmental factors and the prevalence of PA, with control for individual-level socioeconomic factors. Results: The prevalence of PA varied widely between countries and types of PA (5.0%-93.8%). A negative association was found between gross domestic product and PA, odds ratios for men were 0.76 (95% CI: 0.65-0.89) for moderate PA and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63-0.98) for walking. A higher temperature was associated with less PA (all types) and higher urbanization was associated with less vigorous and moderate PA. More gender equality was also associated with more walking for women. Governmental functioning and literacy rate were not found to be associated with any type of PA. Conclusions: This exploratory study indicates that factors such as climate, economic development and cultural factors are determinants of the level of overall PA at national levels. This underlines the suggestion that the macro-environment should be regarded as an important influence on PA.

Using a universally agreed definition of disability based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, this paper examines how, apart from age, social and economic factors contribute to disability differences between older men and women. Methods: World Health Survey data were analyzed from 57 countries drawn from all income groups defined by the World Bank. The final sample comprises 63638 respondents aged 50 and older (28568 males and 35070 females). Item Response Theory was applied to derive a measure of disability which ensured cross country comparability. Individuals with scores at or above a threshold score were those who experienced significant difficulty in their everyday lives, irrespective of the underlying etiology. The population was then divided into "disabled" vs. "not disabled". We firstly computed disability prevalence for males and females by socio-demographic factors, secondly used multiple logistic regression to estimate the adjusted effects of each social determinant on disability for males and females, and thirdly used a variant of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique to partition the measured inequality in disability between males and females into the "explained" part that arises because of differences between males and females in terms of age and social and economic characteristics, and an "unexplained" part attributed to the differential effects of these characteristics. Results: Prevalence of disability among women compared with men aged 50+ years was 40.1% vs. 23.8%. Lower levels of education and economic status are associated with disability in women and men. Approximately 45% of the sex inequality in disability can be attributed to differences in the distribution of socio-demographic factors. Approximately 55% of the inequality results from differences in the effects of the determinants. Conclusions: There is an urgent need for data and methodologies that can identify how social, biological and other factors separately contribute to the health decrements facing men and women as they age. This study highlights the need for action to address social structures and institutional practices that impact unfairly on the health of older men and women.

A major criticism of this method is it downplays the significance of experiential, cultural or political facets of HIV/AIDS. We apply the concept of 'rendering technical' to explore the relationship between methods used in HIV/AIDS research in Papua, Indonesia and current socioeconomic conditions. We analysed research methods used in sixty-two HIV/AIDS studies, assessed presentations at an international AIDS conference, and conducted ethnographic research in Papua. Nation-wide EBPH initiatives are implemented in Papua, yet there remains a critical mass of qualitative ethnographic studies carried out by indigenous scholars emphasising experiences of persons and culture, often within a colonial or post-colonial framework. We argue these studies partially counter approaches which render technical complex realities. In political conditions where indigenous minorities suffer inequities, qualitative ethnographic research may yield critical kinds of evidence, potentially contributing to more nuanced decision-making around HIV.

J	Sellers, C; Melling, J				Sellers, Christopher; Melling, Joseph			Towards a transnational industrial-hazard history: charting the circulation of workplace dangers, debates and expertise	BRITISH JOURNAL FOR THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE			English	Article							USEFUL CATEGORY; ASBESTOS; HEALTH; ENVIRONMENTS; BURDEN; BODY	We argue that industrial hazards have remained an integral feature of the international and 'global' economy since the early modern period, and invite historians of science into the study of their history. The growth and dissemination of knowledge about these hazards, as well as the production and trade that generate them, continue to generate deep inequalities in just who is exposed to them, as illustrated by the shifting impact of the asbestos-related disease plague in the past half-century. Exposure levels in poorer countries have risen as those in affluent societies have fallen, the latter due as much to popular protest and media exposure as to scientific expertise. We suggest that the best way to understand the formation of knowledge about these hazards is not to return to the epistemological battlegrounds of the 'science wars' of the 1990s but to seek more interdisciplinary integration of the multifaceted ways that material bodies, environments and interests contribute to an understanding of such hazards and injuries. We propose the framework of 'industrial-hazard regimes' as an avenue into the ways in which knowledge about risks and dangers at work are created, translated and contested in different countries and times. While urging a return, in some respects, to the early models of 'progressive enlightenment' devised by radical commentators and pioneering historians of the industrial hazard in the early twentieth century, we would revise these early approaches, and also offer some sceptical commentary on the difficulties raised, more recently, by narratives of 'heroic populism' or 'anti-science epidemiology'. The critical standpoints for which we argue recognize the diverse social and political identities and loyalties not only of past contributors to the controversies on industrial hazard, but also of historians of science and medicine themselves.

Methods: NZDep has been created from four 5-yearly censuses using theory developed from international deprivation research, a standard statistical procedure (principal component analysis) and both construct and criterion validation. Results: The latest index was based on nine socio-economic deprivation variables available for just over 4 million people. It was calculated from a basis of 24,000 small areas containing a median of approximately 90 people. The deprivation index has a value from 1 (low) to 10 (high). It is mapped to standard administrative areas and is available free of charge. The index is easy to visualize, and deprivation maps are widely used. The index is used in many applications in research and social epidemiology, and routinely by the country's Ministry of Health, both to explore health variations across the country and to allocate central government funds to local health care providers. Geographers in local government were quick to recognize the index as a good tool for visualizing the diversity and neediness of local communities, and hence as a tool for town and service planning. Conclusion: The national NZDep index of small-area deprivation has been used widely in research on mortality, morbidity and determinants of ill health, and in needs assessment, resource allocation and advocacy.

Mortality inequalities by environment type in New Zealand	HEALTH & PLACE			English	Article						Environmental deprivation; Health; Mortality; Physical environment; New Zealand; Health inequalities	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; HEALTH; JUSTICE; DEPRIVATION	In previous work a multivariate measure of health-related physical environment - the Multiple Environmental Deprivation Classification (MEDClass) - was created to investigate relationships between exposure to differing types of physical environment and health for the UK. Associations between MEDClass and all cause mortality, mortality from certain specific causes, and self-reported morbidity, independent of the level of socio-economic deprivation, were found. In this short report we determine whether the MEDClass approach has potential for international replication and whether the relationships with health prevails. We use New Zealand as a case study. Six environmental clusters were identified and similar associations between environmental classification and health outcomes were observed.

Assessing where vulnerable groups fare worst: a global multilevel analysis on the impact of welfare regimes on disability across different socioeconomic groups	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							HEALTH INEQUALITIES; MAGNITUDE; COUNTRIES; MORTALITY	Background Investigations on health differences within welfare states between low- and high-socioeconomic groups are mainly conducted in Europe. With the aim of gaining global insight on the extent welfare regimes influence personal disability for the most vulnerable, we explore how these health differences vary between low- and high-socioeconomic groups. Methods The World Health Survey data were analysed on 199 595 adults from 46 countries using the welfare regime classification developed by Wood and Gough. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate welfare regime differences in self-reported disability according to individual educational attainment and employment status. Results As compared with the low educated in the European-conservative regime, the odds of having a higher prevalence of disability was found among low-educated people residing in the informal-security regime of South Asia, with OR being 3.16 (95% CI 2.23 to 4.47). While state-organised regimes seemed to offer more protection against disability to the low educated, the productivist regime of East Asia trailed closely behind, with OR being 1.10 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.60) for the low educated. Similar findings were also observed in the unemployed. Conclusions State-organised regimes of Europe and the productivist regime of East Asia seem to contain protecting features against disability for all citizens and especially for the most vulnerable. Apart from the productivist regime of East Asia, the low educated and the unemployed seem to carry the greatest health burden within more insecure regimes, highlighting a deficiency in social provisions within these regimes aimed at protecting the most vulnerable.

However, there has been little empirical investigation as to whether and how obligations of responsiveness, ancillary care, post-trial benefits and research capacity strengthening are upheld in low-and middle-income country settings. In this paper, the authors argue that research ethics guidelines need to be more informed by international research practice. Practical guidance on how to fulfil these obligations is needed if research groups and other actors are to successfully translate them into practice because doing so is often a complicated, context-specific process. Case study research methods offer one avenue for collecting data to develop this guidance. The authors describe how such methods have been used in relation to the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit's vivax malaria treatment (VHX) trial (NCT01074905). Relying on the VHX trial example, the paper shows how information can be gathered from not only international clinical researchers but also trial participants, community advisory board members and research funder representatives in order to: (1) measure evidence of responsiveness, provision of ancillary care, access to post-trial benefits and research capacity strengthening in international clinical research; and (2) identify the contextual factors and roles and responsibilities that were instrumental in the fulfilment of these ethical obligations. Such empirical work is necessary to inform the articulation of obligations of justice in international research and to develop guidance on how to fulfil them in order to facilitate better adherence to guidelines' requirements.

Until the recent development of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Cultural Competency Item Set (CAHPS-CC), no measures capturing patient-level experiences with culturally competent care have been suitable for broad-scale administration. Methods: We performed confirmatory factor analysis and internal consistency reliability analysis of CAHPS-CC among patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 600) receiving primary care in safety-net clinics. CAHPS-CC domains were also correlated with global physician ratings. Results: A 7-factor model demonstrated satisfactory fit (chi(2)(231) = 484.34, P < 0.0001) with significant factor loadings at P < 0.05. Three domains showed excellent reliability-Doctor Communication-Positive Behaviors (alpha = 0.82), Trust (alpha = 0.77), and Doctor Communication-Health Promotion (alpha = 0.72). Four domains showed inadequate reliability either among Spanish speakers or overall (overall reliabilities listed): Doctor Communication-Negative Behaviors (alpha = 0.54), Equitable Treatment (alpha = 0.69), Doctor Communication-Alternative Medicine (a = 0.52), and Shared Decision-Making (alpha = 0.51). CAHPS-CC domains were positively and significantly correlated with global physician rating. Conclusions: Select CAHPS-CC domains are suitable for broad-scale administration among safety-net patients. Those domains may be used to target quality-improvement efforts focused on providing culturally competent care in safety-net settings.

The Global Burden of Disease captures the impact of zoonoses on human health in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Based on this, we estimate that in low income countries, zoonoses and diseases which recently emerged from animals make up 26 % of the DALYs lost to infectious disease and 10 % of the total DALYs lost. In contrast, in high income countries, zoonoses and diseases recently which emerged from animals represent less than 1 % of DALYs lost to infectious disease and only 0.02 % of the total disease burden. We present a framework that captures the costs of zoonoses and emerging disease to human, animal and ecosystem health in terms of cost of treatment, cost of prevention, health burden and intangible and opportunity costs. We also discuss how ecohealth concepts of transdisciplinarity, participation and equity can help in assessing the importance of zoonoses in developing countries and illustrate these with an example of assessing milk-borne disease.

This study was conducted to investigate the association between factors related to socioeconomic status and HBV vaccination in the general population of women in Korea. Methods: Data from annual nationwide cross-sectional interview surveys conducted between 2005 and 2008 were reviewed. These surveys included representative samples of cancer-free people and 4350 women interviewed within the study period were included in the present report. Polychotomous logistic regression was used in the analysis. Results: The complete HBV coverage rate was 39.8%. Older age, lower household income and lower education level showed significant unfavorable influences on the completion of the HBV vaccine series (P-trend < 0.001 for all three variables). Lack of private insurance and having a routine and manual job were also associated with a lower complete vaccination rate (OR: 0.69, 95% Cl: 0.57-0.84; OR: 0.56, 95% Cl: 0.38-0.82, respectively), whereas living in an urban area was related to a higher rate (OR: 1.18, 95% Cl: 1.02-1.37). Older age, lower education level, and not having private insurance were associated with incomplete vaccination compared with unvaccination (P-trend 0.001, < 0.001, OR: 0.68,95% Cl: 0.53-0.78, respectively). Among women of reproductive age, similar results were seen for education level, household income, and occupation. Significant disparities in vaccination status according to socioeconomic status, as indicated by the combination of household income and education level, were seen (P-trend < 0.001). The most common reason for unvaccination was lack of knowledge about the necessity for HBV vaccination. Conclusion: Considering that vertical transmission is the most common source of HBV infection, vaccination of women is important to prevent HBV transmission to newborn infants. Therefore governmental strategies to reduce socioeconomic inequalities related to the completion of the HBV vaccine series among women should be implemented. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The main objective of this paper is to provide a meaningful sustainability assessment tool for make informed decisions, which is applied to higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach - The objective is achieved by developing a quantitative tool for sustainability assessment using a driving force-pressure-state-exposure-effect-action (DPSEEA) framework. The DPSEEA framework considers environmental, social, economic, and educational performance as main dimensions of sustainability. The proposed model is called DPSEEA-Sustainability index Model (D-SiM). The D-SiM is a causality-based model in which the sustainability index (SI) is an outcome of nonlinear effects of sustainability indicators in various stages of DPSEEA. To have an improved understanding of input factors (driving forces) and their impact on sustainability, a simplified empirical model is developed and applied to HEIs to determine the percent contribution of various driving forces on sustainability. Findings - The study reveals that economic development, social equity, and education in sustainability are the major drivers for achieving sustainability in HEI, while health and safety issues, energy requirements, institutional enhancement, and international research and development trends are the less significant driving forces. Originality/value - The indicators connected in DPSEEA framework through causal relationships lead to the quantitative assessment of sustainability, which provides a unique approach for informed decision making.

Ranging from sexual inequality and underdevelopment to homophobia impeding health care access for men who have sex with men, imbalanced resource allocations, and social biases have potentiated the spread of the epidemic. However, recognition of culturally specific aspects of each microepidemic has yielded development of community-based organizations, which have resulted in locally effective responses to AIDS. This effective approach to HIV prevention, care, and treatment is illustrated through examples of community-based responses in Haiti, the United States, Africa, and other impoverished settings.

Inequalities in outcomes of acute kidney injury in England	QJM-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							ACUTE-RENAL-FAILURE; MORTALITY; MANAGEMENT; RISK; CARE	Background: Renal replacement is managed by renal specialists and is well documented in national registries. In contrast, nation-wide data on acute kidney injury (AKI) are difficult to capture as it presents in many different ways to all acute hospitals. This paucity impacts on the coordination of appropriate services. Aims: We have set out to use all the information submitted by all hospitals in England to identify emergency patients in whom AKI was a major contributor to their hospital stay. We then examined workload in relation to specialist provision and outcomes of care. Design and Methods: All English hospitals submit a sequential list of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD 10) codes to describe the diagnosis of each admission. An algorithm was applied to all emergency admissions over a 2-year period to identify AKI. The level of renal specialist care available within each hospital trust was compared with patient outcomes, including 30-day mortality. Results: The incidence of AKI was 1.34% of all emergency admissions. The numbers and types of AKI cases were similar in all trusts, regardless of the service available. Thirty-day mortality was 30.0%. More than half the acute hospitals did not have on-site renal specialists and their AKI mortality rates were significantly higher (P < 0.001). These differences persisted despite adjusting for multiple variables. Conclusions: The country has created specialist renal units in 45% of hospital trusts, but AKI presents as emergencies to all hospitals and there is an increased risk of mortality in the 55% of trusts without renal specialists.

J	Kaur, J				Kaur, Jameen			The role of litigation in ensuring women's reproductive rights: an analysis of the Shanti Devi judgement in India	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						maternal mortality; law and policy; litigation; reproductive rights; human rights; India		The struggle for reproductive self-determination has specific significance for women and girls in India, where a maternal death occurs every five minutes. This paper analyses the role litigation played in seeking redress for violations of the reproductive rights of Shanti Devi, who died in childbirth in 2010 in Haryana state, and some of the socio-economic, cultural, political and legal factors involved. It provides a brief overview of India's national and international obligations with regard to maternal health, and through the lens of the litigation in Shanti Devi's case, it examines how the government failed to protect, respect and fulfill her right to life and health. Litigation can be used to ensure accountability in further cases by building on case law, informing communities about these decisions and their rights, and holding government accountable at local, state and central level. Litigation also has limits, most importantly due to people's lack of awareness of their rights and entitlements, the lack of government outreach programmes informing them of these, and the lack of accountability mechanisms within health programmes when they are not transparent or functioning effectively. Thus, although constitutional justice is an important tool for democratic progress and social change, social justice will only be achieved through broader social struggle.

J	Liljestrand, J; Sambath, MR				Liljestrand, Jerker; Sambath, Mean Reatanak			Socio-economic improvements and health system strengthening of maternity care are contributing to maternal mortality reduction in Cambodia	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						maternal mortality; maternity care; midwifery; human resources; health system strengthening; economic and social development; communications; Cambodia	DEVELOPMENT GOALS 4	Maternal mortality has been falling significantly in Cambodia since 2005 though it had been stagnant for at least 15 years before that. This paper analyzes the evolution of some major societal and health system factors based on recent national and international reports. The maternal mortality ratio fell from 472 per 100,000 live births in 2000-2005 to 206 in 2006-2010. Background factors have included peace and stability, economic growth and poverty reduction, improved primary education, especially for girls, improved roads, improved access to information on health and health services via TV, radio and cellphones, and increased ability to communicate with and within the health system. Specific health system improvements include a rapid increase in facility-based births and skilled birth attendance, notably investment in midwifery training and numbers of midwives providing antenatal care and deliveries within an expanding primary health care network, a monetary incentive for facility-based midwives for every live birth conducted, and an expanding system of health equity funds, making health care free of cost for poor people. Several major challenges remain, including post-partum care, family planning, prevention and treatment of breast and cervical cancer, and addressing sexual violence against women, which need the same priority attention as maternity care.

The surveillance covers 118 315 residents living in 19 847 households. Data on socio-demographic and health indicators including birth, death, migration, marriage, maternal health, education and employment are recorded through quarterly household visits. The primary objective of CHDSS is to monitor the changes in socio-demographic indicators, inequalities in health and impact of public health interventions. A demographic change was accompanied by a shift from traditional to modern society during the past decade, but inequality in health still persists. The findings from the surveillance are shared regularly among the local and global communities. Data are also available upon request to ICDDRB and INDEPTH for use by researchers and policy makers.

The goals of this research were: 1) to assess the gender gap in mobility difficulty in 70 countries; 2) to determine whether the gender gap is explained by sociodemographic and health factors; 3) to determine whether the gender gap differs across 6 regions of the world with different degrees of gender equality according to United Nations data. Methods: Population-based data were used from the World Health Survey (WHS) conducted in 70 countries throughout the world. 276,647 adults aged 18 years and over were recruited from 6 world regions. Mobility was measured by asking the level of difficulty people had moving around in the last 30 days and then creating a dichotomous measure (no difficulty, difficulty). The human development index and the gender-related development index for each country were obtained from the United Nations Development Program website. Poisson regression with Taylor series linearized variance estimation was used. Results: Women were more likely than men to report mobility difficulty (38% versus 27%, P < 0.0001). The age-adjusted prevalence rate ratio for female gender was 1.35 (95% CI 1.31-1.38). The addition of education, marital status, and urban versus rural setting reduced the prevalence rate ratio to 1.30 (95% CI 1.26-1.33). The addition of the presence of back pain, arthritis, angina, depressive symptoms, and cognitive difficulties further reduced the prevalence rate ratio to 1.12 (95% CI 1.09-1.15). There was statistical interaction on the multiplicative scale between female gender and region (P < 0.01). The Eastern Mediterranean region, which had the greatest loss of human development due to gender inequality, showed the largest gender gap in mobility difficulty, while the Western Pacific region, with the smallest loss of human development due to gender inequality, had the smallest gender gap in mobility difficulty. Conclusions: These are the first world-wide data to examine the gender gap in mobility. Differences in chronic diseases are the main reasons for this gender gap. The gender gap seems to be greater in regions with the largest loss of human development due to gender inequality.

We examine the effect of country of origin, length of time in the host country and citizenship on the health of adults, using data from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). As the logistic regressions reveal, some immigrant groups are more likely to perceive worse self-rated health and to suffer from depression than native-born groups, even when demographic and socio-economic variables are taken into account. In particular, people born in Eastern Europe living in Germany, France and Sweden have the highest odds ratio of poor health with respect to natives. Nativity status, duration and citizenship clearly contribute towards explaining health differences which are shown to vary significantly across countries. Furthermore, the perception of poor health rises as the length of stay increases, although a non-linear pattern was found. Results indicate that greater efforts by policy makers are needed in order to improve the health of specific middle-aged and older groups of immigrants in Europe.

Within the UK, these upheavals have coincided with a change in political administration and thus a new approach to managing the volatility of economy. This change has resulted in root and branch reform of service provision that is based around a model that incorporates a shrinking public sector coupled with an increase in civic participation (i.e. The Big Society espoused by the UK-governing coalition). It is also unlikely that healthcare provision on a global level will remain unchanged in such turbulent times. It would therefore seem a useful time to review how socio-economic forces are believed to affect the health and well-being of an individual. These forces include social inequality, the mechanisms of social inclusion and exclusion, social role and the erosion of resilience. This paper will then conclude by offering some potential avenues that nurses can explore to make these forces less damaging for their clients. These avenues include developing a clinical focus based around positive psychology, well-being and some novel ways that nurses can help overcome the maintenance cycles that perpetuate inequality and exclusion.

However, obesity has also been associated with poverty. These contrary findings highlight the need for an examination of the contribution of social and economic factors to the global distribution of obesity. Males and females may be differently exposed to social and economic inequality, however few studies have considered possible gender differences in the association between socio-economic indices and obesity prevalence. We analysed between-country associations between obesity prevalence and three social or economic indices: per capita gross domestic product (GDP), the Gini index of national wealth inequality, and the gender inequality index (GII). We considered the genders separately, the gender average, and also the gender difference (female excess) in obesity prevalence. Across 68 countries listing sample size, there were 3 obese women for every 2 obese men. Within populations, obesity prevalence in males and females was strongly correlated (r = 0.74), however, only 17% of the female excess prevalence was accounted for by the gender-average prevalence. In both genders, there was a positive association between obesity prevalence and GDP that attenuated at higher GDP levels, with this association weaker in females than males. Adjusting for GDP, both the Gini index and GII were associated with excess female obesity. These analyses highlight significant gender differences in the global distribution of obesity, and a gender difference in the association of obesity prevalence with socio-economic factors. The magnitude of female excess obesity is not constant across populations, and is greater in countries characterised by gender inequality and lower GDP. These findings indicate that improving women's status may be a key area for addressing the global obesity epidemic over the long term, with potential benefits for the women themselves and for their offspring.

Following the experience of teaching a short course in global health within the liberal arts, we reviewed global and public health offerings at 50 liberal arts colleges for the 2009-2010 academic year. Forty-two percent had a track, concentration, or program, and 30% had global or public health student organizations. All colleges listed at least one course in the fields, with the highest number in the social sciences. However, many colleges had not coordinated them into a theme. Values of a liberal arts education are found in the study of global and public health: social responsibility, critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and knowledge of the wider world. We propose identifying these programs within the undergraduate liberal arts as global public health. Capturing interest in global public health will enhance the curriculum and student experience. In this day and age, when the world is so fluid with regard to news and information, the knowledge that unnecessary deaths are occurring and that health care lags so far behind in some regions cannot be ignored. From the standpoint of basic human rights, suffering and inequity cannot be tolerated.

Area-level indicators of socio-economic variation are frequently included in models of individual health outcomes. Area disadvantage is linearly related to smoking prevalence, but its relation to cessation outcomes is less well understood. Aims. To explore the relationship between area-level disadvantage and prospective data on smoking cessation. Design and Methods. The Australian cohort of the International Tobacco Control Four-Country Survey (N = 3503) was used to prospectively examine the contribution of area-level socio-economic disadvantage to predicting three important smoking-cessation outcomes: making a quit attempt, achieving 1 month abstinence and achieving 6 month abstinence from smoking, while controlling for individual-level socio-economic indicators and other individual-level covariates related to smoking cessation. Results. Only two independent associations were observed between socio-economic disadvantage and cessation outcomes. Area-level disadvantage was related to 1 month abstinence in a non-linear fashion, and the individual experience of smoking-induced deprivation was associated with a lower likelihood of making quit attempts. Discussion. Despite the documented higher prevalence of smoking among the more disadvantaged and in more disadvantaged areas, socio-economic disadvantage was not consistently related to making quit attempts, nor to medium-term success. Nevertheless, indirect effects of disadvantage, like its impact on psychological distress, cannot be ruled out, and considering smokers' individual psychosocial circumstances is likely to aid cessation efforts. Conclusion. Socio-economic disadvantage, particularly at the area level, poses few direct barriers to smoking cessation.[Partos TR, Borland R, Siahpush M.

To capture policy changes over time and by service in health systems regulation of public and private insurance, we propose a database containing explicit, standardized indicators of policy instruments. Methods: The Health Insurance Access Database (HIAD) will collect policy information for ten OECD countries, over a range of eight health services, from 1990-2010. Policy indicators were selected through a comprehensive literature review which identified policy instruments most likely to constitute barriers to health insurance, thus potentially posing a threat to equity. As data collection is still underway, we present here the theoretical bases and methodology adopted, with a focus on the rationale underpinning the study instruments. Results: These harmonized data will allow the capture of policy changes in health systems regulation of public and private insurance over time and by service. The standardization process will permit international comparisons of systems' performance with regards to health insurance access and equity. Conclusion: This research will inform and feed the current debate on the future of health care in developed countries and on the role of the private sector in these changes.

How do the material inequities in the distributions of resources across the globe play out in the expressions of the experiences of health in the localized contexts of the global margins? In this synthesis essay, I draw upon three interconnected ethnographies conducted over several villages in West Bengal, India, over a decade-long period to explore the alternative rationalities of health that emerge at the margins. At the heart of these ethnographies is the commitment to culturally center narratives of health as hunger, foregrounding the everyday experiences of hunger and the expressions of agency at the margins in securing access to food resources. Based on the synthesis of the ethnographies, entry points are suggested for the praxis of social change communication that builds on the articulation of health as hunger and imagines localized strategies of collective resistance.

J	Zhang, YX; Wang, SR				Zhang, Ying-Xiu; Wang, Shu-Rong			Differences in development and the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents in different socioeconomic status districts in Shandong, China	ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Socioeconomic status; district difference; height; body weight; obesity; adolescent	SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; CHILDHOOD OBESITY; GROWTH; OVERWEIGHT; HEIGHT; WORLDWIDE; EPIDEMIC; SCHOOLCHILDREN; ENVIRONMENTS; POPULATION	Background: There are wide-ranging differences in human growth, not only between ethnic groups but also between regions. Shandong is one of the most populous provinces in China, with inequalities of regional economic status. However, no studies on the differences in development among children and adolescents in different districts have been reported. Aim: This study assessed the differences in height, weight and prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents of different socioeconomic status (SES) districts in Shandong, China. Subjects and methods: Data for this study were obtained from a large cross-sectional survey of schoolchildren. A total of 42 286 students (21 222 boys and 21 064 girls) aged 7-18 years from 16 districts participated in this study. Height and weight of all subjects were measured and BMI was calculated from their height and weight. Prevalence rates of obesity and overweight were determined by comparing calculated BMIs (kg/m(2)) to International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) cut-offs. Each of the 16 districts was assigned an SES ranking (low, moderate, high) based on per capita GDP and income in urban and rural areas. Comparisons of height, weight and the prevalence of overweight and obesity among different groups were made. Results: Significant differences between SES groups were observed for height, weight and the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Boys and girls from high SES group were taller, heavier and more likely to be obese than their peers from moderate and low SES groups. The prevalences of combined overweight and obesity in the three SES groups were 18.46%, 21.08% and 27.31% in boys and 10.43%, 12.42% and 15.18% in girls, respectively. Conclusion: There have been obvious regional variations in development and the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents in Shandong, China, These variations in development and prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents among different SES districts being related to the local SES, process of urbanization, living environments, nutritional status, dietary pattern, physical activity and public health.

J	Greer, S; Jarman, H				Greer, Scott; Jarman, Holly			Managing risks in EU health services policy: Spot markets, legal certainty and bureaucratic resistance	JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN SOCIAL POLICY			English	Article						healthcare; services; markets; European Union; professional mobility; patient mobility	EUROPEAN-UNION	European Union (EU) healthcare services policy has been largely driven by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) applying the law of the internal market to the previously separate area of healthcare systems. We argue that it opened up two major risks: that health service planning would be disrupted by cross-border flows of patients and professionals, including ostensibly interchangeable professionals or procedures that actually vary in quality; and that health systems would be disrupted by the application of liberalizing EU regulatory frameworks. The threats have largely been managed by four developments. Cross-border flows have largely appeared as spot markets rather than broad competition. States, meanwhile, have managed both regulatory and planning risks by debating and then legislating, which increases legal certainty, and the ECJ has taken the hint and become more cautious in its rulings. Meanwhile, states and health systems alike have implemented a strategy of 'bureaucratic resistance' upon discovering how easy it is to comply in only the narrowest ways, thereby limiting affects on systems and regulations alike. The experience testifies to the difficulty of creating and sustaining health markets, but also to the risks of international trade in health services and the amount of effort it takes to manage such risks.

Acute coronary syndromes: an old age problem	JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC CARDIOLOGY			English	Review						Acute coronary syndromes; Elderly patients; Inequalities of care; Evidenced-based treatments	ST-SEGMENT-ELEVATION; ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; HEART-ASSOCIATION COUNCIL; HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS; EVIDENCE-BASED THERAPIES; GLOBAL REGISTRY; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT; GERIATRIC-CARDIOLOGY; CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY	The increasing population in older age will lead to greater numbers of them presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). This has implications on global healthcare resources and necessitates better management and selection for evidenced-based therapies. The elderly are a high risk group with more significant treatment benefits than younger ACS. Nevertheless, age related inequalities in ACS care are recognised and persist. This discrepancy in care, to some extent, is explained by the higher frequency of atypical and delayed presentations in the elderly, and less diagnostic electrocardiograms at presentation, potentiating a delay in ACS diagnosis. Under estimation of mortality risk in the elderly due to limited consideration for physiological frailty, co-morbidity, cognitive/psychological impairment and physical disability, less input by cardiology specialists and lack of randomised, controlled trials data to guide management in the elderly may further confound the inequality of care. While these inequalities exist, there remains a substantial opportunity to improve age related ACS outcomes. The selection of elderly patients for specific therapies and medication regimens are unanswered. There is a growing need for randomised, controlled trial data to be more representative of the population and enroll those of advanced age with co-morbidity. A lack of reporting of adverse events, such as renal impairment post coronary angiography, in the elderly further limit risk benefit decisions. Substantial improvements in care of elderly ACS patients are required and should be advocated. Ultimately, these improvements are likely to lead to better outcomes post ACS. However, the improvement in outcome is not infinite and will be limited by non-modifiable factors of age-related risk.

Lancet Phys Activity Series Workin	The implications of megatrends in information and communication technology and transportation for changes in global physical activity	LANCET			English	Article							WEB-BASED INTERVENTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR; PROMOTE WALKING; INTERNET; TRANSIT; EQUITY; CAR; DETERMINANTS; PREVENTION	Physical inactivity accounts for more than 3 million deaths per year, most from non-communicable diseases in low-income and middle-income countries. We used reviews of physical activity interventions and a simulation model to examine how megatrends in information and communication technology and transportation directly and indirectly affect levels of physical activity across countries of low, middle, and high income. The model suggested that the direct and potentiating effects of information and communication technology, especially mobile phones, are nearly equal in magnitude to the mean effects of planned physical activity interventions. The greatest potential to increase population physical activity might thus be in creation of synergistic policies in sectors outside health including communication and transportation. However, there remains a glaring mismatch between where studies on physical activity interventions are undertaken and where the potential lies in low-income and middle-income countries for population-level effects that will truly affect global health.

J	Hounton, S; Newlands, D				Hounton, Sennen; Newlands, David			Applying the Net-Benefit Framework for Analyzing and Presenting Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Maternal and Newborn Health Intervention	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; EFFECTIVENESS ACCEPTABILITY CURVES; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; UNCERTAINTY; STRATEGIES; TRIAL; CARE	Background: Coverage of maternal and newborn health (MNH) interventions is often influenced by important determinants and decision makers are often concerned with equity issues. The net-benefit framework developed and applied alongside clinical trials and in pharmacoeconomics offers the potential for exploring how cost-effectiveness of MNH interventions varies at the margin by important covariates as well as for handling uncertainties around the ICER estimate. Aim: We applied the net-benefit framework to analyze cost-effectiveness of the Skilled Care Initiative and assessed relative advantages over a standard computation of incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Methods: Household and facility surveys were carried out from January to July 2006 in Ouargaye district (where the Skilled Care Initiative was implemented) and Diapaga (comparison site) district in Burkina Faso. Pregnancy-related and perinatal mortality were retrospectively assessed and data were collected on place of delivery, education, asset ownership, place, and distance to health facilities, costs borne by households for institutional delivery, and cost of standard provision of maternal care. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed. Results: There was a 30% increase in institutional births in the intervention district compared to 10% increase in comparison district, and a significant reduction of perinatal mortality rates (OR 0.75, CI 0.70-0.80) in intervention district. The incremental cost for achieving one additional institutional delivery in Ouargaye district compared to Diapaga district was estimated to be 170 international dollars and varied significantly by covariates. However, the joint probability distribution (net-benefit framework) of the effectiveness measure (institutional delivery), the cost data and covariates indicated distance to health facilities as the single most important determinant of the cost-effectiveness analysis with implications for policy making. Conclusion: The net-benefit framework, the application of which requires household-level effects and cost data, has proven more insightful (than traditional ICER) in presenting and interpreting cost-effectiveness results of the Skilled Care Initiative.

Illness-related behaviour and sociodemographic determinants of oral health care use in Dabou, Cote d'Ivoire	COMMUNITY DENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Accessibility; Cote d'Ivoire; oral care; sociodemographic determinants traditional healer	BURKINA-FASO; TRADITIONAL HEALERS; DENTAL SERVICES; POLICY	Objectives: The aims of this study were to describe adults' oral health behaviour and identify the sociodemographic determinants that influence people to seek oral care in Cote d'Ivoire, in a context of promoting a more accessible health care system. Methods: The design was a cross-sectional pilot survey undertaken in the department of Dabou, Cote d'Ivoire. A stratified sampling procedure with proportional allocation size was used, based on four different criteria: place of residence; type of dwelling; distance between the chosen locality and the dental clinic; and, the presence of a medical centre in the locality. The sample consisted of 927 people (18 years or older) who were interviewed by questionnaire Data were collected at face to face interviews, using the method of itineraries. Results: 34% of the population had not accessed a dental practitioner during the past 12 months. The reasons for not seeking care were: self-medication, lack of money and a perception of not needing care. A dentist or a traditional healer had been sought by 33%. The choice of therapy was influenced by educational level and having health insurance (p<0.05). The main reasons for attending a traditional healer were linked to educational level, the type of dwelling and the participants' place of residence (p<0.05). Choosing to see a dentist was associated with age, the type of dwelling and the distance between the chosen locality and the dental clinic (p<0.05 Conclusion: The socioeconomic situation of the participants was a determining factor for seeking care. Improving access to health care should be part of the global fight against poverty and the reduction of social inequalities.	[Sangare, A.

NICE's evaluations are attracting increasing debate about the tension between efficiency and equity. This article, using the case of renal cell cancer, argues that NICE is not only concerned with maximized aggregate welfare, but also with its social obligations to protect the less advantaged members of society. The English experience is likely to have international implications in terms of evaluating the benefits of new medical treatments.

This new demand for health care gives rise to the need to identify those factors which influence the user's decision to contact the health services and those which determine the quantity of services consumed. The aim of this study is to identify which variables affect these two stages of the use of such services in the Girona Health Region (RSG), where immigrant population represents 21.96% of the total population. Specification of a Hurdle model with a count response variable related to primary health care service visits in the RSG for 2006. The study data is based on a sample of users (immigrants and natives) taken from the population assigned to primary health care services in eight Basic Health Areas (ABS) of the RSG. Contacting primary health care services is associated with variables that ought to affect use of health care such as chronic illness and taking prescribed medication as well as being aged between 46 and 55. Using primary health care services once makes users more likely to make further visits. The number of visits is related not only with variables that ought affect use of health care but also with variables that ought not to affect use of health care such as working without a contract, living in rented accommodation, or being unemployed. Additionally, if we consider the birthplace of the user, we observe the same pattern, with different directions and intensities, depending on the origin of the patient. For example, a higher likelihood of first contact is shown in Eastern Europeans, South Americans, and North Africans that suffer from cholesterol. A higher attendance is observed in natives and Eastern Europeans that take prescribed medication as well as natives, Eastern Europeans, and North Africans living in rented accommodation. On the other hand, working without a contract supposes a higher attendance in natives but a lower attendance in Eastern Europeans and sub-Saharan Africans. We do not detect any socioeconomic barriers associated with making a first contact with primary health services for the users analyzed. However, we do note evidence of horizontal inequity in terms of attending health services, related to variables that ought to affect use of health care as well as socioeconomic factors (variables that ought not to affect use of health care). The user's origin is an important key in detecting different intensities of access and regular visits to primary health care services.

The media attention and economic resources diverted to the threats posed by H1N1 were significant inequalities themselves when contrasted with weaker responses to more lethal threats posed by other diseases associated with global inequality. However, the multiple inequalities revealed by H1N1 itself in 2009 still provide important insights into the future of global health in the context of market-led globalization. These lessons relate to at least four main forms of inequality: (1) inequalities in blame for the outbreak in the media; (2) inequalities in risk management; (3) inequalities in access to medicines; and (4) inequalities encoded in the actual emergence of new flu viruses.

However, since neonatal deaths make up 57% of under-five mortality in the country, increased scale up and equity in programmes for neonatal survival are critical to sustain progress. We examined change for newborn survival from 2000 to 2010 considering mortality, coverage and funding indicators, as well as contextual factors. The national neonatal mortality rate has undergone an annual decline of 4.0% since 2000, reflecting greater progress than both the regional and global averages, but the mortality reduction for children 1-59 months was double this rate, at 8.6%. Examining policy and programme change, and national and donor funding for health, we identified various factors which contributed to an environment favourable to newborn survival. Locally-generated evidence combined with re-packaged global evidence, notably The Lancet Neonatal Series, has played a role, although pathways between research and policies and programme change are often complex. Several high-profile champions have had major influence. Attention for community initiatives and considerable donor funding also appear to have contributed. There have been some increases in coverage of key interventions, such as skilled attendance at birth and postnatal care, however these are low and reach less than one-third of families. Major reductions in total fertility, some change in gross national income and other contextual factors are likely to also have had an influence in mortality reduction. However, other factors such as socio-economic and geographic inequalities, frequent changes in government and pluralistic implementation structures have provided challenges. As coverage of health services increases, a notable gap remains in quality of facility-based care. Future gains for newborn survival in Bangladesh rest upon increased implementation at scale and greater consistency in content and quality of programmes and services.

The prevalence is expected to increase due to demographic change and the growing importance of non-communicable disease and injury. To date, many epidemiological studies have used simple dichotomous measures of disability, even though the WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) provides a multi-dimensional framework of functioning. We aimed to examine associations of socio-economic status (SES) and social integration in 3 core domains of functioning (impairment, pain, limitations in activity and participation) and perceived health. We conducted a secondary analysis of representative cross-sectional data of the Swiss Health Survey 2007 including 10,336 female and 8,424 male Swiss residents aged 15 or more. Guided by a theoretical ICF-based model, 4 mixed effects Poisson regressions were fitted in order to explain functioning and perceived health by indicators of SES and social integration. Analyses were stratified by age groups (15-30, 31-54, >= 55 years). In all age groups, SES and social integration were significantly associated with functional and perceived health. Among the functional domains, impairment and pain were closely related, and both were associated with limitations in activity and participation. SES, social integration and functioning were related to perceived health. We found pronounced social inequalities in functioning and perceived health, supporting our theoretical model. Social factors play a significant role in the experience of health, even in a wealthy country such as Switzerland. These findings await confirmation in other, particularly lower resourced settings.

However, inequalities were found in food consumption between socioeconomic groups. As no national data exist on the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, a survey was conducted in 2010 to assess the micronutrient status of randomly selected 1526 women of reproductive age and 586 children aged 6-75 mo. Principal Findings: In women, according to international thresholds, prevalence of zinc deficiency (ZnD, 67.2 +/- 2.6%) and vitamin B12 deficiency (11.7 +/- 1.7%) represented public health problems, whereas prevalence of anemia (11.6 +/- 1.0%) and iron deficiency (ID, 13.7 +/- 1.1%) were considered low, and folate (<3%) and vitamin A (VAD, <2%) deficiencies were considered negligible. However, many women had marginal folate (25.1%) and vitamin A status (13.6%). Moreover, overweight (BMI >= 23 kg/m(2) for Asian population) or underweight occurred in 20% of women respectively highlighting the double burden of malnutrition. In children, a similar pattern was observed for ZnD (51.9 +/- 3.5%), anemia (9.1 +/- 1.4%) and ID (12.9 +/- 1.5%) whereas prevalence of marginal vitamin A status was also high (47.3 +/- 2.2%). There was a significant effect of age on anemia and ID prevalence, with the youngest age group (6-17 mo) having the highest risk for anemia, ID, ZnD and marginal vitamin A status as compared to other groups. Moreover, the poorest groups of population had a higher risk for zinc, anemia and ID. Conclusion: The prevalence of anemia and ID in Vietnam has been markedly reduced over the last decade, but a large part of the population is still at risk for other deficiencies such as zinc, vitamin A, folate and vitamin B12 especially the youngest children aged 6-17 mo. Consequently specific interventions to improve food diversity and quality should be implemented, among them food fortification of staple foods and condiments and improvement of complementary feeding.

J	Johnston, R; Crooks, VA; Snyder, J				Johnston, Rory; Crooks, Valorie A.; Snyder, Jeremy			"I didn't even know what I was looking for": A qualitative study of the decision-making processes of Canadian medical tourists	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Medical tourism; Decision-making; Qualitative; Surgery; Canada	HEALTH-SERVICES; INFORMED-CONSENT; CARE; SURGERY; HIP; ARTHROPLASTY; COUNTRIES; VIEWS; US	Background: Medical tourism describes the private purchase and arrangement of medical care by patients across international borders. Increasing numbers of medical facilities in countries around the world are marketing their services to a receptive audience of international patients, a phenomenon that has largely been made possible by the growth of the Internet. The growth of the medical tourism industry has raised numerous concerns around patient safety and global health equity. In spite of these concerns, there is a lack of empirical research amongst medical tourism stakeholders. One such gap is a lack of engagement with medical tourists themselves, where there is currently little known about how medical tourists decide to access care abroad. We address this gap through examining aspects of Canadian medical tourists' decision-making processes. Methods: Semi-structured phone interviews were administered to 32 Canadians who had gone abroad as medical tourists. Interviews touched on motivations, assessment of risks, information seeking processes, and experiences at home and abroad. A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts followed. Results: Three overarching themes emerged from the interviews: (1) information sources consulted; (2) motivations, considerations, and timing; and (3) personal and professional supports drawn upon. Patient testimonials and word of mouth connections amongst former medical tourists were accessed and relied upon more readily than the advice of family physicians. Neutral, third-party information sources were limited, which resulted in participants also relying on medical tourism facilitators and industry websites. Conclusions: While Canadian medical tourists are often thought to be motivated by wait times for surgery, cost and availability of procedures were common primary and secondary motivations for participants, demonstrating that motivations are layered and dynamic. The findings of this analysis offer a number of important factors that should be considered in the development of informational interventions targeting medical tourists. It is likely that trends observed amongst Canadian medical tourists apply to those from other nations due to the key role the transnational medium of the Internet plays in facilitating patients' private international medical travel.

J	Schroeder, D; Gefenas, E				Schroeder, Doris; Gefenas, Eugenijus			REALIZING BENEFIT SHARING - THE CASE OF POST-STUDY OBLIGATIONS	BIOETHICS			English	Article						benefit sharing; post-study obligations; international justice; international research ethics; human genetics	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ETHICS; TRIALS; STANDARDS; CARE	In 2006, the Indonesian government decided to withhold avian flu samples from the World Health Organization. They argued that even though Indonesian samples were crucial to the development of vaccines, the results of vaccine research would be unaffordable for its citizens. Commentaries on the case varied from alleging blackmail to welcoming this strong stance against alleged exploitation. What is clear is that the concern expressed is related to benefit sharing. Benefit sharing requires resource users to return benefits to resource providers in order to achieve justice. One benefit sharing tool within health research is the duty to provide a health care intervention which has been proven to be beneficial (or alternative benefits) to research participants after a study has been concluded. This duty is generally known as a post-study obligation. It was enshrined in the Declaration of Helsinki in 2000 and re-emphasized in 2008. Yet, there are few, if any, examples of good practice. In this article, we analyse the obstacles to giving more bite to benefit sharing provisions in health research through ethical review. We conclude that the provision of post-study access to healthcare interventions is not a promising mechanism when monitored through research ethics committees. Alternative benefit provision is preferable if one focuses on achieving compliance. However, even the latter faces challenges, which we address in specific recommendations.

Resilience to obesity among socioeconomically disadvantaged women: the READI study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						obesity risk factors; socioeconomic disadvantage; structural equation models	BODY-MASS INDEX; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; WEIGHT STATUS; ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS; COGNITIVE DETERMINANTS; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; HEALTH; YOUNG; GAIN; QUESTIONNAIRE	Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to identify sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics of 'overweight-resilient' women, that is, women who were in a healthy body weight range, despite living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods that place them at increased risk of obesity. The study also aimed to test a comprehensive theoretically derived model of the associations between intrapersonal, social and environmental factors and obesity among this target group. Participants: A total of 3235 women aged 18-45 years from 80 urban and rural neighbourhoods throughout Victoria, Australia, participated in the Resilience for Eating and Activity Despite Inequality study. Measurements: Women reported height, weight, sociodemographic characteristics, leisure-time physical activity, dietary behaviours and a range of theoretically derived cognitive, social and neighbourhood environmental characteristics hypothesized to influence obesity risk. A theoretical model predicting body mass index (BMI) was tested using structural equation models. Results: Women classified as 'resilient' to obesity tended to be younger, born overseas, more highly educated, unmarried and to have higher or undisclosed household incomes. They engaged in more leisure-time physical activity and consumed less fast foods and soft drinks than overweight/obese women. Neighbourhood characteristics, social characteristics and cognitive characteristics all contributed to explaining variation in BMI in the hypothesized directions. Conclusions: These results demonstrate several characteristics of women appearing 'resilient' to obesity, despite their increased risk conferred by residing in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Acknowledging the cross-sectional study design, the results advance theoretical frameworks aimed at investigating obesity risk by providing evidence in support of a comprehensive model of direct and indirect effects on obesity of neighbourhood, as well as social, cognitive and behavioural characteristics.

J	Sullivan, N				Sullivan, Noelle			Enacting Spaces of Inequality: Placing Global/State Governance Within a Tanzanian Hospital	SPACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						hospital ethnography; governance; space; biomedicine; global assemblages	CARE	Based on ethnographic research conducted in a government hospital in Tanzania, this article explores how global and state governance molds hospital spaces. While some spaces in the hospital are made global through regimes of governance, others-by virtue of being beyond state/donor interest-remain decidedly local. The unequal material configurations characteristic of layered hospital spaces mean that some actors can realize meaningful identities as patients and health professionals, whereas others cannot. Drawing on a case study of one patient's movement from an inpatient ward to an HIV/AIDS clinic within a government-operated hospital, this article reveals the ways that forms of state/donor governance can create multiple spaces, places, and persons within the same institution.

Methods: The paper uses the data from the INDEPTH/WHO Study on global aging and adult health (SAGE). The study was carried out in the FilaBavi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) site in Vietnam and in Purworejo HDSS in Indonesia. All people aged 50 years and over who lived in these two HDSS areas were surveyed. Face-to-face household interviews were carried out by trained surveyors using the standardized summary version of the INDEPTH/WHO SAGE questionnaire. The SQOL was assessed by asking the respondents How would you rate your overall quality of life? The response set was a five-point scale where 1 = Very good, 2 = Good, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Bad, 5 = Very bad. Results: In both countries, the SQOL was reported to be higher among (i) men; (ii) people with higher education; (iii) people who were in a marital partnership; (iv) people who lived with other family members; and (v) those with higher economic status, compared with that in those of other category(ies) of the same characteristic. In Vietnam, people who belonged to the second to fifth economic quintiles and had more than 6 years of education were sevenfold more likely to report very good/good quality of life compared with those who belonged to the first economic quintile (poorest) and had no formal education. The corresponding figure was 2.7 for Indonesia. Conclusions: The patterns of sociodemographic determinants of SQOL show that inequality in quality of life exists among older adults in the two study settings. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2012; 12: 397404.

In the past 3 decades, large-scale studies in the West have accumulated a range of measures and methodologies to pursue this goal. We would like to suggest that there may be conceptual gaps in the science if Western research models are applied uncritically in East Asian studies of socioeconomic, gender, and ethnic inequalities in health. On one hand, there are common concerns, including population aging and gendered labor market participation. Further, international comparison must be built on shared concepts such as socioeconomic stratification in market economies. On the other hand, some aspects of health, such as common mental disorders, may have culturally specific manifestations that require development of perspectives (and perhaps novel measures) in order to reveal Eastern specifics. Exploring and debating commonalities and differences in the determinants of health in Oriental and Occidental cultures could offer fresh inspiration and insight for the next phase of social epidemiology in both regions.

As PMTCT policymakers and implementers work toward these new goals, increased attention must be paid to the role that gender inequality plays in limiting PMTCT programmatic progress. Description: A growing body of evidence suggests that gender inequality, including gender-based violence, is a key obstacle to better outcomes related to all four components of a comprehensive PMTCT programme. Gender inequality affects the ability of women and girls to protect themselves from HIV, prevent unintended pregnancies and access and continue to use HIV prevention, care and treatment services. Lessons Learned: In light of this evidence, global health donors and international bodies increasingly recognize that it is critical to address the gender disparities that put women and children at increased risk of HIV and impede their access to care. The current policy environment provides unprecedented opportunities for PMTCT implementers to integrate efforts to address gender inequality with efforts to expand access to clinical interventions for preventing vertical HIV transmission. Effective community- and facility-based strategies to transform harmful gender norms and mitigate the impacts of gender inequality on HIV-related outcomes are emerging. PMTCT programmes must embrace these strategies and expand beyond the traditional focus of delivering ARV prophylaxis to pregnant women living with HIV. Without greater implementation of comprehensive, gender transformative PMTCT programmes, elimination of vertical transmission of HIV will remain elusive.

Aim: To investigate the impact of socioeconomic and lifestyle factors on the risk of MetS and the underlying contributing factors in the Polish population aged 20-74 years. Methods: Between 2003 and 2005, as part of the National Multicentre Health Survey (WOBASZ, Wieloosrodkowe Badanie Stanu Zdrowia Ludnosci), a random sample of Polish residents aged 20 to 74 years was investigated. Data on sociodemographic and anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, lipid and glucose levels and medical history were collected. MetS was defined according to the criteria proposed by the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA/NHLBI) and by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2005. Data necessary to evaluate MetS and the socioeconomic characteristics were obtained for 5940 men and 6627 women. Results: MetS was identified in 26.0% of men and 23.9% of women according to the AHA/NHLBI definition, and in 30.7% of men and 26.8% of women according to the IDF definition. In both genders older age, higher body mass index and current smoking increased the risk of developing MetS, whereas higher physical activity and good self-rated health decreased the risk. Moreover, women with higher education and in the higher quartile of alcohol intake were associated with a lower risk of having MetS. Household per-capita income did not affect the risk of having MetS in either gender. Conclusions: A relatively high percentage of individuals with MetS was observed in the Polish population aged 20 to 74 years. In both sexes, the risk of MetS and its contributing factors was significantly associated with age and the following lifestyle factors: body mass index, smoking, self-rated health and, additionally for women, higher education and alcohol intake.

Economic growth and decline in mortality in developing countries: An analysis of the World Bank development datasets	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Economic growth; International health problems; Mortality; Infant mortality		Objectives: The 1999 World Bank Report claimed that growth in gross domestic product (GDP) between 1960 and 1990 only accounted for 15% of concomitant growth in life expectancy in developing countries. These findings were used repeatedly by the World Health Organization (WHO) to support a policy shift away from promoting social and economic development, towards vertical technology-driven programmes. This paper updates the 1999 World Bank Report using the World Bank's 2005 dataset, providing a new assessment of the relative contribution of economic growth. Study design: Time-series analysis. Methods: Cross-sectional time-series regression analysis using a random effect model of associations between GDP, education and technical progress and improved health outcomes. The proportion of improvement in health indicators between 1970 and 2000 associated with changes in GDP, education and technical progress was estimated. Results: In 1970, a 1% difference in GDP between countries was associated with 6% difference in female (LEBF) and 5% male (LEBM) life expectancy at birth. By 2000, these values had increased to 14% and 12%, explaining most of the observed health gain. Excluding Europe and Central Asia, the proportion of the increase in LEBF and LEBM attributable to increased GDP was 31% and 33% in the present analysis, vs 17% and 14%, respectively, estimated by the World Bank. In the poorest countries, higher GDPs were required in 2000 than in 1970 to achieve the same health outcomes. Conclusions: In the poorest countries, socio-economic change is likely to be a more important source of health improvement than technical progress. Technical progress, operating by increasing the size of the effect of a unit of GDP on health, is likely to benefit richer countries more than poorer countries, thereby increasing global health inequalities.

Study): study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial	TRIALS			English	Article						Violence against women; Intimate partner violence; Domestic violence; HIV/AIDS; SASA; Community mobilisation; Behaviour change; Gender; Community randomised trial; Uganda	INTIMATE-PARTNER VIOLENCE; RURAL SOUTH-AFRICA; SEXUAL RISK; BEHAVIOR-CHANGE; HIV-INFECTION; GENDER; IMPACT; PERPETRATION; PREVALENCE; AIDS	Background: Gender based violence, including violence by an intimate partner, is a major global human rights and public health problem, with important connections with HIV risk. Indeed, the elimination of sexual and gender based violence is a core pillar of HIV prevention for UNAIDS. Integrated strategies to address the gender norms, relations and inequities that underlie both violence against women and HIV/AIDS are needed. However there is limited evidence about the potential impact of different intervention models. This protocol describes the SASA! Study: an evaluation of a community mobilisation intervention to prevent violence against women and reduce HIV/AIDS risk in Kampala, Uganda. Methods/Design: The SASA! Study is a pair-matched cluster randomised controlled trial being conducted in eight communities in Kampala. It is designed to assess the community-level impact of the SASA! intervention on the following six primary outcomes: attitudes towards the acceptability of violence against women and the acceptability of a woman refusing sex (among male and female community members); past year experience of physical intimate partner violence and sexual intimate partner violence (among females); community responses to women experiencing violence (among women reporting past year physical/sexual partner violence); and past year concurrency of sexual partners (among males). 1583 women and men (aged 18-49 years) were surveyed in intervention and control communities prior to intervention implementation in 2007/8. A follow-up cross-sectional survey of community members will take place in 2012. The primary analysis will be an adjusted cluster-level intention to treat analysis, comparing outcomes in intervention and control communities at follow-up. Complementary monitoring and evaluation and qualitative research will be used to explore and describe the process of intervention implementation and the pathways through which change is achieved. Discussion: This is one of few cluster randomised trials globally to assess the impact of a gender-focused community mobilisation intervention. The multi-disciplinary research approach will enable us to address questions of intervention impact and mechanisms of action, as well as its feasibility, acceptability and transferability to other contexts. The results will be of importance to researchers, policy makers and those working on the front line to prevent violence against women and HIV.

J	Ruger, JP				Ruger, Jennifer Prah			Global health governance as shared health governance	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							PUBLIC-GOODS; COMMUNITIES; STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK; PROGRAMS; BEHAVIOR; ACCESS; POLICY	Background With the exception of key 'proven successes' in global health, the current regime of global health governance can be understood as transnational and national actors pursuing their own interests under a rational actor model of international cooperation, which fails to provide sufficient justification for an obligation to assist in meeting the health needs of others. An ethical commitment to providing all with the ability to be healthy is required. Methods This article develops select components of an alternative model of shared health governance (SHG), which aims to provide a 'road map,' 'focal points' and 'the glue' among various global health actors to better effectuate cooperation on universal ethical principles for an alternative global health equilibrium. Key features of SHG include public moral norms as shared authoritative standards; ethical commitments, shared goals and role allocation; shared sovereignty and constitutional commitments; legitimacy and accountability; country-level attention to international health relations. Results A framework of social agreement based on 'overlapping consensus' is contrasted against one based on self-interested political bargaining. A global health constitution delineating duties and obligations of global health actors and a global institute of health and medicine for holding actors responsible are proposed. Indicators for empirical assessment of select SHG principles are described. Conclusion Global health actors, including states, must work together to correct and avert global health injustices through a framework of SHG based on shared ethical commitments.

Prevalence and predictors of health care use in patients with early hip or knee osteoarthritis: two-year follow-up data from the CHECK cohort	OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE			English	Article						Osteoarthritis; Health services; Analgesics; Therapy; Cohort studies	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SERVICE UTILIZATION; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; MEDICAL-CARE; OLDER-ADULTS; PAIN; CLASSIFICATION; DETERMINANTS; MANAGEMENT	Objective: To describe health care utilization (HCU) and predict analgesic use and health professional (HP) contact at baseline and 2 years in individuals with early symptomatic hip and/or knee osteoarthritis (OA). Design: Baseline and two-year data on HCU of the 1002 participants from the multi-centre Cohort Hip & Cohort Knee study were used. Six forms of health care services were described: analgesic use, supplement use, contact with a General Practitioner (GP), contact with a HP, contact in secondary care, and alternative medicine use. Multivariable logistic regression was performed in order to identify predisposing, enabling and disease-related variables that predict analgesic use and HP contact at 2 years; treatment modalities of first choice in early OA. Results: For the hip (n = 170), the knee (n = 414) and the hip and knee (n = 418) group analgesic use (38%, 29% and 47%, respectively), contact with a GP (32%, 38% and 36%, respectively) and contact with a HP (26%, 18% and 20%, respectively), were reported most often at baseline. Contact with a GP significantly decreased, supplement use increased (to about one third), and other treatment modalities remained stable at 2 years. In all three groups, analgesic use at baseline was the strongest predictor for analgesic use at 2 years, whereas contact with a HP at baseline was the strongest predictor of contact with a HP after 2 years. Belonging to a first generation minority was a predisposing risk factor [Odds Ratio (95%-CI), 8.72 (1.55-48.97)] for analgesic use in the hip and knee group. Conclusions: In early OA, familiarity with HCU and other predisposing factors are, apart from disease-related factors strongly associated with HCU at 2 years. Further research is necessary to examine whether our findings reflect sub-optimal management of early OA in terms of efficacy and equity. (C) 2012 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

This article assesses the implications for global public health, describes the contours of post-2007 crises in food security and finance, and then briefly indicates the probable health impacts. There follows a discussion of the crisis of climate change, one that will unfold over a longer time frame but with manifestations that may already be upon us. The article then discusses the political economy of responses to these crises, noting the formidable obstacles that exist to equitable resolution. The article concludes by noting the threat that such crises present to recent progress in global health, arguing that global health researchers and practitioners must become more familiar with the relevant social processes, and that proposed solutions that neglect the continuing importance of the nation-state are misdirected.

Yet there are indications that they could be particularly vulnerable and confronted to health inequalities. This review of Canadian and international literature highlights that MPS, like other migrants, are confronted with deleterious living conditions and multiple obstacles to access healthcare. However, their status brings additional challenges and harmful health determinants. The situation of MPS may well be similar in Canada, where they could be numerous. Therefore it is crucial to better document this issue within the Canadian context. Part B of this article, reported elsewhere, further explores this topic.

INCOME INEQUALITY AND OBESITY PREVALENCE AMONG OECD COUNTRIES	JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; HEALTH; MORTALITY; ENVIRONMENT; OVERWEIGHT; AGE	Using recent pooled data from the World Health Organization Global Infobase and the World Factbook compiled by the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States, this study assesses the relation between income inequality and obesity prevalence among 31 OECD countries through a series of bivariate and multivariate linear regressions. The United States and Mexico well lead OECD countries in both obesity prevalence and income inequality. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the inclusion or exclusion of these two extreme cases can fundamentally change the findings. When the two countries are included, the results reveal a positive correlation between income inequality and obesity prevalence. This correlation is more salient among females than among males. Income inequality alone is associated with 16% and 35% of the variations in male and female obesity rates, respectively, across OECD countries in 2010. Higher levels of income inequality in the 2005-2010 period were associated with a more rapid increase in obesity prevalence from 2002 to 2010. These associations, however, virtually disappear when the US and Mexico have been excluded from the analysis. Findings from this study underscore the importance of assessing the impact of extreme cases on the relation between income inequality and health outcomes. The potential pathways from income inequality to the alarmingly high rates of obesity in the cases of the US and Mexico warrant further research.

A Case Study of Education and Health Services in Yantian Village of Guangdong Province	CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY			English	Article						China; social citizenship; social policy; welfare provision; I18; I28; O17; P26		Social policy is an indispensable element of rule and China's current leadership has moved policy to a more inclusive system based on a notion of citizenship. The extension of social welfare provision is examined through a case study of education and health care in the South China village of Yantian. Yantian lies at the core of the Pearl River Delta, which has become a key link in the global reorganization of manufacturing and production. Consequently the village is home to some 80 000 migrant workers who complement the 3000 registered inhabitants. A study of education and health-care provision reveals that in terms of equity, registered villagers enjoy significant advantages in seeking welfare resources. Although living in the same village, the two groups inhabit different worlds. However, provision, while selective, has become more inclusive. The present research suggests that social citizenship will precede political citizenship.

J	Fox, S; Hoelscher, K				Fox, Sean; Hoelscher, Kristian			Political order, development and social violence	JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH			English	Article						economic development; homicide; inequality; political institutions; poverty; social violence	HOMICIDE RATES; CIVIL-WAR; ECONOMIC-INEQUALITY; CRIME; DEMOCRACY; INSTABILITY; COUNTRIES; AFRICA	Why are some countries more prone to social violence than others? Despite the fact that annual deaths due to homicides worldwide outnumber those due to organized armed conflict by a factor of roughly 3 to 1, this question has received very little attention from conflict and development specialists in recent years. As a modest first step in addressing this gap in the literature we draw together insights from the conflict and criminology literatures to develop a model of social violence that accounts for both political-institutional and socio-economic factors. While there is an extensive literature on the socio-economic determinants of social violence, there are only a handful of studies that consider the significance of political-institutional arrangements. Using cross-country estimates of homicides produced by the World Health Organization as an indicator of social violence, we test our model using OLS regression analysis for a sample of more than 120 countries. We find that countries with 'hybrid' political orders experience higher rates of social violence than those with strong autocratic or strong democratic regimes, and that weakly institutionalized democracies are particularly violent. We also find robust associations between indicators of poverty, inequality and ethnic diversity and social violence. These results indicate that social and political violence share some common underlying causes. We conclude by suggesting that the apparent global decline in organized armed conflict and the concomitant rise in social violence in recent decades may be linked to world urbanization and the 'third wave' of democratization in the global South, although further research is required to confirm this hypothesis.

J	Schimmel, N				Schimmel, Noam			The Moral Case for Restorative Justice as a Corollary of the Responsibility to Protect: A Rwandan Case Study of the Insufficiency of Impact of Retributive Justice on the Rights and Well-Being of Genocide Survivors	JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							TRAUMA; WOMEN	This article analyzes how the current framework of retributive justice pursued by the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda fails to respect the human rights and to enable the well-being of Rwandan genocide survivors. Rwandan genocide survivors currently suffer from widespread poverty, lack of access to health care and housing, inadequate educational opportunity, and food insecurity and malnutrition. It calls for the application of restorative justice as an extension of the principle of the Responsibility to Protect for genocide survivors to be included in the remit of the Tribunal and UN humanitarian and development programs in Rwanda. It examines current and past restorative justice programs in various countries around the world to provide tangible examples of ways in which restorative justice can be implemented. It critically questions the moral logic of exclusive reliance on retributive justice that ignores the consequences of genocide by punishing the guilty without simultaneously assisting the victims. Finally, it urges that the Declaration of Basic Principles on Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Human Rights Violations and Article 75 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court be applied to the work of the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

J	Roberts, K				Roberts, Ken			The end of the long baby-boomer generation	JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES			English	Article						baby boomers; birth cohorts; generations; standards of living; students; (sic)1000 generation; youth cultures	GLOBAL GENERATIONS; MOBILITY; BRITAIN; YOUTH	This article argues that the post-war baby boomers led a long generation in which successive cohorts achieved, and came to expect, continuous improvement in living standards. The article proceeds to argue that current cohorts of young people in all Western countries will become the vanguard of a successor generation, distinguished by a different youth life stage and also by different characteristic experience of adulthood and, eventually, a different politics than the generation's predecessor. It is argued that the new generation's situation arose initially within the working classes and has now spread upwards. The article suggests that this new trend is unlikely to be reversed on account of (1) economic growth rates in Western countries slowing since the three decades that immediately followed the Second World War; (2) labour's declining share of gross domestic product and wider income inequalities within countries; (3) costs of imported commodities will most likely continue to rise; (4) new cohorts of workers will have to bear some of the costs of supporting swollen cohorts of retired citizens, tackling pollution and alleviating climate change; (5) the costs of raising children are likely to continue to rise and new cohorts of workers will most likely need to make some private provisions for their own health care and retirement incomes; (6) there are now excessive numbers of higher education graduates in all world regions relative to the number of graduate jobs; and (7) the changing class demography in West Europe and North America. The article concludes by considering possible outcomes which include intensified inter-and intra-generational conflict.

We examine how the term 'Third World' is deployed in media discourses in economic, social and environmental contexts and how this deployment results in a 'discursive distancing' from anything associated with the 'Third World'. Such distancing demonstrates a fragile national identity that struggles with the contradictions between the nation's desire to be part of the 'First World' of global capitalism and the growing disparities in health and wealth within it. The shadow of the 'Third World' prevents New Zealand from confronting the realities of its own inequities, which in turn comes in the way of a sound development agenda.

A systematic review of prevention and intervention strategies for populations at high risk of engaging in violent behaviour: update 2002-8	HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT			English	Review							BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; AGGRESSION CONTROL THERAPY; BATTERER TREATMENT PROGRAM; ANGER MANAGEMENT GROUP; DOUBLE-BLIND; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; RAPID TRANQUILIZATION	Background: It has been estimated that violence accounts for more than 1.6 million deaths worldwide each year and these fatal assaults represent only a fraction of all assaults that actually occur. The problem has widespread consequences for the individual and for the wider society in physical, psychological, social and economic terms. A wide range of pharmacological, psychosocial and organisational interventions have been developed with the aim of addressing the problem. This review was designed to examine the effectiveness of these interventions when they are developed in mental health and criminal justice populations. Objective: To update a previous review that examined the evidence base up to 2002 for a wide range of pharmacological, psychosocial and organisational interventions aimed at reducing violence, and to identify the key variables associated with a significant reduction in violence. Data sources: Nineteen bibliographic databases were searched from January 2002 to April 2008, including PsycINFO (CSA) MEDLINE (Ovid), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), British Nursing Index/Royal College of Nursing, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), Education Resources Information Center (ERIC)/International ERIC, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane reviews, other reviews, clinical trials, methods studies, technology assessments, economic evaluations), Web of Science [Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI)]. Review methods: The assessment was carried out according to accepted procedures for conducting and reporting systematic reviews, including identification of studies, application of inclusion criteria, data extraction and appropriate analysis. Studies were included in meta-analyses (MAs) if they followed a randomised control trial (RCT) design and reported data that could be converted into odds ratios (ORs). For each MA, both a fixed-effects model and a random-effects model were fitted, and both Q statistic and /(2) estimates of heterogeneity were performed. Results: A total of 198 studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria; of these, 51 (26%) were RCTs. Bivariate analyses exploring possible sources of variance in whether a study reported a statistically significant result or not, identified six variables with a significant association. An outcome was less likely to be positive if the primary intervention was something other than a psychological or pharmacological intervention, the study was conducted in an penal institution, the comparator was another active treatment or treatment as usual and if a between-groups design had been used. An outcome was more likely to be positive if it was conducted with people with a mental disorder. The variation attributable to these variables when added to a binary logistic regression was not large (Cox and Snell R-2 = 0.12), but not insignificant given the small number of variables included. The pooled results of all included RCTs suggested a statistically significant advantage for interventions over the various comparators [OR 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.65, fixed effects; OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.49 random effects, 40 studies]. However, there was high heterogeneity {/(2)=86, Q=279 [degrees of freedom (df)=39], p < 0.0001), indicating the need for caution in interpreting the observed effect. Analysis by subgroups showed that most results followed a similar pattern, with statistically significant advantages of treatments over comparators being suggested in fixed- and/or random-effects models but in the context of large heterogeneity. Three exceptions were atypical antipsychotic drugs [OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.27, fixed effects; OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.43, random effects; 10 studies, /(2)=72.2, Q = 32.4 (df=9), p < 0.0001], psychological interventions [OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.83, fixed effects; OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93, random effects; nine studies, /(2)=62.1, Q=21.1 (df= 8), p = 0.007] and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as a primary intervention [OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88, fixed effects; OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.99, random effects; seven studies, /(2)=21.6, Q=7.65 (df =6), p=0.26]. Limitations: The heterogenity of the included studies inhibits both robust MA and the clear application of findings to establishing improvements in clinical practice. Conclusions: Results from this review show small-to-moderate effects for CBT, for all psychological interventions combined, and larger effects for atypical antipsychotic drugs, with relatively low heterogeneity. There is also evidence that interventions targeted at mental health populations, and particularly male groups in community settings, are well supported, as they are more likely to achieve stronger effects than interventions with the other groups. Future work should focus on improving the quality of evidence available and should address the issue of heterogenity in the literature.	[Hockenhull, J. C.; Cherry, M.

Influence of Socioeconomic Status Trajectories on Innate Immune Responsiveness in Children	PLOS ONE			English	Article							C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; EARLY-LIFE ORIGINS; CIRCULATING INTERLEUKIN-6; INFLAMMATORY MARKERS; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; STRESS; RISK; DISEASE; OBESITY; HEALTH	Objectives: Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is consistently associated with poor health, yet little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying this inequality. In children, we examined the impact of early-life SES trajectories on the intensity of global innate immune activation, recognizing that excessive activation can be a precursor to inflammation and chronic disease. Methods: Stimulated interleukin-6 production, a measure of immune responsiveness, was analyzed ex vivo for 267 Canadian schoolchildren from a 1995 birth cohort in Manitoba, Canada. Childhood SES trajectories were determined from parent-reported housing data using a longitudinal latent-class modeling technique. Multivariate regression was conducted with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: SES was inversely associated with innate immune responsiveness (p = 0.003), with persistently low-SES children exhibiting responses more than twice as intense as their high-SES counterparts. Despite initially lower SES, responses from children experiencing increasing SES trajectories throughout childhood were indistinguishable from high-SES children. Low-SES effects were strongest among overweight children (p<0.01). Independent of SES trajectories, immune responsiveness was increased in First Nations children (p<0.05) and urban children with atopic asthma (p<0.01). Conclusions: These results implicate differential immune activation in the association between SES and clinical outcomes, and broadly imply that SES interventions during childhood could limit or reverse the damaging biological effects of exposure to poverty during the preschool years.

Understanding the drug treatment community's ambivalence towards tobacco use and treatment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY			English	Article						Smoking cessation; Tobacco treatment; Substance abuse treatment; Health services research; Drug policy	SMOKING-CESSATION TREATMENT; METHADONE-MAINTENANCE PATIENTS; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE TREATMENT; TREATMENT PROGRAMS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; NICOTINE DEPENDENCE; UNITED-STATES; ALCOHOL; SMOKERS; ATTITUDES	Background: Most clients in drug treatment smoke cigarettes, but few facilities provide treatment for tobacco dependence. We identify subjective experiences and social processes that may influence facility adoption of tobacco treatment policies and practices. Methods: Cross-sectional, semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff, directors and clients of 8 drug treatment facilities in the Midwestern U.S. We assembled a purposive sample stratified by ownership, methadone provision, and treatment service provision. We conducted in-person interviews with clinic directors and 54 staff and clients and employed a mixed-method analytic approach. Results: Facility policies and philosophy related to tobacco differed from those regarding alcohol and other drugs. Participants suggested facilities may not treat tobacco dependence because it does not create legal and social problems that force clients into treatment. Tobacco dependence treatment falls outside of a core function of drug treatment, which is to help clients fix legal problems caused by their drug use. Moreover, proactively treating clients for tobacco dependence creates strong ambivalence amongst staff and directors. On the one hand, staff smoking would violate core principles of drug treatment (i.e., the importance of staff abstinence from drugs of abuse); on the other, staff who smoke feel their personal rights and jobs are threatened. This situation creates strong incentives for staff to resist adoption of tobacco dependence treatment. Unlike other studies, the fear of jeopardising clients' abstinence from other drugs did not emerge as a downside for treating tobacco dependence. Conclusions: International and national trends will probably increase the pressure to treat tobacco dependence during drug treatment. However, the U.S. context of drug treatment, as a patchwork, under-funded industry with high employee turnover, may undermine true adoption. At present, many facility staff resolve their ambivalence by reporting they "offer" treatment, but actually providing none. To facilitate dissemination of service provision, it may be useful to identify incentives for U.S. facilities that are closely aligned with the criminal justice system, help facilities define policies and treatment roles for staff who smoke, and better define the role of facilities in preventing morbidity and mortality.

Relative performance of different dental professional groups in screening for occlusal caries. Community Dent Oral Epidemiol 2012. (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S Abstract Objectives: The use of role substitution, where different levels of practitioner undertake the duties of the most qualified clinician, is common in medicine and dentistry. Proponents argue that role substitution has the potential to increase dentists efficiency and effectiveness, thereby freeing up resources to improve access and reduce oral health inequalities. Given the current global economic climate, many countries are re-examining models of service provision to utilize role substitution. The objective of this study was to determine whether different members of the dental team could meet the diagnostic threshold set by the World Health Organization, when screening photographs of occlusal surfaces for dental caries. Methods: Participants were sampled purposively and included; final-year dental students, final-year hygiene-therapy students, primary care dentists, hygiene-therapists and dental nurses. Following a brief training package, participants were asked to score 102 clinical photographs of both carious and noncarious extracted teeth and determine whether the tooth was healthy or had suspected decay. The time delay between consecutive photographs was set at 8-s. Judgment decisions were compared against the International Caries Detection and Assessment System as the gold standard, with scores of two or less representing healthy. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were determined for each participant and clinical group. Kappa was calculated to determine testretest reliability. Results: Dental nurses had the highest median sensitivity (87.9%), although all groups were comparable. The median specificity for the groups was lower than their sensitivity scores, with dentists scoring the highest (71.0%). Dentists also scored the highest median positive predictive value (57.8%), whilst dental nurses scored the highest negative predictive value (91.3%). The median level of agreement was high for all groups; the highest median score was for the final-year dental students (88.9%). Conclusions: Even with minimal training, different members of the dental team show the potential to screen for occlusal caries to a similar standard as primary care dentists. This requires further testing in vivo, but has important implications for the productivity and design of the future dental workforce.

We compared the strength of associations of three SEP components-occupation, income and education-with common mental disorders in a Finnish population. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample of 4561 men and women aged 30-65 years. Mental disorders were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview resulting in 12-month DSM-IV diagnoses of depressive, anxiety and alcohol use disorders. Participants were classified as having low SEP if they worked in a manual occupation, lacked secondary-level education or had income below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition of relative poverty. Results: In models comparing the simultaneous association of all three socio-economic indicators with mental disorders, low income was associated with increased risk for depressive disorder [odds ratio (OR)=1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.31-2.29] and anxiety disorder (OR=1.56, 95% CI 1.14-2.12). Manual occupational class was modestly associated with risk for alcohol use disorder (OR=1.44, 95% CI 1.06-1.95). Low income was the only socio-economic component associated with psychiatric comorbidity, that is, a combination of various disorders within the same individual (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.52-3.37 for any combination). Conclusion: Low income seems to be a more important correlate of mental disorders than education or occupation in a high-income country such as Finland.

PILLARS FOR PROGRESS ON THE RIGHT TO HEALTH: HARNESSING THE POTENTIAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGH A FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON GLOBAL HEALTH	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							COUNTRIES; PEOPLE	Ever more constitutions incorporate the right to health, courts continue to expand their right to health jurisprudence, and communities and civil society increasingly turn to the right to health in their advocacy. Yet the right remains far from being realized. Even with steady progress on numerous fronts of global health, vast inequities at the global and national levels persist, and are responsible for millions of deaths annually. We propose a four-part approach to accelerating progress towards fulfilling the right to health: 1) national legal and policy reform, incorporating right to health obligations and principles including equity, participation, and accountability in designing, implementing, and monitoring the health sector, as well as an all-of-government approach in advancing the public's health; 2) litigation, using creative legal strategies, enhanced training, and promotion of progressive judgments to increase courts' effectiveness in advancing the right to health; 3) civil society and community engagement, empowering communities to understand and claim this right and building the capacity of right to health organizations; and 4) innovative global governance for health, strengthening World Health Organization leadership on health and human rights, further clarifying the international right to health, ensuring sustained and scalable development assistance, and conforming other international legal regimes (e.g., trade, intellectual property, and finance) to health and human rights norms. We offer specific steps to advance each of these areas, including how a new global health treaty, a Framework Convention on Global Health, could help construct these four pillars.

Concurrently, strong evidence on the magnitude and impact of violence against women has emerged from around the world. Despite a growing understanding of factors that may influence women's vulnerability to violence and its effects, key questions about intervention options persist. Using evidence from a WHO household survey on domestic violence, our paper discusses women's help-seeking patterns and considers these findings in relation to Brazil's policies and strategies on violence against women. For the WHO survey, data from a large urban center (the city of Sao Paulo) and from a rural region (Zona da Mata Pernambucana [ZMP]) was collected. Findings from this survey indicate that in Sao Paulo, only 33.8% of women who experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) sought help from a formal service provider, including health, legal, social, or women's support services; in the Forest Zone of the State of Pernambuco, an even smaller proportion (17.1%) sought formal assistance. The majority of women were likely to contact only informal sources of support, such as family, friends, and neighbors. Women who used formal services were primarily those who experienced more severe levels of violence, were severely injured, had children who witnessed the violence, or whose work was disrupted by the violence. Brazil adopted progressive laws and national and local strategies to address violence against women (VAW). Messages about violence and equality now need to reach informal networks and the wider community in order for national anti-violence policies to be successful in supporting women before violence reaches the more extreme levels of severity at which women seek formal help. To translate international standards and national policies into actions that genuinely reach women experiencing violence, states must carefully consider evidence on women's options and decision making.

The paper briefly describes the current macro scenario and the main responses taken to face the crisis and highlights the downside risks of introducing "linear" cuts in the allocation of resources. While justified by the risk of a national debt default, present fiscal policies might increase inequalities in access to care, deteriorate overall health indicators and population wellbeing, and sharpen existing difference in the quality of care between regions. Preliminary evidence shows that the crisis is affecting the quality of nutrition and the incidence of psychiatric disorders. During this difficult financial situation Italy is also facing the risk of a major reduction in investments for preventive medicine, Evidence Based Medicine infrastructures, health information systems and physical capital renewal. This cost-cutting strategy may have negative long term consequences Also, important achievement in terms of limiting waiting lists, improving continuity of care and patients' centeredness, and promoting integration between social and health care may be negatively affected by unprecedented resources' cuts. It is essential that in such a period of public funding constraints health authorities monitor incidence of diseases and access to care of the most vulnerable groups and specifically target interventions to those who may be disproportionally hit by the crisis.

Study Design Identification and tracking of racial/ethnic disparities in health care will be advanced by application of a consistent definition and reliable empirical methods. We have proposed a definition of racial/ethnic health care disparities based in the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Unequal Treatment report, which defines disparities as all differences except those due to clinical need and preferences. After briefly summarizing the strengths and critiques of this definition, we review methods that have been used to implement it. We discuss practical issues that arise during implementation and expand these methods to identify sources of disparities. We also situate the focus on methods to measure racial/ethnic health care disparities (an endeavor predominant in the United States) within a larger international literature in health outcomes and health care inequality. Empirical Application We compare different methods of implementing the IOM definition on measurement of disparities in any use of mental health care and mental health care expenditures using the 20042008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Conclusion Disparities analysts should be aware of multiple methods available to measure disparities and their differing assumptions. We prefer a method concordant with the IOM definition.

In this article, we describe the disease burden and status of epidemiological research and capacity in the SEAR to understand, analyse and develop capacity in response to the diverse burdens of diseases in the region. Methods Data on morbidity, mortality, risk factors, social determinants, research capacity, health education, workforce and systems in the SEAR were obtained using global data on burden of disease, peer-reviewed journals, World Health Organization (WHO) technical and advisory reports, and where available, validated country reports and key informants from the region. Results SEAR countries are afflicted with a triple burden of disease-infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and injuries. Of the seven WHO regions, SEAR countries account for the highest proportion of global mortality (26%) and due to relatively younger ages at death, the second highest percentage of total years of life lost (30%). The SEAR exceeds the global average annual mortality rate for all three broad cause groupings-communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions (334 vs 230 per 100 000); non-communicable diseases (676 vs 573 per 100 000); and injuries (101 vs 78 per 100 000). Poverty, education and other social determinants of health are strongly linked to inequities in health among SEAR countries and within socio-economic subgroups. India, Thailand and Bangladesh produce two-thirds of epidemiology publications in the region. Significant efforts to increase health workforce capacity, research and training have been undertaken in the region, yet considerable heterogeneity in resources and capacity remains. Conclusions Health systems, statistics and surveillance programmes must respond to the demographic, economic and epidemiological transitions that define the current disease burden and risk profile of SEAR populations. Inequities in health must be critically analysed, documented and addressed through multi-sectoral approaches. There is a critical need to improve public health intelligence by building epidemiological capacity in the region.

To reduce these disparities, it is necessary to understand how indigenous women's disadvantages in linguistic, socioeconomic or residential characteristics relate to their underutilization of reproductive health services. METHODS: Logistic regression analyses of a nationally representative sample of women aged 15-49 from the 2008-2009 National Survey of Maternal and Infant Health were used to estimate ethnic disparities in women's use of institutional prenatal care and delivery, and in met demand for modern contraceptives. Using predicted probabilities, we estimated the extent to which these disparities were attributable to a language barrier among indigenous women and to their disadvantage in selected socioeconomic and residential characteristics. RESULTS: The ethnic difference in use of institutional prenatal care was small; however, institutional delivery was far less common among indigenous women than among ladina women (36% vs. 73%), as was met need for modern contraceptives (49% vs. 7296). Not speaking Spanish accounted for the largest portion of these ethnic differentials. Indigenous women's poor education and rural residence made up smaller portions of the ethnic differential in modern contraceptive use than did their economic disadvantage. CONCLUSION: The large proportion of indigenous women who use institutional prenatal care suggests that further integrating the three services may increase their use of institutional delivery and modern contraceptives. Adding speakers of local Mayan languages to the staff of health facilities could also help increase use.

Understanding trends and variations between and within countries will assist in the development of effective preventive programs. This review aims (1) to document time-trends in child caries experience of countries with different levels of social and economic development, and (2) to compare factors affecting the caries experience of children in two contrasting countries. A time-trend analytical approach of ecological data from countries with different levels of social and economic development and individual data of the two contrasting Vietnamese and Australian child populations were used. The analysis found a significant decline in caries experience of children, mostly driven by the improvement in populations with high social and economic development. Significant variations in caries experience and in associations with risk factors between and within countries were observed. Socio-economic inequality in child oral health existed within developed countries and between countries with different levels of development. Population programs aimed at improving upstream factors are of priority in further improving child oral health in different populations.

Conversely, the public sector is often regarded as providing more equitable and evidence-based care. We performed a systematic review of research studies investigating the performance of private and public sector delivery in low- and middle-income countries. Methods and Findings: Peer-reviewed studies including case studies, meta-analyses, reviews, and case-control analyses, as well as reports published by non-governmental organizations and international agencies, were systematically collected through large database searches, filtered through methodological inclusion criteria, and organized into six World Health Organization health system themes: accessibility and responsiveness; quality; outcomes; accountability, transparency, and regulation; fairness and equity; and efficiency. Of 1,178 potentially relevant unique citations, data were obtained from 102 articles describing studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Comparative cohort and cross-sectional studies suggested that providers in the private sector more frequently violated medical standards of practice and had poorer patient outcomes, but had greater reported timeliness and hospitality to patients. Reported efficiency tended to be lower in the private than in the public sector, resulting in part from perverse incentives for unnecessary testing and treatment. Public sector services experienced more limited availability of equipment, medications, and trained healthcare workers. When the definition of "private sector'' included unlicensed and uncertified providers such as drug shop owners, most patients appeared to access care in the private sector; however, when unlicensed healthcare providers were excluded from the analysis, the majority of people accessed public sector care. "Competitive dynamics'' for funding appeared between the two sectors, such that public funds and personnel were redirected to private sector development, followed by reductions in public sector service budgets and staff. Conclusions: Studies evaluated in this systematic review do not support the claim that the private sector is usually more efficient, accountable, or medically effective than the public sector; however, the public sector appears frequently to lack timeliness and hospitality towards patients.

There has been a notable lack of dialogue between gender advocates in the global north and south, from policy and practice, governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This paper contributes to the debate on the shape of future action for gender equity in health, by uniquely bringing together the voices of disparate actors, first heard in a series of four seminars held during 2008 and 2009, involving almost 200 participants from 15 different country contexts. The series used (Feminist) Participatory Action Research (FPAR) methodology to create a productive dialogue on the developing theory around GM and the at times disconnected empirical experience of policy and practice. We analyse the debates and experiences shared at the seminar series using concrete, context specific examples from research, advocacy, policy and programme development perspectives, as presented by participants from southern and northern settings, including Kenya, Mozambique, India, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Canada and Australia. Focussing on key discussions around sexualities and (dis)ability and their interactions with gender, we explore issues around intersectionality across the five key themes for research and action identified by participants: 1) Addressing the disconnect between gender mainstreaming praxis and contemporary feminist theory; 2) Developing appropriate analysis methodologies; 3) Developing a coherent theory of change; 4) Seeking resolution to the dilemmas and uncertainties around the 'place' of men and boys in GM as a feminist project; and 5) Developing a politics of intersectionality. We conclude that there needs to be a coherent and inclusive strategic direction to improve policy and practice for promoting gender equity in health which requires the full and equal participation of practitioners and policy makers working alongside their academic partners.

Evidence from 96 low- and middle-income countries	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						immunisation; unvaccinated; LMIC; Demographic and Health Surveys; vaccination; non vaccines; PRITI; EDS; Inmunizacion; no vacunados; paises con ingresos medios y bajos; encuestas demograficas y sanitarias	VACCINATION	Objective While childhood immunisation coverage levels have increased since the 70s, inequities in coverage between and within countries have been widely reported. Unvaccinated children remain undetected by routine monitoring systems and strikingly unreported. The objective of this study was to provide evidence on the magnitude of the problem and to describe predictors associated with non-vaccination. Methods Two hundred and forty-one nationally representative household surveys in 96 countries were analysed. Proportions and changes in time of unvaccinated (children having not received a single dose of vaccine), partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated children were estimated. Predictors of non-vaccination were explored. Results The percentage of unvaccinated children was 9.9% across all surveys. 66 countries had more than one survey: 38 showed statistically significant reductions in the proportion of unvaccinated children between the first and last survey, 10 countries showed increases and the rest showed no significant changes. However, while 18 of the 38 countries also improved in terms of partially and fully vaccinated, in the other 20 the proportion of fully vaccinated decreased. The predictors more strongly associated with being unvaccinated were education of the caregiver, education of caregivers partner, caregivers tetanus toxoid (TT) status, wealth index and type of family member participation in decision-making when the child is ill. Multivariable logistic regression identified the TT status of the caregiver as the strongest predictors of unvaccinated children. Country-specific summaries were produced and sent to countries. Conclusion The number of unvaccinated children is not negligible and their proportion and the predictors of non-vaccination have to be drawn from specific surveys. Specific vaccine indicators cannot properly describe the performance of immunisation programmes in certain situations. National immunisation programmes and national and international immunisation stakeholders should also consider monitoring the proportion of unvaccinated children (i.e. those who have received no vaccines at all) and draw specific plans on the determinants of non-vaccination.

This article examines issues to be considered to ensure fair compensation provided in a way that respects the dignity of workers. Methods An overview of the literature on characteristics and effects of workers' compensation systems is followed by an analysis based on classic legal methods, including those of comparative law, complemented with interview data to examine three models of disability compensation. Results The first part of the article identifies cross cutting issues to be considered in the examination of the equity of compensation systems and the protection of the dignity of claimants. These include three underpinnings of workers' compensation: the links between a no-fault system and the adversarial process, the appropriate use of medical and scientific evidence in the determination of compensability and the application of appropriate measures for promoting return to work. The second part looks at accident compensation in New Zealand, where compensation is available regardless of the cause of the accident, and disability insurance in the Netherlands, where compensation is available regardless of the cause of the disability. It then describes a composite of characteristics favorable to equity drawn from the thirteen workers' compensation systems in Canada. Conclusion Systems that succeed in reducing opportunities for adversarial interactions and that provide substantive protection could better promote the dignity of claimants. Am. J. Ind.

Is There a Financial Disincentive to Perform Partial Nephrectomy?	JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article						kidney; nephrectomy; reimbursement; incentive; physician's practice patterns; quality of care	LAPAROSCOPIC RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY; RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA; CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; 7 CM; COMPLICATIONS; EXPERIENCE; SURGERY; TRENDS; TUMOR	Purpose: Despite the explicit endorsement of the American Urological Association guidelines of partial nephrectomy as the treatment of choice for T1a renal cell carcinoma, a considerable underuse of nephron sparing surgery characterizes general practice patterns in the United States. We explored possible financial disincentives associated with partial nephrectomy that may contribute to this important quality of care deficit. Materials and Methods: A PubMed (R) query on perioperative outcomes identified 10 series on open or laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and 16 on open, laparoscopic or robot-assisted partial nephrectomy. Mean operative time and hospital length of stay were calculated for each group. Using these data in conjunction with Health Care Financing Administration data on physician work time, which guides the current Resource-Based Relative Value Scale Medicare fee schedule, we calculated global physician time expenditure and hourly Medicare reimbursement rates for each of these 5 surgical services. Results: Mean +/- SD operative time for open and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, and open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted partial nephrectomy was 180.7 +/- 24.7 minutes (95% CI 119.3-242.0) in 3 studies, 178.8 +/- 16.5 (95% CI 163.5-194.1) in 7, 226.0 +/- 36.9 (95% CI 187.2-264.8) in 6, 227.9 +/- 40.2 (95% CI 185.8-270.1) in 6 and 227.9 +/- 37.8 (95% CI 167.7-288.1) in 4, respectively (p = 0.028). Mean length of stay (days) after open and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, and open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted partial nephrectomy was 5.8 +/- 0.7 days (95% CI 4.0-7.7) in 3 studies, 2.5 +/- 1.1 (95% CI 1.4-3.6) in 6, 5.8 +/- 0.4 (95% CI 5.3-6.2) in 5, 2.9 +/- 0.3 (95% CI 2.6-3.3) in 6 and 2.8 +/- 1.0 (95% CI 1.2-4.4) in 4, respectively (p < 0.001). The hourly reimbursement rate was calculated at $200.61, $242.03, $185.66, $231.27 and $231.97 for open and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, and open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted partial nephrectomy, respectively. Hence, open partial nephrectomy emerged as the lowest paying of these procedures. Conclusions: Inferior compensation for open partial nephrectomy relative to that of laparoscopic or open radical nephrectomy may impede the dissemination of nephron sparing surgery for small renal masses. This may occur particularly in a general practice setting, where the expertise required for laparoscopic or robot-assisted partial nephrectomy may be lacking. We propose rectifying this inequity to facilitate wider use of nephron sparing surgery in the clinically appropriate setting.	[Tanagho, Youssef S.; Figenshau, R.

A Framework Convention on Global Health Health for All, Justice for All	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article								Health inequalities represent perhaps the most consequential global health challenge and yet they persist despite increased funding and innovative programs. The United Nations is revising the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that will shape the world for many years to come. What would a transformative post-MDG framework for global health justice look like? A global coalition of civil society and academics-the Joint Action and Learning Initiative on National and Global Responsibilities for Health (JALI)-has formed an international campaign to advocate for a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH). Recently endorsed by the UN Secretary-General, the FCGH would reimagine global governance for health, offering a new post-MDG vision. This Special Communication describes the key modalities of an FCGH to illustrate how it would improve health and reduce inequalities. The modalities would include defining national responsibilities for the population's health; defining international responsibilities for reliable, sustainable funding; setting global health priorities; coordinating fragmented activities; reshaping global governance for health; and providing strong global health leadership through the World Health Organization.

Space, race, and poverty: Spatial inequalities in walkable neighborhood amenities?	DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH			English	Article							RACIAL RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION; BODY-MASS INDEX; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; HEALTH DISPARITIES; PRIORITIZING COMMUNITIES; SOCIOECONOMIC MEASURES; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; IMPACT ASSESSMENT	BACKGROUND Multiple and varied benefits have been suggested for increased neighborhood walkability. However, spatial inequalities in neighborhood walkability likely exist and may be attributable, in part, to residential segregation. OBJECTIVE Utilizing a spatial demographic perspective, we evaluated potential spatial inequalities in walkable neighborhood amenities across census tracts in Boston, MA (US). METHODS The independent variables included minority racial/ethnic population percentages and percent of families in poverty. Walkable neighborhood amenities were assessed with a composite measure. Spatial autocorrelation in key study variables were first calculated with the Global Moran's I statistic. Then, Spearman correlations between neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics and walkable neighborhood amenities were calculated as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We fit ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and spatial autoregressive models, when appropriate, as a final step. RESULTS Significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found in neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics (e.g. census tract percent Black), but not walkable neighborhood amenities or in the OLS regression residuals. Spearman correlations between neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics and walkable neighborhood amenities were not statistically significant, nor were neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics significantly associated with walkable neighborhood amenities in OLS regression models. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that there is residential segregation in Boston and that spatial inequalities do not necessarily show up using a composite measure. COMMENTS Future research in other geographic areas (including international contexts) and using different definitions of neighborhoods (including small-area definitions) should evaluate if spatial inequalities are found using composite measures but also should use measures of specific neighborhood amenities.

We report findings from a critical hermeneutic phenomenological research study that explored how the social, economic, and political structures impinge on the lives of people with chronic illness. Research findings of this study show how the people with chronic illness in Colombia live through the effects and pressures of globalization and corporate agendas. Results also showed how the marked social inequities caused by the unequal distribution of power, services, and goods leads to health inequities and social exclusion of research participants.

J	Payne, S				Payne, S.			An Elusive Goal? Gender Equity and Gender Equality in Health Policy	GESUNDHEITSWESEN			English	Article						gender equity; gender equality; gender differences; gender mainstreaming; health policy		Variations in the health of men and women are well known: men have poorer life expectancy than women in virtually every country, and there are differences between women and men in patterns of morbidity across the life course. These variations reflect both biology and gender, and health systems play a part through the services they offer. In recent years a number of national governments and international bodies have paid increasing attention to gender inequalities, and gender mainstreaming has been adopted by as a key policy objective at various levels of governance. While gender mainstreaming has resulted in some successes, analysis of the depth of change suggests a less optimistic view, reflecting the persistence of barriers to gender mainstreaming in health, which include a lack of resources, uncertainty over the goals of gender mainstreaming, and notional rather than genuine adoption of gender mainstreaming principles. Underlying these barriers however, is the use of bureaucratic and systems-based approaches to gender mainstreaming. The failure to challenge underlying gender relations of power allows gender strategies to become technocratic exercises which achieve results in terms of the boxes ticked, but not in relation to what matters: the health and health opportunities of both women and men.

J	MacGregor, H; Mills, E				MacGregor, Hayley; Mills, Elizabeth			Framing rights and responsibilities: accounts of women with a history of AIDS activism	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH-SERVICES; HIV-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS; SOUTH-AFRICA; PEOPLE; GENDER; MEN; PERSPECTIVES; HIV/AIDS; POLICY; EXPERIENCES	Background: In South Africa, policy with respect to HIV/AIDS has had a strong rights-based framing in line with international trends and in keeping with the constitutional overhaul in the post-Apartheid era. There have also been considerable advances since 1994 towards legal enshrinement of sexual and reproductive health rights and in the provision of related services. Since HIV in this setting has heavily affected women of reproductive age, there has been discussion about the particular needs of this subgroup, especially in the context of service integration. This paper is concerned with the way in which HIV positive women conceptualise these rights and whether they wish and are able to actualise them in their daily lives. Methods: In 2003 a group of women involved with the Treatment Action Campaign and Medicines Sans FrontiSres participated in an initiative to 'map' their bodies as affected by the virus. A book containing the maps and narratives was published and used as a political tool to pressure the government of the day to roll out antiretroviral therapy (ART) to the population. In 2008, the authors coordinated an initiative that involved conducting follow-up in-depth interviews in which five of these women reflected on those body maps and on how their lives had changed in the intervening five years since gaining the right to treatment through the public sector. Results: Drawing upon this qualitative data and published sources, these new accounts are analysed in order to reflect the perspectives of these women living with chronic HIV with respect to their sexual relations and fertility desires. The paper reveals difficulties faced by these women in negotiating sexual relationships and disclosure of their HIV positive status. It focuses on how they perceive relative responsibilities in terms of taking preventative measures in sexual encounters. Women adopt tactics within a context characterised by various inequalities in order to 'make do', such as by remaining silent about their status. Concerns about childbearing can be addressed by information and support from a health care worker. Conclusions: Women's experience of HIV as a chronic illness and the need to adhere to ART, is linked to the way in which the language of responsibility can come to counter-balance a language of rights in treatment programmes.

J	Rashid, SF				Rashid, Sabina Faiz			Human rights and reproductive health: political realities and pragmatic choices for married adolescent women living in urban slums, Bangladesh	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								Background: In Bangladesh, particularly in urban slums, married adolescent women's human rights to life, health, and reproductive and sexual health remain adversely affected because of the structural inequalities and political economic, social and cultural conditions which shape how rights are understood, negotiated and lived. Methods: The focus of the research and methods was anthropological. An initial survey of 153 married adolescent women was carried out and from this group, 50 in-depth interviews were conducted with selected participants and, from the in-depth interviews, a further eight case studies of women and their families were selected for in-depth repeated interviews and case histories. Results: This paper speaks of the unanticipated complexities when writing on reproductive rights for poor adolescent women living in the slums, where the discourses on 'universal human rights' are often removed from the reality of adolescent women's everyday lives. Married adolescent women and their families remain extremely vulnerable in the unpredictable, crime-prone and insecure urban slum landscape because of their age, gender and poverty. Adolescent women's understanding of their rights such as the decision to marry early, have children, terminate pregnancies and engage in risky sexual behaviour, are different from the widely accepted discourse on rights globally, which assumes a particular kind of individual thinking and discourse on rights and a certain autonomy women have over their bodies and their lives. This does not necessarily exist in urban slum populations. Conclusions: The lived experiences and decisions made pertaining to sexual and reproductive health and 'rights' exercised by married adolescent women, their families and slum communities, allow us to reflect on the disconnect between the international legal human rights frameworks as applied to sexual and reproductive health rights, and how these are played out on the ground. These notions are far more complex in environments where married adolescent women and their families live in conditions of poverty and socioeconomic deprivation.

J	Bowen, KJ; Friel, S				Bowen, Kathryn J.; Friel, Sharon			Climate change adaptation: Where does global health fit in the agenda?	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Review						Global health; Climate change; Adaptation; Equity; Sustainable development; Adaptation funding; Social determinants	FOOD; VULNERABILITY; VARIABILITY	Human-induced climate change will affect the lives of most populations in the next decade and beyond. It will have greatest, and generally earliest, impact on the poorest and most disadvantaged populations on the planet. Changes in climatic conditions and increases in weather variability affect human wellbeing, safety, health and survival in many ways. Some impacts are direct-acting and immediate, such as impaired food yields and storm surges. Other health effects are less immediate and typically occur via more complex causal pathways that involve a range of underlying social conditions and sectors such as water and sanitation, agriculture and urban planning. Climate change adaptation is receiving much attention given the inevitability of climate change and its effects, particularly in developing contexts, where the effects of climate change will be experienced most strongly and the response mechanisms are weakest. Financial support towards adaptation activities from various actors including the World Bank, the European Union and the United Nations is increasing substantially. With this new global impetus and funding for adaptation action come challenges such as the importance of developing adaptation activities on a sound understanding of baseline community needs and vulnerabilities, and how these may alter with changes in climate. The global health community is paying heed to the strengthening focus on adaptation, albeit in a slow and unstructured manner. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of adaptation and its relevance to global health, and highlight the opportunities to improve health and reduce health inequities via the new and additional funding that is available for climate change adaptation activities.

Developed countries are making the problem worse by luring health care workers away from the countries that need them most, while developing countries do not have the resources to stem the flow or even replace those lost. Postmodern philosopher Emmanuel Levinas offers a unique ethical framework that is helpful in assessing both the irresponsibility inherent in the current global health care situation and the responsibility and obligation held by the stakeholders involved in this global crisis. Drawing on Levinas' exploration of individual freedom and self-pursuit, infinite responsibility for the Other, and the potential emergence of a just community, we demonstrate its effectiveness in explaining the health care worker crisis, and we argue in favor of a variety of policy and development assistance measures that are grounded in an orientation of non-indifference toward Others.

J	Nord, E				Nord, Erik			Measuring concerns for severity: Re-examination of a health scale with purported equal interval properties	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Priority setting; Economic evaluation; QALY; Equity; Severity; Interval scale	COST-VALUE ANALYSIS; TRADE-OFF; VALUATIONS	Severity of illness is an important official criterion for priority setting in health care in a number of jurisdictions. An 8-point scale of severity and functional status has been used in a number of studies in Norway in order to estimate the strength of concerns for severity in population samples. The scale has attracted international attention and may be of interest to researchers in other countries. For confidence in interpretations of results, the scale should have equal interval properties with respect to individual utility. Close examination suggest that some deviations from equal intervals occur. These deviations do not impact significantly on earlier findings and do not prevent the scale from being a potentially useful tool in future studies of the strength of societal concerns for fairness in health care. However, further research with larger and more representative samples is encouraged. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ishfaq, M; Lodhi, BK				Ishfaq, Mohammad; Lodhi, Bilal Khan			Role of GIS in Social Sector Planning: Can Developing Countries Benefit from the Examples of Primary Health Care (PHC) Planning in Britain?	JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article						GIS (geographical information system); Locality planning; Decentralization; Primary health care delivery; Locality profiles; Locality boundaries; Localities' empowerment	INFORMATION-SYSTEM; SERVICES	Social sector planning requires rational approaches where community needs are identified by referring to relative deprivation among localities and resources are allocated to address inequalities. Geographical information system (GIS) has been widely argued and used as a base for rational planning for equal resource allocation in social sectors around the globe. Devolution of primary health care is global strategy that needs pains taking efforts to implement it. GIS is one of the most important tools used around the world in decentralization process of primary health care. This paper examines the scope of GIS in social sector planning by concentration on primary health care delivery system in Pakistan. The work is based on example of the UK's decentralization process and further evidence from US. This paper argues that to achieve benefits of well informed decision making to meet the communities' needs GIS is an essential tool to support social sector planning and can be used without any difficulty in any environment. There is increasing trend in the use of Health Management Information System (HMIS) in Pakistan with ample internet connectivity which provides well established infrastructure in Pakistan to implement GIS for health care, however there is need for change in attitude towards empowering localities especially with reference to decentralization of decision making. This paper provides GIS as a tool for primary health care planning in Pakistan as a starting point in defining localities and preparing locality profiles for need identification that could help developing countries in implementing the change.

The role of hardship in the association between socio-economic position and depression	AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Depression; epidemiology; hardship; socio-economic status	COMMON MENTAL-DISORDERS; ECONOMIC HARDSHIP; INCOME INEQUALITY; SOCIAL-CLASS; HEALTH; UNEMPLOYMENT; CONSEQUENCES; DEPRIVATION; PREVALENCE; EMPLOYMENT	Objective: It is well established that socio-economic position is associated with depression. The experience of financial hardship, having to go without the essentials of daily living due to limited financial resources, may explain the effect. However, there are few studies examining the link between financial hardship and diagnosable depression at a population level. The current paper addresses this gap and also evaluates the moderating effect of age. Method: Data were from 8841 participants aged 16-85 years in Australia's 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. The 12-month prevalence of depressive episode was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Measures of socio-economic position included: financial hardship, education, labour-force status, occupational skill, household income, main source of income, and area-level disadvantage. Results: Financial hardship was more strongly associated with depression than other socio-economic variables. Hardship was more strongly associated with current depression than with prior history of depression. The relative effect of hardship was strongest in late adulthood but the absolute effect of hardship was greatest in middle age. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the critical role of financial hardship in the association between socio-economic disadvantage and 12-month depressive episode, and suggest that social and economic policies that address inequalities in living standards may be an appropriate way to reduce the burden attributable to depression.

A Methodology Study	PLOS ONE			English	Review							METAANALYSIS; INEQUALITIES; STUDENTS; ADULTS	Introduction: Tackling health inequities both within and between countries remains high on the agenda of international organizations including the World Health Organization and local, regional and national governments. Systematic reviews can be a useful tool to assess effects on equity in health status because they include studies conducted in a variety of settings and populations. This study aims to describe the extent to which the impacts of health interventions on equity in health status are considered in systematic reviews, describe methods used, and assess the implications of their equity related findings for policy, practice and research. Methods: We conducted a methodology study of equity assessment in systematic reviews. Two independent reviewers extracted information on the reporting and analysis of impacts of health interventions on equity in health status in a group of 300 systematic reviews collected from all systematic reviews indexed in one month of MEDLINE, using a pre-tested data collection form. Any differences in data extraction were resolved by discussion. Results: Of the 300 systematic reviews, 224 assessed the effectiveness of interventions on health outcomes. Of these 224 reviews, 29 systematic reviews assessed effects on equity in health status using subgroup analysis or targeted analyses of vulnerable populations. Of these, seven conducted subgroup analyses related to health equity which were reported in insufficient detail to judge their credibility. Of these 29 reviews, 18 described implications for policy and practice based on assessment of effects on health equity. Conclusion: The quality and completeness of reporting should be enhanced as a priority, because without this policymakers and practitioners will continue lack the evidence base they need to inform decision-making about health inequity. Furthermore, there is a need to develop methods to systematically consider impacts on equity in health status that is currently lacking in systematic reviews.

J	Leonard, L				Leonard, Llewellyn			Another political ecology of civil society reflexiveness against urban industrial risks for environmental justice: The case of the Bisasar landfill, Durban, South Africa	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Bisasar landfill; civil society; Durban; environmental justice; political ecology; risk society	APARTHEID; LIMITS	The concerns of political ecology since its beginnings as a field have been predominantly set in rural areas with limited focus on urban industrial risks. Further, debates on the global South (often from Anglo-American perspectives) have not fully appreciated the divergent and differentiated perceptions of urban risks and, therefore, everyday forms of resistance within civil society. Instead, work has mainly focused on civil society power relations against the state and industry that are driven by coherent populist political agendas. Against this setting, this paper's contribution aims to better contextualize other third world localities in political ecology through a case study of urban industrial risks in the upper/middle income (as opposed to rural, low/lower middle income) country, South Africa. In doing so, the paper sheds light on the derelict aspect of civil society contestation, especially along class and ethnic lines, over urban landfill infrastructure as a livelihood resource or a health hazard. The paper draws upon frameworks of self-reflexivity and reflexive localism as complementary to the mainstream political ecology to illuminate differentiated civil society reflexiveness and therefore, aims to advance the discussion of other political ecologies. The case study of the largest formal landfill site in Africa, the Bisasar landfill situated in Durban, highlights differences underlying power relations and constraints within civil society (in leadership, social networking, resources and mistrust) that have implications for mainstream political ecology notions of civil society coherence.

Measles and rubella eradication in the Americas	VACCINE			English	Article						Measles; Rubella; Congenital rubella syndrome; Eradication; Surveillance	VACCINATION; ELIMINATION; HEALTH; VACCINES	The challenge for regions embarking on measles elimination will be to maintain high population immunity with excellent vaccination coverage and high-quality surveillance. Meeting this challenge will be especially critical for dealing with importations of measles virus that will occur as long as the virus is circulating anywhere in the world. Implementation of measles elimination strategies will uncover the "hidden" disease burden of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome. As was the experience in countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), integrating the elimination of measles with the elimination of rubella will greatly enhance the capacity of countries to sustain progress in the reduction of measles mortality. Countries of LAC prioritized the routine national immunization program over short-term successes. While doing so, they have also encountered new opportunities to expand the benefits of disease control and elimination activities to other aspects of public health, most importantly towards improving health care for women and new borns and reducing inequities in health in the region's poorest communities. Implementation of similar strategies could lead to the global eradication of measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome early this century, while strengthening routine immunization programs, and developing the capacity to introduce new and underutilized vaccines.

J	Aveling, EL				Aveling, Emma-Louise			Making sense of 'gender': From global HIV/AIDS strategy to the local Cambodian ground	HEALTH & PLACE			English	Article						Gender; Cambodia; HIV/AIDS; Local knowledge	COMMUNITY; EMPOWERMENT; HEALTH; SEX	Interventions aiming to promote gender equality are a common feature of global HIV/AIDS policies. To develop effective interventions, it is important to understand how globally established concepts (e.g. 'gender') are (re)interpreted and legitimated locally. This paper examines what happens when the concept of 'gender' hits the local ground in the context of an internationally funded HIV/AIDS intervention in Cambodia. Interviews with participants reveal that 'gender' is itself understood to mean equal rights. Some elements of this concept are rejected as inapplicable in Khmer society, while others are hybridised with existing knowledges. The analysis demonstrates how relational, symbolic and material dimensions of the place into which HIV/AIDS programmes intervene shape not only what 'sense' participants make of new knowledge, but also their capacity to use it. Further, the paper argues that to achieve the desired health-enhancing outcomes, international health organisations must avoid essentialising local spaces as static and 'traditional'; rather, they must attend to and build on the ambiguities of existing knowledges and the changing dynamics of the places they enter.

J	Mohanty, SK				Mohanty, Sanjay K.			Multiple Deprivations and Maternal Care in India	INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Article							ANTENATAL CARE; UTTAR-PRADESH; HEALTH-CARE; POVERTY; INEQUALITIES; POOR; IMMUNIZATION; COUNTRIES; SERVICES; CHILDREN	CONTEXT: Research on inequalities in the utilization of maternal health care services is often confined to only the economic domain. Individuals and families living in acute poverty may simultaneously experience multiple dimensions of deprivation, which together may obstruct their access to basic health services. It is important to examine the linkages between multiple deprivations and maternal health care. METHODS: Data from the 2005-2006 Indian National Family Health Survey were used to examine ever-married women's receipt of antenatal care, medical assistance during delivery and postnatal care services across three dimensions of deprivation: education, wealth and health. Bivariate analyses, principal component analyses and binomial logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Thirty-two percent of ever-married Indian women reported being deprived in one of the three dimensions, 18% in two and 7% in all three; 43% were deprived in none. Women deprived in all three dimensions were less likely than those not deprived in any to have received antenatal care (predicted probabilities, 0.3 vs. 0.8) or postnatal care (0.2 vs. 0.7); the likelihood that a birth occurred with medical assistance was smaller for women deprived in three dimensions than for those deprived in none (0.2 vs. 0.8). These patterns held true for all of the larger Indian states. Differentials in utilization of maternal care services across deprivation levels were higher in states where service coverage was low and lower in states where service coverage was high. CONCLUSION: More research is needed to understand how multiple deprivations are associated with health inequality across cultures and how to use this knowledge to improve delivery of basic health services.

Seeking to shape effective policies to combat with gender inequality and to measure achieved progress in this area; the indices of gender inequality play important role. There are many indicators of inequality representing different aspects on gender inequality ranging from social-economic to institutional and cultural issues. The main measures of gender inequalities can be found in the following areas: education; poverty; health; labor market; access to resources; education; globalization; governance; conflict and emergencies; human rights etc. However it is necessary to have one indicator which allows assessing gender inequality in all aspects to compare countries in terms of level of gender inequality. It is important to have good statistics disaggregated by gender. Such statistics helps to evaluate the status quo, inform policies, and stimulate and measure change by raising awareness amongst policy-makers and providing a foundation for development of new policies in this area. There are some limitations of certain statistics and the validity of certain indicators for gender inequality measurements. In addition the validity of certain indicators are questionable. There is a need for new indicator, covering all issues of gender inequalities. Integrated indicator of gender inequality is proposed in the paper. This indicator is based on multi-criteria analysis and normalization of several the most important gender inequality indicators being applied by various international institutions dealing with gender issues.

Euro-Education: Employability for all (EEE4all) <i>Design and implementation of an international course for future health-care professionals</i>	WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION			English	Article						Occupational therapy; gender; e-learning; vocational rehabilitation; course design		Background: Employment is a priority in the European Union, and it is essential to address the needs of individuals disadvantaged at the labour market on grounds such as ethnicity, age, gender or disability, to increase the opportunities for these groups to gain employment. The Council of the European Union recognize the important role of national organisations in increasing gender equality and the need to integrate a gender perspective in all policies. Gender equality perspectives should also, according to the EU Plan of Action and Gender Equality be integrated in education. Objectives: To equip students in higher education with knowledge, about gender, age, disability and ethnicity in relation to employability, a European group initiated a project; Euro-Education: Employability for all (EEE4all). Approach: The project, funded by the European Lifelong Learning Programme, was aimed to develop and implement four course modules, each relating to employability with different focus: gender, age, disability or ethnicity. In this paper design, implementation, and evaluation of the course focused on gender, provided by the Occupational Therapy Programme at Linkoping University, is described. Conclusions: The students highlighted the importance of awareness and knowledge about gender theory and its application in relation to employability and client-centred approach.	[Falk, Annika E.

Share of Nations in 37 international Public Health Journals: An Equity and Diversity Perspective towards Health Research Capacity Building	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Equity; Capacity buliding; Editorial board; Journal; Nations		Background: This paper contributes to thriller exploration of inequity in access to health research capacity development by examining the representation of different nations in international public health journals. It also aims to examine the degree of diversity that exists in these journals. Methods: This study is a descriptive survey. It was done with objective sampling on 37 ISI health journals on October of 2008. The number and nationality of people in different editorial positions of the journals was identified. The second analysis involved recalculating the numbers obtained for each nation to the population size of nations per million inhabitants. In order to better compare countries in terms of presence in editorial team of the journals, a 'public health editor equity gap ratio' (PHEEGR) was developed. Results: Low income countries have occupied none of the leadership positions of chief editor or associate/assistant chief editors and middle income countries at maximum shared less than 5 percent. The PHEEGR gap in access to the different editorial positions between highest to the lowest representation of countries was 16/1 for chief editors, 12/1 for associate editors, 335/1 for editorial boards and 202/1 for associate editorial boards. However, after normalizing the data to the country's population, the gap increased significantly. Conclusion: There is an imbalance and possibly even inequity in the composition of editorial boards and offices of international health journals that should be paid significant attention. This can contribute to fill the equity gap exists between health in developing and developed countries.	[Mohammadi, N.

Methods: A cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 1 control and 2 intervention arms was conducted in Shivgarh. India, between January 2004 and May 2005. Risk-enhancing domiciliary newborn care behaviors, including those posing a concomitant risk to maternal health, were targeted through home visits and community meetings. Secondary outcomes included knowledge of maternal danger signs, self-reported complications, maternal care practices, care-seeking from trained providers, and maternal mortality ratio (MMR). The intervention arms were combined for analysis, which was done by intention to treat. Results: Significant improvements were observed in maternal health equity and outcomes including knowledge of danger signs, care practices, self-reported complications, and timely care-seeking from trained providers. The difference in adjusted MMR was not significant (relative risk 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-1.43; P=0.11) owing to the inadequate sample size for this outcome, but may suggest a decline in MMR given improvements in other outcomes in the causal pathway to mortality. Conclusion: Community-based strategies focused on prevention and care-seeking effectively complemented facility-based strategies toward improving maternal health, while synergizing with newborn care interventions.

J	Chung, R				Chung, Ryoa			A Theoretical Framework for a Comprehensive Approach to Medical Humanitarianism	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article								This article aims to demonstrate how the impact of humanitarian crises on health outcomes is related to social justice issues, even when these crises are brought upon by natural disasters. Pre-existing inequalities between individuals and social groups within a community affect in important and complex ways the health disparities which result from natural disasters. Drawing on the thought-provoking work of Paul Farmer, my main hypothesis is that socio-political factors prior to natural disasters determine 'structured health risks' that humanitarian crises will necessarily exacerbate. To adequately respond to these structured health risks, medical humanitarianism cannot abide by an apolitical approach which mainly focuses on emergency relief. A more comprehensive analysis of the socio-political aspects of the health impact of humanitarian crises indicates that a more comprehensive approach to medical humanitarianism is necessary. This has three implications. First, a coherent account of medical humanitarianism needs to assess the international dimension of structural injustice that leads to structured health disparities. Second, this comprehensive approach to medical humanitarianism supports the 'denaturalization of natural disasters' argument. Third, medical humanitarianism should be organized around a broader and more complex approach of overlapping sequences which bridge emergency relief, reconstruction and development through a better aligned, orchestrated and coherent international effort.

J	Esteves, RJF				Esteves, Roberto J. F.			The quest for equity in Latin America: a comparative analysis of the health care reforms in Brazil and Colombia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Brazil; Colombia; health care reform; health care system; equity; health inequities; comparative analysis; health policy	INEQUALITIES; POLICY	Introduction: Brazil and Colombia have pursued extensive reforms of their health care systems in the last couple of decades. The purported goals of such reforms were to improve access, increase efficiency and reduce health inequities. Notwithstanding their common goals, each country sought a very different pathway to achieve them. While Brazil attempted to reestablish a greater level of State control through a public national health system, Colombia embraced market competition under an employer-based social insurance scheme. This work thus aims to shed some light onto why they pursued divergent strategies and what that has meant in terms of health outcomes. Methods: A critical review of the literature concerning equity frameworks, as well as the health care reforms in Brazil and Colombia was conducted. Then, the shortfall inequality values of crude mortality rate, infant mortality rate, under-five mortality rate, and life expectancy for the period 1960-2005 were calculated for both countries. Subsequently, bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed and controlled for possibly confounding factors. Results: When controlling for the underlying historical time trend, both countries appear to have experienced a deceleration of the pace of improvements in the years following the reforms, for all the variables analyzed. In the case of Colombia, some of the previous gains in under-five mortality rate and crude mortality rate were, in fact, reversed. Conclusions: Neither reform seems to have had a decisive positive impact on the health outcomes analyzed for the defined time period of this research. This, in turn, may be a consequence of both internal characteristics of the respective reforms and external factors beyond the direct control of health reformers. Among the internal characteristics: underfunding, unbridled decentralization and inequitable access to care seem to have been the main constraints. Conversely, international economic adversities, high levels of rural and urban violence, along with entrenched income inequalities seem to have accounted for the highest burden among external factors.

In Alyne da Silva Pimentel v. Brazil, the first maternal death case decided by an international human rights body, it confirms that States have a human rights obligation to guarantee that all women, irrespective of their income or racial background, have access to timely, non-discriminatory, and appropriate maternal health services. In L.C. v. Peru, concerning a 13-year-old rape victim who was denied a therapeutic abortion and had an operation on her spine delayed that left her seriously disabled as a result, it established that the State should guarantee access to abortion when a woman's physical or mental health is in danger, decriminalise abortion when pregnancy results from rape or sexual abuse, review its restrictive interpretation of therapeutic abortion and establish a mechanism to ensure that reproductive rights are understood and observed in all health care facilities. Both cases affirm that accessible and good quality health services are vital to women's human rights and expand States' obligations in relation to these. They also affirm that States must ensure national accountability for sexual and reproductive health rights, and provide remedies and redress in the event of violations. And they reaffirm the importance of international human rights bodies as sources of accountability for sexual and reproductive rights violations, especially where national accountability is absent or ineffective.

Inequality in Human Resources for Health: Measurement Issues	GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article							PRACTITIONERS	This article discusses options to allow comparative analysis of inequalities in the distribution of health workers (HWs) across and within countries using a single summary measure of the distribution. Income inequality generally is measured across individuals, but inequalities in the dispersion of HWs must use geographical areas or population groupings as units of analysis. The article first shows how this change of observational unit creates a resolution problem for various inequality indices and then tests how sensitive a simple ratio measure of the distribution of HWs is to changes in resolution. This ratio of inequality is illustrated first with the global distribution of HWs and then with its distributions within Indonesia. The resolution problem is not solved through this new approach, and indicators of inequalities of access to HWs or health services more generally appear not to be comparable across countries. Investigating geographical inequalities over time in one setting is possible but only if the units of analysis remain the same over time.

J	Ambagtsheer, F; Weimar, W				Ambagtsheer, F.; Weimar, W.			A Criminological Perspective: Why Prohibition of Organ Trade Is Not Effective and How the Declaration of Istanbul Can Move Forward	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article						Declaration of Istanbul; prohibition; organ trade; organ trafficking; World Health Organization	TRANSPLANT TOURISM; KIDNEY-TRANSPLANTATION; DONORS	The Declaration of Istanbul is the first document that has been established by the international transplant community that defines and prohibits transplant commercialism and organ trafficking. Its Custodian Group has successfully led various countries to implement legislation against trafficking and commercialism. The question arises, however, whether efforts to prohibit organ trade are realistic and effective. The Declaration differentiates trafficking from commercialism, yet it does not mention how both acts should be approached by policy. Policies that address transplant commercialism work differently from policies that tackle organ trafficking. There is considerable room for improvement in the current prohibitive approach to commercialism and organ trafficking. The Custodian Group and World Health Organization (WHO) should address commercialism by encouraging the expansion of living donation in the same manner as they encourage deceased donation. Furthermore, the Custodian Group and the WHO can improve their strategy to combat organ trafficking by raising awareness for enforcement. To achieve a consistent and effective prohibition of trafficking, legislation and law enforcement must go hand in hand. Ideally, this can best be achieved by close collaboration between the medical field and (international) criminal justice agencies.

Among these, labour market regulations are of vital significance. In this study, we investigate the labour market regulations among low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and propose a labour market taxonomy to further understand population health in a global context. Methods: Using Gross National Product per capita, we classify 113 countries into either low-income (n = 71) or middle-income (n = 42) strata. Principal component analysis of three standardized indicators of labour market inequality and poverty is used to construct 2 factor scores. Factor score reliability is evaluated with Cronbach's alpha. Using these scores, we conduct a hierarchical cluster analysis to produce a labour market taxonomy, conduct zero-order correlations, and create box plots to test their associations with adult mortality, healthy life expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, under-5 mortality, and years of life lost to communicable and non-communicable diseases. Labour market and health data are retrieved from the International Labour Organization's Key Indicators of Labour Markets and World Health Organization's Statistical Information System. Results: Six labour market clusters emerged: Residual (n = 16), Emerging (n = 16), Informal (n = 10), PostCommunist (n = 18), Less Successful Informal (n = 22), and Insecure (n = 31). Primary findings indicate: (i) labour market poverty and population health is correlated in both LMICs; (ii) association between labour market inequality and health indicators is significant only in low-income countries; (iii) Emerging (e.g., East Asian and Eastern European countries) and Insecure (e.g., sub-Saharan African nations) clusters are the most advantaged and disadvantaged, respectively, with the remaining clusters experiencing levels of population health consistent with their labour market characteristics. Conclusions: The labour market regulations of LMICs appear to be important social determinant of population health. This study demonstrates the heuristic value of understanding the labour markets of LMICs and their health effects using exploratory taxonomy approaches.

Unfortunately, researchers and practitioners struggle with the complexity of predicting who volunteers. The authors ask whether a rough identification of older volunteers solely based on age is possible. The authors answer this question by means of structural equation modeling, analyzing international survey data. The findings show that the direct effect of age on the time older people spend volunteering is negligible. Moreover, the age patterns in volunteering created by retirement and declining health are weak. Those findings make age an unsuitable indicator for volunteering in later life. The authors recommend that voluntary organizations and policy makers use personal characteristics, such as health status, when defining their target groups for programs that encourage volunteering. In addition, researchers should not use an age group when referring to the third age, meaning the active and productive part of old age.

RESULTS: Younger and better off respondents were more likely to have a positive self-perceived health status. Having no chronic conditions, independence in performing daily living activities and lower level of depression were also associated with positive self-perceived health status. People living in the south of Spain showed a more negative self-perceived health status than those living in other regions. CONCLUSION: The study results point to health inequality among Spanish older adults of lower socioeconomic condition and living in the south of Spain. The analysis by geographic units allows for international cross-regional comparisons.

J	Isaksen, LW				Isaksen, Lise Widding			Transnational Spaces of Care: Migrant Nurses in Norway	SOCIAL POLITICS			English	Article								This article argues that international nurse recruitment from Latvia to Norway is not a winwin situation. The gains and losses of nurse migration are unevenly distributed between sender and receiver countries. On the basis of empirical research and interviews with Latvian nurses and families they left behind, this article argues that nurse migration transforms families and communities and that national health services now become global workplaces. Some decades ago feminist research pointed to the fact that the welfare state was based on a male breadwinner family and women's unpaid production of care work at home. Today this production of unpaid care is outsourced from richer to poorer countries and is related to an emergence of transnational spaces of care. International nurse recruitment and global nurse care chains in Norway increasingly provide the labor that prevents the new adult worker model and gender equality politics from being disrupted in times where families are overloaded with elder care loads.

Family practice doctors and public health professionals need to work with other sectors to establish comprehensive approaches to obesity reduction. This study compares the approaches of three cities with different health and political systems (Lisbon, London and New York City) to promoting effective action to decrease child obesity. Using a comparative case study approach, participant observers in three intersectoral municipal collaborative on child obesity describe their challenges and accomplishments. Municipal governments made child obesity a policy priority and coordinate efforts in different sectors. Public health provided relevant information on population characteristics and scientific evidence for decision-making, family practice monitored children's growth and assisted families to adopt healthy behaviors. These sectors, together with university-based researchers, also played an advocacy role, addressing inequalities, alerting the public and policy makers about damaging products or risky situations, and regulating private interests that threaten well-being, e.g., the food and beverage industry that promotes unhealthy products. Local, national and global networks of health providers, municipal agencies and researchers have helped to diagnose problems, coordinate action across sectors and levels, share and evaluate successes and failures, translate evidence into practice and promote social cohesion. These cities have developed common approaches and face similar challenges in reducing high rates of child obesity, suggesting that it may be possible for cities in different parts of the world to learn from each other and thus accelerate progress.

Methods: Data were collected from 102 mothers who had given birth to an infant with congenital syphilis at Dr. Ramon Madariaga Central Hospital (2005-2007) and 306 control mothers. Clinical and demographic information were collected from clinical records, and socioeconomic details were obtained by interview. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the relationships between congenital syphilis and clinical and socioeconomic factors. Results: Receiving the recommended number of prenatal health checks had a clear protective effect on congenital syphilis in the univariate analysis (odds ratio (OR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-0.86), as did being in a stable relationship (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.14-0.38). Furthermore, women with secondary education or above were over four-times less likely to have a child with congenital syphilis compared to women who had not completed primary school education, even after controlling for the number of prenatal health checks and other factors (adjusted OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.72). In addition, women with previous stillborn births were over three-times more likely to have a baby with congenital syphilis after controlling for education and prenatal care (adjusted OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.24-9.16). Conclusions: There is a clear opportunity for reducing the burden of congenital syphilis by promoting syphilis screening and treatment in women with previous stillborn births. In addition, the potential impact of more general policies addressing social determinants of health, such as those improving education, must not be overlooked.

This phenomenon includes such diverse processes as the greater mobility of capital, goods, and services, as well as increasing diffusion of ideas, technology, and norms. Given the ubiquitous and multi-faceted nature of globalization, we evaluate the effect of economic, social, and political global integration on a particularly important outcome - human well-being. Theoretically, we argue that globalization has a large number of different effects on human well-being, including multiple positive effects and multiple negative effects. Empirically, we analyze the impact of globalization on well-being using a pooled data set, including 132 countries over the time period 1970-2007. We find that, on balance, all three forms of globalization positively affect well-being.

Diet in phenylketonuria: A snapshot of special dietary costs and reimbursement systems in 10 international centers	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Phenylketonuria; Diet; Reimbursement; Cost	DRINK PROTEIN SUBSTITUTE; READY	Background and aims: To gather exploratory data on the costs and reimbursement of special dietary foods used in the management of phenylketonuria (PKU) from ten international specialist PKU centers. Methods: Experts from each center provided data on retail costs of the three most frequently used phenylalanine-free protein substitutes and low-protein foods at their center; reimbursement of protein substitutes and low-protein foods; and state monetary benefits provided to PKU patients. Results: The mean annual cost of protein substitutes across 4 age groups (2 y, 8 y, 15 y and adults) ranged from (sic)4273 to (sic)21,590 per patient. The cost of low-protein products also differed; the mean cost of low-protein bread varied from (sic)0.04 to (sic)1.60 per 100 kcal. All protein substitutes were either fully reimbursed or covered by health insurance. However, reimbursement for low-protein products varied and state benefits differed between centers. Conclusions: The variation in the cost and reimbursement of diet therapy and the level of additional state benefits for PKU patients demonstrates the large difference in expenditure on and access to PKU dietary products. This highlights the inequality between healthcare systems and access to special dietary products for people with PKU, ultimately leading to patients in some countries receiving better care than others.

That silence generates questions about health risks in the contexts of HIV/AIDS and international migration. Based on a qualitative study of mainland Chinese immigrants in Canada, this paper explores the impacts of immigration processes on sex and sexuality. The findings reveal a gap between these individuals' changing sexual behaviours and the continuing silence on sex. Although Canada has exposed them to a new living environment that has shaped the dynamics and patterns of their sexual practices, their incomplete integration into the host society and their close connections with China as the home country mean that traditional Chinese norms continue to influence their understanding of these changes. With the increasing openness of these immigrants' sexual relationships, the obsolescence of their consciousness and knowledge of sexuality should be addressed in order to reduce their vulnerability to sexual inequalities and consequent health risks.

Within this milieu, medical tourism is being promoted as a rational economic development strategy for some developing nations, and a makeshift solution to the escalating waiting lists and exorbitant costs of health care in developed nations. This paper explores the need to problematize medical tourism in order to move beyond one dimensional neoliberal discourses that have, to date, dominated the arena. In this problematization, the paper discusses a range of understandings and uses of the term medical tourism and situates it within the context of the neoliberal economic development of health care internationally. Drawing on theory from critical medical anthropology and health and human rights perspectives, the paper critically analyzes the assumed independence between the medical tourism industry and local populations facing critical health issues, where social, cultural and economic inequities are widening in terms of access, cost and quality of health care. Finally, medical tourism is examined in the local context of India, critiquing the increasingly indistinct roles played by government and private sectors, whilst linking these shifts to global market forces.

Glenn			HOW TO REGULATE MEDICAL TOURISM (AND WHY IT MATTERS FOR BIOETHICS)	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						bioethics; developing world bioethics; distributive justice; rights; India; international justice; patient	HEALTH; TRADE	A growing literature examines descriptive and normative questions about medical tourism such as: How does it operate? What are its effects? Are home country patients or their governments failing in moral duties by engaging in or permitting medical tourism? By contrast, much less has been written on the regulatory dimension: What might be done about medical tourism if we were convinced that it posed ethical issues and were motivated to act? I shall argue that this kind of regulatory analysis is essential for bioethical analysis of medical tourism. This article focuses on these regulatory questions more directly, evaluating available methods, restrictions, costs, and benefits of home and destination country unilateral regulatory moves. This article also discusses more briefly multilateral treaty and private sector responses.

J	Harper, S; McKinnon, B				Harper, Sam; McKinnon, Brittany			Global socioeconomic inequalities in tobacco use: internationally comparable estimates from the World Health Surveys	CANCER CAUSES & CONTROL			English	Article						Tobacco; Health inequalities; Socioeconomic position; Smoking; Low- and middle-income countries	RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; SMOKING; CANCER; CONSUMPTION; BENEFITS; TRENDS	To produce internationally comparable estimates of socioeconomic differences in tobacco exposure within low and middle-income countries. We used data from 50 countries that participated in the World Health Surveys in 2002-2003. We measured two aspects of smoking: current smoking prevalence and accumulated pack-years of smoking. We used an asset-based approach to estimate permanent income. We measured absolute inequalities, separately by gender, across the entire socioeconomic distribution by using the concentration index and summarized the results and explored heterogeneity by meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of current smoking was highest in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, and Europe, and lowest in Africa. Pack-years among current male smokers were highest in Europe. Wealthier men were generally less likely to be current smokers in all regions. However, there was substantial heterogeneity within each region, and in some countries (Georgia, Mexico, Mauritania) current smoking was greater among the more advantaged. Among currently smoking men socioeconomic differences for pack-years of smoking were generally much weaker than for smoking prevalence. Among women the concentration index in current smoking was largest and favored the poor in Europe (1.4, 95% CI 0.8, 2.1) but favored the rich in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. National income was generally not associated with the magnitude of socioeconomic gradients. In low and middle-income countries there is substantial between and within-region heterogeneity in socioeconomic inequality in tobacco exposure that is not explained by national income. Our results imply that the relationship between socioeconomic position and smoking in poorer countries is dynamic and may not reflect the historical pattern in wealthier countries.

Global inequalities in assessment of migrant and ethnic variations in health	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Ethnicity; Race; Migration; Inequalities; Global health; Research; Surveillance	RACE	This paper briefly recaps the role of migration in creating multi-ethnic societies, the main types of migration and/or ethnicity studies, and the power and potential of such studies. Next, the paper examines whether opportunities are being grasped globally, and whether information systems exist to grasp these opportunities. The paper concludes that there are massive global inequalities in the use of migration status and ethnicity as epidemiological variables, to the detriment of global health.

Visions for the 20th International Epidemiological Association's World Congress of Epidemiology (WCE 2014)	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						World Congress of Epidemiology; WCE2014; Building ties with North and South America; Epidemiology Congress		During August 17th-21st, 2014, the University of Alaska Anchorage, along with other local, state, and federal agencies throughout Alaska, will host the 20th International Epidemiological Association's (IEA) World Congress of Epidemiology (WCE 2014). The theme for this Congress is "Global Epidemiology in a Changing Environment: The Circumpolar Perspective." The changing environment includes the full range of environments that shape population health and health inequities from the physical to the social and economic. Our circumpolar perspective on these environments includes views on how political systems, work, immigration, Indigenous status, and gender relations and sexuality affect the global world and the health of its people. Suggestions and insights from the 3rd North American Congress of Epidemiology (2011) and the first-ever joint regional workshop co-organized by the IEA North American Region and the IEA Latin American and Caribbean Region held at the 19th IEA World Congress of Epidemiology (2011) have helped direct the focus for WCE 2014. Since the Arctic regions are feeling the effects of climate change first, we believe focusing on the emerging data on the health impacts of climate change throughout the world will be an important topic for this Congress. This will include a broad range of more traditional epidemiology areas such as infectious disease epidemiology, environmental epidemiology, health disparities, and surveillance and emergency preparedness. Addressing health inequities and promoting health equity is likewise a key concern of the Congress. This Congress will also host presentations on injury epidemiology, occupational health, infectious diseases, chronic diseases, maternal and child health, surveillance and field epidemiology, mental health, violence (from self-directed, e. g., suicide, to interpersonal to structural), psychoactive substance use (including tobacco), and measures of subjective health. Attention will be given to epidemiology's theoretical frameworks and emphasizing knowledge translation, from epidemiology to health systems, to policy, and to the broader public. We also plan to offer many hands-on workshops including practical uses of epidemiology to improve health systems and reduce health inequities within and between countries; the manner in which epidemiology can inform public health practice; the understanding and use of the Dictionary of Epidemiology; and many others.

The genesis and progression of cardiovascular disease is modulated by a complex interplay of genetic, physiological, social and economic circumstances. Increasingly the impact of racial, ethic, social and economic inequalities is identified as predictors of cardiovascular disease outcome. Despite important advances over the last 30 years in reducing age adjusted mortality from cardiovascular disease, it continues to represent a major social and economic burden nationally and internationally. Aim: This paper provides a critical review of the social issues impacting upon women in Australia. It also identifies areas for future interventions with a view to improving outcomes in women with cardiovascular disease. Method: The bibliographic databases; CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, were searched for relevant studies using the search terms 'women', 'cardiovascular disease', and 'socio-economic status'. Findings: While some gains have been made in reducing the risk factor profile and rates of death from cardiovascular disease, it is clear that gender, race and socioeconomic disparities persist. Conclusions: New approaches are required to improve health differentials for CVD, and reduce the impact of gender, racial, ethic, social and economic factors on health disparities.

To examine the relationship between migration and migrant remittances and health care utilization in Ecuador, and to identify any potential equalizing effects. Methods. Using data from the 2004 National Demographic and Maternal & Child Health Survey (ENDEMAIN), a multilevel multivariate analysis was conducted to assess the relationship of two migrant predictors (households with an international migrant; use of migrant remittances) with use of preventive care, number of curative visits, hospitalization, and use of antiparasitic medicines. Relevant predisposing, enabling, and need factors were included following Andersen's Model of Health Care Utilization Behavior. Interaction terms were included to assess the potential equalizing effects of migration and remittances by ethnicity, area of residence, and economic status. Results. Migrant predictors were strongly associated with use of antiparasitic medicines, and to a lesser extent, with curative visits, even after adjusting for various predisposing, enabling, and need factors. Interaction models showed that having an international migrant increased use of these services among low-income Ecuadorians (quintiles 1 and 2). No significant relationship was found between migrant predictors and use of preventive services. Conclusions. Migration and remittances seem to have an equalizing effect on access to antiparasitic medicines, and to a lesser extent, curative health care services. Health care reform efforts should take into account the scope of this effect when developing public policy.

STUDY DESIGN: We obtained data on the number of CSs performed in 137 countries in 2008. The consensus is that countries should achieve a 10% rate of CS; therefore, for countries that are below that rate, we calculated the cost to achieve a 10% rate. For countries with a CS rate of >15%, we calculated the savings that could be made by the achievement of a 15% rate. RESULTS: Fifty-four countries had CS rates of <10%, whereas 69 countries showed rates of >15%. The cost of the global saving by a reduction of CS rates to 15% was estimated to be $2.32 billion (US dollars); the cost to attain a 10% CS rate was $432 million (US dollars). CONCLUSION: CSs that are potentially medically unjustified appear to command a disproportionate share of global economic resources.

Health impact assessment: A comparison of 45 local, national, and international guidelines	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW			English	Article						Health impact assessment; Guidance; Techniques; Process; Equity; Health in all policy	CONSENSUS	This article provides a comparison of health impact assessment (HIA) guidelines from around the world and for multiple geographic scales. We identify commonalities and differences within HIA guides to discuss the plausibility of consensus guidelines and to inform guideline development The practice of HIA has grown over the last two decades with a concurrent growth of HIA guides. This study expands on earlier review work and includes guides published since 2007 (Mindell, Boltong and Forde, 2008). From April 2010 to October 2011, 45 HIA guides were identified through an internet search and review of previous research. Common characteristics, key features, and the HIA process were analyzed. The 45 documents recommended similar but not identical processes for conducting HIAs. These analyses suggest that guidelines for HIAs are similar in many areas of the world and that new HIA practitioners can use these findings to inform their approach. Further discussion is needed to determine if the approaches established in these guidelines are followed and if one set of common guidelines could be written for use in numerous countries and regions.

J	Mladovsky, P; Rechel, B; Ingleby, D; McKee, M				Mladovsky, Philipa; Rechel, Bernd; Ingleby, David; McKee, Martin			Responding to diversity: An exploratory study of migrant health policies in Europe	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Migrants; Immigrants; Ethnic groups; Health inequalities; Access to health care	NETHERLANDS; CARE	There has been growing international attention to migrant health, reflecting recognition of the need for health systems to adapt to increasingly diverse populations. However, reports from health policy experts in 25 European countries suggest that by 2009 only eleven countries had established national policies to improve migrant health that go beyond migrants' statutory or legal entitlement to care. The objective of this paper is to compare and contrast the content of these policies and analyse their strengths and limitations. The analysis suggests that most of the national policies target either migrants or more established ethnic minorities. Countries should address the diverse needs of both groups and could learn from "intercultural" health care policies in Ireland and, in the past, the Netherlands. Policies in several countries prioritise specific diseases or conditions, but these differ and it is not clear whether they accurately reflect real differences in need among countries. Policy initiatives typically involve training health workers, providing interpreter services and/or 'cultural mediators', adapting organizational culture, improving data collection and providing information to migrants on health problems and services. A few countries stand out for their quest to increase migrants' health literacy and their participation in the development and implementation of policy. Progressive migrant health policies are not always sustainable as they can be undermined or even reversed when political contexts change. The analysis of migrant health policies in Europe is still in its infancy and there is an urgent need to monitor the implementation and evaluate the effectiveness of these diverse policies.

Burden of disease, health indicators and challenges for epidemiology in North America	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						North American region; burden of disease; health indicators; epidemiology	DISPARITIES; DISCRIMINATION; CANADIANS; MORTALITY; FUTURE; CANCER; RACISM	Background Commissioned by the International Epidemiological Association, this article is part of a series on burden of disease, health indicators and the challenges faced by epidemiologists in bringing their discoveries to provide equitable benefit to the populations in their regions and globally. This report covers the health status and epidemiological capacity in the North American region ( USA and Canada). Methods We assessed data from country-specific sources to identify health priorities and areas of greatest need for modifiable risk factors. We examined inequalities in health as a function of social deprivation. We also reviewed information on epidemiological capacity building and scientific contributions by epidemiologists in the region. Findings The USA and Canada enjoy technologically advanced healthcare systems that, in principle, prioritize preventive services. Both countries experience a life expectancy at birth that is higher than the global mean. Health indicator measures are consistently worse in the USA than in Canada for many outcomes, although typically by only marginal amounts. Socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities in indicators exist for many diseases and risk factors in the USA. To a lesser extent, these social inequalities also exist in Canada, particularly among the Aboriginal populations. Epidemiology is a well-established discipline in the region, with many degree-granting schools, societies and job opportunities in the public and private sectors. North American epidemiologists have made important contributions in disease control and prevention and provide nearly a third of the global scientific output via published papers. Conclusions Critical challenges for North American epidemiologists include social determinants of disease distribution and the underlying inequalities in access to and benefit from preventive services and healthcare, particularly in the USA. The gains in life expectancy also underscore the need for research on health promotion and prevention of disease and disability in older adults. The diversity in epidemiological subspecialties poses new challenges in training and accreditation and has occurred in parallel with a decrease in research funding.

It integrates the series commissioned by the International Epidemiological Association to all WHO Regions to identify global opportunities to promote the development of epidemiology. Methods Health situations of the regions were analysed based on published data on selected mortality, morbidity and risk factors. Epidemiological publication output by country was estimated by Medline bibliometrics. Internet and literature searches and data provided by key informants were used to describe perspectives on epidemiological training, research and funding. Findings Despite important advances in recent decades, LAC remains the world's most unequal region. In 2010, 10% of the LAC's people still lived in conditions of multidimensional poverty, with huge variation among countries. The region has experienced fast and complex epidemiological changes in past decades, combining increasing rates of non-communicable diseases and injuries, and keeping uncontrolled many existing endemic and emerging diseases. Overall, epidemiological publications per year increased from 160 articles between 1961 and 1970 to 2492 between 2001 and 2010. The increase in papers per million inhabitants in the past three decades varied from 57% in Panama to 1339% in Paraguay. Universities are the main epidemiological training providers. There are at least 34 universities and other institutions in the region that offer postgraduate programmes at the master's and doctoral levels in epidemiology or public health. Most LAC countries rely largely on external funding and donors to initiate and sustain long-term research efforts. Despite the limited resources, the critical mass of LAC researchers has produced significant scientific contributions. Future needs The health research panorama of the region shows enormous regional discrepancies, but great prospects. Improving research and human resources capacity in the region will require establishing research partnerships within and outside the region, between rich and poor countries, promoting collaborations between LAC research institutions and universities to boost postgraduate programmes and aligning research investments and outputs with the current burden of disease.

J	Govender, V; Mooney, G				Govender, Veloshnee; Mooney, Gavin			People's policies for the health of the poor globally	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						globalisation; global institutions; communitarianism; global health; poor	GOVERNANCE; EQUITY	In this paper, we argue that the dominant role played by governments of the developed countries in global health policies is a critical but often an ignored factor in contributing to the lack of progress in global health. The solution to this challenge lies in efforts to democratise global decision making and to argue for a greater say of the poor globally in policies affecting them. Although there are potentially many ways to achieve this, the paper proposes communitarian claims as one way to have the voice of people globally involved and to make decisions about how best to allocate resources globally. It is argued that such claims can be advanced at a practical level through citizens juries' as evident from the experience in Australia. That experience and with increasing evidence from elsewhere, there is a strong indication from communities of desires for a very different set of values to underpin healthcare than the Australian and other governments, in partnership with global institutions, deliver.

Wastewater irrigation and environmental health: Implications for water governance and public policy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Climate change; Carbon credits; Global change; Urbanization; Poverty; Sustainability	HEAVY-METALS; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; FRESH-WATER; REUSE; SOIL; QUALITY; EFFLUENT; LAND; FISH	Climate change is a large-scale and emerging environmental risk. It challenges environmental health and the sustainability of global development. Wastewater irrigation can make a sterling contribution to reducing water demand, recycling nutrients, improving soil health and cutting the amount of pollutants discharged into the waterways. However, the resource must be carefully managed to protect the environment and public health. Actions promoting wastewater reuse are every where, yet the frameworks for the protection of human health and the environment are lacking in most developing countries. Global change drivers including climate change, population growth, urbanization, income growth, improvements in living standard, industrialization, and energy intensive lifestyle will all heighten water management challenges. Slowing productivity growth, falling investment in irrigation, loss of biodiversity, risks to public health, environmental health issues such as soil salinity, land degradation, land cover change and water quality issues add an additional layer of complexity. Against this backdrop, the potential for wastewater irrigation and its benefits and risks are examined. These include crop productivity, aquaculture, soil health, groundwater quality, environmental health, public health, infrastructure constraints, social concerns and risks, property values, social equity, and poverty reduction. It is argued that, wastewater reuse and nutrient capture can contribute towards climate change adaptation and mitigation. Benefits such as avoided freshwater pumping and energy savings, fertilizer savings, phosphorous capture and prevention of mineral fertilizer extraction from mines can reduce carbon footprint and earn carbon credits. Wastewater reuse in agriculture reduces the water footprint of food production on the environment; it also entails activities such as higher crop yields and changes in cropping patterns, which also reduce carbon footprint. However, there is a need to better integrate water reuse into core water governance frameworks in order to effectively address the challenges and harness the potential of this vital resource for environmental health protection. The paper also presents a blueprint for future water governance and public policies for the protection of environmental health. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

The future of inter-country adoption: a paradigm shift for this century The only existing international framework for inter-country adoption (ICA) is a legal one. Current legal and welfare approaches have limitations in that ICA tends to be conceptualised in individualistic terms, while strategies that prevent ICA by strengthening communities and addressing structural inequalities in the first instance are neglected and divorced from ICA practice. A vision and an overarching framework based on a socioecological approach that informs other arenas, such as health promotion, are proposed. The article concludes that the development of collaborative, intersectoral approaches, the reorientation of public and private resources and international leadership from academics, legislators, policy makers, practitioners and communities are necessary for a paradigm shift for this century.

Knowledge of existing disparities in stroke risk is important for effective stroke prevention and management strategies. This review updates the evidence for associations between socioeconomic status and stroke. Summary of Review-Studies were identified with electronic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (January 2006 to July 2011) and reference lists from identified studies were searched manually. Articles reporting the association between any measure of socioeconomic status and stroke were included. Conclusions-The impact of stroke as measured by disability-adjusted life-years lost and mortality rates is >3-fold higher in low-income compared with high-and middle-income countries. The number of stroke deaths is projected to increase by >30% in the next 20 years with the majority occurring in low-income countries. Higher incidence of stroke, stroke risk factors, and rates of stroke mortality are generally observed in low compared with high socioeconomic groups within and between populations worldwide. There is less available evidence of an association between socioeconomic status and stroke recurrence or temporal trends in inequalities. Those with a lower socioeconomic status have more severe deficits and are less likely to receive evidence-based stroke services, although the results are inconsistent. Poorer people within a population and poorer countries globally are most affected in terms of incidence and poor outcomes of stroke. Innovative prevention strategies targeting people in low socioeconomic groups are required along with effective measures to promote access to effective stroke interventions worldwide.

We interpret this at a minimum as people's right to a decent living standard, which gives rise to claims by countries to an exemption from mitigation for the energy and emissions needed to provide a decent life to all. We elaborate a conceptual framework for a comprehensive quantification of such an energy requirement, including the energy required to build out infrastructure to support these living standards. We interpret decent living as the consumption by households of a set of basic goods including adequate nutrition, shelter, health care, education, transport, refrigeration, television and mobile phones. We develop universal indicators for these activities and their infrastructure requirements, and specify a methodology to convert these to energy requirements using energy input-output analysis. Our main recommendations include estimating bottom-up, country-specific energy and emissions requirements, incorporating a minimum for methane emissions, and using international benchmarks at the sector level to encourage the reduction of countries' energy and emissions intensity.

Introduction of vaccines against pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type b (the most important causes of severe pneumonia in young children), increasing resistance to antibiotics, and changes in HIV prevalence will likely change patterns of pneumonia etiology in developing countries. Studies such as Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) that take advantage of new diagnostic technologies are needed to provide an updated and more precise description of the microbial causes of pneumonia and to inform decisions around treatment algorithms and vaccine development and introduction. In recognition of its importance for global health and especially its significance as an ongoing cause of gross inequity in risks, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has made pneumonia an important part of its global health strategy and PERCH a centerpiece of its Pneumonia Program.

Integrating tobacco control into health and development agendas	TOBACCO CONTROL			English	Article							CIGARETTE-SMOKING; SMOKELESS TOBACCO; RISK-FACTOR; DISEASE; INDIA; MORTALITY; BURDEN	Tobacco use is one of the major risk factors for non-communicable diseases, with a profound impact on resource-poor low-income and middle-income countries such as India, where tobacco use is high and where socioeconomic as well as health inequalities are rampant. Effective implementation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control requires multisectoral efforts that can fructify through integration of tobacco control into broader health and development agendas such as food and water security, environment, the right to education and human rights. The global tobacco control community will need to explore innovative partnerships beyond its traditional confines and build a global coalition that supports tobacco control by partnering with others having convergent concerns on common determinants. A firm political commitment and intersectoral coordination between government and non-government agencies is paramount in order to implement effective tobacco control programmes. Integration of tobacco control into other health and development agendas as described in this paper has the potential to contribute to the achievement of all the eight United Nations Millennium Development Goals. This paper explores why the whole of government should accord a high priority to tobacco control, and how this integration could be achieved.	[Reddy, K.

Wilkinson et al. and Schnell et al.); however, the reasons for inequality and the interactions of the underlying causes of inequality at the level of the world economy have not yet been properly explored in this kind of literature. The aim of this article is to provide a new, globalization-oriented, multi-disciplinary perspective on life expectancy, under-five mortality, inequality and socio-economic development in the world system, compatible with the advances in international sociological research on the subject over the last three decades. Design: Taking up the traditions of quantitative sociology to study the effects of multinational corporation (MNC) penetration as a key determining variable for development outcomes such as socio-economic inequality and infant mortality, this article analyzes from the perspective of quantitative political science and economics this particular role of MNC penetration as the key variable for the determination of health, inequality and socioeconomic development in 183 countries of the world system, using international social science standard data. Main outcomes: As correctly predicted by quantitative sociology, but largely overlooked by the medical profession, the development style, implied by a high MNC penetration of their host countries, reflects the oligopolistic power, which transnational corporations wield over local economies. We took up an idea from Austro-American economist Joseph Alois Schumpeter (1883-1950), which states that the long-term effects of oligopolistic power are negative and lead toward economic and social stagnation. Our data show that although MNC penetration indeed led to certain short-term growth effects after 1990, today, social polarization and stagnation increase as a consequence of the development model, based on high MNC penetration. There is a negative trade-off between MNC penetration and health, both in terms of life expectancy and avoiding under-five mortality. But it can be shown for the 115 countries with complete data that Richard G. Wilkinson's hypothesis still plays an important role in explaining deficient health development in the world system, once we control for the effects of MNC penetration-driven globalization.

However, the structure of the urban environment is also of importance in dictating the existence of extremely variable traffic pollutant levels, which often tend to be linked with social disparities. Nevertheless 'Environmental Justice' studies have rarely tackled the adverse health implications of exposures from mobile sources (Chakraborty, 2009), or have applied statistical techniques that are appropriate for such spatial data (Gilbert and Chalcraborty, 2011). This article addresses these gaps by spatially examining the distribution of respiratory hospitalisation incidents of children aged 0-15 years in relation to social circumstances and residential exposures of annual PK road-transport emissions within Leicester during 2000-09. Continuing upon the theme of 'Environmental Justice', the research explores the intra-urban spatial distribution of those who produce and residentially experience the majority of road-transport emissions. The findings indicate significant global relationships to exist between children's hospitalisation rates and social-economic-status, ethnic minorities, and PM10 road-transport emissions within Leicester. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) identified important localised variations within the dataset, specifically relating to a double-burden of residentially experienced road-transport emissions and deprivation effecting inner city children's respiratory health. Furthermore, affluent intra-urban communities tended to contribute the highest levels of emission from private transport, while residentially experiencing relatively low exposure of transport emissions, This would suggest that environmental injustices prevail across the model British multicultural city of Leicester.

The aim of this article is to define the indicators of the social determinants of health, which is important for better planning and policy-making. Method: data was gathered through the comparative analysis of different sources of socioeconomic indicators, which are presented schematically, ranked in the structural field and analysed from the perspective of their impact on health. Results: Indicators are divided into ten different fields that present a socioeconomic determinant of health. The fields are: material deprivation (including income and other material items necessary for everyday living), followed by social capital, (un)employment, housing and homelessness, education and profession, living environment, health, crime and safely, accessibility and ethnicity. The table includes 100 indicators that are used in various states for planning and policy-making. The extent and diversity of the indicators shows the complexity of the social determinants of health, which are often overlooked or are insufficiently understood. Conclusion: Poverty is a structural problem with an important impact on health. Because living in poverty is a specific way of life, ways of tackling the problem of poverty are also specific. They have to include relations of power, the accessibility of resources and opportunities to escape from the poverty. Health plays an important role in that but it depends on the capabilities and readiness of the states to ensure this for all people regardless of their social status, material wealth or other circumstances. The list of indicators can contribute to achieving that goal.

J	El-Sayed, AM; Tracy, M; Scarborough, P; Galea, S				El-Sayed, Abdulrahman M.; Tracy, Melissa; Scarborough, Peter; Galea, Sandro			Ethnic Inequalities in Mortality: The Case of Arab-Americans	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RISK-FACTORS; EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH; ACCULTURATIVE STRESS; BIRTH-OUTCOMES; UNITED-STATES; SOCIAL-CLASS; MENTAL-HEALTH; PRETERM BIRTH; GLOBAL BURDEN; SEPTEMBER 11	Background: Although nearly 112 million residents of the United States belong to a non-white ethnic group, the literature about differences in health indicators across ethnic groups is limited almost exclusively to Hispanics. Features of the social experience of many ethnic groups including immigration, discrimination, and acculturation may plausibly influence mortality risk. We explored life expectancy and age-adjusted mortality risk of Arab-Americans (AAs), relative to non-Arab and non-Hispanic Whites in Michigan, the state with the largest per capita population of AAs in the US. Methodology/Principal Findings: Data were collected about all deaths to AAs and non-Arab and non-Hispanic Whites in Michigan between 1990 and 2007, and year 2000 census data were collected for population denominators. We calculated life expectancy, age-adjusted all-cause, cause-specific, and age-specific mortality rates stratified by ethnicity and gender among AAs and non-Arab and non-Hispanic Whites. Among AAs, life expectancies among men and women were 2.0 and 1.4 years lower than among non-Arab and non-Hispanic White men and women, respectively. AA men had higher mortality than non-Arab and non-Hispanic White men due to infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and homicide. AA women had higher mortality than non-Arab and non-Hispanic White women due to chronic diseases. Conclusions/Significance: Despite better education and higher income, AAs have higher age-adjusted mortality risk than non-Arab and non-Hispanic Whites, particularly due to chronic diseases. Features specific to AA culture may explain some of these findings.

Inclusion and Exclusion in Nutrigenetics Clinical Research: Ethical and Scientific Challenges	JOURNAL OF NUTRIGENETICS AND NUTRIGENOMICS			English	Article						Ethics; Inclusion; Exclusion; Eligibility; Representativeness; Justice; External validity; Ethnicity; Age	PUBLISHING NUTRITION RESEARCH; FOOD FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; DIETARY ASSESSMENT; EXTERNAL VALIDITY; GENOMIC MEDICINE; GENETIC ANCESTRY; INFORMED-CONSENT	Background/Aims: There are compelling reasons to ensure the participation of ethnic minorities and populations of all ages worldwide in nutrigenetics clinical research. If findings in such research are valid for some individuals, groups, or communities, and not for others, then ethical questions of justice - and not only issues of methodology and external validity - arise. This paper aims to examine inclusion in nutrigenetics clinical research and its scientific and ethical challenges. Methods: In total, 173 publications were identified through a systematic review of clinical studies in nutrigenetics published between 1998 and 2007. Data such as participants' demographics as well as eligibility criteria were extracted. Results: There is no consistency in the way participants' origins (ancestry, ethnicity, or race) and ages are described in publications. A vast majority of the studies identified was conducted in North America and Europe and focused on 'white' participants. Our results show that pregnant women (and fetuses), minors, and the elderly (>= 75 years old) remain underrepresented. Conclusion: Representativeness in nutrigenetics research is a challenging ethical and scientific issue. Yet, if nutrigenetics is to benefit whole populations and be used in public and global health agendas, fair representation as well as clear descriptions of participants in publications are crucial.

We aimed to develop and apply a robust systematic method for monitoring the epidemiology of serious infectious diseases. Methods We did a national epidemiological study with all hospital admissions for infectious and non-infectious diseases in New Zealand from 1989 to 2008, to investigate trends in incidence and distribution by ethnic group and socioeconomic status. We extended a recoding system based on the ninth revision of international classification of diseases (ICD-9) to the tenth revision (ICD-10), and applied this to data for hospital admissions from the New Zealand Ministry of Health, National Minimum Dataset. We filtered results to account for changes in health-care practices over time. Acute overnight admissions were the events of interest. Findings Infectious diseases made the largest contribution to hospital admissions of any cause. Their contribution increased from 20.5% of acute admissions in 1989-93, to 26.6% in 2004-08. We noted clear ethnic and social inequalities in infectious disease risk. In 2004-08, the age-standardised rate ratio was 2.15 (95% CI 2.14-2.16) for Maori (indigenous New Zealanders) and 2.35 (2.34-2.37) for Pacific peoples compared with the European and other group. The ratio was 2.81 (2.80-2.83) for the most socioeconomically deprived quintile compared with the least deprived quintile. These inequalities have increased substantially in the past 20 years, particularly for Maori and Pacific peoples in the most deprived quintile. Interpretation These findings support the need for stronger prevention efforts for infectious diseases, and reinforce the need to reduce ethnic and social inequalities and to address disparities in broad social determinants such as income levels, housing conditions, and access to health services. Our method could be adapted for infectious disease surveillance in other countries.

In order to improve health access for the urban poor, the Ministry of Health developed a "Reaching Every District" strategy (RED strategy) to deliver an integrated package of key health and social services. The aim of this article is to present findings of an assessment of the implementation of the RED strategy, and, on the basis of this assessment, articulate lessons learned for equitable urban health planning. Methods: Principal methods for data collection and analysis included literature review, barrier analysis of health access and in-depth interviews and group discussions with health managers and providers. Findings: The main barriers to health access for the urban poor relate to interacting effects of poverty, unhealthy daily living environments, social vulnerability and isolation. Implementation of the RED strategy has resulted in increased health access for the urban poor, as demonstrated by health staff having reached new clients with immunization, family planning and ante-natal care services, and increased civil registrations which enable social service provision. Organizational effects have included improved partnerships for health and increased motivation of the health workforce. Important lessons learned from the early implementation of the RED strategy include the need to form strong partnerships among stakeholders at each level of the health system and in the community, as well as the need to develop a specific financing strategy to address the needs of the very poor. The diverse social context for health in an urban poor setting calls for a decentralized planning and partnership strategy, but with central level commitment towards policy guidance and financing of pro-poor urban health strategies. Conclusions: Lessons from Mongolia mirror other international studies which point to the need to measure and take action on the social determinants of health at the local area level in order to adequately reduce persistent inequities in health care access for the urban poor.

J	Wall, LL				Wall, L. Lewis			Preventing Obstetric Fistulas in Low-Resource Countries: Insights From a Haddon Matrix	OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY			English	Article							REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; VESICOVAGINAL FISTULAS; OBSTRUCTED LABOR; NORTHERN NIGERIA; POOR COUNTRIES; HEALTH; STRATEGIES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CONSEQUENCES	An obstetric fistula is classically regarded as an "accident of childbirth" in which prolonged obstructed labor leads to destruction of the vesicovaginal/rectovaginal septum with consequent loss of urinary and/or fecal control. Obstetric fistula is highly stigmatizing and afflicted women often become social outcasts. Although obstetric fistula has been eliminated from advanced industrialized nations, it remains a major public health problem in the world's poorest countries. Several million cases of obstetric fistula are currently thought to exist in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Although techniques for the surgical repair of such injuries are well known, it is less clear which strategies effectively prevent fistulas, largely because of the complex interactions among medical, social, economic, and environmental factors present in those countries where fistulas are prevalent. This article uses the Haddon matrix, a standard tool for injury analysis, to examine the factors influencing obstetric fistula formation in low-resource countries. Construction of a Haddon matrix provides a "wide angle" overview of this tragic clinical problem. The resulting analysis suggests that the most effective short-term strategies for obstetric fistula prevention will involve enhanced surveillance of labor, improved access to emergency obstetric services (particularly cesarean delivery), competent medical care for women both during and after obstructed labor, and the development of specialist fistula centers to treat injured women where fistula prevalence is high. The long-term strategies to eradicate obstetric fistula must include universal access to emergency obstetric care, improved access to family planning services, increased education for girls and women, community economic development, and enhanced gender equity. Successful eradication of the obstetric fistula will require the mobilization of sufficient political will at both the international and individual country levels to ensure that adequate resources are devoted to this problem and that maternal health becomes a high priority on national political agendas. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists and Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After participating in this CME activity, physicians should be better able to apply the Haddon matrix, a tool commonly used for injury analysis, to the field of obstetrics and gynecology; analyze the problem of obstructed labor and obstetric fistula formation in low-resource countries using the Haddon matrix, and implement possible strategies for the prevention of obstetric fistulas and the mitigation of harm in cases of obstructed labor that arise from the use of the Haddon matrix.

Examining the Lack of Legal Remedies for Environmental Damage in the 2006 Lebanon-Israel War	ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE			English	Article						Lebanon; Israel; environmental damage; settlement schemes; dispute; compensation	OIL POLLUTION DAMAGE; INTERNATIONAL COURT; DEPLETED URANIUM; COMPENSATION; CONSEQUENCES; MANAGEMENT; LIABILITY; JUSTICE; WARTIME; HEALTH	The principle of polluter pays is fundamental to environmental law. However, the principle becomes problematic in the case of environmental damage caused during conflict. The international community acknowledges that reparation should be forthcoming, but it is not clear in every case how compensation should be funded. Compensation related to environmental damage caused by military intervention has been settled by either diplomacy or political means. In the summer of 2006 Israel entered into a conflict with Lebanon that had substantial environmental impacts, including a major oil spill on the Lebanese coast and forest fires in Israel. The situation is complex because, although the Israeli attacks were sanctioned by the Israeli state, the Hezbollah actions were carried out independently of the Lebanese government. We analyze the different settlement schemes available and their applicability in such a case. The analysis is framed by the three main methods of international dispute settlement between conflicting parties. The paper concludes that the only way to claim compensation would be through unilateral recourse to the United Nations Security Council. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

J	Zhou, ZL; Gao, JM; Zhou, ZY; Yang, XW				Zhou, Zhongliang; Gao, Jianmin; Zhou, Zhiying; Yang, Xiaowei			Measuring the Benefit Equity in China's Basic Health Insurance Schemes	HEALTHMED			English	Article						UEHI; URHI; NCMS; the equity of benefit rate; the equity of benefit degree; horizontal index of inequity	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; CARE; DELIVERY	Background: Although the health insurance has nearly achieved universal coverage in China, the co-payment ratio is still very high. Therefore, it is doubtful that the insured could get equitable benefit from the health insurance schemes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit equity which the insured residents with different economic levels get from the Urban Employee basic Health Insurance (UEHI), the Urban Resident basic Health Insurance (URHI) and the New rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), respectively. Methods: The data were from the household survey in Mei County, Shannxi Province, in which the number of the urban employees, the urban residents and the rural residents used in this study were 1258, 733 and 2870 respectively. The benefit equity was measured by the equity of benefit rate and the equity of benefit degree in health insurance scheme. By subtracting the concentration index of health care need from the concentration index of benefit rate/degree, the horizontal index of inequity of benefit rate/degree were generated. Results: There were pro-rich horizontal inequities of benefit rate in UEHI, RUHI and NCMS, and the horizontal indexes of inequity of benefit rate were 0.061, 0.122 and 0.161, respectively. In terms of the benefit degree, the horizontal indexes of inequity of benefit degree for the residents covered by UEHI, URHI and NCMS were 0.027, -0.187 and 0.178 respectively, which means both the inequity of benefit degree in UEHI and NCMS were pro-rich and the inequity of benefit degree in URHI was pro-poor. Conclusion: When the insured with different economic levels have the same health care need, the number of the rich who can get benefit from UEHI, URHI and NCMS is more than the poor; meanwhile the rich can get more compensation from the UEHI and NCMS than the poor.

The objective of this study is to examine the role of social determinants on current tobacco use in thirteen low-and-middle income countries. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used nationally representative data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) conducted during 2008-2010 in 13 low-and-middle income countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russian Federation, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, and Viet Nam. These surveys provided information on 209,027 respondent's aged 15 years and above and the country datasets were analyzed individually for estimating current tobacco use across various socio-demographic factors (gender, age, place of residence, education, wealth index, and knowledge on harmful effects of smoking). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to predict the impact of these determinants on current tobacco use status. Current tobacco use was defined as current smoking or use of smokeless tobacco, either daily or occasionally. Former smokers were excluded from the analysis. Adjusted odds ratios for current tobacco use after controlling other cofactors, was significantly higher for males across all countries and for urban areas in eight of the 13 countries. For educational level, the trend was significant in Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Philippines and Thailand demonstrating decreasing prevalence of tobacco use with increasing levels of education. For wealth index, the trend of decreasing prevalence of tobacco use with increasing wealth was significant for Bangladesh, India, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay and Viet Nam. The trend of decreasing prevalence with increasing levels of knowledge on harmful effects of smoking was significant in China, India, Philippines, Poland, Russian Federation, Thailand, Ukraine and Viet Nam. Conclusions/Significance: These findings demonstrate a significant but varied role of social determinants on current tobacco use within and across countries.

Once a weapon of the weak, informally learned by male slaves on the streets and outlawed by Brazilian authorities, capoeira today is taught to men, women, and children in schools, health clubs, dance studios, and community centers throughout Brazil and around the world. Accompanying the global commodification and consumption of capoeira as an exotic, hip, multicultural activity is a trend within Brazil to professionalize its teaching. Recent debates around the institutionalization of capoeira offer a revealing window onto the contradictions of nationalism, citizenship, and democracy in Brazil. While the increased emphasis on pedagogy and professionalism is transforming the actual "play" of capoeira, the practice remains, albeit in new ways, a mobilizing agent in the struggle against social inequalities and uneven citizenship in Brazil.

BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH			English	Article							MATERNAL MORTALITY; CHILD HEALTH; SURVIVAL; NEWBORN; COUNTDOWN; COVERAGE; EQUITY	Background: The fifth Millennium Development Goal target for 90% of births in low and middle income countries to have a skilled birth attendant (SBA) by 2015 will not be met. In response to this, policy has focused on increasing SBA access. However, reducing maternal mortality also requires policies to prevent deaths among women giving birth unattended. We aimed to generate estimates of the absolute number of non SBA births between 2011 and 2015 in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, given optimistic assumptions of future trends in SBA attendance. These estimates could be used by decision makers to inform the extent to which reductions in maternal mortality will depend on policies aimed specifically at those women giving birth unattended. Methods: For each country within South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa we estimated recent trends in SBA attendance and used these as the basis for three increasingly optimistic projections for future changes in SBA attendance. For each country we obtained estimates for the current SBA attendance in rural and urban settings and forecasts for the number of births and changes in rural/urban population over 2011-2015. Based on these, we calculated estimates for the number of non-SBA births for 2011-2015 under a variety of scenarios. Results: Conservative estimates are that there will be between 130 and 180 million non-SBA births in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa from 2011 to 2015 (90% of these in rural areas). Currently, there are more non-SBA births per year in South Asia than sub-Saharan Africa, but our projections suggest that the regions will have approximately the same number of non-SBA births by 2015. We also present results for each of the six countries currently accounting for more than 50% of global maternal deaths. Conclusions: Over the next five years, many millions of women within South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa will give birth without an SBA. Efforts to improve access to skilled attendance should be accompanied by interventions to improve the safety of non-attended deliveries.

BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article							RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH; CHILD DEATHS; POLICY; SCIENCE; COMMERCIALIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; PRIORITIES	International collaborative health research is justifiably expected to help reduce global health inequities. Investment in health policy and systems research in developing countries is essential to this process but, currently, funding for international research is mainly channelled towards the development of new medical interventions. This imbalance is largely due to research legislation and policies used in high-income countries. These policies have increasingly led these countries to invest in health research aimed at boosting national economic competitiveness rather than reducing health inequities. In the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the regulation of research has encouraged a model that: leads to products that can be commercialized; targets health needs that can be met by profitable, high-technology products; has the licensing of new products as its endpoint; and does not entail significant research capacity strengthening in other countries. Accordingly, investment in international research is directed towards pharmaceutical trials and product development public-private partnerships for neglected diseases. This diverts funding away from research that is needed to implement existing interventions and to strengthen health systems, i.e. health policy and systems research. Governments must restructure their research laws and policies to increase this essential research in developing countries.

J	London, L; Schneider, H				London, Leslie; Schneider, Helen			Globalisation and health inequalities: Can a human rights paradigm create space for civil society action?	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Human rights; Agency; Globalisation; Civil society; State; Accountability; Health inequalities; Southern Africa; Neoliberalism	SOUTH-AFRICA; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; DISEASES; EQUITY; POLICY; AIDS	While neoliberal globalisation is associated with increasing inequalities, global integration has simultaneously strengthened the dissemination of human rights discourse across the world. This paper explores the seeming contradiction that globalisation is conceived as disempowering nations states' ability to act in their population's interests, yet implementation of human rights obligations requires effective states to deliver socio-economic entitlements, such as health. Central to the actions required of the state to build a health system based on a human rights approach is the notion of accountability. Two case studies are used to explore the constraints on states meeting their human rights obligations regarding health, the first drawing on data from interviews with parliamentarians responsible for health in East and Southern Africa, and the second reflecting on the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa. The case studies illustrate the importance of a human rights paradigm in strengthening parliamentary oversight over the executive in ways that prioritise pro-poor protections and in increasing leverage for resources for the health sector within parliamentary processes. Further, a rights framework creates the space for civil society action to engage with the legislature to hold public officials accountable and confirms the importance of rights as enabling civil society mobilization, reinforcing community agency to advance health rights for poor communities. In this context, critical assessment of state incapacity to meet claims to health rights raises questions as to the diffusion of accountability rife under modern international aid systems. Such diffusion of accountability opens the door to 'cunning' states to deflect rights claims of their populations. We argue that human rights, as both a normative framework for legal challenges and as a means to create room for active civil society engagement provide a means to contest both the real and the purported constraints imposed by globalisation.

This alternative consumer approach distinctively integrates health with development, social justice and environmental issues. It has not always explicitly employed rights language, but consumer activism fits with rights-based approaches, emphasising entitlements, accountability and participation. This case-study traces the development of networked consumer campaigns to contest and shape global health governance. It highlights the important, yet under-researched role of Southern nodes within global networks mobilizing health rights and public health. Alternative consumer activism reinterprets the consumer as a countervailing force, collectively mobilizing citizens to claim their health rights. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This case study of formal and informal health care provision for Bedouin in North East Jordan is based on interviews conducted in 2007-2008 involving clinic providers, policymakers and Bedouin as part of an EC funded study from 2006 to 2010. The paper explores to what extent the right to health as set out in UN General Comment 14 (on Article 12 and 12.2 of the International Covenant on Social Economic and Cultural Rights on the right to health) can provide a framework for considering the availability, accessibility and acceptability of current provision in a rural setting in Jordan. Health care is provided in the public sector by the Ministry of Health and the Royal Medical Services to a dispersed population living in encampments and villages over a large rural area. There are issues of accessibility in terms of distance, and of acceptability in relation to the lack of local and female staff, lack of cultural competencies and poor communication. We found that these providers of health care have a developing partnership that could potentially address the challenge of provision to this rural area. The policymakers have an overview that is in line with applying the concept of health care justice for a more equitable distribution of resources and adjustment of differential access and availability. The health providers are less aware of the right to accessible acceptable health care in their day to day provision whilst the Bedouin population are quite aware of this. This case study of Bedouin in North East Jordan has particular relevance to the needs of populations - both pastoralists and non pastoralists living in remote and rural areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Dowler, EA; O'Connor, D				Dowler, Elizabeth A.; O'Connor, Deirdre			Rights-based approaches to addressing food poverty and food insecurity in Ireland and UK	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Ireland; UK; Right to food; Right to health; Food poverty; Food insecurity	MINIMUM INCOME; HEALTHY FOOD; NUTRITION; SECURITY; ACCESS; AVAILABILITY; ENGLAND; FIELDS; ACTORS	Food poverty is an important contributing factor to health inequalities in industrialised countries: it refers to the inability to acquire or eat an adequate quality or sufficient quantity of food in socially acceptable ways (or the uncertainty of being able to do so). Synonymous with household food insecurity, the issue needs to be located within a social justice framework. Recognising the clear interdependence between the right to food and the right to health, this paper explores how international human rights obligations could inform approaches to addressing food poverty and insecurity with specific reference to Ireland and the UK. Little attention has been paid to how countries should meet their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the right to food in developed countries. The paper contributes by examining the social and policy circumstances which inhibit poor households from obtaining sufficient food to eat healthily, along with strategies and interventions from State and civil society actors in the two countries. In practice, problems and potential solutions have largely been directed towards the individual rather than at social determinants, particularly as research on environmental factors such as distance to shops has produced equivocal results. Other key structural aspects such as income sufficiency for food are broadly ignored by the State, and anti-poverty strategies are often implemented without monitoring for effects on food outcomes. Thus scant evidence exists for either Ireland or the UK meeting its rights to food obligations to date, in terms of roles and responsibilities in ensuring access to affordable, available and appropriate food for all.

Smith			Underdiagnosis of malnutrition in infants and young children in Rwanda: implications for attainment of the Millennium Development Goal to end poverty and hunger	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						child malnutrition; growth standards; Rwanda; diagnosis	INTERNATIONAL GROWTH REFERENCE; WORLD-HEALTH-ORGANIZATION; STANDARDS	Progress towards the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG1) to end poverty and hunger has lagged behind attainment of other MDGs due to chronic poverty and worldwide inequity in access to adequate health care, food, clean water, and sanitation. Despite ongoing challenges, Rwanda has experienced economic progress and the expansion of the national public health system during the past 20 years. However, protein-energy malnutrition in children under five is still a major concern for physicians and government officials in Rwanda. Approximately 45% of children under the age of five in Rwanda suffer from chronic malnutrition, and one in four is undernourished. For years, health facilities in Rwanda have used incorrect growth references for measuring nutritional status of children despite the adoption of new standards by the World Health Organization in 2006. Under incorrect growth references used in Rwanda, a number of children under five who were severely underweight were not identified, and therefore were not treated for malnutrition, thus potentially contributing to the under five mortality rate. Given that one in ten children suffer from malnutrition worldwide, it is imperative that all countries with a burden of malnutrition adopt the most up-to-date international standards for measuring malnutrition, and that the problem is brought to the forefront of international public health initiatives. For low income countries in the process of improving economic conditions, as Rwanda is, increasing the identification and treatment of malnutrition can promote the advancement of MDG1 as well as physical and cognitive development in children, which is imperative for advancing future economic progress.

Despite the important role of SEP in the development of many diseases, no socioeconomic indicator was included in the Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) module of the Global Burden of Disease study. We therefore aimed to illustrate an example by estimating the burden of type 2 diabetes in Sweden attributed to lower educational levels as a measure of SEP using the methods applied in the CRA. Methods: To include lower educational levels as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, we pooled relevant international data from a recent systematic review to measure the association between type 2 diabetes incidence and lower educational levels. We also collected data on the distribution of educational levels in the Swedish population using comparable criteria for educational levels as identified in the international literature. Population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated and applied to the burden of diabetes estimates from the Swedish burden of disease database for men and women in the separate age groups (30-44, 45-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ years). Results: The PAF estimates showed that 17.2% of the diabetes burden in men and 20.1% of the burden in women were attributed to lower educational levels in Sweden when combining all age groups. The burden was, however, most pronounced in the older age groups (70-79 and 80+), where lower educational levels contributed to 22.5% to 24.5% of the diabetes burden in men and 27.8% to 32.6% in women. Conclusions: There is a considerable burden of type 2 diabetes attributed to lower educational levels in Sweden, and socioeconomic indicators should be considered to be incorporated in the CRA.

NGO-provided free HIV treatment and services in Burkina Faso: scarcity, therapeutic rationality and unfair process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Antiretrovirals; User-fees; Selection processes; Access; West Africa	ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; ADHERENCE; MORTALITY; ACCESS; HEALTH; AFRICA; CARE; IMPLEMENTATION; OUTCOMES	Until 2010, Burkina Faso was an exception to the international trend of abolishing user fees for antiretroviral treatment (ART). Patients were still expected to pay 1,500F CFA (2 Euros) per month for ART. Nevertheless, many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) exempted patients from payment. The objective of this study was to investigate how NGOs selected the beneficiaries of payment exemptions for government-provided ART and rationed out complementary medical and psychosocial services. For this qualitative study, we conducted 13 individual interviews and three focus group discussions (n = 13 persons) with program staff in nine NGOs (4,000 patients), two NGO coordinating structures and one national program. These encounters were recorded and transcribed, and their content was thematically analyzed. The results were presented to the NGOs for feedback. Results indicate that there are no concrete guidelines for identifying patients warranting payment exemptions. Formerly, ART was scarce in Burkina Faso and the primary criterion for treatment selection was clinical. Our results suggest that this scarcity, mediated by an approach we call sociotherapeutic rationality (i.e. maximization of clinical success), may have led to inequities in the provision of free ART. This approach may be detrimental to assuring equity since the most impoverished lack resources to pay for services that maximize clinical success (e. g. viral load) that would increase their chances of being selected for treatment. However, once selected into treatment, attempts were made to ration-out complementary services more equitably. This study demonstrates the risks entailed by medication scarcity, which presents NGOs and health professionals with impossible choices that run counter to the philosophy of equity in access to treatment. Amid growing concerns of an international funding retreat for ART, it is important to learn from the past in order to better manage the potentially inequitable consequences of ART scarcity.

Department of Epidemiology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences Objectives: There has been a growing concern that maternal employment could have adverse or beneficial effects on children's health. Although recent studies demonstrated that maternal employment was associated with a higher risk of childhood overweight, the evidence remains sparse in Asian countries. We sought to examine the relationship between maternal working hours and early childhood overweight in a rural town in Okayama Prefecture. Methods: In February 2008, questionnaires were sent to parents of all preschool children aged >= 3 yr in the town to assess maternal working status (working hours and form of employment), children's body mass index, and potential confounders. Childhood overweight was defined following the age and sex-specific criteria of the International Obesity Task Force. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for childhood overweight were estimated in a logistic regression. We used generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable correlation matrix, considering the correlation between siblings. Results: We analyzed 364 preschool children. Adjusting for each child's characteristics (age, sex), mother's characteristics (age, obesity, educational attainment, smoking status, and social participation), and family's characteristics (number of siblings), children whose mothers work <8 h/day had a substantially lower risk for being overweight (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.93) compared with children of non-working mothers, whereas the relationship was less pronounced among children whose mothers work >= 8 h/day (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.19, 2.68). We observed similar patterns in a stratified analysis by the form of maternal employment. Conclusion: Short maternal working hours are associated with a lower odds of early childhood overweight.

Working alliance, interpersonal trust and perceived coercion in mental health review hearings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS			English	Article							TRIBUNALS	Background: There is some evidence that when mental health commitment hearings are held in accordance with therapeutic jurisprudence principles they are perceived as less coercive, and more just in their procedures leading to improved treatment adherence and fewer hospital readmissions. This suggests an effect of the hearing on therapeutic relationships. We compared working alliance and interpersonal trust in clinicians and forensic patients, whose continued detentions were reviewed by two different legal review bodies according to their legal category. Methods: The hearings were rated as positive or negative by patients and treating psychiatrists using the MacArthur scales for perceived coercion, perceived procedural justice (legal and medical) and for the impact of the hearing. We rated Global assessment of Function (GAF), Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) and Interpersonal Trust in Physician (ITP) scales six months before the hearing and repeated the WAI and ITP two weeks before and two weeks after the hearing, for 75 of 83 patients in a forensic medium and high secure hospital. Results: Psychiatrists agreed with patients regarding the rating of hearings. Patients rated civil hearings (MHTs) more negatively than hearings under insanity legislation (MHRBs). Those reviewed by MHTs had lower scores for WAI and ITP. However, post-hearing WAI and ITP scores were not different from baseline and pre-hearing scores. Using the receiver operating characteristic, baseline WAI and ITP scores predicted how patients would rate the hearings, as did baseline GAF and PANSS scores. Conclusions: There was no evidence that positively perceived hearings improved WAI or ITP, but some evidence showed that negatively perceived hearings worsened them. Concentrating on functional recovery and symptom remission remains the best strategy for improved therapeutic relationships.

Flood, Disaster, and Turmoil: Social Issues in Cleft and Craniofacial Care and Crisis Relief	CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFACIAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cleft lip; cleft palate; craniofacial; crisis relief; disaster relief; teams		Objective: To examine social issues in the conduct of cleft and craniofacial care through relief programs in disrupted crisis contexts. Method: Social, health policy, and ethical analyses. Results: At best, craniofacial team care is multidisciplinary, coordinated, and sustained, requiring a long-term relationship between team members, patients, and families. Disasters and societal turmoil interrupt such relationships, causing craniofacial care to become a secondary concern. Providing craniofacial team care in a crisis setting requires rebuilding disrupted coordination and communication. Crisis relief care involves a complex set of expectations and responsibilities and raises issues such as (1) quality assurance, infection control, appropriate standards of care, and follow-up care/continuity; (2) equity of access to services and clinical ethics in the context of war and/or deprivation; (3) training of visitors in the local nation or site; (4) disciplinary composition of teams, interprofessional communication/rivalry, and credentials of clinicians; (5) ownership of the site and local visitor relations; (6) fundraising and marketing strategies; and (7) ethical issues in the doctor-patient relationship. Conclusions: Specific ethical standards for international cleft and craniofacial care delivery also apply to domestic and global crisis relief contexts. Guidance on issues related to professional experience, informed consent, and continuity of care will help care providers address social and ethical issues raised in crisis relief programs. This paper proposes that the Position Paper of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (ACPA) on International Treatment Programs should be used as a template to develop and disseminate a set of standards that apply to crisis relief.

Materials and Methods: A household survey was carried out on a nationally representative sample of the adult (18 years and above) resident population. The main instrument used to establish the diagnosis of mental disorders is the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). The mental disorders included in study were major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. Respondents were asked if they had any of the chronic medical conditions from a list of 15 conditions. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the EQ-5D. Results: Of the 6616 respondents, the lifetime prevalence of mental disorders was 12.0%, and that of chronic medical disorders were 42.6% and those with comorbid mental and medical disorders was 6.1%. The prevalence of any physical disorder in this population was high (42.6%). Among those with chronic physical disorders, 14.3% also had a mental disorder, and among those with mental disorders, more than half (50.6%) had a medical disorder. Most of the mental disorders were not treated. Males, Indians, older people, and those who were separated or divorced were more likely to have comorbidity. The health-related quality of life was significant worse in those with both mental and medical disorders compared to those with either mental or medical disorder. Conclusion: Our study re-emphasised the common occurrence of mental and medical disorders and the importance for an integrated care system with the capability to screen and treat both types of disorders. It also identified certain subpopulations which are more likely to have comorbidity for which a more targeted intervention could be planned.

Cunsolo		Rigolet Inuit Community Govt	'Changing Climate, Changing Health, Changing Stories' Profile: Using an EcoHealth Approach to Explore Impacts of Climate Change on Inuit Health	ECOHEALTH			English	Article						EcoHealth; Indigenous; climate change; health; community-based research; digital storytelling	TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH; COMPLEXITY; PROMOTION; INTERDISCIPLINARY; EQUITY	Global climate change and its impact on public health exemplify the challenge of managing complexity and uncertainty in health research. The Canadian North is currently experiencing dramatic shifts in climate, resulting in environmental changes which impact Inuit livelihoods, cultural practices, and health. For researchers investigating potential climate change impacts on Inuit health, it has become clear that comprehensive and meaningful research outcomes depend on taking a systemic and transdisciplinary approach that engages local citizens in project design, data collection, and analysis. While it is increasingly recognised that using approaches that embrace complexity is a necessity in public health, mobilizing such approaches from theory into practice can be challenging. In 2009, the Rigolet Inuit Community Government in Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Canada partnered with a transdisciplinary team of researchers, health practitioners, and community storytelling facilitators to create the Changing Climate, Changing Health, Changing Stories project, aimed at developing a multi-media participatory, community-run methodological strategy to gather locally appropriate and meaningful data to explore climate-health relationships. The goal of this profile paper is to describe how an EcoHealth approach guided by principles of transdisciplinarity, community participation, and social equity was used to plan and implement this climate-health research project. An overview of the project, including project development, research methods, project outcomes to date, and challenges encountered, is presented. Though introduced in this one case study, the processes, methods, and lessons learned are broadly applicable to researchers and communities interested in implementing EcoHealth approaches in community-based research.

J	Starfield, B				Starfield, Barbara			Primary care: an increasingly important contributor to effectiveness, equity, and efficiency of health services. SESPAS report 2012	GACETA SANITARIA			English	Article						Primary health care; Primary care; Evaluation of effectiveness and equity; Health systems	INFANT-MORTALITY; MEDICAL HOME; CHILD-MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; COUNTRIES; PHYSICIAN; ACCESS; INEQUALITIES; CONTINUITY; SYSTEMS	As of 2005, the literature on the benefits of primary care oriented health systems was consistent in showing greater effectiveness, greater efficiency, and greater equity. In the ensuing five years, nothing changed that conclusion: but there is now greater understanding of the mechanisms by which the benefits of primary care are achieved. We now know that, within certain bounds, neither the wealth of a country nor the total number of health personnel are related to health levels. What counts is the existence of key features of health policy (Primary Health Care): universal financial coverage under government control or regulation, attempts to distribute resources equitably, comprehensiveness of services, and low or no copayments for primary care services. All of these, in combination, produce better primary care: greater first contact access and use, more person-focused care over time, greater range of services available and provided when needed, and coordination of care. The evidence is no longer confined mainly to industrialized countries, as new studies show it to be the case in middle and lower income countries. The endorsements of the World Health Organization (in the form of the reports of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health and the World Health Report of 2008, as well a number of other international commissions, reflect the widespread acceptance of the importance of primary health care. Primary health care can now be measured and assessed; all innovations and enhancements in it must serve its essential features in order to be useful. (C) 2011 SESPAS.

J	Ataguba, JE; McIntyre, D				Ataguba, John E.; McIntyre, Di			Paying for and receiving benefits from health services in South Africa: is the health system equitable?	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Health system; benefit incidence analysis; progressivity; health care financing; health care benefits; South Africa	CARE; POOR	There is a global challenge for health systems to ensure equity in both the delivery and financing of health care. However, many African countries still do not have equitable health systems. Traditionally, equity in the delivery and the financing of health care are assessed separately, in what may be termed 'partial' analyses. The current debate on countries moving toward universal health systems, however, requires a holistic understanding of equity in both the delivery and the financing of health care. The number of studies combining these aspects to date is limited, especially in Africa. An assessment of overall health system equity involves assessing health care financing in relation to the principles of contributing to financing according to ability to pay and benefiting from health services according to need for care. Currently South Africa is considering major health systems restructuring toward a universal system. This paper examines together, for both the public and the private sectors, equity in the delivery and financing of health care in South Africa. Using nationally representative datasets and standard methodologies for assessing progressivity in health care financing and benefit incidence, this paper reports an overall progressive financing system but a pro-rich distribution of health care benefits. The progressive financing system is driven mainly by progressive private medical schemes that cover a small portion of the population, mainly the rich. The distribution of health care benefits is not only pro-rich, but also not in line with the need for health care; richer groups receive a far greater share of service benefits within both public and private sectors despite having a relatively lower share of the ill-health burden. The importance of the findings for the design of a universal health system is discussed.

Until recently, international debates about financing and health equity have focused primarily on mechanisms to promote equity in relation to very specific elements of health systems. However, in recent years there has been growing interest in considering these equity challenges from a more systemic perspective. In this context, universal health coverage is becoming a rallying call, with a focus on how best universal coverage can be financed. This paper is the first in a special issue which presents a body of research whose overall aim was to critically evaluate existing inequities in health care financing and provision in Ghana, South Africa and Tanzania, and the extent to which health insurance mechanisms (broadly defined) could address financial protection and equity of access challenges. In this first paper we introduce the countries' health systems, with a special emphasis on existing mechanisms for financial protection. We also identify in broad terms the key challenges for universal coverage, setting the scene for the subsequent papers.

Socio-economic Inequality in Oral Healthcare Coverage: Results from the World Health Survey	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						dental public health; healthcare disparities; socioeconomic factors; cross-sectional studies; epidemiology; health services research	SERVICES; BEHAVIOR; DISEASES	The objective of this study was to assess socioeconomic inequality in oral healthcare coverage among adults with expressed need living in 52 countries. Data on 60,332 adults aged 18 years or older were analyzed from 52 countries participating in the 2002-2004 World Health Survey. Oral healthcare coverage was defined as the proportion of individuals who received any medical care from a dentist or other oral health specialist during a period of 12 months prior to the survey, among those who expressed any mouth and/or teeth problems during that period. In addition to assessment of the coverage across wealth quintiles in each country, a wealth-based relative index of inequality was used to measure socio-economic inequality. The index was adjusted for sex, age, marital status, education, employment, overall health status, and urban/rural residence. Pro-rich inequality in oral healthcare coverage was observed within most of the countries, although lower income countries showed greater levels of relative inequality than higher income countries. Overall, lowest coverage and highest relative inequality were found in the low-income countries. The findings of this study may inform policies for oral health at global and national levels. To achieve universal coverage in oral healthcare, relevant interventions should reach the poorest population groups.	[Hosseinpoor, A.

A Research Strategy to Develop New Tools to Prevent Leprosy, Improve Patient Care and Reduce the Consequences of Leprosy	LEPROSY REVIEW			English	Article								A Research Strategy to Develop New Tools to Prevent Leprosy, Improve Patient Care and Reduce the Consequences of Leprosy The Importance: The Global Leprosy Programme has had a dramatic impact on the prevalence of registered cases of leprosy over the last 20 years through the implementation of short course multi-drug therapy (MDT) treatment. However, further advances in the field of leprosy are hindered by the lack of new tools to address the challenge of apparent persistence in transmission and incidence, and the long-term consequences of the disease. The Strategy: This strategy was developed by the Technical Commission of ILEP to provide a framework to prioritise research, to identify the steps needed to develop and implement new tools, and to identify funding gaps. The strategy focuses on applied research, either technology transfer or research to evaluate effectiveness of interventions where there is already proof of principle. More basic research and proof of principle are important but are outside the scope of this five year strategy. The Principles: The strategy is composed of eight themes, but research in these themes should be fully integrated mainly through the use of common field sites. The integration of research with other Neglected Tropical Diseases and diseases of poverty, and multi-disciplinary approaches are strongly advocated. Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6 targets the reduction in the burden of disease but tackling poverty (MDG1), education (MDG2), gender equality (MDG3), child health (MDG4), maternal health (MDG5) and partnerships (MDG8) are all important for leprosy. The Logistics: This strategy is based on the achievement of deliverables within five years at an estimated cost of 24 million. A number of the projects are already in progress, some are developed and requiring funding, while other areas are gaps representing urgent priorities. The key components are presented in the table: [GRAPHICS] A Research Strategy to Develop New Tools to Prevent Leprosy, Improve Patient Care and Reduce the Consequences of Leprosy											2	3	5	0	8	LEPRA	COLCHESTER	28 MIDDLEBOROUGH, COLCHESTER CO1 1TG, ESSEX, ENGLAND	0305-7518			LEPROSY REV	Lepr.

Global health research priorities: Mobilizing the developing world	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health research; Priority setting; Low-income countries; Middle-income countries	SETTING PRIORITIES; RESEARCH INVESTMENTS; CHILD HEALTH; MORTALITY; DIARRHEA	The paper focuses on two questions: (i) how to set research priorities in a transparent, systematic, fair and legitimate way?; and (ii) how to mobilize low and middle- income countries to take more ownership in defining their own research policies, rather than merely being passive recipients of international aid for research and development? I propose that the recently developed Child Health and Nutrition Research initiative (CHNRI) methodology is becoming widely accepted as a feasible answer to both those questions. In this paper, I review its numerous applications to date and show how it evolved into a practical and systematic tool that can assist priority setting in health research investments in diverse contexts. The CHNRI methodology also addresses support for different instruments of health research to achieve better balance between fundamental research, translation research and implementation research. The wide application of CHNRI methodology is expected to maximise the potential of health research to reduce disease burden and gradually reduce inequities that exist between support for research on the health problems of the rich and the poor. I believe that this tool will find application within many low and middle-income countries and assist them to pull together their own experts and actively define their priorities for research and development in the coming years.

An essential tool in achieving this reduction is the ability to provide valid measurements of inequalities, which are comparable over time and ultimately across countries and continents. With valid data a true understanding of inequalities can be ascertained, which can begin to inform effective legislation and policy. In this workshop, the speakers described in three different countries, Scotland, New Zealand and the Netherlands, how record linkage has been used to link ethnic status to health and health care measures and so to determine ethnic inequalities in health with the ultimate aim of reducing these inequalities.

J	Treiman, DJ				Treiman, Donald J.			The "difference between heaven and earth": Urban-rural disparities in well-being in China	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND MOBILITY			English	Article						China; Inequality; Trends; Rural-urban disparities; SES	1959-1961 GREAT LEAP; EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; HUKOU SYSTEM; STRATIFICATION; CONSEQUENCES; INEQUALITY; ORIGINS; FAMINE; FIRMS	Although China is a rapidly developing nation, rural-urban disparities in well-being remain large, and perhaps have become larger than in the early years of the Communist period because the urban sector has benefited from China's transition to a market economy much more than has the rural sector; or perhaps have become smaller as earning opportunities in the export-oriented manufacturing sector have increased for those from rural origins. Economic disparities are exacerbated by institutional arrangements that have created a two-class society based on registration (hukou) status with sharp rural-urban distinctions in the public provision of schooling, health care, housing, and retirement benefits. Indeed, it is fair to say that China built an urban welfare state on the backs of the peasants. Using data from two national probability sample surveys, one carried out in 1996 and one in 2008, this paper describes trends in various aspects of inequality for three groups, identified at age 14: those with rural registration and rural residence; those with rural registration and urban residence: and those with urban registration. The specific outcomes considered are education, occupational position, earnings, family income, material well-being, and perceptions regarding whether life has improved. The paper shows that a rising tide lifts all boats. That is. there has been across-the-board improvement in almost all aspects of life in China measured here, but for most measures the size of the rural-urban gap has remained relatively constant over a 60-year period.

J	Lane, K				Lane, Karen			When is collaboration not collaboration? When it's militarized	WOMEN AND BIRTH			English	Article						Collaborative care; Professionalisation; Maternity policy; Primary care; Public health	MIDWIVES; DOCTORS; WORKING	In adopting the medical lobby's preferred definition of collaboration where midwives are legally compelled to seek endorsement for their care plan from an obstetrician, Determination 2010 connotes a form of militarized collaboration and thus negates all that genuine collaboration stands for-equality, mutual trust and reciprocal respect. Using Critical Discourse Analysis, the first half of this paper analyses the submissions from medical, midwifery and consumer peak organisations to the Maternity Services Review and Senate reviews held between 2008 and 2010 showing that Determination 2010 privileges the medical lobby worldview in adopting a vertical definition of collaboration. The second half of the paper responds to the principal assumption of Determination 2010-that midwives do not voluntarily collaborate. It argues by reference to a qualitative inquiry conducted into select caseload maternity units in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales during 2009-2010 that this presupposition is erroneous. The evidence shows that genuine collaboration is possible without legislative force but it requires a coalition of the willing among senior midwives and obstetricians to institute regular interdisciplinary meetings and clinical reviews and to model respectful behaviour to new entrants.

Inequalities in Body Mass Index and Smoking Behavior in 70 Countries: Evidence for a Social Transition in Chronic Disease Risk	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						body mass index; smoking; socioeconomic factors; urbanization	NUTRITION TRANSITION; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; OBESITY; TOBACCO; URBANIZATION; DIET	Despite the growing burden of chronic disease globally, few studies have examined the socioeconomic patterning of risk across countries. The authors examined differences in the social patterning of body mass index (BMI) and current smoking by urbanicity among 70 countries from the 2002-2003 World Health Surveys. Age-adjusted, gender-stratified ordinary least squares and logistic regression analyses were conducted in each country to assess the relation between education and BMI Of smoking. Meta-analytic techniques were used to assess heterogeneity between countries in the education-risk factor relations. Meta-regression was used to determine whether the heterogeneity could be explained by country-level urbanicity. In the least urban countries, persons with higher education had a higher BMI, while the opposite pattern was seen in the most urban countries, with this pattern being especially pronounced among women. In contrast, smoking was consistently concentrated among persons of lower education among all men and among women in the least urban countries. For women in the most urban countries, higher education was associated with higher odds of smoking, although there was substantial variability in this relation. These results highlight a global trend toward an increasing burden of chronic disease risk among persons of lower socioeconomic position as countries become more urban.

J	Antai, D				Antai, Diddy			Gender inequities, relationship power, and childhood immunization uptake in Nigeria: a population-based cross-sectional study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Gender inequities; Childhood immunization; Relationship power; Multilevel regression; Nigeria	MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; VACCINATION; MORTALITY; HEALTH; COUNTRIES; INDIA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MOTHERHOOD; COVERAGE; VACCINES	Background: This study aimed to simultaneously examine the association between multiple dimensions of gender inequities and full childhood immunization. Methods: A multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed on nationally representative sample data from the 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, which included 33 385 women aged 15-49 years who had a total of 28 647 live-born children; 24 910 of these children were included in this study. Results: A total of 4283 (17%) children had received full immunization. Children of women whose spouse did not contribute to household earnings had a higher likelihood of receiving full childhood immunization (odds ratio (OR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-3.77), and children of women who lacked decision-making autonomy had a lower likelihood of receiving full childhood immunization (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60-0.91). The likelihood of receiving full childhood immunization was higher among female children (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.54), Yoruba children (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.19-4.26), and children resident in communities with low illiteracy (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.06-3.12), but lower for children of birth order 5 or above (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.96), children of women aged <= 24 years (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.87) and 25-34 years (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99), children of women with no education (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21-0.54) and primary education (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.97), as well as children of women resident in communities with high unemployment (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.20-0.57). Conclusions: The woman being the sole provider for her family (i.e., having a spouse who did not contribute to household earnings) was associated with a higher likelihood of fully immunizing the child, and the woman lacking decision-making autonomy was associated with a lower likelihood of fully immunizing the child. These findings draw attention to the need for interventions aimed at promoting women's employment and earning possibilities, whilst changing gender-discriminatory attitudes within relationships, communities, and society in general.

We consider these data in the global discussion on taking action to reduce health inequalities. This study draws on cross-sectional data from a large population-based survey of Australian women 6 months after giving birth. Only those women reporting to attend publically-funded models of antenatal care (i.e., public clinic, midwife clinic, shared care, primary medical care, primary midwife care) were included in analyses. Results showed a social patterning in the organization and experience of care with clear links between model of care attended in pregnancy and a number of individual-level indicators of social disadvantage. Our findings show model of care is a salient feature in how women view their care. How women from socially disadvantaged backgrounds navigate available care options are important considerations. Pregnancy care is recognized as an opportunity to intervene to give children 'the best start in life.' Our data show the current system of universally accessible pregnancy care in Australia is failing to support the most vulnerable women and families. This information can inform actions to reduce social disparities during this critical period.

Yet, there is little research on vulnerabilities to corruption or associated factors at the sectoral level. This article examines current patterns and risks of corruption in Vietnam's health sector and reviews strategies for addressing corruption in the future. The article builds on the findings and discussion at the sixth Anti-Corruption Dialogue between the Vietnamese government and the international donor community. Development partners, government agencies, Vietnamese and international non-governmental organisations, media representatives and other stakeholders explored what is known about important problems such as informal payments, procurement corruption and health insurance fraud. The participants proposed corruption-reduction interventions in the areas of administrative oversight, transparency initiatives and civil society participation and health reforms to change incentives. The analysis assesses the prospects for success of these interventions, given the Vietnamese institutional context, and draws conclusions relevant to addressing health sector corruption in other countries.

J	O'Kane, G				O'Kane, Gabrielle			What is the real cost of our food? Implications for the environment, society and public health nutrition	PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION			English	Article						Community food systems; Food sustainability; Food citizenship; Globalised food system	AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY; SYSTEMS; ASSOCIATIONS; RESTAURANTS; CONSUMPTION; STRATEGIES; DEMOCRACY; SECURITY; POLITICS	The current, globalised food system supplies 'cheap' food to a large proportion of the world's population, but with significant social, environmental and health costs that are poorly understood. The present paper examines the nature and extent of these costs for both rural and urban communities, by illustrating the financial pressures on food producers and manufacturers to produce cheap food, the disconnection people experience with how and where their food is produced, and the rise in obesity levels that plague the globe. The paper then proposes that community food systems may play an important role in mitigating the adverse environmental, economic and social effects of the dominant food system, by the use of more sustainable food production methods, the development of local economies and enabling closer connections between farmers and consumers. There are many opportunities for public health nutritionists to contribute to the local food system literature to ascertain whether these systems improve inequities, provide better access to healthy food and help stem the tide of rising global obesity levels. Public health nutritionists can play a key role in supporting people to become food citizens and to advocate for democratic and sustainable food systems.

It is estimated that approximately 1,000 girls are born every year in China with Rett syndrome but far fewer have received a diagnosis. Fourteen of 74 Chinese families known to the International Rett Syndrome Phenotype Database participated in this qualitative study. Telephone interviews were conducted in Mandarin to explore pathways to a diagnosis of Rett syndrome in China and associated barriers. Families consulted multiple clinical centers and eventually received a diagnosis at a centrally located hospital. Over the course of this pathway, families encountered lack of knowledge and diagnostic expertise for Rett syndrome at local levels and a heavily over-burdened hospital system. There was a paucity of information available to guide management of this rare disorder after the diagnosis had been received. Our study suggests that the frustrations experienced by families could in part be addressed by the provision of information, education, and training related to Rett syndrome for clinicians, additional resources to allow clinicians to request genetic testing for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and for information and support services for families.

Children living with both biological parents reported higher levels of life satisfaction than children living with a single parent or parentstep-parent. Children in joint physical custody reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction than their counterparts in other types of non-intact families. Controlling perceived family affluence, the difference between joint physical custody families and single mother or motherstepfather families became non-significant. Difficulties in communicating with parents were strongly associated with less life satisfaction but did not mediate the relation between family structure and life satisfaction. Children in the Nordic countries characterised by strong welfare systems reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction in all living arrangements except in single father households. Differences in economic inequality between countries moderated the association between certain family structures, perceived family affluence and life satisfaction.

A consideration of the various models that have been developed by sociologists and their allies most conspicuously social epidemiologists to account for (a) and (b) is offered, drawing on government-sponsored commissions and reviews as well as the peer-reviewed literature. This is followed by a portrayal of specifically sociological theories of health inequalities, featuring those that hold social structures as well as cultural shifts in convention and behaviour to be causally efficacious for health inequalities. The summary and conclusions of the review incorporate an outline of pertinent questions the sociological community has so far been reluctant to address and an agenda for future research.

In 2008, they were the top killers in the South-East Asia region, causing 7.9 million deaths; the number of deaths is expected to increase by 21% over the next decade. One-third of the 7.9 million deaths (34%) occurred in those <60 years of age (compared to 23% in the rest of the world). Of the total deaths in the South-East Asia region (14.5 million), cardiovascular diseases accounted for 25%, chronic respiratory diseases 9.6%, cancer 7.8% and diabetes 2.1%. NCDs are largely attributable to a few preventable risk factors, all of which are highly prevalent in the region-tobacco use, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity and harmful use of alcohol. Key strategies for the prevention and control of NCDs include (i) reducing exposure to risk factors through health promotion and primary prevention, (ii) early diagnosis and management of people with NCDs, and (iii) surveillance to monitor trends In risk factors and diseases. Tackling NCDs calls for a paradigm shift: from addressing each NCD separately to collectively addressing a cluster of diseases in an integrated manner, and from using a biomedical approach to a public health approach guided by the principles of universal access and social justice. High levels of commitment and multisectoral actions are needed to reverse the growing burden of NCDs in the South-East Asia region.

The diagram illustrates the dynamic and complex interrelationships among structural factors (i.e., social determinants) of HIV infection, such as machismo; lack of work, money, and social services; local dynamics of the performance of the state; and international dynamics of the sexual tourism industry. On the basis of the diagram, groups of key representatives proposed prioritizing structural actions such as reducing socioeconomic inequalities and providing access to health care and education. Conclusions. The social determinants displayed in the diagram relate to historic power forces that have shaped vulnerable scenarios in Cartagena. Collaboration between participants and researchers generates conceptual frameworks that make it possible to understand and manage the complexity of HIV's social determination. This way of understanding effectively connects local inequalities with international flows of power such as sexual tourism and makes evident the strengths and limitations of current approaches to HIV prevention.

The contribution of educational inequalities to lifespan variation	POPULATION HEALTH METRICS			English	Article						Lifespan variation; Life expectancy; Socioeconomic inequality; Education; International variation; Mortality	HEALTH REPORT 2000; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MORTALITY; LENGTH; DEATH; INDICATORS; POSITION; TRENDS	Background: Studies of socioeconomic inequalities in mortality consistently point to higher death rates in lower socioeconomic groups. Yet how these between-group differences relate to the total variation in mortality risk between individuals is unknown. Methods: We used data assembled and harmonized as part of the Eurothine project, which includes census-based mortality data from 11 European countries. We matched this to national data from the Human Mortality Database and constructed life tables by gender and educational level. We measured variation in age at death using Theil's entropy index, and decomposed this measure into its between-and within-group components. Results: The least-educated groups lived between three and 15 years fewer than the highest-educated groups, the latter having a more similar age at death in all countries. Differences between educational groups contributed between 0.6% and 2.7% to total variation in age at death between individuals in Western European countries and between 1.2% and 10.9% in Central and Eastern European countries. Variation in age at death is larger and differs more between countries among the least-educated groups. Conclusions: At the individual level, many known and unknown factors are causing enormous variation in age at death, socioeconomic position being only one of them. Reducing variations in age at death among less-educated people by providing protection to the vulnerable may help to reduce inequalities in mortality between socioeconomic groups.

J	Lacey, J				Lacey, Joseph			Climate change and Norman Daniels' theory of just health: an essay on basic needs	MEDICINE HEALTH CARE AND PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Basic needs; Climate change; Climate policy; Global justice; Health; Healthcare; John Rawls; Norman Daniels	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; RAWLS	Norman Daniels, in applying Rawls' theory of justice to the issue of human health, ideally presupposes that society exists in a state of moderate scarcity. However, faced with problems like climate change, many societies find that their state of moderate scarcity is increasingly under threat. The first part of this essay aims to determine the consequences for Daniels' theory of just health when we incorporate into Rawls' understanding of justice the idea that the condition of moderate scarcity can fail. Most significantly, I argue for a generation-neutral principle of basic needs that is lexically prior to Rawls' familiar principles of justice. The second part of this paper aims to demonstrate how my reformulated version of Daniels' conception of just health can help to justify action on climate change and guide climate policy within liberal-egalitarian societies.

J	Kondo, N				Kondo, Naoki			Socioeconomic Disparities and Health: Impacts and Pathways	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						income inequality; social determinants; economic crisis; socioeconomic status; aged; Japan	SELF-RATED HEALTH; INCOME INEQUALITY; RELATIVE DEPRIVATION; POPULATION HEALTH; MORTALITY; JAPAN; MULTILEVEL; COHORT; BHPS	Growing socioeconomic disparity is a global concern, as it could affect population health. The author and colleagues have investigated the health impacts of socioeconomic disparities as well as the pathways that underlie those disparities. Our meta-analysis found that a large population has risks of mortality and poor self-rated health that are attributable to income inequality. The study results also suggested the existence of threshold effects (ie, a threshold of income inequality over which the adverse impacts on health increase), period effects (ie, the potential for larger impacts in later years, specifically after the 1990s), and lag effects between income inequality and health outcomes. Our other studies using Japanese national representative survey data and a large-scale cohort study of Japanese older adults (AGES cohort) support the relative deprivation hypothesis, namely, that invidious social comparisons arising from relative deprivation in an unequal society adversely affect health. A study with a natural experiment design found that the socioeconomic gradient in self-rated health might actually have become shallower after the 1997-98 economic crisis in Japan, due to smaller health improvements among middle-class white-collar workers and middle/upper-income workers. In conclusion, income inequality might have adverse impacts on individual health, and psychosocial stress due to relative deprivation may partially explain those impacts. Any study of the effects of macroeconomic fluctuations on health disparities should also consider multiple potential pathways, including expanding income inequality, changes in the labor market, and erosion of social capital. Further studies are needed to attain a better understanding of the social determinants of health in a rapidly changing society.

Postretrenchment Politics: Policy Feedback in Chile's Health and Pension Reforms	LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY			English	Article							LATIN-AMERICA; SOCIAL-SECURITY; DEMOCRACY; WELFARE; STATE; TRANSFORMATION; GLOBALIZATION; PRIVATIZATION; MARKETS; RISK	Through a comparison of three periods of health and pension reform in Chile, this article develops an explanation for the incremental form of social policy change that some Latin American nations have witnessed in recent years, despite the dramatic rise of left governments. It describes postretrenchment politics, which constitutes a realignment in the way politics plays out in countries that have undergone social policy retrenchment. In postretrenchment politics, the strengthened position of private business interests, combined with political learning legacies and lock-in effects generated by reforms, results in incremental political change, despite renewed efforts by left parties to address inequality. Global capital also plays an important contextual role, and may influence postretrenchment politics. In postretrenchment politics, newly reformed systems may achieve greater equity, but they do so in fragmented form.

Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA) provides a forewarning of the burden of mental disorders in urban settings in developing world. The aim of this study is to estimate prevalence, severity, and treatment of recently active DSM-IV mental disorders. We examined socio-demographic correlates, aspects of urban living such as internal migration, exposure to violence, and neighborhood-level social deprivation with 12-month mental disorders. Methods and Results: A representative cross-sectional household sample of 5,037 adults was interviewed face-to-face using the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), to generate diagnoses of DSM-IV mental disorders within 12 months of interview, disorder severity, and treatment. Administrative data on neighborhood social deprivation were gathered. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate individual and contextual correlates of disorders, severity, and treatment. Around thirty percent of respondents reported a 12-month disorder, with an even distribution across severity levels. Anxiety disorders were the most common disorders (affecting 19.9%), followed by mood (11%), impulse-control (4.3%), and substance use (3.6%) disorders. Exposure to crime was associated with all four types of disorder. Migrants had low prevalence of all four types compared to stable residents. High urbanicity was associated with impulse-control disorders and high social deprivation with substance use disorders. Vulnerable subgroups were observed: women and migrant men living in most deprived areas. Only one-third of serious cases had received treatment in the previous year. Discussion: Adults living in Sao Paulo megacity had prevalence of mental disorders at greater levels than similar surveys conducted in other areas of the world. Integration of mental health promotion and care into the rapidly expanding Brazilian primary health system should be strengthened. This strategy might become a model for poorly resourced and highly populated developing countries.

J	Room, R; Reuter, P				Room, Robin; Reuter, Peter			How well do international drug conventions protect public health?	LANCET			English	Article							ILLICIT OPIOID USE; TRENDS; POLICIES; BURDEN; ABUSE	The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961 aimed to eliminate the illicit production and non-medical use of cannabis, cocaine, and opioids, an aim later extended to many pharmaceutical drugs. Over the past 50 years international drug treaties have neither prevented the globalisation of the illicit production and non-medical use of these drugs, nor, outside of developed countries, made these drugs adequately available for medical use. The system has also arguably worsened the human health and wellbeing of drug users by increasing the number of drug users imprisoned, discouraging effective countermeasures to the spread of HIV by injecting drug users, and creating an environment conducive to the violation of drug users' human rights. The international system has belatedly accepted measures to reduce the harm from injecting drug use, but national attempts to reduce penalties for drug use while complying with the treaties have often increased the number of drug users involved with the criminal justice system. The international treaties have also constrained national policy experimentation because they require nation states to criminalise drug use. The adoption of national policies that are more aligned with the risks of different drugs and the effectiveness of controls will require the amendment of existing treaties, the formulation of new treaties, or withdrawal of states from existing treaties and re-accession with reservations.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WELFARE			English	Article						refugees; Iraq; humanitarianism; global social policy; social work	MENTAL-HEALTH; ASYLUM-SEEKERS; RESETTLEMENT; EXPERIENCE; CHILDREN; TRAUMA; WOMEN	The US-led invasion and war in Iraq has created one of the most significant refugee crises in recent decades. International nongovernmental organizations have partnered with local organizations in Jordan and Syria to provide humanitarian aid to some two million displaced Iraqis. Field research indicates that, as with other humanitarian crises, few trained social workers have contributed to policy and practice with displaced Iraqis. The case of Iraq provides an opportunity to consider how the social work profession can shape comprehensive global refugee policies and programs. This role is appropriate, given mandates for the profession to promote social justice and human rights. Using the case of Iraqi displacement, we illustrate the complexities of humanitarian services provision and the need for trained social workers to participate in humanitarian relief and development programs. We argue that a variety of social work institutions and actors should become more robust advocates for shaping just refugee policy and practice.

Study abroad programs can play an important role in this transformation through educating nurses in the delivery of culturally safe health care in a diverse world. Exposing nursing students to study abroad experiences that are guided by critical approaches such as a postcolonial feminist framework provides nursing students with opportunities to be immersed in the life and culture of people who have a completely different positioning and location while reflecting on the "us" versus "them" phenomenon that is pervasive in modern Western society and generates negative cultural comparisons. Attention to the design and implementation of such programs is important if nursing schools in the Western world are to uphold ethical standards, promote equality in relationships with host communities and avoid inadvertent exploitation and marginalization of vulnerable peoples. We present the development and implementation of a community health study abroad program for American nursing students in Malawi, Africa using a postcolonial feminist framework.

SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						Socioeconomic; Depression; Reporting style; International; Vignettes	OLDER-ADULTS; PHYSICAL HEALTH; LATE-LIFE; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; RISK-FACTOR; D SCALE; STROKE; DISABILITY; GENDER	Depression is one of the leading causes of disability in the developed world. Previous studies have shown varying depression prevalence rates between European countries, and also within countries, between socioeconomic groups. However, it is unclear whether these differences reflect true variations in prevalence or whether they are attributable to systematic differences in reporting styles (reporting heterogeneity) between countries and socioeconomic groups. In this study, we examine the prevalence of three depressive symptoms (mood, sleeping and concentration problems) and their association with educational level in 10 European countries, and examine whether these differences can be explained by differences in reporting styles. We use data from the first and second waves of the COMPARE study, comprising a sub-sample of 9,409 adults aged 50 and over in 10 European countries covered by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. We first use ordered probit models to estimate differences in the prevalence of self-reported depressive symptoms by country and education. We then use hierarchical ordered probit models to assess differences controlling for reporting heterogeneity. We find that depressive symptoms are most prevalent in Mediterranean and Eastern European countries, whereas Sweden and Denmark have the lowest prevalence. Lower educational level is associated with higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in all European regions, but this association is weaker in Northern European countries, and strong in Eastern European countries. Reporting heterogeneity does not explain these cross-national differences. Likewise, differences in depressive symptoms by educational level remain and in some regions increase after controlling for reporting heterogeneity. Our findings suggest that variations in depressive symptoms in Europe are not attributable to differences in reporting styles, but are instead likely to result from variations in the causes of depressive symptoms between countries and educational groups.

J	Kamradt-Scott, A; Lee, K				Kamradt-Scott, Adam; Lee, Kelley			The 2011 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework: Global Health Secured or a Missed Opportunity?	POLITICAL STUDIES			English	Article						global health security; influenza; virus sharing; Indonesia; H5N1	VACCINE PRODUCTION CAPACITY; COUNTRIES	In early 2007 the Indonesian government announced that it would cease sharing H5N1 influenza virus samples with the World Health Organization's Global Influenza Surveillance Network. At the heart of the government's complaint was the fact that samples were being passed by the WHO to pharmaceutical companies which developed, and patented, influenza vaccines that the Indonesian authorities could not purchase. The decision gained widespread support among advocates of greater equity of access to medicines, and in response the WHO established an intergovernmental process to agree a framework for influenza virus sharing. The process officially concluded in April 2011 and a new Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIPF) was agreed at the 64th World Health Assembly in May 2011. This article investigates the events that prompted the re-examination of a technical cooperation system that has provided effective global health security on influenza for 60 years, and evaluates the framework that has now been agreed. Drawing the distinction between functional and moral-political benefits, the article argues that PIPF more accurately represents a diplomatic stand-off - one that has now been effectively sidelined with the passage of the agreement - rather than genuine reform. In fact, the PIPF papers over fundamental disagreements regarding authority in global health governance, the relationship between the WHO and governments, and the role of private industry. The article concludes by examining an alternative mechanism that would arguably better address the inherent tensions between national and collective interests, and accomplish the functional and moral-political benefits that the negotiations set out to achieve.

The private health sector is a major provider of care in the region and it will remain a significant actor in the future. Any efforts by SSA governments to improve health systems performance therefore has to account for the private health sector. Regional and international actors increasingly recognize importance of effectively engaging with the private health sector, and initiatives to improve engagement are underway in several countries. However, there is little systematic analysis of private health providers' view and experience with engagement. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we surveyed private health facilities in Kenya and Ghana to understand the extent to which and how governments interact and engage with these facilities. The results suggest that government engagement with private health facilities is quite limited. The primary focus of this engagement is "command-and-control" type regulations to improve the quality of care. There is little attention paid to building the capacity of health care businesses through either technical or financial assistance. The vast majority of these facilities also receive no government assistance in meeting public health and social goals. Finally, government engagement with private pharmacies is often neglected and clinics receive a disproportionate share of government assistance. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, our findings suggest that there may be considerable untapped potential for greater engagement with private health facilities-particularly pharmacies. Improving engagement will likely help governments with limited resources to better take advantage of the private sector capacity to meet access and equity objectives and to accelerate the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

This paper will use elements of a framework developed by Gruskin et all that analyses the interconnected factors affecting the sexual and reproductive health of people living with HIV. We use and adapt some of these elements to examine the extent to which sexual and reproductive rights have been realized in Latin America since 1994. Specifically, we consider the rights, needs and aspirations of people; the socioeconomic context; national and international law and policy; health systems, services and programmes; the opposition; the perceived high costs of political support; the role of civil society, NGO networks and coalitions; and development aid, donor policy and government funding. There are a growing number of progressive regional and national bodies, organizations, groups and individuals with a commitment to sexual and reproductive health and rights in the region, and many gains have been made in the realization of these rights. However, these gains are only partial, given the acute inequality across ethnic, socioeconomic and geographic lines, and there is evidence of widening gaps. Given the breadth of the subject and the number of countries involved, this paper can cite only a few of the enormous number of examples from the literature. We hope the paper will stimulate further in-depth, critical reviews of these issues at the country and regional level. (C) 2011 Reproductive Health Matters. All rights reserved.

J	Olivier, C; Williams-Jones, B				Olivier, Catherine; Williams-Jones, Bryn			Pharmacogenomic technologies: a necessary "luxury" for better global public health?	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Pharmacogenomic technologies; drug development; health innovations; global; public health; developing world populations; University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics criteria; inequity; luxury	ADVERSE DRUG-REACTIONS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; GENOMIC MEDICINE; PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; IMPROVING HEALTH; HEART-FAILURE; SOCIETY; RACE; SCIENCE	Background: Pharmacogenomic technologies aim to redirect drug development to increase safety and efficacy of individual care. There is much hope that their implementation in the drug development process will help respond to population health needs, particularly in developing countries. However, there is also fear that novel pharmacogenomic drugs will remain too costly, be designed for the needs of the wealthy nations, and so constitute an unnecessary "luxury" for most populations. In this paper, we analyse the promise that pharmacogenomic technologies hold for improving global public health and identify strategies and challenges associated with their implementation. Discussion: This paper evaluates the capacity of pharmacogenomic technologies to meet six criteria described by the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics group: 1) impact of the technology, 2) technology appropriateness, 3) capacity to address local burdens, 4) feasibility to be implemented in reasonable time, 5) capacity to reduce the knowledge gap, and 6) capacity for indirect benefits. We argue that the implementation of pharmacogenomic technologies in the drug development process can positively impact population health. However, this positive impact depends on how and for which purposes the technologies are used. We discuss the potential of these technologies to stimulate drug discovery in the case of rare (orphan diseases) or neglected diseases, but also to reduce acute adverse drug reactions in infectious disease treatment and prevention, which promises to improve global public health. Conclusions: The implementation of pharmacogenomic technologies may lead to the development of drugs that appear to be a "luxury" for populations in need of numerous interventions that are known to have a demonstrable impact on population health (e.g., secure access to potable water, reduction of social inequities, health education). However, our analysis shows that pharmacogenomic technologies do have the potential to redirect drug development and distribution so as to improve the health of vulnerable populations. Strategies should thus be developed to better direct their implementation towards meeting the needs and responding to the realities of populations of the developing world (i.e., social, cultural and political acceptability, and local health burdens), making pharmacogenomic technologies a necessary "luxury" for global public health.

J	Bozorgmehr, K; Saint, VA; Tinnemann, P				Bozorgmehr, Kayvan; Saint, Victoria A.; Tinnemann, Peter			The 'global health' education framework: a conceptual guide for monitoring, evaluation and practice	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article							MEDICAL-EDUCATION; GLOBALIZATION; ISSUES	Background: In the past decades, the increasing importance of and rapid changes in the global health arena have provoked discussions on the implications for the education of health professionals. In the case of Germany, it remains yet unclear whether international or global aspects are sufficiently addressed within medical education. Evaluation challenges exist in Germany and elsewhere due to a lack of conceptual guides to develop, evaluate or assess education in this field. Objective: To propose a framework conceptualising 'global health' education (GHE) in practice, to guide the evaluation and monitoring of educational interventions and reforms through a set of key indicators that characterise GHE. Methods: Literature review; deduction. Results and Conclusion: Currently, 'new' health challenges and educational needs as a result of the globalisation process are discussed and linked to the evolving term 'global health'. The lack of a common definition of this term complicates attempts to analyse global health in the field of education. The proposed GHE framework addresses these problems and presents a set of key characteristics of education in this field. The framework builds on the models of 'social determinants of health' and 'globalisation and health' and is oriented towards 'health for all' and 'health equity'. It provides an action-oriented construct for a bottom-up engagement with global health by the health workforce. Ten indicators are deduced for use in monitoring and evaluation.

It has been found in empirical studies of health inequalities that health dynamics can differ systematically across subgroups, even if prevalence measured at one point in time is the same. We explore the relevance of the concept of health dynamics in the context of cost-effectiveness analysis. Although economic evaluation takes health dynamics into account where they matter in terms of efficiency, we find that it fails to take into account the equity dimensions of health dynamics. In addition, the political implications of health dynamics may influence resource allocation decisions, possibly in opposing directions.

This article identifies and examines studies that deal with the subject of disability with reference to rights, ethical issues, and justice. A total of 42 articles and 33 books were selected. The subject most frequently dealt with in studies on disability is that of human rights (76% of the articles and 79% of the books examined), followed by topics relating to welfare (52% of articles and 64% of books), International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (38% of articles and 45% of books), justice (24% of articles and 48% of books), education (21% of articles and 61% of books), and work (19% of articles and 39% of books). The subject of disability is dealt with in various fields of study and various disciplines. Most of the studies are based on the legal approach. It is to be hoped that there will be an increase in the philosophical and ethical study of disability, which has only recently entered the European debate.

J	Hollenweger, J; Moretti, M				Hollenweger, Judith; Moretti, Marta			Using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Children and Youth Version in Education Systems A New Approach to Eligibility	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION			English	Review						Eligibility; Education; Disability; Diversity	CULTURE	In developed countries, establishing eligibility for persons with disabilities is a requirement for accessing specialized services or benefits. The underlying conceptualizations of disability are often problematic because they concentrate on deficits but try to promote social participation and focus on dependence while trying to strengthen independence. In addition, such conceptualizations are unable to respond to the rights-based approach of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Version for Children and Youth provides a model and classification that allows relating disease- or impairment-specific information to participation in the life domains relevant for a specific policy area. Establishing eligibility in education systems needs to be compatible with the principles of inclusive education, participation, and social justice. In addition, the overall goals of education and individualized goals for a specific child with disabilities need to be taken into account. Using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Version for Children and Youth as a model and classification, the different factors influencing eligibility-related decisions (impairments, activity/participation, environment, personal factors) can be made transparent to provide the basis for a decision-making process to which parents and the child actively contribute.

J	Cattaneo, A				Cattaneo, Adriano			Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine Founder's Lecture 2011: Inequalities and Inequities in Breastfeeding: An International Perspective	BREASTFEEDING MEDICINE			English	Article							HEALTH; INTERVENTIONS; DURATION; SUPPORT; PROMOTION; POLICY; RATES; CARE	Breastfeeding is the biological norm for infant feeding but is also a social construct. As such, its rates and practices are determined by the same social determinants that shape health inequalities and inequities. In the past 30 years, several reports have drawn attention to the changing pattern of breastfeeding inequalities across countries and population groups. Breastfeeding rates tend to fall and rise following a similar pattern everywhere, although at different times and speed. The role of women within families and societies, the routines of maternity hospitals and other healthcare services, and the pressure exerted by the baby food industry are among the factors that influence the time and speed of changes in breastfeeding rates and practices across countries and population groups. Inequities (i.e., inequalities considered unfair and avoidable by reasonable action) can be redressed by interventions for the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding. Evidence-based and quality-implemented support and promotion activities, if applied without an equity lens, may increase inequities. Activities for the protection of breastfeeding (e.g., implementation and enforcement of the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes; legislations, regulations, and policies to remove obstacles and barriers to good-quality breastfeeding support and to protect women and mothers in the workforce; elimination of obstacles and barriers to breastfeeding anywhere, anyhow, and anytime mothers want) apply to all women and are less dependent on take up by the target population. If well designed and enforced, protective interventions contribute to reducing inequalities and inequities and to delivering promotion and support activities more effectively.

Methods A three-step approach was employed to: (i) identify the risk factors that contribute most substantially to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs); (ii) re-rank these risk factors based on the availability of effective preventive interventions warranting further cost-effectiveness analysis (and in some instances on evidence from existing cost-effectiveness analyses); and (iii) re-rank these risk factors in accordance with their relative contribution to health inequalities. Health inequalities between the Maori and non-Maori populations in New Zealand were used by way of illustration. Findings Seven of the top 10 risk factors prioritized for research on preventive interventions in New Zealand were also among the 10 risk factors Most highly ranked as contributing to DALYs in high-income countries of the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region. The final list of priority risk factors included tobacco use; alcohol use; high blood pressure; high blood cholesterol; overweight/obesity, and physical inactivity. All of these factors contributed to health inequalities. Effective interventions for preventing all of them are available, and for each risk factor there is at least one documented cost-saving preventive intervention. Conclusion The straightforward approach to prioritizing risk factors described in this paper may be applicable in many countries, and even in those countries that lack the capacity to perform additional cost-effectiveness analyses, this approach will still make it possible to determine which cost-effective interventions should be implemented in the short run.

International differences in self-reported health measures in 33 major metropolitan areas in Europe	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							MORBIDITY; COUNTRIES; VALIDITY; OBESITY; TRENDS	Background: The increasing concentration of populations into large conurbations in recent decades has not been matched by international health assessments, which remain largely focused at the country level. We aimed to demonstrate the use of routine survey data to compare the health of large metropolitan centres across Europe and determine the extent to which differences are due to socio-economic factors. Methods: Multilevel modelling of health survey data on 126 853 individuals from 33 metropolitan areas in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Spain, Belgium and Germany compared general health, longstanding illness, acute sickness, psychological distress and obesity with the average for all areas, accounting for education and social class. Results: We found some areas (Greater Glasgow; Greater Manchester, Cheshire and Merseyside; Northumberland, Tyne and Wear and South Yorkshire) had significantly higher levels of poor health. Other areas (West Flanders and Antwerp) had better than average health. Differences in individual socio-economic circumstances did not explain findings. With a few exceptions, acute sickness levels did not vary. Conclusion: Health tended to be worse in metropolitan areas in the north and west of the UK and the central belt and south east of Germany, and more favourable in Sweden and north west Belgium, even accounting for socio-economic composition of local populations. This study demonstrated that combining national health survey data covering different areas is viable but not without technical difficulties. Future comparisons between European regions should be made using standardized sampling, recruitment and data collection protocols, allowing proper monitoring of health inequalities.

The scoping review process systematically identified articles describing one or more cases of intersectoral action. Each article was then described in terms of the context of initiation, as well as the strategies, actors, tools and structures used to implement these initiatives. 128 unique articles were found describing intersectoral action across 43 countries. A majority of the cases appear to have initiated in the last decade. A variety of approaches were used to carry out intersectoral action, but articles varied in the richness of information included to describe different aspects of these initiatives. With this examination of cases across multiple countries and contexts, we can begin to clarify how intersectoral approaches to health equity have been used; however, the description of these complex, multi-actor processes in the published documents was generally superficial and sometimes entirely absent and improvements in such documentation in future publications is warranted. Richer sources of information such as interviews may facilitate a more comprehensive understanding from the perspective of multiple sectors involved.

This paper is a report of an integrative review of the international literature examining established nurse-led primary healthcare walk-in centres and their outcomes to understand whether they are effective in improving access to primary health care. Background. Reviews of nurse-led primary care walk-in centres have included centres staffed by family physicians and general practitioners. There is a paucity of evidence about walk-in centres staffed solely by nurses. Data sources. Studies were identified through an electronic search using the databases Medline, Cinahl and EBSCO from 1990 until July 2010. Papers were included if they examined walk-in centres providing nurse-led primary care for the general community. Only peer reviewed studies published in English were included. Review methods. An integrative approach utilizing Bowlings checklist facilitated a systematic appraisal of studies in regard to clarity of aims, objectives, methods and appropriate analysis of data. Results. Thirteen publications were categorized into five themes: users of walk-in centres, quality of care provided at walk-in centres, impact on other healthcare providers, perceptions of walk-in centres and satisfaction with walk-in centres. Conclusion. The possibility that walk-in centres create demand highlights the need for clearer evidence of the drivers of demand for health care in walk-in centres. Innovations in healthcare provision need to be matched with adaptation to nursing education to ensure an adequately prepared nursing workforce. Improvement in access to primary healthcare needs to be measured in terms of equity and the capacity this access has to fill identified gaps in primary healthcare provision in the community.

We therefore examine whether socioeconomic inequities exist in pregnancy exposures to multiple common environmental contaminants in air, water and food. Methods A Spanish population-based birth cohort study enrolled over 2000 pregnant women between 2004 and 2008. Questionnaires assessed parental education, occupation, country of birth, diet and many other factors. Environmental pollutant assessments included nitrogen dioxide as a marker of traffic-related air pollution, trihalomethanes as a marker of tap water disinfection by-products, organochlorine biomarkers measured in maternal serum during pregnancy (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane) and mercury concentrations measured in cord blood. Results Associations between socioeconomic status indicators and nitrogen dioxide and trihalomethanes were generally weak and inconsistent in direction. Concentrations of PCB, hexachlorobenzene and mercury were higher in higher social classes than lower social classes. p,p'-DDE and b-hexachlorocyclohexane were not related to social class. Social class explained between 1% and 5% of the variability in pollutant concentrations, much less than other variables such as region of residence, country of birth and maternal age. Discussion This study demonstrates that the general assumption that more disadvantaged populations have higher levels of exposure to environmental pollution does not always hold and requires further elucidation in different international settings.

The Commission on Social Determinants of Health drew attention to dramatic social gradients in health within most countries and made proposals for action. These inequalities are not inevitable. The purpose of this article is to report on activity that has taken place worldwide after the report by the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. First, we summarise the global situation. Second, we summarise an interim report of the emerging findings from an independent review of social determinants and the health divide, which was commissioned by the WHO European region. The world conference on social determinants of health will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in October, 2011. This summit provides an opportunity to galvanise support, prioritise action, and respond to the call by the Commission on Social Determinants of Health for social justice as a route to a fair distribution of health.

Four theories-John Rawls's theory of justice, the rights-based cosmopolitan theories of Thomas Pogge and Henry Shue, and Jennifer Ruger's health capability paradigm-are evaluated. The article shows that three of the four theories require the conduct of health research for justice in global health. The theories help identify the ends of justice to which ICR is to contribute, but they cannot tell us how to organize ICR to promote these ends. Aside from Ruger's health capability paradigm, the theories also lack an allocative principle for assigning specific duties to specific actors. This creates difficulties for establishing obligations for certain types of ICR actors.

These conditions include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), low birth weight, protein-energy malnutrition, chronic energy deficit of women, and micronutrient deficiencies. Although the rates of stunting or chronic protein-energy malnutrition are increasing in Africa, the absolute numbers of stunted children are much higher in Asia. The four common micronutrient deficiencies include those of iron, iodine, vitamin A, and zinc. All these conditions are responsible directly or indirectly for more than 50% of all under-5 deaths globally. According to more recent estimates, IUGR, stunting and severe wasting are responsible for one third of under-5 mortality. About 12% of deaths among under-5 children are attributed to the deficiency of the four common micronutrients. Despite tremendous progress in different disciplines and unprecedented improvement with many health indicators, persistently high undernutrition rates are a shame to the society. Human development is not possible without taking care to control undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. Poverty, food insecurity, ignorance, lack of appropriate infant and young child feeding practices, heavy burden of infectious illnesses, and poor hygiene and sanitation are factors responsible for the high levels of maternal and child undernutrition in developing countries. These factors can be controlled or removed by scaling up direct nutrition interventions and eliminating the root conditions including female illiteracy, lack of livelihoods, lack of women's empowerment, and poor hygiene and sanitation.

We find that remittances play an important role in improving primary and secondary school attainment, increasing life expectancy and reducing infant mortality. Our results suggest that as migration laws continue to support greater emigration and remittances, policies should be enacted to facilitate the flow of remittances as they represent a significant source for economic development.

In this paper we describe and analyse the inequities in international aid flows to these countries from a health equity and "responsibility to protect" perspective. Review of public health and health systems literature and examination of international aid flows reveals that countries with a comparable gross national income receive total aid flows 11 to 12 times larger than do Myanmar (Burma) and DPR Korea (North Korea). Although the issue of aid effectiveness in these governance contexts remains a significant challenge, there is nonetheless a joint national and international responsibility to protect women and children through the careful targeting of health humanitarian aid and development programs.

Drawing on data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, this article firstly examines the evidence for intergenerational transmission of socio-economic disadvantage from parents to young children. It then examines parents' jobs as another source of social inequality. Results confirm that children's healthy development is affected by family income, by parents' hours of work and by the quality of parents' jobs. Job combinations that include long work hours of mothers and fathers and poorer quality jobs are associated with elevated rates of parental mental health problems, less time spent in developmentally important activities with children, and socio-emotional developmental difficulties for children. The evidence suggests that these effects are greater within low income families. These findings highlight the need for social and economic policies to move beyond simplistic notions of promoting parental workforce participation as a way of reducing the adverse effects of social disadvantage. A more nuanced approach is required that considers the additional impacts of the quality and characteristics of jobs, especially for the parents of young children.

The development of the Olympic Park in Stratford for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games provides the opportunity to take advantage of a natural experiment to examine the impact of large-scale urban regeneration on the health and well-being of young people and their families. Design and methods: A prospective school-based survey of adolescents (11-12 years) with parent data collected through face-to-face interviews at home. Adolescents will be recruited from six randomly selected schools in an area receiving large-scale urban regeneration (London Borough of Newham) and compared with adolescents in 18 schools in three comparison areas with no equivalent regeneration (London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Barking & Dagenham). Baseline data will be completed prior to the start of the London Olympics (July 2012) with follow-up at 6 and 18 months postintervention. Primary outcomes are: pre-post change in adolescent and parent mental health and well-being, physical activity and parental employment status. Secondary outcomes include: pre-post change in social cohesion, smoking, alcohol use, diet and body mass index. The study will account for individual and environmental contextual effects in evaluating changes to identified outcomes. A nested longitudinal qualitative study will explore families' experiences of regeneration in order to unpack the process by which regeneration impacts on health and well-being. Ethics and dissemination: The study has approval from Queen Mary University of London Ethics Committee (QMREC2011/40), the Association of Directors of Children's Services (RGE110927) and the London Boroughs Research Governance Framework (CERGF113). Fieldworkers have had advanced Criminal Records Bureau clearance. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, national and international conferences, through participating schools and the study website (http://www.orielproject.co.uk).

Sexual offending is both a social and a public health issue. Victim surveys illustrate high incidence and prevalence levels, and it is commonly accepted that there is considerable hidden sexual victimisation. There are significant levels of psychiatric morbidity in survivors of sexual offences. Psychological interventions are generally based on behavioural or psychodynamic theories. Behavioural interventions fall into two main groups: those based on traditional classical conditioning and/or operant learning theory and those based on cognitive behavioural approaches. Approaches may overlap. Interventions associated with traditional classical and operant learning theory are referred to as behaviour modification or behaviour therapy, and focus explicitly on changing behaviour by administering a stimulus and measuring its effect on overt behaviour. Within sex offender treatment, examples include aversion therapy, covert sensitisation or olfactory conditioning. Cognitive behavioural therapies are intended to change internal processes thoughts, beliefs, emotions, physiological arousal - alongside changing overt behaviour, such as social skills or coping behaviours. They may involve establishing links between offenders' thoughts, feelings and actions about offending behaviour; correction of offenders' misperceptions, irrational beliefs and reasoning biases associated with their offending; teaching offenders to monitor their own thoughts, feelings and behaviours associated with offending; and promoting alternative ways of coping with deviant sexual thoughts and desires. Psychodynamic interventions share a common root in psychoanalytic theory. This posits that sexual offending arises through an imbalance of the three components of mind: the id, the ego and the superego, with sexual offenders having temperamental imbalance of a powerful id (increased sexual impulses and libido) and a weak superego (a low level of moral probation), which are also impacted by early environment. This updates a previous Cochrane review but is based on a new protocol. Objectives To assess the effects of psychological interventions on those who have sexually offended or are at risk of offending. Search methods In September 2010 we searched: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), Biosis Previews, CINAHL, COPAC, Dissertation Abstracts, EMBASE, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), ISI Proceedings, Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts Database, PsycINFO, OpenSIGLE, Social Care Online, Sociological Abstracts, UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database and ZETOC. We contacted numerous experts in the field. Selection criteria Randomised trials comparing psychological intervention with standard care or another psychological therapy given to adults treated in institutional or community settings for sexual behaviours that have resulted in conviction or caution for sexual offences, or who are seeking treatment voluntarily for behaviours classified as illegal. Data collection and analysis At least two authors, working independently, selected studies, extracted data and assessed the studies' risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information including details of methods and outcome data. Main results We included ten studies involving data from 944 adults, all male. Five trials involved primarily cognitive behavioural interventions (CBT) (n = 664). Of these, four compared CBT with no treatment or wait list control, and one compared CBT with standard care. Only one study collected data on the primary outcome. The largest study (n = 484) involved the most complex intervention versus no treatment. Long-term outcome data are reported for groups in which the mean years 'at risk' in the community are similar (8.3 years for treatment (n = 259) compared to 8.4 in the control group (n = 225)). There was no difference between these groups in terms of the risk of reoffending as measured by reconviction for sexual offences (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.56). Four trials (n = 70) compared one behavioural programme with an alternative behavioural programme or with wait list control. No meta-analysis was possible for this comparison. For two studies (both cross-over, n = 29) no disaggregated data were available. The remaining two behavioural studies compared imaginal desensitisation with either covert sensitisation or as part of adjunctive drug therapy (n = 20 and 21, respectively). In these two studies, results for the primary outcome (being 'charged with anomalous behaviour') were encouraging, with only one new charge for the treated groups over one year in the former study, and in the latter study, only one new charge (in the drug-only group) over two years. One study compared psychodynamic intervention with probation. Results for this study (n = 231) indicate a slight trend in favour of the control group (probation) over the intervention (group therapy) in terms of sexual offending as measured by rearrest (RR 1.87; 95% CI 0.78 to 4.47) at 10-year follow-up. Data for adverse events, 'sexually anomalous urges' and for secondary outcomes thought to be 'dynamic' risk factors for reoffending, including anger and cognitive distortions, were limited. Authors' conclusions The inescapable conclusion of this review is the need for further randomised controlled trials. While we recognise that randomisation is considered by some to be unethical or politically unacceptable (both of which are based on the faulty premise that the experimental treatment is superior to the control - this being the point of the trial to begin with), without such evidence, the area will fail to progress. Not only could this result in the continued use of ineffective (and potentially harmful) interventions, but it also means that society is lured into a false sense of security in the belief that once the individual has been treated, their risk of reoffending is reduced. Current available evidence does not support this belief. Future trials should concentrate on minimising risk of bias, maximising quality of reporting and including follow-up for a minimum of five years 'at risk' in the community.

In recent years, several disorder-specific interventions have been developed. This is an update of a review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2006. Objectives To assess the effects of psychological interventions for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Search methods We searched the following databases: CENTRAL 2010(3), MEDLINE (1950 to October 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010, week 39), ASSIA (1987 to November 2010), BIOSIS (1985 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to October 2010), Dissertation Abstracts International (31 January 2011), National Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts (15 October 2010), PsycINFO (1872 to October Week 1 2010), Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 10 October 2010), Sociological Abstracts (1963 to October 2010), ZETOC (15 October 2010) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (15 October 2010). In addition, we searched Dissertation Abstracts International in January 2011 and ICTRP in August 2011. Selection criteria Randomised studies with samples of patients with BPD comparing a specific psychotherapeutic intervention against a control intervention without any specific mode of action or against a comparative specific psychotherapeutic intervention. Outcomes included overall BPD severity, BPD symptoms (DSM-IV criteria), psychopathology associated with but not specific to BPD, attrition and adverse effects. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data. Main results Twenty-eight studies involving a total of 1804 participants with BPD were included. Interventions were classified as comprehensive psychotherapies if they included individual psychotherapy as a substantial part of the treatment programme, or as non-comprehensive if they did not. Among comprehensive psychotherapies, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT), mentalisation-based treatment in a partial hospitalisation setting (MBT-PH), outpatient MBT (MBT-out), transference-focused therapy (TFP), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and interpersonal therapy for BPD (IPT-BPD) were tested against a control condition. Direct comparisons of comprehensive psychotherapies included DBT versus client-centered therapy (CCT); schema-focused therapy (SFT) versus TFP; SFT versus SFT plus telephone availability of therapist in case of crisis (SFT+TA); cognitive therapy (CT) versus CCT, and CT versus IPT. Non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions comprised DBT-group skills training only (DBT-ST), emotion regulation group therapy (ERG), schema-focused group therapy (SFT-G), systems training for emotional predictability and problemsolving for borderline personality disorder (STEPPS), STEPPS plus individual therapy (STEPPS+IT), manual-assisted cognitive treatment (MACT) and psychoeducation (PE). The only direct comparison of an non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic intervention against another was MACT versus MACT plus therapeutic assessment (MACT+). Inpatient treatment was examined in one study where DBT for PTSD (DBT-PTSD) was compared with a waiting list control. No trials were identified for cognitive analytical therapy (CAT). Data were sparse for individual interventions, and allowed for meta-analytic pooling only for DBT compared with treatment as usual (TAU) for four outcomes. There were moderate to large statistically significant effects indicating a beneficial effect of DBT over TAU for anger (n = 46, two RCTs; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.43 to -0.22; I-2 = 0%), parasuicidality (n = 110, three RCTs; SMD -0.54, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.16; I-2 = 0%) and mental health (n = 74, two RCTs; SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.24 I-2 = 30%). There was no indication of statistical superiority of DBT over TAU in terms of keeping participants in treatment (n = 252, five RCTs; risk ratio 1.25, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.92). All remaining findings were based on single study estimates of effect. Statistically significant between-group differences for comparisons of psychotherapies against controls were observed for BPD core pathology and associated psychopathology for the following interventions: DBT, DBT-PTSD, MBT-PH, MBT-out, TFP and IPT-BPD. IPT was only indicated as being effective in the treatment of associated depression. No statistically significant effects were found for CBT and DDP interventions on either outcome, with the effect sizes moderate for DDP and small for CBT. For comparisons between different comprehensive psychotherapies, statistically significant superiority was demonstrated for DBT over CCT (core and associated pathology) and SFT over TFP (BPD severity and treatment retention). There were also encouraging results for each of the non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions investigated in terms of both core and associated pathology. No data were available for adverse effects of any psychotherapy. Authors' conclusions There are indications of beneficial effects for both comprehensive psychotherapies as well as non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions for BPD core pathology and associated general psychopathology. DBT has been studied most intensely, followed by MBT, TFP, SFT and STEPPS. However, none of the treatments has a very robust evidence base, and there are some concerns regarding the quality of individual studies. Overall, the findings support a substantial role for psychotherapy in the treatment of people with BPD but clearly indicate a need for replicatory studies.

J	Witter, S; Fretheim, A; Kessy, FL; Lindahl, AK				Witter, Sophie; Fretheim, Atle; Kessy, Flora L.; Lindahl, Anne Karin			Paying for performance to improve the delivery of health interventions in low- and middle-income countries	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							IMPACT; CARE; SERVICES; QUALITY; PAYMENT; IMMUNIZATION; PARTNERSHIP	Background There is a growing interest in paying for performance as a means to align the incentives of health workers and health providers with public health goals. However, there is currently a lack of rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of these strategies in improving health care and health, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. Moreover, paying for performance is a complex intervention with uncertain benefits and potential harms. A review of evidence on effectiveness is therefore timely, especially as this is an area of growing interest for funders and governments. Objectives To assess the current evidence for the effects of paying for performance on the provision of health care and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. Search methods We searched more than 15 databases in 2009, including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register (searched 3 March 2009), CENTRAL (2009, Issue 1) (searched 3 March 2009), MEDLINE, Ovid (1948 to present) (searched 24 June 2011), EMBASE, Ovid (1980 to 2009 Week 09) (searched 2 March 2009), EconLit, Ovid (1969 to February 2009) (searched 5 March 2009), as well as the Social Sciences Citation Index, ISI Web of Science (1975 to present) (searched 8 September 2010). We also searched the websites and online resources of numerous international agencies, organisations and universities to find relevant grey literature and contacted experts in the field. We carried out an updated search on the Results-Based Financing website in April 2011, and re-ran the MEDLINE search in June 2011. Selection criteria Pay for performance refers to the transfer of money or material goods conditional on taking a measurable action or achieving a predetermined performance target. To be included, a study had to report at least one of the following outcomes: changes in targeted measures of provider performance, such as the delivery or utilisation of healthcare services, or patient outcomes, unintended effects and/or changes in resource use. Studies also needed to use one of the following study designs: randomised trial, non-randomised trial, controlled before-after study or interrupted time series study, and had to have been conducted in low-or middle-income countries (as defined by the World Bank). Data collection and analysis We aimed to present a meta-analysis of results. However, due to the limited number of studies in each category, the diversity of intervention designs and study methods, as well as important contextual differences, we present a narrative synthesis with separate results from each study. Main results Nine studies were included in the review: one randomised trial, six controlled before-after studies and two interrupted time series studies (or studies which could be re-analysed as such). The interventions were varied: one used target payments linked to quality of care (in the Philippines). Two used target payments linked to coverage indicators (in Tanzania and Zambia). Three used conditional cash transfers, modified by quality measurements (in Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo). Two used conditional cash transfers without quality measures (in Rwanda and Vietnam). One used a mix of conditional cash transfers and target payments (China). Targeted services also varied. Most of the interventions used a wide range of targets covering inpatient, outpatient and preventive care, including a strong emphasis on services for women and children. However, one focused specifically on tuberculosis (the main outcome measure was cases detected); one on hospital revenues; and one on improved treatment of common illnesses in under-sixes. Participants were in most cases in a mix of public and faith-based facilities (dispensaries, health posts, health centres and hospitals), though districts were also involved and in one case payments were made direct to individual private practitioners. One study was considered to have low risk of bias and one a moderate risk of bias. The other seven studies had a high risk of bias. Only one study included any patient health indicators. Of the four outcome measures, two showed significant improvement for the intervention group (wasting and self reported health by parents of the under-fives), while two showed no significant difference (being C-reactive protein (CRP)-negative and not anaemic). The two more robust studies both found mixed results - gains for some indicators but no improvement for others. Almost all dimensions of potential impact remain under-studied, including intended and unintended impact on health outcomes, equity, organisational change, user payments and satisfaction, resource use and staff satisfaction. Authors' conclusions The current evidence base is too weak to draw general conclusions; more robust and also comprehensive studies are needed. Performance based funding is not a uniform intervention, but rather a range of approaches. Its effects depend on the interaction of several variables, including the design of the intervention (e. g. who receives payments, the magnitude of the incentives, the targets and how they are measured), the amount of additional funding, other ancillary components such as technical support, and contextual factors, including the organisational context in which it is implemented.

A qualitative approach with open-ended qualitative interviews was used to explore young, married men's first time experiences of early childbearing, their sexual and reproductive decision making and the meanings they make of their role as husbands and fathers. The results offer a nuanced picture of the men's vulnerability in becoming young fathers and having to assume their role as family decision-makers, while still being inexperienced in matters related to the health of their wives and newborn child. Constraints to gender equality and traditional norms and values continue to pose barriers to both young men and women making independent decisions in relation to marriage and childbearing. Men's involvement is necessary in healthcare programmes designed to improve women's sexual and reproductive health and the health of the newborn. Young, first-time fathers, in particular, need support and empowerment.

J	Kremen, C; Iles, A; Bacon, C				Kremen, Claire; Iles, Alastair; Bacon, Christopher			Diversified Farming Systems: An Agroecological, Systems-based Alternative to Modern Industrial Agriculture	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						agroecology; ecological diversification; food justice; food sovereignty; industrialized agriculture	ORGANIC AGRICULTURE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SHADE COFFEE; FOOD; SUSTAINABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; CONSEQUENCES; IMPACTS; HEALTH	This Special Issue on Diversified Farming Systems is motivated by a desire to understand how agriculture designed according to whole systems, agroecological principles can contribute to creating a more sustainable, socially just, and secure global food system. We first define Diversified Farming Systems (DFS) as farming practices and landscapes that intentionally include functional biodiversity at multiple spatial and/or temporal scales in order to maintain ecosystem services that provide critical inputs to agriculture, such as soil fertility, pest and disease control, water use efficiency, and pollination. We explore to what extent DFS overlap or are differentiated from existing concepts such as sustainable, multifunctional, organic or ecoagriculture. DFS are components of social-ecological systems that depend on certain combinations of traditional and contemporary knowledge, cultures, practices, and governance structures. Further, as ecosystem services are generated and regenerated within a DFS, the resulting social benefits in turn support the maintenance of the DFS, enhancing its ability to provision these services sustainably. We explore how social institutions, particularly alternative agri-food networks and agrarian movements, may serve to promote DFS approaches, but note that such networks and movements have other primary goals and are not always explicitly connected to the environmental and agroecological concerns embodied within the DFS concept. We examine global trends in agriculture to investigate to what extent industrialized forms of agriculture are replacing former DFS, assess the current and potential contributions of DFS to food security, food sovereignty and the global food supply, and determine where and under what circumstances DFS are expanding rather than contracting.

J	Asnake, M; Bishaw, T				Asnake, Mengistu; Bishaw, Tewabech			The Addis Ababa Declaration on Global Health Equity: A call to action	ETHIOPIAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								,Background: Health inequalities occur -through differences in health, status or in the distribution of health determinants between different population groups. Access to basic health services was affirmed as a fundamental human Tight by the declaration of AlmarAta,in 1978. The reality is that in 2012, more than 40 years 'later, -many people,in resource poor settings Still do not have.equitable access to even basic health services. In many places this 'gap is widening. Rationale: In order to tackle the different global health inequities there is still a need for a concerted effort by different - :public health experts and institutions. As a multidisciplinary professional association, the World Federation of Public Health Associations (WFPHA) which has a mission of promoting and protecting global public health is one of the inititutions which stand for such causes. One of-the WFPHA platforms for such kind of initiatives is its triennial World Congress On Public Health, a scientific conference for public health professionals from around. the world. " The'WFPHA Congress: The 13th World-Congress on Public Health with the theme of "Moving towards Global Health Equity: Opportunities and Threats", was held in Addis, Ababa, Ethiopia from April 23-27, 2012. The congress brought together over 3000 public health experts from more than 100 countries to discuss different health issues including its major theme global health equity. Participants of the congress touched several public health issues that include: major health threats, health inequity, migration, fair trade, revised MDGs, development aid and health Workforce which were used to forward recommendation for action. Call for action: Based on the different interaction, at the conclusion of the 13th World Congress on Public Health, the " WFPHA issued the Addis Ababa Declaration, a call to action on -Global' Health Equity.

J	Kitaw, Y; Mariam, DH				Kitaw, Yayehyirad; Mariam, Damen Haile			Moving towards global health equity: Opportunities and threats: An African perspective	ETHIOPIAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								Background: The theme of the 13`11 World Congress.ongublic Health, "Moving Towards Global Health Equity: Opportunities and"Threats"; strikes an optimistic note as the gaps within and between countries are greater than at any time in recent history. There is no consensus on what globalization is, but most agree that it will substantially-shape.all the other mdjor trends in the world even though its impacts are highly asymmetric "with disproportionate benefits for rich countries and multinationals, leaving poor countries and people behind". The current globalization has major influence on health. Objective: This is a review article that attempts to reflect on the African perspective on health equity in view of the complex situations of globalization as welras diverse partnership in the sector. Results: Equity has been a long quest in public health and global health equity couldte seen as part of the new 'global health diplomacy' with recent major drives to meet the global equity gap made more complex by the growing involvement of private (in particular for profit) organizations. There are nb 'givens' in globalization; Africa would have to 'negotiate' its position in the tide of globalization. Sub-Saharan Africa will remain an enduring preoccupation and target of global policies and interventions as "the current rates of progress will not be able to provide satisfactory health care to its inhabitants by 2020" one reason being the effect of globalization as exemplified by...the highly inadequate human resources for health. Conclusions: Negotiating Africa's future in a globalizing world complicated by conflicting interests, recurring and deepening economic crisis, and bewildering cacophony of actors, eonditionalities and requirements will not be easy. Africa should continuously monitor developments and try to play a proactive role, define its priorities and s.trategize including developing its intellectual capital.-	[Mariam, Damen Haile] Univ Addis Ababa, Sch Publ Hlth, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia	Addis Ababa University		yayehyiradk@yahoo.com							92	2	3	2	15	ADDIS ABABA UNIV, DEPT COMMUNITY HEALTH	ADDIS ABABA	TIKUR ANBESSA HOSP, PO BOX 32812, ADDIS ABABA, 00000, ETHIOPIA	1021-6790			ETHIOP J HEALTH DEV	Ethiop.

Migration, social mobility and common mental disorders: critical review of the literature and meta-analysis	ETHNICITY & HEALTH			English	Article						migration; social mobility; common mental disorders; refugees; socioeconomic status; ethnic minorities	SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; ETHNIC INEQUALITIES; HEALTH; IMMIGRANTS; ILLNESS; UNDEREMPLOYMENT; ASSOCIATION; ADAPTATION; MORTALITY	Objective. Changes in socio-economic position in people who migrate may have adverse associations with mental health. The main objective of this review was to assess the association of social mobility with common mental disorders in migrant and second-generation groups, to inform future research. Design. Systematic review and meta-analysis of English-language studies assessing the association of social mobility in migrant or second-generation groups with common mental disorders. Approaches to operationalise 'social mobility' were reviewed. Results. Twelve studies (n = 18,548) met criteria for retrieval. Very few included second-generation groups, and most studies were cross-sectional in design. Approaches to operationalise 'social mobility' varied between studies. Downward intragenerational social mobility was associated with migration in the majority of studies. Random effects meta-analysis (n = 5179) suggested that migrants to higher income countries who experienced downward mobility or underemployment were more likely to screen positive for common mental disorders, relative to migrants who were upwardly mobile or experienced no changes to socio-economic position. Conclusions on second-generation groups were limited by the lack of research highlighted for these groups. Downward intragenerational mobility associated with migration may be associated with vulnerability to common mental disorders in some migrant groups. Conclusion. Given the increasing scale of global migration, further research is needed to clarify how changes to socio-economic position associated with international migration may impact on the mental health of migrants, and in their children.

GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						human rights; health systems; policy; equity; accountability	CHILD-SURVIVAL; EQUITY; MEXICO; REFORM; SEX	Global initiatives and recent G8 commitments to health systems strengthening have brought increased attention to factors affecting health system performance. While equity concerns and human rights language appear often in the global health discourse, their inclusion in health systems efforts beyond rhetorical pronouncements is limited. Building on recent work assessing the extent to which features compatible with the right to health are incorporated into national health systems, we examine how health systems frameworks have thus far integrated human rights concepts and human rights-based approaches to health in their conceptualisation. Findings point to the potential value of the inclusion of human rights in these articulations to increase the participation or involvement of clients in health systems, to broaden the concept of equity, to bring attention to laws and policies beyond regulation and to strengthen accountability mechanisms.

The article begins with an overview of the contribution of four scientific foundations toward the discipline's core agenda: to scale up services for people with mental disorders and to promote their human rights. Next, the article highlights four recent, key events that are indicative of the actions shaping the discipline: the Mental Health Gap Action Programme to synthesize evidence on what treatments are effective for a range of mental disorders; the evidence on task shifting to nonspecialist health workers to deliver these treatments; the Movement for Global Mental Health's efforts to build a common platform for professionals and civil society to advocate for their shared goal; and the Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health, which has identified the research priorities that, within the next decade, can lead to substantial improvements in the lives of people living with mental disorders. The article ends by examining the major challenges for the field, and the opportunities for addressing them in the future. (HARV REV PSYCHIATRY 2012; 20: 6-12.)

Bush to the global HIV/AIDS epidemic at the intersection of neo-conservatism and neo-liberalism, highlighting the various ways their distinct gender logics collide to reproduce masculine privilege and gender inequalities on a global scale. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the United States global HIV/AIDS policy and is the largest commitment made by any single nation for an international health project. My analysis is based on PEPFAR's 'formal' policy texts, including its authorizing legislation, five-year strategic framework and specific policy directives for recipient organizations. In addition, I examine more 'informal' texts like Congressional reports and Presidential speeches delivered by George W. Bush on various occasions. Drawing on a rich body of feminist ethnographic work in the fields of global governance, international political economy, organizational theory and sexuality and masculinity studies, the following article examines the various ways market-based norms and practices can legitimate the moral imperatives of neo-conservatism to promote 'traditional' values and institutions in the global South as leading solutions to global problems and insecurities.

Governing for a Healthy Population: Towards an Understanding of How Decision-Making Will Determine Our Global Health in a Changing Climate	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						global health; climate change; adaptive capacity; equity; governance; decision-making	ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; SCIENCE; POLICY; COMPLEXITY; FRAMEWORK; CAPACITY	Enhancing the adaptive capacity of individuals, communities, institutions and nations is pivotal to protecting and improving human health and well-being in the face of systemic social inequity plus dangerous climate change. However, research on the determinants of adaptive capacity in relation to health, particularly concerning the role of governance, is in its infancy. This paper highlights the intersections between global health, climate change and governance. It presents an overview of these key concerns, their relation to each other, and the potential that a greater understanding of governance may present opportunities to strengthen policy and action responses to the health effects of climate change. Important parallels between addressing health inequities and sustainable development practices in the face of global environmental change are also highlighted. We propose that governance can be investigated through two key lenses within the earth system governance theoretical framework; agency and architecture. These two governance concepts can be evaluated using methods of social network research and policy analysis using case studies and is the subject of further research.

Age differences in the association of childhood obesity with area-level and school-level deprivation: cross-classified multilevel analysis of cross-sectional data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						BMI; deprivation; multilevel analysis; children	BODY-MASS INDEX; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL; HEALTH RESEARCH; SOCIAL-CLASS; WEIGHT; OVERWEIGHT; CHILDREN	Objective: Evidence suggests that area-level deprivation is associated with obesity independently of individual socioeconomic status; however, although the school may also have an impact on child health, few studies have investigated the association between school-level deprivation and the body mass index (BMI) of students. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the BMI for children of different ages and area-level and school-level deprivation. Subjects: BMI measurements were collected through the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) that samples from two school years: 396 171 reception year pupils (4-5-year olds) and 392 344 year 6 pupils (10-11-year olds) from 14 054 primary schools in England. Design: Cross-classified multilevel models with four levels: individual (n = 788 525), lower super output areas corresponding to area of residence (n = 29 606), schools (n = 14 054) and primary care trusts (PCTs, n = 143), which coordinate the collection of data within a large area, were used to study the relationship between measures of deprivation at an area and school level, and childhood BMI within England. Results: A positive association was found between the area and school measures of deprivation, and student BMI. Both the measures of deprivation explained a greater proportion of variance in BMI z-scores for year 6 students than for the reception year students, with a greater difference between the year groups found with the school-level measure of socioeconomic status than for the the area-level measure. Conclusions: Deprivation explains a greater proportion of the variance in BMI for older compared with younger children, perhaps reflecting the impact of deprivation as children age, highlighting the widening of health inequalities through childhood. The association with school-level deprivation illustrates the impact of the school on BMI status throughout the primary school years.

It reviews international concepts of well-being as well as those within social work to consider a deeper exploration of the meanings of well-being. Dimensions of well-being that resonate with social work values include eliminating poverty; promoting social inclusion and eliminating oppression; eliminating all forms of violence in society; increasing investments in health, education, and social supports; and the protection and restoration of environmental resources and the biosphere. Frameworks for incorporating concepts of well-being in social work practice, research, and teaching are proposed.

J	Dowdle, WR; Cochi, SL				Dowdle, Walter R.; Cochi, Stephen L.			The principles and feasibility of disease eradication	VACCINE			English	Article						Eradication; Disease; Global	POLIO ERADICATION	Smallpox eradication framed disease eradication as a monumental public health achievement in global health equity. The principles of disease eradication are encapsulated in a constellation of four conditions: biologic feasibility, adequate public health infrastructure, sufficient funding, and sustained political/societal will. Where the constellation exists, national eradication occurs in the absence of a global initiative. Assessing the feasibility of global eradication requires determining the constellation gaps for nations of all regions and identifying the human and financial resources to fill the gaps. The economic and humanitarian benefits of eradication have strong appeal. Global polio and guinea worm efforts are underway. Regional eradication of measles and rubella has been achieved in the Americas and other diseases have been proposed. Global decisions on disease eradication should include careful consideration of opportunity costs and prioritization of limited global health resources, with the objective of providing the most appropriate, cost-beneficial, and equitable outcome of disease control.

The lack of accessibility, scarce availability and the poor quality of health services and personnel in the remote rural and underdeveloped urban areas have been the major obstacles to the delivery of quality health care services in a vast and culturally diverse country with inter- and intra-regional variations and inequalities. The already over-stretched public health care system has been grappling with the deficiencies in linkage with the collateral health determinants, gross shortage and non utilization of infrastructure, financial and human resources. Revitalizing the existing primary health care infrastructure under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) will bring about the long overdue architectural corrections in the health care sector and be able to provide accessible, affordable, accountable, effective and reliable health care especially to the under-privileged sections of the society. NRHM is based on the principles of decentralisation of the health system, empowerment of the community and the panchayati raj institutions. Effective integration of health concerns with other health determinants like sanitation, hygiene and nutrition through district health plan is being made.

The Health Systems Strengthening for Equity (HSSE) project sought to assess the alignment between national policy and regulation, preservice training, district level expectations, and clinical practice of cadres providing some or all components of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) in Malawi and Tanzania. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used, including key informant interviews, a survey of District Health Management Teams, and a survey of health providers employed at a representative sample of health facilities. Results: A lack of alignment between national policy and regulation, training, and clinical practice was observed in both countries, particularly for cadres with less preservice training; a closer alignment was found between district level expectations and reported clinical practice. There is ineffective use of cadres that are trained and authorized to provide EmOC, but who are not delivering care, especially assisted vaginal delivery. Conclusion: Better alignment between policy and practice, and support and training, and more efficient utilization of clinical staff are needed to achieve the quality health care for which the Malawian and Tanzanian health ministries and governments are accountable.

Housing Quality, Housing Instability, and Maternal Mental Health	JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE			English	Article						Housing; Depression; Anxiety; Residential instability; Stress; Housing quality	BUILT ENVIRONMENT; DEPRESSION; STRESS; HOME; INEQUALITIES; DIMENSIONS	Poor housing conditions and residential instability have been associated with distress among women; however, this association could be the result of other social factors related to housing, such as intimate partner violence (IPV) and economic hardship. We examined associations of housing conditions and instability with maternal depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) while accounting for IPV and economic hardship in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 2,104). In the third study wave, interviewers rated indoor housing quality, including housing deterioration (e.g., peeling paint and holes in floor) and housing disarray (e.g., dark, crowded, and noisy). Mothers reported whether they had moved more than twice in the past two years, an indicator of housing instability. A screening for depression and GAD was obtained from questions derived from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form in the second and third study waves. IPV and economic hardship were assessed through questionnaire. In this sample, 16% of women were classified as having probable depression and 5% as having probable GAD. In adjusted analyses, mothers experiencing housing disarray (odds ratio [OR], 1.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0, 1.7]) and instability (OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2, 2.3]) were more likely to screen positive for depression. In addition, those experiencing housing instability were more likely to screen positive for GAD (OR 1.9 [95% CI, 1.2, 3.0]) even after adjusting for other social factors. No associations were noted between housing deterioration and maternal mental health. Similar associations were noted when incident cases of probable depression and GAD were examined. Housing instability and disarray, but not deterioration, are associated with screening positive for depression and generalized anxiety among women regardless of other social stressors present in their lives. Housing could potentially present a point of intervention to prevent mental health consequences among mothers and possibly their children.

Nursing Inquiry 2011; 18: 359-368 Promoting the health of Europeans in a rapidly changing world: a historical study of the implementation of World Health Organisation policies by the Nursing and Midwifery Unit, European Regional Office, 1970-2003 The World Health Organisation (WHO) was inaugurated in 1948. Formed in a period of post-war devastation, WHO aimed to develop and meet goals that would rebuild the health of shattered populations. The historical study reported here examined the work of the Nursing and Midwifery Unit (NMU) of WHO's European Regional Office during the later part of the twentieth century. The study examined archive sources lodged at the NMU archive. The sources included manuscripts relating to important NMU initiatives, reports and papers published by WHO, and a range of secondary sources. The study identified three main driving forces in the work of the NMU of the European Regional Office of WHO. One of the strongest of these was a drive to develop and promote the nursing profession within the countries of the European Region. The second was the promulgation and implementation of the positive public health strategies of WHO, particularly its '38 Targets for Health for All by the Year 2000'. The third focussed on securing equity across the European continent and on promoting the development of the nursing professions in poorer and less-developed countries. The study concludes that the nursing professions in European states grew in strength and influence, and that the health of populations improved throughout the continent between 1970 and 2003. It discusses the extent to which the role of the NMU in these advances may have been significant.

J	Bose, CE				Bose, Christine E.			Eastern Sociological Society Presidential Address: Globalizing Gender Issues: Many Voices, Different Choices	SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM			English	Article						feminist research; gender inequality; globalization; intersectionality; property ownership; transnational studies		Why are the important gender inequality issues different in various countries around the world? This question is answered using a comparative perspective on extant research about gender inequalities in the regions of the world. Just as there is diversity among individual women, based on their intersecting axes of age, race, ethnicity, class, marital status, sexual orientation, religion, or other characteristics, I argue that there is diversity across countries in their gender inequalities based on intersecting axes of transnational, regional, cross-cutting, and unique national issues that structure gendered or feminist concerns within any country. Global and regional dynamics are the interrelated foundations on which broad gender inequalities are built. Major transnational dynamics include neoliberal economics, migration, and violence, while regional patterns include nation building and gendered inequalities in education and property ownership. On the other hand, unique national trajectories and cross-cutting themes, found in a few nations in each region, add much greater variation to those basic inequalities. Some of those cross-cutting themes are problems generated by health status and health services, the relationship of religion to the state, and war or militarism.

J	Pritchard, C; Hickish, T				Pritchard, C.; Hickish, T.			Comparing cancer mortality and GDP health expenditure in England and Wales with other major developed countries from 1979 to 2006	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						international; comparison; deaths; age	SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; UNITED-STATES; SURVIVAL; PERSPECTIVE; UK	BACKGROUND: Cancer and gross-domestic-product on health expenditure (GDPHE) are critical issues for major developed countries (MDC). Each country's economic input, GDPHE 1980-2005 is contrasted with clinical outputs, cancer mortality rates (CMRs), to compare their efficiency and effectiveness in reducing CMR. METHODS: World Health Organization's CMR data for baseline years (1979-1981) are compared with 2004-2006 by sex and age. The chi(2)-tests are used to determine differences between MDC. Efficiency is analysed by calculating a ratio of average GDPHE to reduced CMR over the period. RESULTS: Inputs: All the countries GDPHE grew substantially. For the United Kingdom this reached 9.3%, which is below the MDC average (10%). Outputs: CMR fell substantially (>20%) in six of the ten countries. The male average (15-74 years) CMR in England and Wales had been third highest but by 2004-2006 was sixth, a 31% reduction, which was significantly greater than seven other countries. Initially England and Wales female average CMR was the highest of all countries and is now the second highest. There were significantly greater reductions for the 55-64 and 65-74 years old than in seven and four countries, respectively. GDPHE reduced CMR ratios - the average GDPHE : reduced CMR ratio of England and Wales was 1 : 120, greater than all MDC and double that in four countries. CONCLUSION: Comparing GDPHE input with CMR output showed that relatively the NHS achieved more with proportionately less than other MDC.

J	Southall, D				Southall, David			Armed conflict women and girls who are pregnant, infants and children; a neglected public health challenge. What can health professionals do?	EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								Without security, adequate healthcare is not possible. Armed conflicts continue to be waged with pregnant women and girls, babies and children affected most. Most countries in conflict are poorly resourced and their mortality and morbidity statistics so much higher than rich countries that nothing short of a global revolution to create equity is going to solve the problem. When the arms trade is added in and analysed the maternal and child mortality rates for those countries exporting most of these killing machines is so much lower than the countries in which they are used that we have an ethical issue that must be addressed by health professionals. Armed conflict is probably the most serious global public health challenge and two solutions are proposed. Health professionals have a major voice and must support the currently progressing Arms Trade Treaty and call for more effective protection for healthcare in areas of conflict.

Much of the research focuses on differences in language and culture which are posed as the attributes of the immigrant nurse. Objectives: In reporting on an analysis of data drawn from China-educated nurses working in the Australian health care system, this paper explores the social construction of difference and the related intersection of difference and racialisation. Design: A symbolic interactionist approach informed 46 in-depth interviews with 28 China-educated nurses. The method of analysis was initial and focused coding and constant comparison of data. The focus of interpretation was on human action and interaction as contextual and thus structural factors were critical to the analysis. Results: Two levels of meaning were depicted in this study: difference as "you are you and I am I" and difference as "incompetence". Negative meanings were ascribed to difference which in turn legitimised inequality and held the potential to perpetuate racism. Conclusions: We argue that it is problematic to conceptualise difference as individual attributes. Difference needs to be contextualised and thus explored as a complex and socially constructed concept that in its application has social and political implications for immigrant nurses in Australia and elsewhere.

J	Bloor, M				Bloor, Michael			An essay on health capital' and the Faustian bargains struck by workers in the globalised shipping industry	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS			English	Article						health capital; labour intensification; health inequalities; occupational health; lay epidemiology; seafaring	MORTALITY	It has long been understood that work directly generates ill health and disability through injuries and occupational exposure to toxic and carcinogenic materials, but the more complex relationship between work and ill health that is seemingly mediated through psychological distress is more controversial. For example, the Karasek model, whereby high job demands coupled with limited latitude in decision making were thought to generate ill health, has not been supported in large-scale surveys. This paper postulates an alternative linking mechanism between work and health, namely Mildred Blaxters concept of health capital, and specifically explores the value of the concept in understanding lay theorising about the links between labour intensification and self-perceived health: workers perceptions that their work has become more effortful may be bracketed with their belief that their continuing employment is demanding accelerating expenditure of their health capital. The argument is illustrated by qualitative interviews with an international sample of seafarers, a proto-typically globalised labour force.

J	Sentürk, T; Terzi, F; Dokmeci, V				Senturk, Tugba; Terzi, Fatih; Dokmeci, Vedia			Privatization of Health-care Facilities in Istanbul	EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES			English	Article							HOSPITAL UTILIZATION; POPULATION HEALTH; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; MEDICAL-CARE; ACCESS; SERVICES; INEQUALITIES; COUNTRIES; INCOME; ACCESSIBILITY	A wide variety of health-care systems, ranging from the traditional private medical practice to medical care services, is organized by the government in Turkey. In the 1990s, as a result of privatization movement at the international level, the Turkish Government took the decision to financially support the establishment of new private health-care facilities in order to answer the increasing health-care needs of people and, at the same time, to create a competitive market to improve the quality of health care. This paper investigates, first, the growth pattern of the number of private hospitals beds versus public hospital beds and their spatial distribution in Istanbul; then, the relationships between the number of public and private hospital beds and the characteristics of the districts, such as population, income and education by using regression analysis. According to the results, while income and education are the most important factors to affect the number of private hospital beds, no relationship is found between the number of public hospital beds and the characteristics of the districts. Thus, most of the private hospitals are concentrated in the higher income neighborhoods. More efforts should be spent for balanced distribution of public and private hospital beds with respect to health-care needs of people.

Ottawa 25 years on: a more radical agenda for health equity is still required	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						social determinants of health; policy development; policy and implementation analysis; politics		This article revisits our 1995 assessment of the international health promotion agenda. Then we concluded that a more radical agenda for change was required in which responses were both technically sound and infused with an appreciation of the imperative for a change in politics and power. We conclude that this message is even more relevant in 2011 in an era when the continuing rise of transnational corporations (TNCs) poses a major threat to achieving improved and more equitable health. We support and illustrate this claim through the example of food and agriculture TNCs where the combination of producer subsidies, global trade liberalization and strengthened property rights has given increasing power to the corporate food industry and undermined national food security in many countries. We argue that a Health in All Policies approach should be used to monitor and enforce TNC accountability for health. Part of this process should include the use of a form of health impact assessment and health equity impact assessment on their activities. Civil society groups such as the People's Health Movement have a central role to play in monitoring the impacts of TNCs.

J	Labonté, R				Labonte, Ronald			Toward a post-Charter health promotion	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						health promotion; global capitalism; financial crises; geopolitics; progressive taxation		The past 25 years have seen enormous shifts in the environmental, political, economic and social landscapes that condition people's abilities to be healthy. Climate change is now a reality. China, India, Brazil and other 'developing' countries are emerging as new axes of political and economic power. Global capitalism has become increasingly predatory and crisis ridden, a result of unregulated and irresponsible greed of unimaginable scale. The elite response has been the increased erosion of the health and other social protection policies of redistribution that characterized the first-world run-up to the Ottawa Charter. These new realities challenge health promoters in ways unforeseen a quarter century ago. It is imperative that local determinants of health, to which health promoters give their attention, be traced to broader, even global levels of determinants. Support for groups acting at these levels should become a fundamental practice tenet. So, too, should advocacy for the social state, in which progressive taxation and hefty social investment blunt the health inequalities created by unfettered markets. As environmental and economic insecurities and inequalities increase in many of the world's countries, so does the risk of xenophobia and conflict. The roots of racism are complex; but weeding them out becomes another health promotion practice of the new millennium. There are some hopeful signs of health promoting political change, much of it emanating now from countries in the global South; but the threat of a return to health behaviourism in the face of the new global pandemic of chronic disease is real and must be confronted.

Much of the current focus of public health surveillance is on detecting aberrations in space largely inspired by concerns about bioterrorism and newly emerging infectious diseases. We argue that the current focus on spatial aberrations has limited the development of public health surveillance by excluding a more explicit geographical understanding and representation of place. A more place-focused public health surveillance could represent geography in ways that are useful to a broader audience, provide information on the social and physical contexts related to health, facilitate a better understanding of health inequalities, and can benefit from local knowledge. Geographers can make important contributions to public health practice by contributing to more meaningful definitions of place in the design and operation of public health surveillance systems.

The purpose of this article is to respond to invited dialogue about the standards and to offer commentary on social justice and its relationship with context, advocacy, leadership, and culturally competent care. A model of culturally competent care for vulnerable groups informs this discussion. The context and culture that surround migrant and seasonal farmworkers illustrate how social justice illuminates their health inequities and necessitates their need for culturally competent care. The article concludes with recommendations for culturally competent education, practice, and research and offers suggestions for developing culturally competent interventions for migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

Elucidating the spatially varying relation between cervical cancer and socio-economic conditions in England	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article						Geographically weighted regression; cervical cancer; screening; disease mapping	POISSON REGRESSION; DISEASE; HEALTH; MODELS; EQUITY; ACCESS; IMPACT; WOMEN	Background: Geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) was applied to the relation between cervical cancer disease incidence rates in England and socio-economic deprivation, social status and family structure covariates. Local parameters were estimated which describe the spatial variation in the relations between incidence and socio-economic covariates. Results: A global (stationary) regression model revealed a significant correlation between cervical cancer incidence rates and social status. However, a local (non-stationary) GWPR model provided a better fit with less spatial correlation (positive autocorrelation) in the residuals. Moreover, the GWPR model was able to represent local variation in the relations between cervical cancer incidence and socio-economic covariates across space, whereas the global model represented only the overall (or average) relation for the whole of England. The global model could lead to misinterpretation of the relations between cervical cancer incidence and socio-economic covariates locally. Conclusions: Cervical cancer incidence was shown to have a non-stationary relationship with spatially varying covariates that are available through national datasets. As a result, it was shown that if low social status sectors of the population are to be targeted preferentially, this targeting should be done on a region-by-region basis such as to optimize health outcomes. While such a strategy may be difficult to implement in practice, the research does highlight the inequalities inherent in a uniform intervention approach.	[Cheng, Edith M.

The recent initiation of programs funding free antiretroviral treatment in sub-Saharan Africa has both forestalled the deaths of millions of patients and brought molecular medicine to the continent on a massive scale. However, in the years leading up to this development, scientists and policymakers engaged in heated debates over whether HIV treatment in Africa could succeed, with many arguing that economic and 'cultural' factors would lead to missed pills and the rapid development of drug-resistant HIV strains. This article describes how the molecular 'maps' upon which knowledge claims about HIV were made (including claims about treatment and drug resistance) are based on HIV strains found primarily in patients in North America and Europe, and raises questions about what this implies for patients and scientists in Africa and other regions in the global South. Borrowing from the insights of critical geographers, I argue that our genetic maps of HIV are partial and contingent and reflect a 'molecular politics' in which the global inequalities of the AIDS epidemic are manifest at the most minute scale, embedded within the very materials and tools scientists use to study HIV. The consequences of this fact are at once clinical, political and epistemological.

J	Petersen, PE; Kwan, S				Petersen, Poul Erik; Kwan, Stella			Equity, social determinants and public health programmes - the case of oral health	COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						burden of oral disease; inequality; intervention for oral health for all; policy for oral health; research for oral health		The WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health issued the 2008 report 'Closing the gap within a generation - health equity through action on the social determinants of health' in response to the widening gaps, within and between countries, in income levels, opportunities, life expectancy, health status, and access to health care. Most individuals and societies, irrespective of their philosophical and ideological stance, have limits as to how much unfairness is acceptable. In 2010, WHO published another important report on 'Equity, Social Determinants and Public Health Programmes', with the aim of translating knowledge into concrete, workable actions. Poor oral health was flagged as a severe public health problem. Oral disease and illness remain global problems and widening inequities in oral health status exist among different social groupings between and within countries. The good news is that means are available for breaking poverty and reduce if not eliminate social inequalities in oral health. Whether public health actions are initiated simply depends on the political will. The Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion ( 1986) and subsequent charters have emphasized the importance of policy for health, healthy environments, healthy lifestyles, and the need for orientation of health services towards health promotion and disease prevention. This report advocates that oral health for all can be promoted effectively by applying this philosophy and some major public health actions are outlined.

Design Cross-sectional data in 16 established market economies participating in the Gender, Alcohol and Culture: An International Study (GenACIS) study. Setting Population surveys. Participants A total of 12 454 mothers (aged 25-49 years). Measurements Alcohol use was assessed as the quantity per drinking day. Paid labour, having a partner, gender-income ratio at country level and the interaction between individual and country characteristics were regressed on alcohol consumed per drinking day using multi-level modelling. Findings Mothers with a partner who were in paid labour reported consuming more alcohol on drinking days than partnered housewives. In countries with high gender-income equity, mothers with a partner who were in paid labour drank less alcohol per occasion, while alcohol use was higher among working partnered mothers living in countries with lower income equity. Conclusion In countries which facilitate working mothers, daily alcohol use decreases as female social roles increase; in contrast, in countries where there are fewer incentives for mothers to remain in work, the protective effect of being a working mother (with partner) on alcohol use is weaker. These data suggest that a country's investment in measures to improve the compatibility of motherhood and paid labour may reduce women's alcohol use.

More recently, in the battle against HIV/AIDS-and given the unique challenges the pandemic presents for health and development the global community has acknowledged the benefits of synergizing sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS interventions. However, the United States has been slow to incorporate lessons learned from the international experience when it comes to integrating HIV/AIDS, SRHR, and gender equality in the fight against HIV/AIDS. This article highlights the importance of SRHR and lessons learned from SRHR-HIV integration to inform U.S. domestic and global AIDS strategies and interventions.

J	Mohanty, SK				Mohanty, Sanjay K.			Multidimensional Poverty and Child Survival in India	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; UNDERLYING CAUSE; MORTALITY; UNDERNUTRITION; DETERMINANTS; TRENDS	Background: Though the concept of multidimensional poverty has been acknowledged cutting across the disciplines (among economists, public health professionals, development thinkers, social scientists, policy makers and international organizations) and included in the development agenda, its measurement and application are still limited. Objectives and Methodology: Using unit data from the National Family and Health Survey 3, India, this paper measures poverty in multidimensional space and examine the linkages of multidimensional poverty with child survival. The multidimensional poverty is measured in the dimension of knowledge, health and wealth and the child survival is measured with respect to infant mortality and under-five mortality. Descriptive statistics, principal component analyses and the life table methods are used in the analyses. Results: The estimates of multidimensional poverty are robust and the inter-state differentials are large. While infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate are disproportionately higher among the abject poor compared to the non-poor, there are no significant differences in child survival among educationally, economically and health poor at the national level. State pattern in child survival among the education, economical and health poor are mixed. Conclusion: Use of multidimensional poverty measures help to identify abject poor who are unlikely to come out of poverty trap. The child survival is significantly lower among abject poor compared to moderate poor and non-poor. We urge to popularize the concept of multiple deprivations in research and program so as to reduce poverty and inequality in the population.

Several frameworks exist for monitoring and evaluating funding results and modalities. Based on its long history of support, we report on the impact of individual and institutional capacity strengthening programmes conducted by the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and on the factors that influenced the outcome of its Research Capacity Strengthening (RCS) activities. Methodology and Principal Findings: A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods (questionnaires and in-depth interviews) was applied to a selected group of 128 individual and 20 institutional capacity development grant recipients that completed their training/projects between 2000 and 2008. A semi-structured interview was also conducted on site with scientists from four institutions. Most of the grantees, both individual and institutional, reported beneficial results from the grant. However, glaring inequities stemming from gender imbalances and a language bias towards English were identified. The study showed that skills improvement through training contributed to better formulation of research proposals, but not necessarily to improved project implementation or communication of results. Appreciation of the institutional grants' impact varied among recipient countries. The least developed countries saw the programmes as essential for supporting basic infrastructure and activities. Advanced developing countries perceived the research grants as complementary to available resources, and particularly suitable for junior researchers who were not yet able to compete for major international grants. Conclusion: The study highlights the need for a more equitable process to improve the effectiveness of health research capacity strengthening activities. Support should be tailored to the existing research capacity in disease endemic countries and should focus on strengthening national health research systems, particularly in the least developing countries. The engagement of stakeholders at country level would facilitate the design of more specific and comprehensive strategies based on local needs.

J	Golding, B; Foley, A				Golding, Barry; Foley, Annette			All over, red rover? The neglect and potential of Australian adult education in the community	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ADULT LEARNING			English	Article								Consistent with the 'looking back, moving forward' conference theme, in this paper we undertake a critical, research-based appraisal of the current, arguably neglected state of adult education in Australia in 2010, and proceed to paint a picture of how a different and potentially more positive future might be realised. Firstly, we emphasise situations (including states and territories) in Australia in which adult education is seen to be lacking or missing for particular groups of adults. Secondly we emphasise research evidence confirming the demonstrable value of learning for purposes other than those that are immediately vocational. We identify links between lifelong and lifewide learning on one hand, and health and wellbeing on the other. Part of the paper involves international comparisons with other forms of adult learning that Australia might learn from, adapt or borrow. We make particular reference to research underpinning the recent Inquiry into the Future of Lifelong Learning by NIACE in the United Kingdom. Our first main conclusion has to do with equity. Adult and community education (ACE) in Australia is currently seen to be least available or accessible to those Australians with the most limited and most negative experiences of school education, but the most need to learn in non-vocational domains. These groups include older Australians, some men and women, people not in paid work, and rural, isolated and Indigenous people. Our second main conclusion is that, to realise adult learning's future potential, we need changes to government policies, research and practice that acknowledge and actively support the broader nature and value of learning for life across all age groups. To paraphrase research from Belgium by Sfard (2008), based around Beck's (1986) exploration of reflexive modernity, the adult education function of ACE is in dire straits, unless education is seen as being much more valuable than the sum of individual vocational competencies, and particularly unless it is also recognised, valued and supported as one of many valuable outcomes of social, lifelong and lifewide learning throughout the community.

J	Shonkoff, SB; Morello-Frosch, R; Pastor, M; Sadd, J				Shonkoff, Seth B.; Morello-Frosch, Rachel; Pastor, Manuel; Sadd, James			The climate gap: environmental health and equity implications of climate change and mitigation policies in California-a review of the literature	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							HEAT-RELATED DEATHS; UNITED-STATES; RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; PUBLIC-HEALTH; US CITIES; MORTALITY; AIR; TEMPERATURE; WAVE	Climate change is an issue of great importance for human rights, public health, and socioeconomic equity because of its diverse consequences overall as well as its disproportionate impact on vulnerable and socially marginalized populations. Vulnerability to climate change is determined by a community's ability to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from the impact of major weather events. Climate change will affect industrial and agricultural sectors, as well as transportation, health, and energy infrastructure. These shifts will have significant health and economic consequences for diverse communities throughout California. Without proactive policies to address these equity concerns, climate change will likely reinforce and amplify current as well as future socioeconomic disparities, leaving low-income, minority, and politically marginalized groups with fewer economic opportunities and more environmental and health burdens. This review explores the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable groups in California and investigates the costs and benefits of the climate change mitigation strategies specified for implementation in the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32). Lastly, knowledge gaps, future research priorities, and policy implications are identified.

Methods: We drew upon national and international data to develop benchmarks for health system performance, then applied basic ratio scores to compare New Zealand performances to the benchmark. 64 indicators were included in four assessment categories: healthy lives, quality, access, and efficiency. In a fifth category, 27 of these indicators were used to score health system equity. Indicator scores in each category were then averaged to give a health system score out of 100. Results: New Zealand's health system achieved an overall score of 71 out of 100. The system scored relatively well on quality and efficiency, but poorly on equity despite considerable government investment in reducing inequalities. Conclusions: The scorecard offers a useful method for combining a range of data to give an overall picture of health system performance, highlighting strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. This initial study provides a baseline for assessing New Zealand's performance over time and, where data permit, a template for other countries to follow. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Rising inequities since that time, however, have been largely unchecked in the Americas and globally, and have presented us with an acutely paradoxical time for community participation and action. On the one hand, transnational globalized markets and accompanying economic and environmental devastation have challenged the effectiveness of community action to create health. On the other hand, hopeful signs of local through national and international activism and of new mechanisms for community engagement continue to surface as meaningful and effective democratic acts. This article presents a dialogue on these issues between colleagues in the United States and Brazil, and considers the broader applicability to Latin America and worldwide. We begin by discussing how community participation and community organizing grew out of our respective histories. We consider the catalytic role of the Ottawa Charter in spurring a reorientation of health promotion and the genesis of healthy city and community initiatives, as well as other current community organizing strategies and the growth of participatory research/CBPR. We unpack the potential for co-optation of both community and social participation and end with recommendations for what we can do to maintain our integrity of belief in democratic social participation to promote improved health and health equity.

More variation in lifespan in lower educated groups: evidence from 10 European countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Lifespan variation; life expectancy; socio-economic inequality; education; international variation; mortality	CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES; SURVIVAL-CURVE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; DEATH; MEN; EXPECTANCY; TIME; DETERMINANTS	Background Whereas it is well established that people with a lower socio-economic position have a shorter average lifespan, it is less clear what the variability surrounding these averages is. We set out to examine whether lower educated groups face greater variation in lifespans in addition to having a shorter life expectancy, in order to identify entry points for policies to reduce the impact of socio-economic position on mortality. Methods We used harmonized, census-based mortality data from 10 European countries to construct life tables by sex and educational level (low, medium, high). Variation in lifespan was measured by the standard deviation conditional upon survival to age 35 years. We also decomposed differences between educational groups in lifespan variation by age and cause of death. Results Lifespan variation was higher among the lower educated in every country, but more so among men and in Eastern Europe. Although there was an inverse relationship between average life expectancy and its standard deviation, the first did not completely predict the latter. Greater lifespan variation in lower educated groups was largely driven by conditions causing death at younger ages, such as injuries and neoplasms. Conclusions Lower educated individuals not only have shorter life expectancies, but also face greater uncertainty about the age at which they will die. More priority should be given to efforts to reduce the risk of an early death among the lower educated, e.g. by strengthening protective policies within and outside the health-care system.

J	Hajizadeh, M; Nghiem, HS				Hajizadeh, Mohammad; Nghiem, Hong Son			Out-of-pocket expenditures for hospital care in Iran: who is at risk of incurring catastrophic payments?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE & ECONOMICS			English	Article						Out-of-pocket expenditures; Catastrophic expenditures; Heckman selection model; Hospital care; Iran	HEALTH SYSTEM REFORM; INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; FINANCIAL PROTECTION; UNITED-STATES; EQUITY; DETERMINANTS; THAILAND; IMPOVERISHMENT; COLOMBIA; MALAYSIA	Since the beginning of 1980s, the Iranian health care system has undergone several reforms designed to increase accessibility of health services. Notwithstanding these reforms, out-of-pocket payments which create a barrier to access health services contribute almost half of total health are financing in Iran. This study aimed to provide a greater understanding about the inequality and determinants of the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) and the related catastrophic expenditure (CE) for hospital services in Iran using a nationwide survey data, the 2003 Utilisation of Health Services Survey (UHSS). The concentration index and the Heckman selection model were used to assess inequality and factors associated with these expenditures. Inequality analysis suggests that the CE is concentrated among households in lower socioeconomic levels. The results of the Heckman selection model indicate that factors such as length of stay, admission to a hospital owned by private sector or Ministry of Health and Medical Education, and living in remote areas are positively associated with higher OOPE. Results of the ordered-probit selection model demonstrate that length of stay, lower household wealth index, and admission to a private hospital are major factors contributing to the increase in the probability of CE. Also, we find that households living in East Azarbaijan, Kordestan and Sistan and Balochestan face a higher level of CE. Based on our findings, the current employer-sponsored health insurance system does not offer equal protection against hospital expenditure in Iran. It seems that a single universal health insurance scheme that covers health services for all Iranian-regardless of their employment status-can better protect households from catastrophic health spending.

However, in many low-income and some middle-income countries, urbanization conveys inequality and exclusion, creating cities and dwellings characterized by poverty, overcrowded conditions, poor housing, severe pollution, and absence of basic services such as water and sanitation. Slums in large cities often have an absence of schools, transportation, health centers, recreational facilities, and other such amenities. Additionally, the persistence of certain conditions, such as poverty, ethnic heterogeneity, and high population turnover, contributes to a lowered ability of individuals and communities to control crime, vandalism, and violence. The social vulnerability in health is not a "natural" or predefined condition but occurs because of the unequal social context that surrounds the daily life of the disadvantaged, and often, socially excluded groups. Social exclusion of individuals and groups is a major threat to development, whether to the community social cohesion and economic prosperity or to the individual self-realization through lack of recognition and acceptance, powerlessness, economic vulnerability, ill health, diminished life experiences, and limited life prospects. In contrast, social inclusion is seen to be vital to the material, psychosocial, and political aspects of empowerment that underpin social well-being and equitable health. Successful experiences of cooperation and networking between slum-based organizations, grassroots groups, local and international NGOs, and city government are important mechanisms that can be replicated in urban settings of different low- and middle-income countries. With increasing urbanization, it is imperative to design health programs for the urban poor that take full advantage of the social resources and resourcefulness of their own communities.

SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Persistent deprivation; Deprivation (im)mobility; Population residualisation; Premature mortality; UK; Glasgow; Scotland	LIFE-COURSE; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; BRITISH REGIONS; SHRINKING AREAS; DEPRIVATION; HEALTH; ENGLAND; SCOTLAND; CIRCUMSTANCES; UNEMPLOYMENT	In the international literature, many studies find strong relationships between area-based measures of deprivation and mortality. In the UK, mortality rates have generally fallen in recent decades but the life expectancy gap between the most and least deprived areas has widened, with a number of Scottish studies highlighting increased mortality rates in deprived areas especially in Glasgow. However, these studies relate health outcomes at different time points against period-specific measures of deprivation which may not be comparable over time. Using longitudinal deprivation measures where levels of area deprivation are made comparable over time, a recent study demonstrated how levels of mortality change in relation to changing or persistent levels of (non-) deprivation over time. The results showed that areas which were persistently deprived in Scotland experienced a rise in premature mortality rates by 9.5% between 1981 and 2001. Here, focussing on persistently deprived areas we extended the coverage to the whole of the UK to assess whether, between 1991 and 2001, rising premature mortality rates in persistentl/deprived areas are a Scottish only phenomenon or whether similar patterns are evident elsewhere and for men and women separately. We found that male premature mortality rates rose by over 14% in Scotland over the 10-year period between the early 1990s and 2000s in persistently deprived areas. We found no significant rise in mortality elsewhere in the UK and that the rise among men in Scotland was 1riven by results for Glasgow where mortality rates rose by over 15% during the decade. Our analyses demonstrate the importance of identifying areas experiencing persistent poverty. These results justify even more of a public health focus on Glasgow and further work is needed to understand the demographic factors, such as health selective migration, immobility and population residualisation, which r ay contribute to these findings.

J	Riva, M; Curtis, S; Norman, P				Riva, Mylene; Curtis, Sarah; Norman, Paul			Residential mobility within England and urban-rural inequalities in mortality	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Rural-urban health inequalities; Residential mobility; Selective migration; All-cause mortality; England; ONS Longitudinal Study; UK	LONG-TERM ILLNESS; SELECTIVE MIGRATION; SHRINKING AREAS; HEALTH; DEPRIVATION; ARTIFACT; SUICIDE; IRELAND; PEOPLE	This study is situated within the international literature on geographic health inequalities between urban and rural areas. Using data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS LS), this paper assesses the role of residential mobility within England between 1981 and 2001 in explaining geographic inequalities in all-cause mortality between urban and rural Local Authority Districts at the end of the period (deaths occurring between 2001 and 2005). First, the pattern of directly age-standardised death rates (2001-2005) in urban and rural areas of residence in 2001 is examined and compared with the pattern that would have been seen if the observed death/survival of individuals had occurred in their original place of residence in 1981, or in 1991. Secondly, logistic regression is applied to examine whether individuals' residential mobility between urban and rural areas predict the risk of mortality, adjusting for people's socio-demographic characteristics. Findings show that, for this sample, residential mobility 1981-2001 accounts for about 30% of the urban rural inequalities in mortality observed at the end of the period. LS members who were residentially mobile between urban and rural areas were relatively healthier than long-term urban residents, with better mortality outcomes among rural in-migrants. In age-stratified analysis, LS members of working age (20-64 years) moving out of rural areas, and LS members of retirement age (65 years and older) moving into rural areas, were shown to be healthier. Processes of selective migration in and out of rural areas in England are complex and may partly explain urban rural health inequalities. In terms of varying mortality risk, findings also highlight the possible marginalisation and disadvantage of sub-groups of the rural population. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Manning, N				Manning, Nick			The Reform of Health Policy in China - Left Behind in the Race to Industrialize?	SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION			English	Article						China; Health policy; Reform	CARE	A major programme of health reform was announced in 2009. China is growing fast, and is beginning to engage with the international social policy community to discuss and review the consequences of rapid industrialization. As a specific part of social policy, health policy shares some of the characteristics of a policy area driven by the consequences of industrialization, but it also has its own particular features. This article reviews the general relationship between state and citizens in the health field by way of an introduction before focussing more specifically on Chinese patterns of health inequalities, and the pressures for reform. The 2009 reform of health policy and its dynamics are then presented, and the article concludes that there has been a deterioration in Chinese health policy, which threatens to undermine the benefits of economic growth for Chinese people.

J	Gupta, N; Alfano, M				Gupta, Neeru; Alfano, Marco			Access to non-pecuniary benefits: does gender matter? Evidence from six low- and middle-income countries	HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH			English	Article								Background: Gender issues remain a neglected area in most approaches to health workforce policy, planning and research. There is an accumulating body of evidence on gender differences in health workers' employment patterns and pay, but inequalities in access to non-pecuniary benefits between men and women have received little attention. This study investigates empirically whether gender differences can be observed in health workers' access to non-pecuniary benefits across six low-and middle-income countries. Methods: The analysis draws on cross-nationally comparable data from health facility surveys conducted in Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Jamaica, Mozambique, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Probit regression models are used to investigate whether female and male physicians, nurses and midwives enjoy the same access to housing allowance, paid vacations, in-service training and other benefits, controlling for other individual and facility-level characteristics. Results: While the analysis did not uncover any consistent pattern of gender imbalance in access to non-monetary benefits, some important differences were revealed. Notably, female nursing and midwifery personnel (the majority of the sample) are found significantly less likely than their male counterparts to have accessed in-service training, identified not only as an incentive to attract and retain workers but also essential for strengthening workforce quality. Conclusion: This study sought to mainstream gender considerations by exploring and documenting sex differences in selected employment indicators across health labour markets. Strengthening the global evidence base about the extent to which gender is independently associated with health workforce performance requires improved generation and dissemination of sex-disaggregated data and research with particular attention to gender dimensions.

J	Medalia, C; Chang, VW				Medalia, Carla; Chang, Virginia W.			Gender equality, development, and cross-national sex gaps in life expectancy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						cross-national; development; gender equality; life expectancy; sex differences	WOMENS HEALTH; FEMALE MORTALITY; SMOKING; CONVERGENCE; EMPLOYMENT; COHORT; MEN; INEQUALITY; OUTCOMES; TOBACCO	Female life expectancy exceeds male life expectancy in almost every country throughout the world. Nevertheless, cross-national variation in the sex gap suggests that social factors, such as gender equality, may directly affect or mediate an underlying biological component. In this article, we examine the association between gender equality and the sex gap in mortality. Previous research has not addressed this question from an international perspective with countries at different levels of development. We examine 131 countries using a broad measure of national gender equality that is applicable in both Less Developed Countries (LDCs) and Highly Developed Countries (HDCs). We find that the influence of gender equality is conditional on level of development. While gender equality is associated with divergence between female and male life expectancies in LDCs, it is associated with convergence in HDCs. The relationship between gender equality and the sex gap in mortality in HDCs strongly relates to, but is not explained by, sex differences in lung cancer mortality. Finally, we find that divergence in LDCs is primarily driven by a strong positive association between gender equality and female life expectancy. In HDCs, convergence is potentially related to a weak negative association between gender equality and female life expectancy, though findings are not statistically significant.

Acknowledging calls for the use of experimental study designs to explore contextual influences on health, we develop a study design in which sets of local areas from Britain and Belgium became akin to two 'treatment' groups; one exposed to British society and culture and the other exposed to Belgian society and culture. The areas are matched on the basis of showing very strong similarities in economic, demographic and historical characteristics. Data describing these characteristics are obtained from national census data. A principal component analysis of these variables permits areas in Britain and Belgium with similar scores on the resulting components to be matched into pairs. A sequence of logistic regression models identifies between-country difference in the risk of reporting poor health. Our final model compares the risk of reporting poor health among Belgians and people from Britain living in similar local contexts, adjusting for any residual differences in individual level characteristics. We compare results from this new method with those from more conventional approaches. All approaches show that residence in Britain is associated with a substantial and significantly higher risk of reporting poor health for both men and women, after adjustment for both individual and local contextual influences. We then critically reflect on our method and on the context-composition framework for research into area variation in health. We conclude that whilst our approach succeeded in applying the idea of comparable groups with different exposures to an observational, international comparison, it also brought associated questions about external validity and the extent to which a sample of matched areas captures a 'national' context.

J	Lowrie, PM				Lowrie, Patricia M.			Accidental Decisions: Reflections on Moving Forward	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article								The Recognition Lecture is an annual honor awarded by the Association of American Veterinary Colleges (AAVMC) to an individual whose leadership and vision have made significant contributions to academic veterinary medicine and the veterinary profession. In 2010 this prestigious honor was bestowed upon Ms. Patricia Lowrie who has been, and continues to be, a champion of inclusion in the veterinary profession. She has spent much of her illustrious career addressing inequities in the veterinary profession, advocating for social justice, questioning inequality, and addressing the disproportionate representation of women in various fields of academia and senior-level academic positions. Ms. Lowrie is an influential leader who has contributed her energy, talents, passion, and dedication to advancing our understanding of the importance of diversity among the staff, faculty, and student bodies of veterinary colleges. She is the persistent voice that reminds us that our profession cannot reach pre-eminence until it reflects the makeup of our society and embraces the differences among us. Ms. Lowrie is a native of Washington, DC, where she grew up in a family that valued education and taught her that no dream was impossible and not to accept society's limitations for women, especially women of color. She received the BS and MS degrees in zoology from Harvard University and acquired additional training in organizational management from the University of California at Davis as well as training in community leadership from the Lansing Michigan Community College. Throughout her distinguished career she has held many important research and administrative positions. She started her career as a research assistant in electron microscopy in the Department of Animal Sciences and Dairy Sciences at Auburn University, and she later became a research assistant in the Department of Pathology at the California Primate Research Center, University of California at Davis and a specialist in electron microscopy at Michigan State University. Ms. Lowrie's love of the veterinary profession and veterinary medical education caused her to turn her attention to the lack of inclusiveness in the veterinary profession. This began a lifelong effort to encourage and support students of color in their quest to become members of the veterinary profession. This new path began when she was appointed the Affirmative Action Officer for the College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, and later Assistant to the Dean for Admissions and Affirmative Action. In 1993, she expanded her horizon and assumed the role of Senior Academic Specialist and Director of the Women's Research Center at Michigan State. Throughout her career Ms. Lowrie has been a mentor, colleague, friend, and cheerleader for countless individuals both within and outside of veterinary medicine. She has received many honors and awards for her efforts, including the Outstanding Contribution to Minority Medical Education Award presented by the National Association of Minority Educators, the Michigan State University All University Excellence in Diversity Award, the AAVMC Iverson Bell Award, and appointment as Senior Fellow in the Office of Diversity Equity and Global Initiatives by the American Association of Colleges and Universities. In addition, Ms. Lowrie has served on numerous local, state, and national committees relating to the recruitment, retention, and development of women and underrepresented individuals in higher education. Ms. Lowrie has devoted countless hours to the AAVMC, where she helped desin and implement recruitment strategies for underrepresented students in veterinary medicine. For many years, she provided visionary leadership to the AAVMC Multicultural Affairs Committee, At Michigan State University, she created one of the most successful and longest running programs in the country for the recruitment of underrepresented students to veterinary medicine, The Vetward Bound Program, which has received federal funding for nearly 30 years. She has also received funding from the National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Agriculture for summer research programs for underrepresented high school students to allow them to gain research experience by working alongside noted veterinary scientists. A fact not well known and not fully appreciated in the veterinary profession is that in addition to helping students pursue their dreams of becoming veterinarians, Ms. Lowrie has assisted many veterinarians, especially graduates of Tuskegee University, in pursuing graduate and residency training at Michigan State University. Many of these individuals now hold key leadership positions in academia, government, and the private sector. On their behalf, I take the liberty to say thank you for being there when they needed you. In her lecture to attendees of the AAVMC Annual Meeting, which is included here, she reflected on the influence of mentors who impacted her life, many of whom were giants in the field of veterinary medical education. She recounts how they influenced her decisions and her career in so many ways and how they helped her develop the self-determination that was needed in order to never give up on fighting for the cause.

The Information Service model proposed is based on some fundamental elements: 1) human interaction with experienced operators, adequately trained in communication and information, complemented with 2) virtual interaction (Help line, Internet, blog, forum and social network); 3) informative material adequate for both scientific accuracy and communicative style; 4) adequate locations for appropriate positioning and privacy (adequate visibility); 5) appropriate advertising. First results coming from these initiatives contributed to introduce issues related to "Communication and Information to patients" as a "Public Health Instrument" to the National Cancer Plan approved by the Ministry of Health for the years 2010-2012.

J	Almond, P; Lathlean, J				Almond, Palo; Lathlean, Judith			Inequity in provision of and access to health visiting postnatal depression services	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						access; equity; health visiting; interviews; postnatal depression; qualitative case study	WOMEN; BLACK; CARE	Aim. This paper is a report of a study of equity in the provision of a public health nursing postnatal depression service. Background. Postnatal depression is a global public health concern. Health visitors are nurses involved in the early detection and treatment of postnatal depression. However, research has revealed that all women are not assessed for postnatal depression particularly women in minority ethnic groups. Methods. A case study was conducted involving 21 observations of health visitors visiting postnatal women, interviews with 20 health visitors, 6 managers, 12 English women, 9 Bangladeshi women and 3 other personnel. Data were collected between 2003 and 2005 and analysis was completed in 2008. Findings. The organization had a policy to create equitable postnatal depression services, but practitioners were not clear whether it was to be implemented, and it did not address the needs of a diverse population. All health visitors received specialized training and were consequently expected to assess and treat all women. The training based on the policy had not equipped health visitors with knowledge and skills to assess and treat women in minority ethnic groups. Conclusion. While a policy was in place, equity in care was not achieved. An analysis of women's needs is recommended prior to policy development and policy implementation should be planned. To achieve equity, training should include knowledge and skills for cultural competency. Research is needed to illuminate the characteristics of equitable nursing services.

J	Edwards, I; Delany, CM; Townsend, AF; Swisher, LL				Edwards, Ian; Delany, Clare M.; Townsend, Anne F.; Swisher, Laura Lee			New Perspectives on the Theory of Justice: Implications for Physical Therapy Ethics and Clinical Practice	PHYSICAL THERAPY			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE RESOURCES; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; DECISION-MAKING; BATTERED WOMEN; POPULATION; POSITION; PHYSIOTHERAPY; OPPORTUNITIES; RECOGNITION; PHILOSOPHY	Recent revisions of physical therapy codes of ethics have included a new emphasis concerning health inequities and social injustice. This emphasis reflects the growing evidence regarding the importance of social determinants of health, epidemiological trends for health service delivery, and the enhanced participation of physical therapists in shaping health care reform in a number of international contexts. This perspective article suggests that there is a "disconnect" between the societal obligations and aspirations expressed in the revised codes and the individualist ethical frameworks that predominantly underpin them. Primary health care is an approach to health care arising from an understanding of the nexus between health and social disadvantage that considers the health needs of patients as expressive of the health needs of the communities of which they are members. It is proposed that re-thinking ethical frameworks expressed in codes of ethics can both inform and underpin practical strategies for working in primary health care. This perspective article provides a new focus on the ethical principle of justice: the ethical principle that arguably remains the least consensually understood and developed in the ethics literature of physical therapy. A relatively recent theory of justice known as the "capability approach to justice" is discussed, along with its potential to assist physical therapy practitioners to further develop moral agency in order to address situations of health inequity and social injustice in clinical practice.

Child under-nutrition is estimated to be the largest contributor to global burden of disease, and it clusters in South Asia but literature on under-nutrition among school-aged children is difficult to find in this region. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of stunting and thinness among Pakistani primary school children. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with a representative multistage cluster sample of 1860 children aged 5-12 years in Lahore, Pakistan. Stunting (< -2 SD of height-for-age z-score) and thinness (< -2 SD of BMI-for-age z-score) were defined using the World Health Organization reference 2007. Chi-square test was used as the test of trend. Logistic regression was used to quantify the independent predictors of stunting and thinness and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained. Linear regression was used to explore the independent determinants of height-and BMI-for-age z-scores. Statistical significance was considered at P < 0.05. Results: Eight percent (95% CI 6.9-9.4) children were stunted and 10% (95% CI 8.7-11.5) children were thin. Stunting and thinness were not significantly associated with gender. Prevalence of stunting significantly increased with age among both boys and girls (both P < 0.001) while thinness showed significant increasing trend with age among boys only (P = 0.034). Significant correlates of stunting included age > 8 years, rural area and urban area with low SES, low-income neighborhoods, lower parental education, more siblings, crowded housing and smoking in living place (all P < 0.001). Significant correlates of thinness included rural area and urban area with low SES, low-income neighborhoods and lower parental education (all P < 0.001), and age > 10 years (P = 0.003), more siblings (P = 0.016) and crowded housing (P = 0.006). In multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted simultaneously for all factors, older age (aOR 3.60, 95% CI 1.89-6.88), urban area with low SES (aOR 2.58, 95% CI 1.15-5.81) and low-income neighborhoods (aOR 4.62, 95% CI 1.63-13.10) were associated with stunting while urban area with low SES (aOR 2.28, 95% CI 1.21-4.30) was associated with thinness. In linear regression analyses adjusted for all factors, low-income neighborhoods and older age were associated with lower height-for-age z-score while rural area with low/disadvantaged SES was associated with lower BMI-for-age z-score. Conclusions: Relatively low prevalence of stunting and thinness depicted an improvement in the nutritional status of school-aged children in Pakistan. However, the inequities between the poorest and the richest population groups were marked with significantly higher prevalence of stunting and thinness among the rural and the urban poor, the least educated, the residents of low-income neighborhoods and those having crowded houses. An increasing trend with age was observed in prevalence of stunting and thinness. Smoking in living place was associated with stunting. Findings suggest the need to implement evidence-based child health policy and strategies, prioritizing the poor and socially disadvantaged population.

Together we can make a difference: The case for transnational action for improved health in prisons	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Prison health; Marginalization; World Federation of Public Health; Associations		In spite of international differences in the treatment of incarcerated persons, as a group, they are vulnerable to poor health status and lack of access to quality health care. The health care of prisoners is affected by knowledge and commitment to ideas of human rights and social justice, as well as economic conditions. Prisoners are at increased risk of both acute and chronic diseases, and may constitute a threat to the health of other prisoners, their attendants or outside communities upon release. Mental illness and related problems of substance abuse are prevalent in prison populations, with many US prisons serving as modern asylums. Public health workers and organizations can stimulate and implement action to improve health in prisons. The World Federation of Public Health Associations can play a leadership role in co-ordinating and facilitating collaborative international action and research to enhance the health of prisoners and their communities worldwide.

Exploring the Epidemiology of Violence in Jamaica	WEST INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Criminal violence; epidemiology; Jamaica		There is a high level of criminal violence that afflicts the Jamaican society. While it is certainly non-communicable in the context of medicine and public health, the concepts of social contagion and the well-established fact of the intergenerational transfer of effects of trauma raise questions as to whether or not it is non-communicable in a social sense. Historically, scholars have linked Jamaican criminal violence to three main roots: poverty and urban decay, political patronage, garrisonisation and more recently to a fourth, the growth in transnational organized crime (TOC). Traditionally as well, policy-makers have brought the three discrete perspectives of criminology, criminal justice and public health to bear on the problem. This paper applies a conceptual framework derived from a combination of epidemiology and the behavioural sciences to argue that a sustainable resolution to this looming and intractable social problem must take the form of a cocktail of policies that encompasses all three approaches at levels ranging from the community to the international.

Closing the International Health Gaps: Taiwan Comes in From the Cold	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						cross-cultural communication; medicolegal issues; inequalities in health; peace studies; resources	INSURANCE	A revised set of International Health Regulations came into force in June 2007. A month earlier, The Lancet had noted the importance of filling the remaining gaps in the global health system. One of these gaps was the exclusion of Taiwan from the structures of the World Health Organization (WHO), denied a presence at the World Health Assembly and able to communicate with the WHO only through a complex and time-consuming bureaucratic process. This situation was becoming increasingly indefensible in the face of clear difficulties in transmitting information about epidemic diseases, such as the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the growing threat of avian influenza since 2004. This is at last being addressed following a landmark decision to admit Taiwan to observer status at the World Health Assembly in May 2009. These developments will be addressed in this article.

One approach to this is 'Engaging all Care Providers', which evolved from 'Public-Private Mix (PPM) DOTS'. The overall aim of this study was to systematically assess whether and to what degree the STOP TB Partnership's four global objectives of engaging all care providers are met through existing PPM interventions. These four objectives are; 1) Increase TB case detection; 2) Improve TB treatment outcomes; 3) Enhance access and equity; 4) Reduce financial burden on patients. The specific objectives of this assessment were to 1) Understand what PPM means to the STOP TB Partnership's PPM Subgroup and to National Tuberculosis Programme managers; 2) Scope the nature of existing country-level PPM interventions and 3) Review PPM practice against the global PPM objectives. Methods: We undertook a systematic, multi facetted assessment. The methods included interviews with National Tuberculosis Programme managers from high burden countries, clarification of key issues with the STOP TB Partnership PPM secretariat and a review of publicly accessible reports and published articles on PPM projects. Both the literature review and interviews with the National Tuberculosis Programme managers yielded data on project characteristics; PPM models at country level; National Tuberculosis Programme partners; and mechanisms for engagement. Matrices were developed from the literature review and the interviews to show the relationship between services and service providers for different PPM projects. Data from the literature were assessed against each of the four global PPM objectives. Results: Twelve National Tuberculosis Programme managers from high burden countries were interviewed about the scope of PPM partnerships. Understanding of PPM and types of engaged providers varied considerably; 'private-for-profit qualified clinical providers' were the dominant category. The literature review yielded information on 22 projects in which 'private-for-profit qualified clinical providers' were again the dominant category. The contributions made by 'private-for-profit qualified clinical providers' and 'Non Governmental Organisation qualified clinical providers', were assessed against the four global PPM objectives. Reporting on tuberculosis case detection and treatment outcomes was generally good and demonstrated important PPM contributions in these areas. Reporting on equity, access and reduced patient costs was often lacking or inconclusive. Conclusions: PPM has improved case detection and treatment outcomes among patients seeking care with private providers. Evidence on reducing patient costs is inconclusive, and there is scope for increasing equity in access to care by systematically engaging those providers who are the primary agents for poor people seeking health care. Guidelines outlining which types of providers best contribute to achieving the four global objectives, along with the resources required by National Tuberculosis Programs for such engagement is needed.

The traditional distinctions between negative and positive, civil-political and economic-social, legal and moral rights are to be questioned and probably overcome if the goal is to pursue 'the highest attainable standard of health' as a fundamental human right, that should as such be guaranteed to every human being. What we are called upon to, is the commitment not to exclude now and forever anyone from having access to the 'excellence' of scientific and medical progress. Therefore, the addressees of this 'responsibility' cannot be just the governments and the states within the limits of their 'jurisdiction'. The challenge is to tackle at the same time the social and global determinants of health.

It is argued that solidarity plays a major role in supporting the whole framework of social responsibility, as presented by the IBC. Moreover, solidarity is not limited to members of particular groups, but potentially extended to all human beings on the basis of their inherent dignity; this sense of human solidarity is a necessary presupposition for a genuinely universalistic morality of justice and human rights.

J	Tambor, M; Pavlova, M; Woch, P; Groot, W				Tambor, Marzena; Pavlova, Milena; Woch, Piotr; Groot, Wim			Diversity and dynamics of patient cost-sharing for physicians' and hospital services in the 27 European Union countries	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						patient cost-sharing; public health-care system; health-care financing; European Union	HEALTH-CARE; USER CHARGES; EQUITY	Background: During the past decades, many governments have introduced patient cost-sharing in their public health-care system. This trend in health-care reforms affected the European Union (EU) member states as well. This article presents a review of patient cost-sharing for health-care services in the 27 EU countries, and discusses directions for their improvement. Methods: Data are collected based on a review of international data bases, national laws and regulations, as well as scientific and policy reports. The analysis presents a combination of qualitative and quantitative research techniques. Results: Patient cost-sharing arrangements in the EU have been changing considerably over the past two decades (mostly being extended) and are quite diverse at present. There is a relation between patient cost-sharing arrangements and some characteristics of the health-care system in a country. In a few EU countries, a mix of formal and informal charges exists, which creates a double financial burden for health-care consumers. Conclusions: The adequacy of patient cost-sharing arrangements in EU countries needs to be reconsidered. Most importantly, it is essential to deal with informal patient payments (where applicable) and to assure adequate exemption mechanisms to diminish the adverse equity effects of patient cost-sharing. A close communication with the public is needed to clarify the objectives and content of a patient payment policy in a country.

However, although environmental abatement equally benefits all economies in the world, it is shown that, if the private productive resources are not yet accumulated sufficiently in low income economies, income inequality among economies can be widened in the short term not only under equal burden sharing of pollution abatement but even under income-proportional burden sharing. When the marginal productivity is diminishing, the negative effect of the burden is large relative to the positive effect of the improved environment in economies in which resources are not accumulated sufficiently.

There has been a flurry of international activity toward the establishment of indicators relevant to measuring and monitoring PHC. Yet, little attention has been paid to whether current indicators: 1) are sensitive enough to detect inequities in processes or outcomes of care, particularly in relation to the health needs of vulnerable groups or 2) adequately capture the complexity of delivering PHC services across diverse groups. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the discourse regarding what ought to be considered a PHC indicator and to provide some concrete examples illustrating the need for modification and development of new indicators given the goal of PHC achieving health equity. Methods: Within the context of a larger study of PHC delivery at two Health Centers serving people facing multiple disadvantages, a mixed methods ethnographic design was used. Three sets of data collected included: (a) participant observation data focused on the processes of PHC delivery, (b) interviews with Health Center staff, and (c) interviews with patients. Results: Thematic analysis suggests there is a disjuncture between clinical work addressing the complex needs of patients facing multiple vulnerabilities such as extreme levels of poverty, multiple chronic conditions, and lack of housing and extant indicators and how they are measured. Items could better measure and monitor performance at the management level including, what is delivered (e. g., focus on social determinants of health) and how services are delivered to socially disadvantaged populations (e. g., effective use of space, expectation for all staff to have welcoming and mutually respectful interactions). New indicators must be developed to capture inputs (e. g., stability of funding sources) and outputs (e. g., whole person care) in ways that better align with care provided to marginalized populations. Conclusions: The current emphasis on achieving greater equity through PHC, the continued calls for the renewal and strengthening of PHC, and the use of monitoring and performance indicators highlight the relevance of ensuring that there are more accurate methods to capture the complex work of PHC organizations.

Although we do not find significant impacts on long-term child health variables, we find that remittances do have an impact on health expenditures, and on some preventive issues such as de-worming and vaccination. In addition, we find significant effects of remittances on medicine expenditures when illness occurs. In this regard, remittances are used for both preventive and emergency situations. Interestingly, we also find a significant and positive effect of remittances on health knowledge.

Socioeconomic status and barriers to the use of free antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS in Enugu State, south-eastern Nigeria	AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH			English	Article						accessibility; equity; sub-Saharan Africa; utilisation patterns	HOUSEHOLDS; SETTINGS; AFRICA; ACCESS; VIEWS; HIV	With about 3 million people living with HIV, Nigeria has approximately 8% of the global burden of HIV cases. In 2009, only about 34% of those in need of antiretroviral treatment (ART) were able to access care, which means that Nigeria was far from achieving the United Nations target of 'universal access' by 2010. This study aimed to describe the barriers to accessibility and the coping strategies employed to overcome these barriers among users of free ART services overall and by socioeconomic status (SES). Data were collected from 240 people receiving ART at one urban and one peri-urban health facility in Enugu State, south-eastern Nigeria. Information on SES, demographic characteristics, and barriers and coping mechanisms for accessing ART were elicited from the respondents. The high cost of transportation, HIV stigma, and long waiting hours were found to be key barriers to the use of ART services. On average, ART clients spent just under four hours at the clinic during their monthly appointments. The use of personal savings and financial support from relatives were the main means to access treatment. When the data were analysed according to clients' SES, transportation costs were a chief concern among the poorest while those who were better off were more likely to be concerned about stigma and discrimination. These findings should be borne in mind when designing and locating services to maximise ongoing accessibility to ART.

J	Grosglik, R				Grosglik, Rafi			Organic Hummus in Israel: Global and Local Ingredients and Images	SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ONLINE			English	Article						Globalization; Localization; Cosmopolitism; Organic Food; Hummus; Commodification; Israeli Culture	CALIFORNIA; CULTURE; FOOD; FAIR; AGE	Hummus is an ancient traditional dish in Middle Eastern Cultures. In Israel it is one of the most common foods, appropriated as an icon of Israeli culture and nationality. Today, hummus is served in Israel in many restaurants, and is even distributed as a commercially packaged spread sold in supermarkets. Organic hummus - a recent version of the dish - is influenced by global trends of ethical and reflexive food consumption. Organic food is conceived as the spearhead opposing the consequences of globalization. It is customary to view it as representing locality, health, ecology and social justice. But it also embodies representations of globalism and westernism, mainly because of its integration in the global industrial system and its origin among the post-materialistic-social elite in western countries. This article deals with the encounter of the global and the local as embodied in organic hummus in Israel. Looking at the production, distribution, and consumption of this dish uncovers social and political layers embedded in it. I will argue that the global socio-economic conditions and ideas embedded in the concept of organic attached to hummus are the ones which allow - paradoxically - the imagined re-localization of the dish. Organic hummus in Israel is a dish steeped in paradoxical aspects, and therefore characterized by culinary-ideological-dissonance. Hummus is a dish that was perceived as representing rootedness, earthiness, and local simplicity, but nowadays, in its organic version, it wears an economic and symbolic framework of global values used by the Israeli westernizing elite to demonstrate a widespread-environmental cosmopolitan identity.

This paper illustrates the process needed to make a realistic forecast of the possible resource implications of a well-implemented user fee removal programme and proposes six steps for a successful policy change: (1) analysis of a country's initial position (including user fee level, effectiveness of exemption systems and impact of fee revenues at facility level); (2) estimation of the impact of user fee removal on service utilization; (3) estimation of the additional requirements for human resources, drugs and other inputs, and corresponding financial requirements; (4) mobilization of additional resources (both domestic and external) and development of locally-tailored strategies to compensate for the revenue gap and costs associated with increased utilization; (5) building political commitment for the policy reform; (6) communicating the policy change to all stakeholders. The authors conclude that countries that intend to remove user fees can maximize benefits and avoid potential pitfalls through the utilization of the approach and tools described.

In this study, we review recent reforms in six sub-Saharan African countries: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ghana, Liberia, Senegal and Uganda. The review describes the processes and strategies through which user fee removal reforms have been implemented and tries to assess them by referring to a good practice hypotheses framework. The analysis shows that African leaders are willing to take strong action to remove financial barriers met by vulnerable groups, especially pregnant women and children. However, due to a lack of consultation and the often unexpected timing of the decision taken by the political authorities, there was insufficient preparation for user fee removal in several countries. This lack of preparation resulted in poor design of the reform and weaknesses in the processes of policy formulation and implementation. Our assessment is that there is now a window of opportunity in many African countries for policy action to address barriers to accessing health care. Mobilizing sufficient financial resources and obtaining long-term commitment are obviously crucial requirements, but design details, the formulation process and implementation plan also need careful thought. We contend that national policy-makers and international agencies could better collaborate in this respect.

The aim of our study was to estimate the prevalence and impact of overweight and obesity on physician consultations and frequency of use and furthermore, to investigate whether physician consultations in each of the groups defined by BMI level correspond to the need for care implied by health risk level, using logistic regression models. The survey was carried out in Greece in 2006 and involved complete data from 645 individuals consulted by physicians. Overweight and obese users constituted 41.7% and 19% of the sample respectively. The findings showed firstly that the odds of obese individuals visiting a physician (OR 2.15) or making more than three visits (OR 2.12) was doubled compared to the odds of individuals with normal weight. Secondly, we conclude that physician consultations in overweight and obese subgroups as well as the frequency of visits were predicted by factors such as co-morbidities, low HRQL, low educational level which are associated directly or indirectly with obesity, and thus with a greater health need, assuming vertical equity in the utilization of such services.

Legal aspects of public health: How law frames communicable disease control in Greece	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						communicable disease control; legislation; public health; Greece	GLOBALIZATION; RIGHTS; SARS	We reviewed Greek law (legislation, historic Royal Decrees, and modern Presidential ones, 1833-2010) pertinent to control of communicable diseases and compared this body of Greek law with the revised International Health Regulations. Greece authorizes and regulates communicable disease control commensurate with public health risks, and integrates the principles of equality, objectivity, and respect for human rights. Despite strength at the level of principles, Greek law lacks coherence, clarity, and systematization. An inadequate body of regulations means legislation falls short of adequate implementing authority and guidelines; public health authorities often cannot find or understand the laws, nor are they certain about allocation of jurisdictional authority. We identified areas for improvement.

HIV, Gender, Race, Sexual Orientation, and Sex Work: A Qualitative Study of Intersectional Stigma Experienced by HIV-Positive Women in Ontario, Canada	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article							BLACK-WOMEN; RACISM; HEALTH; HIV/AIDS; PREVENTION; DISCRIMINATION; PREJUDICE; DISTRESS; VIOLENCE; JUSTICE	Background: HIV infection rates are increasing among marginalized women in Ontario, Canada. HIV-related stigma, a principal factor contributing to the global HIV epidemic, interacts with structural inequities such as racism, sexism, and homophobia. The study objective was to explore experiences of stigma and coping strategies among HIV-positive women in Ontario, Canada. Methods and Findings: We conducted a community-based qualitative investigation using focus groups to understand experiences of stigma and discrimination and coping methods among HIV-positive women from marginalized communities. We conducted 15 focus groups with HIV-positive women in five cities across Ontario, Canada. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis to enhance understanding of the lived experiences of diverse HIV-positive women. Focus group participants (n = 104; mean age = 38 years; 69% ethnic minority; 23% lesbian/bisexual; 22% transgender) described stigma/discrimination and coping across micro (intra/interpersonal), meso (social/community), and macro (organizational/political) realms. Participants across focus groups attributed experiences of stigma and discrimination to: HIV-related stigma, sexism and gender discrimination, racism, homophobia and transphobia, and involvement in sex work. Coping strategies included resilience (micro), social networks and support groups (meso), and challenging stigma (macro). Conclusions: HIV-positive women described interdependent and mutually constitutive relationships between marginalized social identities and inequities such as HIV-related stigma, sexism, racism, and homo/transphobia. These overlapping, multilevel forms of stigma and discrimination are representative of an intersectional model of stigma and discrimination. The present findings also suggest that micro, meso, and macro level factors simultaneously present barriers to health and well being-as well as opportunities for coping-in HIV-positive women's lives. Understanding the deleterious effects of stigma and discrimination on HIV risk, mental health, and access to care among HIV-positive women can inform health care provision, stigma reduction interventions, and public health policy.

How money is spent, the way in which programmes are organised, and the services that are prioritised can have important implications for health, including the sexual and reproductive health of men and women. Choices in how resources are allocated are influenced by a number of factors. Covering the years from the late 1970s to the current time, this article reviews the contexts that have influenced the provision of sexual and reproductive health services and provides examples of instances where decisions about resource allocation are not evidence-based. The role of donors in determining how services are provided and their lack of accountability is discussed. We conclude that sexual and reproductive health and rights activists need to engage with and take into account the macroeconomic environment in their efforts to improve sexual and reproductive health outcomes.

For this paper, we define sexual and reproductive health and rights education as including not only its biomedical aspects but also an understanding of its history, values and politics, grounded in gender politics and social justice, addressing sexuality, and placed within a broader context of health systems and global health. Using a case study approach with an opportunistically selected sample of schools of public health within our regional contexts, we examine the status of sexual and reproductive health and rights education and some of the drivers and obstacles to the development and delivery of sexual and reproductive health and rights curricula. Despite diverse national and institutional contexts, there are many commonalities. Teaching of sexual and reproductive health and rights is not fully integrated into core curricula. Existing initiatives rely on personal faculty interest or short-term courses, neither of which are truly sustainable or replicable. We call for a multidisciplinary and more comprehensive integration of sexual and reproductive health and rights in public health education. The education of tomorrow's public health leaders is critical, and a strategy is needed to ensure that they understand and are prepared to engage with the range of sexual and reproductive health and rights issues within their historical and political contexts.

These reforms, implemented by the international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, under the pressure of wealthy nations and transnational corporations, have also produced negative health effects. The advent of these economic measures since the late 1970s and early 1980s coincided, in fact, with reduced worldwide gains in both economic growth and life expectancy. They also have generated larger economic and health gaps between and within countries. This article reviews the major bodies of evidence on the multiple links between neoliberal globalisation policies, economic inequalities and health. It also discusses the future prospects for global health in light of contemporary policy responses to the crisis by national governments and the G-20.

Taking welfare state regime research globally: An application of the Wood and Gough typology to individual health	SOCIAL THEORY & HEALTH			English	Article						welfare regimes; multilevel models; World Health Survey; global public health; disability	PUBLIC-HEALTH; INEQUALITIES	Seldom do studies on welfare regimes and health take a global perspective. Usually most research on this genre concentrates on high-income countries only, few studies include low-and middle-income countries, and even fewer examinations combine a large number of countries to obtain a worldwide view. For this, we need global welfare regime typologies that would allow for such examinations. Given this, we investigated the usefulness of the Wood and Gough welfare regime typology on 49 countries by examining the association between welfare regimes and self-reported individual disability worldwide. The World Health Survey data were examined on 207 818 people from 49 countries using the welfare regime classification developed by Wood and Gough. Multilevel logistic regression was used to investigate links between disability and welfare regimes while also accounting for individual-level socioeconomic factors. Variations in individual disability prevalence were found within the different welfare regimes. For example, odds of poor health prevalence for citizens within the insecurity Sub-Saharan African regime as compared with the European-conservative regime were OR = 1.83 95 per cent CI: 0.85-3.95. Living in a state-organized regime was associated with lower odds of disability prevalence, as higher odds of disability prevalence were observed in all non-state regimes (with the exception of the productivist regime). For instance, the people in the productivist regime of East Asia reported similar prevalence of poor health odds as compared with the European-conservative regime (OR = 0.94 95 per cent CI: 0.45-1.99). This short report found that the Wood and Gough typology enables the study of welfare regimes and health globally, and appears to be a useful tool in welfare regime type research. The productivist regime seems to have health protective features that are on par with European welfare state regimes. We recommend that this finding is investigated further in future empirical analyses.

Casting destitution as intractable, or epidemics that afflict the poor as accidental, erroneously exonerates us from responsibility for caring for those most in need. Adequately addressing communicable diseases requires a biosocial appreciation of the structural forces that shape disease patterns. Most health interventions in resource-poor settings could garner support based on cost/benefit ratios with appropriately lengthy time horizons to capture the return on health investments and an adequate accounting of externalities; however, such a calculus masks the suffering of inaction and risks eroding the most powerful incentive to act: redressing inequality.

The most notorious controversy has been related to the zidovudine (AZT) trials in Africa in the late 1990s, in which the control groups were given a placebo rather than an effective drug to prevent vertical transmission. This raised concerns in the sponsoring country about exploitation of subjects, injustice and an ethical double standard between donor countries and resource-poor settings. However, the real double standard is between clinical practice standards in Western versus African countries, which must be addressed as part of the increasing global inequity of wealth both between countries and also within countries. There are important limitations to ethical declarations, principles and guidelines on their own without contextual ethical reasoning. The focus on research ethics with the HIV epidemic has led to a relative neglect of ethical issues in clinical practice. Although the scientific advances in HIV/AIDS have changed the ethical issues since the 1990s, there has also been progress in the bioethics of HIV/AIDS in terms of ethical review capability by local committees as well as in exposure to ethical issues by clinicians and researchers in Africa. However, serious concerns remain about the overregulation of research by bureaucratic agencies which could discourage African research on specifically African health issues. There is also a need for African academic institutions and researchers to progressively improve their research capacity with the assistance of research funders and donor agencies.

J	van den Bergh, BJ; Gatherer, A; Fraser, A; Moller, L				van den Bergh, Brenda J.; Gatherer, Alex; Fraser, Andrew; Moller, Lars			Imprisonment and women's health: concerns about gender sensitivity, human rights and public health	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article								The health of prisoners is among the poorest of any population group and the apparent inequalities pose both a challenge and an opportunity for country health systems. The high rates of imprisonment in many countries, the resulting overcrowding, characteristics of prison populations and the disproportionate prevalence of health problems in prison should make prison health a matter of public health importance. Women prisoners constitute a minority within all prison systems and their special health needs are frequently neglected. The urgent need to review current services is clear from research, expert opinion and experience from countries worldwide. Current provision of health care to imprisoned women fails to meet their needs and is, in too many cases, far short of what is required by human rights and international recommendations. The evidence includes a lack of gender sensitivity in policies and practices in prisons, violations of women's human rights and failure to accept that imprisoned women have more and different health-care needs compared with male prisoners, often related to reproductive health issues, mental health problems, drug dependencies and histories of violence and abuse. Additional needs stem from their frequent status as a mother and usually the primary carer for her children. National governments, policy-makers and prison management need to address gender insensitivity and social injustice in prisons. There are immediate steps which could be taken to deal with public health neglect, abuses of human rights and failures in gender sensitivity.

Stakeholders understanding of the concept of benefit sharing in health research in Kenya: a qualitative study	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							ETHICAL-ISSUES; POLICY	Background: The concept of benefit sharing to enhance the social value of global health research in resource poor settings is now a key strategy for addressing moral issues of relevance to individuals, communities and host countries in resource poor settings when they participate in international collaborative health research. The influence of benefit sharing framework on the conduct of collaborative health research is for instance evidenced by the number of publications and research ethics guidelines that require prior engagement between stakeholders to determine the social value of research to the host communities. While such efforts as the production of international guidance on how to promote the social value of research through such strategies as benefit sharing have been made, the extent to which these ideas and guidelines have been absorbed by those engaged in global health research especially in resource poor settings remains unclear. We examine this awareness among stakeholders involved in health related research in Kenya. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with key informants drawn from within the broader health research system in Kenya including researchers from the mainstream health research institutions, networks and universities, teaching hospitals, policy makers, institutional review boards, civil society organisations and community representative groups. Results: Our study suggests that although people have a sense of justice and the moral aspects of research, this was not articulated in terms used in the literature and the guidelines on the ethics of global health research. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that while in theory several efforts can be made to address the moral issues of concern to research participants and their communities in resource poor settings, quick fixes such as benefit sharing are not going to be straightforward. We suggest a need to pay closer attention to the processes through which ethical principles are enacted in practice and distil lessons on how best to involve individuals and communities in promoting ethical conduct of global health research in resource poor settings.

Human papillomavirus vaccination in the resourced and resource-constrained world	BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY			English	Article						cervical cancer; human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination; resource-constrained world; developed world; poverty	HPV-RELATED CANCERS; CERVICAL-CANCER; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; BURDEN; TRENDS; CHALLENGES; VACCINES; POVERTY; HEALTH	Human papillomavirus has been established as the causal agent for cervical cancer. The identification of a clear cause presents an unparalleled opportunity for cancer control. As such, the development of prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccines has been rightly hailed as one of the significant scientific triumphs of the past 20 years. This story of scientific triumph over disease, however, is not yet complete. The fruit of scientific labour must be delivered to the people in order to fulfil the underlying intent of the research (i.e. to prevent cancer and save lives). The success of a vaccination programme, however, does not depend on the biological efficacy of the vaccine alone. Various other local factors, such as poverty, gender inequality, cultural traditions, or religious beliefs, can significantly constrain the success of any vaccination programme. In this chapter, we provide an overview of how the human papillomavirus vaccine works and its global uptake, as well as, how variations in local contexts can affect the successful implementation of a vaccination programme. Other factors besides vaccine costs also need serious attention. With better understanding of such factors, policy makers and medical health professionals will be better equipped to make informed decisions to maximise the potential benefits of the human papillomavirus vaccines for the most number of people in individual countries.

Post-conflict health reconstruction: search for a policy	DISASTERS			English	Article						equity; human rights principles; legitimacy; post-conflict health reconstruction; security; stabilisation	MENTAL-HEALTH; WAR; MORTALITY; DISABILITY; SYMPTOMS; OUTCOMES; IMPACT	Despite increasing experience in health reconstruction in societies emerging from conflict, the policy basis for investing in the development of equitable and effective health systems in the wake of war remains unsettled. 1 Consideration of post-conflict health reconstruction is almost entirely absent in donor policies on global health. Practically by default, health programmes are seen increasingly as an element of stabilisation and security interventions in the aftermath of armed conflict. That perspective, however, lacks an evidence base and can skew health programmes towards short-term security and stabilisation goals that have a marginal impact and violate the principles of equity, non-discrimination, and quality, which are central to sound health systems and public acceptance of them. A better approach is to ground policy in legitimacy, viewing health both as a core social institution and one that, if developed according to human rights principles, including equity, non-discrimination, participation and accountability, can advance the effectiveness and the quality of governance in the emerging state.

Dutch versus English advantage in the epidemic of central and generalised obesity is not shared by ethnic minority groups: comparative secondary analysis of cross-sectional data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						overweight; ethnic groups; England; Netherlands	AFRICAN-ORIGIN POPULATIONS; TO-HEIGHT RATIO; HEALTH; RISK; NETHERLANDS; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE; BLACK; INEQUALITIES; HYPERTENSION	Background: Ethnic minority groups in Western European countries tend to have higher levels of overweight than the majority populations for reasons that are poorly understood. Investigating relative differences between countries could enable an investigation of the importance of national context in determining these inequalities. Objective: To explore: (1) whether Indian and African origin populations in England and the Netherlands are similarly disadvantaged compared with the White populations in terms of the prevalence of overweight and central obesity; (2) whether the previously known Dutch advantage of relatively low overweight prevalence is also observed in Dutch ethnic minority groups and (3) the contribution of health behaviour and socio-economic position to the differences observed. Methods: Secondary analyses of population-based studies of 16 406 participants from England and the Netherlands. Prevalence ratios were estimated using regression models. Results: Except for African men, ethnic minority groups in both countries had higher rates of overweight and central obesity than their White counterparts. However, the Dutch minority groups were relatively more disadvantaged than English minority groups as compared with the majority populations. The Dutch advantage of the low prevalence of obesity was only seen in White men and women and African men. In contrast, English-Indian (prevalence ratio = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81-0.93) and English-Caribbean (prevalence ratio = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.76-0.89) women were less centrally obese than their Dutch equivalents. The Dutch-Indian men were very similar to the English-Indian men. The contribution of health behaviour and socio-economic position to the observed differences were small. Conclusion: Contrary to the patterns in White groups, the Dutch ethnic minority women were more obese than their English equivalents. More work is needed to identify factors that may contribute to these observed differences.

Roundtable on Urban Living Environment Research (RULER)	JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE			English	Article							HEAT-WAVE IMPACTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH-PROMOTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; NEIGHBORHOOD; CITY; MORTALITY; GOVERNANCE; INDICATORS; POVERTY	For 18 months in 2009-2010, the Rockefeller Foundation provided support to establish the Roundtable on Urban Living Environment Research (RULER). Composed of leading experts in population health measurement from a variety of disciplines, sectors, and continents, RULER met for the purpose of reviewing existing methods of measurement for urban health in the context of recent reports from UN agencies on health inequities in urban settings. The audience for this report was identified as international, national, and local governing bodies; civil society; and donor agencies. The goal of the report was to identify gaps in measurement that must be filled in order to assess and evaluate population health in urban settings, especially in informal settlements (or slums) in low- and middle-income countries. Care must be taken to integrate recommendations with existing platforms (e.g., Health Metrics Network, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation) that could incorporate, mature, and sustain efforts to address these gaps and promote effective data for healthy urban management. RULER noted that these existing platforms focus primarily on health outcomes and systems, mainly at the national level. Although substantial reviews of health outcomes and health service measures had been conducted elsewhere, such reviews covered these in an aggregate and perhaps misleading way. For example, some spatial aspects of health inequities, such as those pointed to in the 2008 report from the WHO's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, received limited attention. If RULER were to focus on health inequities in the urban environment, access to disaggregated data was a priority. RULER observed that some urban health metrics were already available, if not always appreciated and utilized in ongoing efforts (e.g., census data with granular data on households, water, and sanitation but with little attention paid to the spatial dimensions of these data). Other less obvious elements had not exploited the gains realized in spatial measurement technology and techniques (e.g., defining geographic and social urban informal settlement boundaries, classification of population-based amenities and hazards, and innovative spatial measurement of local governance for health). In summary, the RULER team identified three major areas for enhancing measurement to motivate action for urban health-namely, disaggregation of geographic areas for intra-urban risk assessment and action, measures for both social environment and governance, and measures for a better understanding of the implications of the physical (e.g., climate) and built environment for health. The challenge of addressing these elements in resource-poor settings was acknowledged, as was the intensely political nature of urban health metrics. The RULER team went further to identify existing global health metrics structures that could serve as platforms for more granular metrics specific for urban settings.

Urban change is taking place in a context of other global challenges-economic globalization, climate change, financial crises, energy and food insecurity, old and emerging armed conflicts, as well as the changing patterns of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. These health and social problems, in countries with different levels of infrastructure and health system preparedness, pose significant development challenges in the 21st century. In all countries, rich and poor, the move to urban living has been both good and bad for population health, and has contributed to the unequal distribution of health both within countries (the urban-rural divide) and within cities (the rich-poor divide). In this series of papers, we demonstrate that urban planning and design and urban social conditions can be good or bad for human health and health equity depending on how they are set up. We argue that climate change mitigation and adaptation need to go hand-in-hand with efforts to achieve health equity through action in the social determinants. And we highlight how different forms of governance can shape agendas, policies, and programs in ways that are inclusive and health-promoting or perpetuate social exclusion, inequitable distribution of resources, and the inequities in health associated with that. While today we can describe many of the features of a healthy and sustainable city, and the governance and planning processes needed to achieve these ends, there is still much to learn, especially with respect to tailoring these concepts and applying them in the cities of lower- and middle-income countries.

Cities in low- and middle-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Urbanization is both a cause of and potential solution to global climate change. Most population growth in the foreseeable future will occur in urban areas primarily in developing countries. How this growth is managed has enormous implications for climate change given the increasing concentration and magnitude of economic production in urban localities, as well as the higher consumption practices of urbanites, especially the middle classes, compared to rural populations. There is still much to learn about the extent to which climate change affects urban health equity and what can be done effectively in different socio-political and socio-economic contexts to improve the health of urban dwelling humans and the environment. But it is clear that equity-oriented climate change adaptation means attention to the social conditions in which urban populations live-this is not just a climate change policy issue, it requires inter-sectoral action. Policies and programs in urban planning and design, workplace health and safety, and urban agriculture can help mitigate further climate change and adapt to existing climate change. If done well, these will also be good for urban health equity.

Governance is defined as: "the process of collective decision making and processes by which decisions are implemented or not implemented": it is concerned with the distribution, exercise, and consequences of power. Although there appears to be general agreement that the quality of governance is important for development, much less agreement appears to exist on what the concept really implies and how it should be used. Our review of the literature confirmed significant variation in meaning as well as in the practice of urban governance arrangements. The review found that the linkage between governance practices and health equity is under-researched and/or has been neglected. Reconnecting the fields of urban planning, social sciences, and public health are essential "not only for improving local governance, but also for understanding and addressing global political change" for enhanced urban health equity. Social mobilization, empowering governance, and improved knowledge for sustainable and equitable development in urban settings is urgently needed. A set of strategic research questions are suggested.

Japan: Universal Health Care at 50 Years 6 Future of Japan's system of good health at low cost with equity: beyond universal coverage	LANCET			English	Article							INSURANCE; SERVICES; POLICY; GHANA	Japan's premier health accomplishment in the past 50 years has been the achievement of good population health at low cost and increased equity between different population groups. The development of Japan's policies for universal coverage are similar to the policy debates that many countries are having in their own contexts. The financial sustainability of Japan's universal coverage is under threat from demographic, economic, and political factors. Furthermore, a series of crises-both natural and nuclear-after the magnitude 9.0 Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, has shaken up the entire Japanese social system that was developed and built after World War 2, and shown existing structural problems in the Japanese health system. Here, we propose four major reforms to assure the sustainability and equity of Japan's health accomplishments in the past 50 years-implement a human-security value-based reform; redefine the role of the central and local governments; improve the quality of health care; and commit to global health. Now is the time for rebirth of Japan and its health system.

METHODS We performed an extensive review and analysis of existing literature on medical education in SSA. Relevant literature was identified through searches of five traditional medical databases and three non-traditional or grey literature databases featuring many African journals not indexed by the traditional databases. We focused our inquiry upon three themes of importance to educators and policy-makers: innovation; capacity building, and workforce retention. RESULTS Despite the tremendous heterogeneity of languages and institutions in the region, the available literature is published predominantly in English in journals based in South Africa, the UK and the USA. In addition, first authors usually come from those countries. Several topics are thoroughly described in this literature: (i) human resources planning priorities; (ii) curricular innovations such as problem-based and community-based learning, and (iii) the 'brain drain' and internal drain. Other important topics are largely neglected, including: (i) solution implementation; (ii) programme outcomes, and (iii) the development of medical education as a specialised field of inquiry. CONCLUSIONS Medical education in SSA has undergone dramatic changes over the last 50 years, which are recorded within both the traditionally indexed literature and the non-traditional, grey literature. Greater diversity in perspectives and experiences in medical education, as well as focused inquiry into neglected topics, is needed to advance medical education in the region. Lessons learned from this review may be relevant to other regions afflicted by doctor shortages and inequities in health care resulting from inadequate capacity in medical education; the findings from this study might be used to inform specific efforts to address these issues.

This paper explores spaces where urgent environmental health imperatives intersect with deeply entrenched cultural norms surrounding human waste and the barriers they create for the development of more appropriate excreta management systems. The primary focus is on the global South (particularly India), although literature on sanitation histories in Europe and its colonies is drawn upon to illustrate spatial and temporal differences in cultural attitudes towards excrement.

An international comparison between Belgium and Great Britain	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Self-rated health; Informal care; Methodology; International; Area; Great Britain; Belgium	SELF-RATED HEALTH; LONG-TERM-CARE; WELFARE-STATE; INEQUALITIES; WORKING; PARTICIPATION; POLICIES; REGIMES; EUROPE; RISK	The aim of this paper is to determine whether the association between the provision of informal care and the health status of caregivers is affected by the country of residence. We focus on two European countries, Belgium and Great Britain, and develop a methodology, which consists of matching a subset of areas from Britain with areas in Belgium that are demographically and socioeconomically similar. These pairs of areas are then used as fixed effects in logistic regressions of poor health. This allows us to take into account the influence of area type on health and to remove the influence of these local contextual characteristics from the estimated country effects. Results suggest that, although caregiving is more prevalent in Britain, the health burden associated with heavy caregiving activities is lower in Britain than in Belgium. This may be explained by the better targeting of long-term home care policies towards more severely dependent patients in Britain than in Belgium. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Improvements in health services and systems help to strengthen civil society and to restore legitimacy to governments. Effective engagement with fragile states to inform the design of health programmes and selection of interventions depends on donor coordination and an understanding of health system challenges. Planning requires consideration of allocation (services to be delivered), production (organisation of services), distribution (beneficiaries of services) and financing. The criteria for selecting interventions are: their impact on major health problems; effectiveness; the possibility of scale-up; equity; and sustainability. There are various options for financing and models of engagement, but support should always combine short-term relief with longer-term development. Stakeholders should aim not only to save lives and protect health but also to bolster nations' ability to deliver good-quality services in the long run.

To present the needs and psychological treatment options for offenders with ADHD. Methods. Key papers are discussed in relation to this topic. Results. Research suggests there is a disproportionately high number of individuals with ADHD involved with the Criminal Justice System. UK studies among offenders have indicated around 45% of youths and 24% of male adults screen positive for a childhood history of ADHD, 14% of whom have persisting symptoms in adulthood. Those with persisting symptoms have a significantly younger onset of offending and higher rate of recidivism. ADHD was the most powerful predictor of violent offending, even above substance misuse. They accounted for 8-fold more institutional aggressive behavioural disturbances (critical incidents) than other non-ADHD prisoners. Critical incidents have also been associated with personality disordered patients screening positive for ADHD and detained under the Mental Health Act. It is the impulsive symptoms and mood instability associated with ADHD that most likely increase the risk of critical incidents within institutional settings. Conclusions. There are international guidelines available for the treatment of ADHD; however, serious offenders with ADHD will require more complex and comprehensive interventions than their non-offending peers.

J	Bogdanovica, I; McNeill, A; Murray, R; Britton, J				Bogdanovica, Ilze; McNeill, Ann; Murray, Rachael; Britton, John			What Factors Influence Smoking Prevalence and Smoke Free Policy Enactment across the European Union Member States	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TOBACCO INDUSTRY	Background: Smoking prevention should be a primary public health priority for all governments, and effective preventive policies have been identified for decades. The heterogeneity of smoking prevalence between European Union (EU) Member States therefore reflects, at least in part, a failure by governments to prioritise public health over tobacco industry or possibly other financial interests, and hence potentially government corruption. The aims of this study were to test the hypothesis that smoking prevalence is higher in countries with high levels of public sector corruption, and explore the ecological association between smoking prevalence and a range of other national characteristics in current EU Member States. Methods: Ecological data from 27 EU Member States were used to estimate univariate and multivariate correlations between smoking prevalence and the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, and a range of other national characteristics including economic development, social inclusion, quality of life and importance of religion. We also explored the association between the Corruption Perceptions Index and measures of the extent to which smoke-free policies have been enacted and are enforced. Results: In univariate analysis, smoking prevalence was significantly higher in countries with higher scores for corruption, material deprivation, and gender inequality; and lower in countries with higher per capita Gross Domestic Product, social spending, life satisfaction and human development scores. In multivariate analysis, only the corruption perception index was independently related to smoking prevalence. Exposure to tobacco smoke in the workplace was also correlated with corruption, independently from smoking prevalence, but not with the measures of national smoke-free policy implementation. Conclusions: Corruption appears to be an important risk factor for failure of national tobacco control activity in EU countries, and the extent to which key tobacco control policies have been implemented. Further research is needed to assess the causal relationships involved.

Hence, there is a need for information on home care in Europe. The objective of this literature review was to respond to this need by systematically describing what has been reported on home care in Europe in the scientific literature over the past decade. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed for papers on home care published in English, using the following data bases: Cinahl, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, and Social Care Online. Studies were only included if they complied with the definition of home care, were published between January 1998 and October 2009, and dealt with at least one of the 31 specified countries. Clinical interventions, instrument developments, local projects and reviews were excluded. The data extracted included: the characteristics of the study and aspects of home care 'policy & regulation', 'financing', 'organisation & service delivery', and 'clients & informal carers'. Results: Seventy- four out of 5,133 potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria, providing information on 18 countries. Many focused on the characteristics of home care recipients and on the organisation of home care. Geographical inequalities, market forces, quality and integration of services were also among the issues frequently discussed. Conclusions: Home care systems appeared to differ both between and within countries. The papers included, however, provided only a limited picture of home care. Many studies only focused on one aspect of the home care system and international comparative studies were rare. Furthermore, little information emerged on home care financing and on home care in general in Eastern Europe. This review clearly shows the need for more scientific publications on home care, especially studies comparing countries. A comprehensive and more complete insight into the state of home care in Europe requires the gathering of information using a uniform framework and methodology.	[Genet, Nadine; Boerma, Wienke G.

J	Lob-Levyt, J				Lob-Levyt, Julian			Contribution of the GAVI Alliance to improving health and reducing poverty	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						vaccines; GAVI; immunization		The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), now 10 years old, was established as a successful and innovative public-private partnership to deal with a fundamental inequity. The poorest children in the poorest parts of the world were being denied access to life-saving vaccines simply on the basis of cost. GAVI has been successful in mobilizing significant funding from donors and through innovative financing instruments, immunizing large numbers of children. GAVI has been less successful, at least in the time frames first envisaged, at quickly reducing the prices of new and under-used vaccines to levels affordable by the poorest countries. Vaccines remain some of the most cost effective of public health interventions. As GAVI seeks to introduce a new set of vaccines to tackle major killers such as pneumonia and diarrhoea, and emerging threats such as cervical cancer, it needs to raise significant additional funds. There is no single solution. Multiple and new instruments will be required to raise finance both globally and at the country level, and also to incentivize industry and others to provide vaccines at affordable prices to the poorest countries.

Faith-based organizations (FBOs) have historically played an important role in providing maternal/newborn health services in African countries. However, the contribution of FBOs in service delivery is insufficiently recognized and mapped. Objectives: A systematic review of the literature to assess available evidence on the role of FBOs in the area of maternal/newborn health care in Africa. Search strategy: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for articles published between 1989 and 2009 on maternal/newborn health and FBOs in Africa. Results: Six articles met the criteria for inclusion. These articles provided information on 6 different African countries. Maternal/newborn health services provided by FBOs were similar to those offered by governments, but the quality of care received and the satisfaction were reported to be better. Conclusion: Efforts to document and analyze the contribution of FBOs in maternal/newborn health are necessary to increase the recognition of FBOs and to establish stronger partnerships with them in Africa as an untapped route to achieving Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5.

Methods: Between July and August 2005, 14112 women from 45 counties in 10 western provinces of China were enrolled in a cross-sectional study by a multi-stage probability sampling method. The women completed a structured questionnaire, and a 2-level logistic regression model was used to examine the data. Results: The proportion of women who had prenatal care was 95%. The average number of prenatal visits was 4.94. The proportion of women who had more than 4 prenatal visits was 52.9%, and 66.9% of these had their first prenatal visit within 12 weeks of gestation. The hospital delivery rate was 86.3%. The frequency of postnatal visits was 84.8%, and the average number of postnatal visits was 2.19. Han ethnicity, higher education, lower parity, higher wealth index, and lower altitude of county had a higher odds ratio for more than 4 prenatal visits, hospital delivery, and postnatal visits. Conclusion: Maternal healthcare utilization seems to be associated with socio-economic and regional factors. The Chinese government should focus on the supply, funding, and quality of maternity services in rural areas. (C) 2011 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

J	Larose, A; Moore, S; Harper, S; Lynch, J				Larose, Auburn; Moore, Spencer; Harper, Sam; Lynch, John			Global income-related inequalities in HIV testing	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						HIV; inequalities; socioeconomic factors; World Health	SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIOR; CONDOM USE; THAILAND; UGANDA	Background Voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) is an important prevention initiative in reducing HIV/AIDS transmission. Despite current global prevention efforts, many low-and middle-income countries continue reporting low VCT levels. Little is known about the association of within-and between-country socioeconomic inequalities and VCT. Based on the 'inverse equity hypothesis,' this study examines the degree to which low socioeconomic groups in developing countries are disadvantaged in VCT. Methods Using recently released data from the 2002 to 2003 World Health Survey (WHS) for 106 705 individuals in 49 countries, this study used multilevel logistic regression to examine the association of individual-and national-level factors with VCT, and whether national economic development moderated the association between individual income and VCT. Individual income was based on country-specific income quintiles. National economic development was based on national gross domestic product per capita (GDP/c). Effect modification was evaluated with the likelihood ratio test (G(2)). Individuals eligible for the VCT question of the WHS were adults between the ages of 18-49 years; women who had given birth in the last 2 years were excluded from this question. Results VCT was more likely among higher income quintiles and in countries with higher GDP/c. GDP/c moderated the association between individual income and VCT whereby relative income differences in VCT were greater in countries with lower GDP/c (G(2) 9.21; P = 0.002). Individual socio-demographic characteristics were also associated with the likelihood of a person having VCT. Conclusions Relative socioeconomic inequalities in VCT coverage appear to decline when higher SES groups reach a certain level of coverage. These findings suggest that changes to international VCT programs may be necessary to moderate the relative VCT differences between high- and low-income individuals in lower GDP/c nations.

This may be particularly important in developing countries where the health of internal migrating populations may affect economic development. We use a large representative sample of adults residing in Kathmandu, Nepal to investigate the utility of a stress process model for understanding the mental health effects of rural-to-urban migration. Because our sample contains both migrants and non-migrants, we are able to compare the importance of stressors common to all urban dwellers and those specific to migrants (i.e. acculturation stressors) as they affect the well-being of urban residents. Results show that acculturation-related stressors and social support problems are less salient for explaining distress and mental health symptoms than common stressors and social support problems. Migrants do face more chronic stressors, have more social support problems and report higher levels of distress and symptoms. We speculate that this has more to do with the social inequality that results from migration than with specific migration-related stressors or loss of social resources.

Analysis of the distributional impact of out-of-pocket health payments: Evidence from a public health insurance program for the poor in Mexico	JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						Out-of-pocket payments; Poverty; Distributional impact; marginal dominance	POVERTY; EXPENDITURES; REFORMS; CARE; INEQUALITY; DOMINANCE	Many governments have health programs focused on improving health among the poor and these have an impact on out-of-pocket health payments made by individuals. Therefore, one of the objectives of these programs is to reach the poorest and reduce their out-of-pocket expenditure. In this paper we propose the distributional poverty impact approach to measure the poverty impact of out-of-pocket health payments of different health financing policies. This approach is comparable to the impoverishment methodology proposed by Wagstaff and van Doorslaer (2003) that compares poverty indices before and after out-of-pocket health payments. In order to escape the specification of a particular poverty index, we use the marginal dominance approach that uses non-intersecting curves and can rank poverty reducing health financing policies. We present an empirical application of the out-of-pocket health payments for an innovative social financing policy implemented in Mexico named Seguro Popular. The paper finds evidence that Seguro Popular program has a better distributional poverty impact when families face illness when compared to other poverty reducing policies. The empirical dominance approach uses data from Mexico in 2006 and considers international poverty standards of $2 per person per day. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Peak Oil, Food Systems, and Public Health	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							CHILD UNDERNUTRITION; ENERGY INPUTS; AGRICULTURE; BIOFUELS; US; INCREASE; CONSEQUENCES; WATER	Peak oil is the phenomenon whereby global oil supplies will peak, then decline, with extraction growing increasingly costly. Today's globalized industrial food system depends on oil for fueling farm machinery, producing pesticides, and transporting goods. Biofuels production links oil prices to food prices. We examined food system vulnerability to rising oil prices and the public health consequences. In the short term, high food prices harm food security and equity. Over time, high prices will force the entire food system to adapt. Strong preparation and advance investment may mitigate the extent of dislocation and hunger. Certain social and policy changes could smooth adaptation; public health has an essential role in promoting a proactive, smart, and equitable transition that increases resilience and enables adequate food for all.

Lifestyle and self-rated health: a cross-sectional study of 3,601 citizens of Athens, Greece	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						self-rated health; health promotion; sleep; health inequalities; lifestyle; public health	REPORTED HEALTH; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MORTALITY; INEQUALITIES; DETERMINANTS; WOMEN; MEN; ASSOCIATION; PREDICTOR; COMMUNITY	Background: Self-rated health (SRH) is a popular health measure determined by multiple factors. International literature is increasingly focusing on health-related behaviors such as smoking, dietary habits, physical activity, even religiosity. However, population-based studies taking into account multiple putative determinants of SRH in Greece are scarce. The aim of this study was to clarify possible determinants of SRH with an emphasis on the relationship between SRH and lifestyle variables in a large sample of urban citizens. Methods: In this one-year cross-sectional study, a stratified random sample of 3,601 urban citizens was selected. Data were collected using an interview-based questionnaire about various demographic, socioeconomic, disease- and lifestyle related factors such as smoking, physical activity, dietary habits, sleep quality and religiosity. Multivariate logistic regression was used separately in three age groups [15-29 (N = 1,360), 30-49 (N = 1,122) and 50+ (N = 1,119) years old] in order to identify putative lifestyle and other determinants of SRH. Results: Reporting of good SRH decreased with age (97.1%, 91.4% and 74.8%, respectively). Overall, possible confounders of the lifestyle-SRH relationship among age groups were sex, education, hospitalization during the last year, daily physical symptoms and disease status. Poor SRH was associated with less physical activity in the 15-29 years old (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.14-4.33), with past or heavy smoking, along with no sleep satisfaction in the 30-49 years old (OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.35-7.74, OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.29-5.05, OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.1-2.92, respectively) and with obesity and no sleep satisfaction in the 50+ years old individuals (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.19-2.81, OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.83-3.54). Sleep dissatisfaction of the 50+ years old was the only variable associated with poor SRH at the 0.001 p level of significance (OR 2.45, 99% CI 1.59 to 3.76). Subgroup analyses of the 15-19 years old individuals also revealed sleep dissatisfaction as the only significant variable correlated with SRH. Conclusions: Slight differences in lifestyle determinants of SRH were identified among age groups. Sleep quality emerged as an important determinant of SRH in the majority of participants.

However, there exists a sizeable discrepancy between the supply and demand of organs, especially in developing countries, where lack of expertise, financial constraints, and inadequate transplant facilities have been obstacles. According to current practice, donors must be dead before unpaired vital organs can be recovered. Equal health warrants needs-based health care for everyone. Recovering viable organs from donors while they are alive, but with death inevitable, may be significant to persons on waiting lists. Future policies in organ transplantation must be made after thorough consideration of all aspects of donation and dealing with the inequalities of health care. These pose a challenge for medicolegal and ethical organizations.

Juvenile Delinquency and Teenage Pregnancy: A Comparison of Ecological Risk Profiles Among Midwestern White and Black Female Juvenile Offenders	PSYCHOLOGY OF WOMEN QUARTERLY			English	Article						juvenile delinquency; adolescent pregnancy; risk assessment; criminal justice; racial differences; substance abuse; health behaviors	SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED-DISEASES; ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; MENTAL-HEALTH; DRUG-USE; CONTEXTUAL FACTORS; PHYSICAL ABUSE; SUBSTANCE USE; ALCOHOL-USE; GENDER	The authors examined ecological risk factors associated with teen pregnancy with a sample of 1,190 court-involved female juvenile offenders between 11 and 18 years of age. Data were obtained from five Midwestern juvenile county courts using a recently developed youth risk assessment instrument called the global risk assessment device (GRAD). In line with past research on teen pregnancy, the authors found that young African American female offenders were three times more likely to have ever been pregnant than their European American counterparts. Factorial multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) procedures were conducted to identify the ecological risk domains that differentiated groups of female juvenile offenders in the sample of this study, based on their pregnancy history and racial background. The findings of this study suggest that female offenders who had experienced a pregnancy had significantly higher levels of health-related risks as compared to their counterparts who had never been pregnant. Furthermore, regardless of their pregnancy history, White female offenders reported significantly greater involvement in substance abuse behaviors as compared to Blacks. Taken together, these findings underscore the need to utilize comprehensive risk assessments when designing integrated intervention programs that are tailored to the unique needs of young female offenders who are at risk for early pregnancies.

J	Barendrecht, M				Barendrecht, Maurits			Rule of Law, Measuring and Accountability: Problems to be Solved Bottom Up	HAGUE JOURNAL ON THE RULE OF LAW			English	Article							JUSTICE	Efforts to measure the rule of law trigger a process of clarifying how the rule of law impacts people's lives. Accountability emerges as a key element of the rule of law. Nowadays, accountability is created through courts and by countless other forums, including the court of public opinion. Legal pluralism is common: the standards for accountability can be norms from local, national and international levels, set by public or private organizations, formal as well as informal. Measuring the status and progress in the field of rule of law would then require investigating what these accountability mechanisms jointly produce, working together and competing with each other. But how can this be established? Inspired by developments in the health care sector, this paper suggests focusing on specific problems and the way they are resolved. Legal needs studies and crime surveys suggest a classification of problems for which accountability is frequently sought. This can be extended to other areas of governance. These studies also gather data about the incidence of problems and which forums are actually addressed for accountability. Sophisticated client satisfaction surveys now monitor whether this leads to fair and acceptable results. Evidence based treatments for some legal problems are also developing. The rule of law in a country may eventually be measured as the capacity to prevent and resolve the most urgent problems. Interventions can focus on specific, urgent problems, opt for the best available 'treatments' and measure progress systematically.

An ecological approach also helps to reveal the grounding of global responsibilities and an alternative conception of justice for long-term care and global health equity more generally.

Changes in World Inequality in Length of Life: 1970-2000	POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW			English	Article							GLOBAL DEMOGRAPHIC CONVERGENCE; EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; HEALTH INEQUALITY; INCOME INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; COMPRESSION; LONGEVITY; DIVERGENCE; COUNTRIES; SPANS	Previous research has revealed much global convergence over the past several decades in life expectancy at birth and in infant mortality, which are closely linked. But trends in the variance of length of life, and in the variance of length of adult life in particular, are less well understood. I examine life-span inequality in a comprehensive panel of 180 countries observed in 1970 and 2000. Convergence in infant mortality has unambiguously reduced world inequality in total length of life starting from birth, but world inequality in length of adult life has remained largely unchanged. Underlying both of these observations is a growing share of total inequality attributable to between-country variation. Especially among developed countries, the absolute level of between-country inequality has risen over time. The sources of widening inequality in length of life between countries remain unclear, but signs point away from changes in income, leaving patterns of knowledge diffusion as a likely candidate.

J	Pratt, B; Loff, B				Pratt, Bridget; Loff, Bebe			JUSTICE IN INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL RESEARCH	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						justice; clinical trials; research ethics; global health		Debates about justice in international clinical research problematically conflate two quite different forms of obligation. International research ethics guidelines were intended to describe how to conduct biomedical research in a just manner at the micro or clinical level (within the researcher-participant interaction) but have come to include requirements that are clearly intended to promote justice at the global level. Ethicists have also made a variety of claims regarding what international research should contribute to global justice. This paper argues that the conflation of debates about justice at the micro and macro-levels has not only resulted in the placement of obligations upon the wrong actors but has also served to exclude relevant actors from the ethical picture. Suggestions for who should properly bear macro-level obligations of justice in international clinical research are offered. The paper further contends that, unlike researchers who violate informed consent requirements, no similar type of accountability exists for obligations of global justice, even for those obligation-bearers (incorrectly) identified by current ethics guidelines.

J	Newman, CJ; de Vries, DH; Kanakuze, JD; Ngendahimana, G				Newman, Constance J.; de Vries, Daniel H.; Kanakuze, Jeanne d'Arc; Ngendahimana, Gerard			Workplace violence and gender discrimination in Rwanda's health workforce: Increasing safety and gender equality	HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH			English	Article								Background: Workplace violence has been documented in all sectors, but female-dominated sectors such as health and social services are at particular risk. In 2007-2008, IntraHealth International assisted the Rwanda Ministries of Public Service and Labor and Health to study workplace violence in Rwanda's health sector. This article reexamines a set of study findings that directly relate to the influence of gender on workplace violence, synthesizes these findings with other research from Rwanda, and examines the subsequent impact of the study on Rwanda's policy environment. Methods: Fifteen out of 30 districts were selected at random. Forty-four facilities at all levels were randomly selected in these districts. From these facilities, 297 health workers were selected at random, of whom 205 were women and 92 were men. Researchers used a utilization-focused approach and administered health worker survey, facility audits, key informant and health facility manager interviews and focus groups to collect data in 2007. After the study was disseminated in 2008, stakeholder recommendations were documented and three versions of the labor law were reviewed to assess study impact. Results: Thirty-nine percent of health workers had experienced some form of workplace violence in year prior to the study. The study identified gender-related patterns of perpetration, victimization and reactions to violence. Negative stereotypes of women, discrimination based on pregnancy, maternity and family responsibilities and the 'glass ceiling' affected female health workers' experiences and career paths and contributed to a context of violence. Gender equality lowered the odds of health workers experiencing violence. Rwandan stakeholders used study results to formulate recommendations to address workplace violence gender discrimination through policy reform and programs. Conclusions: Gender inequality influences workplace violence. Addressing gender discrimination and violence simultaneously should be a priority in workplace violence research, workforce policies, strategies, laws and human resources management training. This will go a long way in making workplaces safer and fairer for the health workforce. This is likely to improve workforce productivity and retention and the enjoyment of human rights at work. Finally, studies that involve stakeholders throughout the research process are likely to improve the utilization of results and policy impact.

A review of equity issues in quantitative studies on health inequalities: the case of asthma in adults	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Review							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; RISK-FACTORS; PREVALENCE; DISPARITIES; SYMPTOMS; CAUSATION; EXPOSURE	Background: The term 'inequities' refers to avoidable differences rooted in injustice. This review examined whether or not, and how, quantitative studies identifying inequalities in risk factors and health service utilization for asthma explicitly addressed underlying inequities. Asthma was chosen because recent decades have seen strong increases in asthma prevalence in many international settings, and inequalities in risk factors and related outcomes. Methods: A review was conducted of studies that identified social inequalities in asthma-related outcomes or health service use in adult populations. Data were extracted on use of equity terms (objective evidence), and discussion of equity issues without using the exact terms (subjective evidence). Results: Of the 219 unique articles retrieved, 21 were eligible for inclusion. None used the terms equity/inequity. While all but one article traced at least partial pathways to inequity, only 52% proposed any intervention and 55% of these interventions focused exclusively on the more proximal, clinical level. Conclusions: Without more in-depth and systematic examination of inequities underlying asthma prevalence, quantitative studies may fail to provide the evidence required to inform equity-oriented interventions to address underlying circumstances restricting opportunities for health.
