Two are highly visible: pricing policies and intellectual property rights; two are less recognized: the regulatory environment and scientific and technological capacities. Two ongoing transitions influence and even distort the problem of universal access to medications: the epidemiologic transition to an increasing burden of chronic non-communicable diseases; and the growing role of biotechnology products (especially immunobiologicals) in the pharmacopeia. Examples from Cuba and Brazil are used to explore what can and should be done to address commercial, regulatory, and technological aspects of assuring universal access to medications.

As a result of the politics of inequality between rich and poor countries, one or a few health systems are set up as models. Every country, irrespective of political or economic status, should be open to learning from others to build relevant and cost-effective systems. To combat the current global challenge of chronic non-communicable diseases, poor countries have the advantage of flexible health systems that are veritable laboratories of health systems research. Not only can research conducted in these health systems help harness the potential of mobile communication technologies and informal health providers, it can also help rich country health systems adapt to meet the chronic disease challenge.

J	Bambra, C				Bambra, Clare			Health inequalities and welfare state regimes: theoretical insights on a public health 'puzzle'	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							SELF-PERCEIVED HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; EDUCATIONAL-LEVEL; EUROPE; INCOME; COUNTRIES; MORTALITY; POLITICS; POLICIES	Welfare states are important determinants of health. Comparative social epidemiology has almost invariably concluded that population health is enhanced by the relatively generous and universal welfare provision of the Scandinavian countries. However, most international studies of socioeconomic inequalities in health have thrown up something of a public health 'puzzle' as the Scandinavian welfare states do not, as would generally be expected, have the smallest health inequalities. This essay outlines and interrogates this puzzle by drawing upon existing theories of health inequalities-artefact, selection, cultural-behavioural, materialist, psychosocial and life course-to generate some theoretical insights. It discusses the limits of these theories in respect to cross-national research; it questions the focus and normative paradigm underpinning contemporary comparative health inequalities research; and it considers the future of comparative social epidemiology.

The Intervention for Health Enhancement After Leaving is a comprehensive, trauma informed, primary health care intervention, which builds on the grounded theory Strengthening Capacity to Limit Intrusion and other research findings. Delivered by a nurse and a domestic violence advocate working collaboratively with women through 6 components (safeguarding, managing basics, managing symptoms, cautious connecting, renewing self, and regenerating family), this promising intervention is in the early phases of testing.

Amongst other aspects of this concern has been the recognition that EDs constitute a critical boundary between the community and the hospital and a key point for the identification of social care needs. Consequently, EDs have become the focus for a variety of service developments which combine the provision of acute medical and nursing assessment and care with a range of activities in which social care is a prominent feature. One approach to this has been the establishment of multidisciplinary teams aiming to prevent re-attendance or admission, re-direct patients to other services, or speed patients through EDs with the aim of providing improved quality of care. This study, carried out between September 2007 and April 2008, was the first UK national survey of social care initiatives based in EDs and aimed to determine the objectives, organisation, extent, functions, funding and evidence on outcomes of such interventions. Eighty-three per cent of UK Type I and II EDs responded to the survey. Approximately, one-third of EDs had embedded social care teams, with two-thirds relying on referrals to external social care services. These teams varied in their focus, size and composition, leadership, availability, funding and permanence. As a result, the unintended effect has been to increase inequities in access to social care services through EDs. Three further conclusions are drawn about policy led, locally-based service development. This survey adds to international evidence pointing to the potential benefits of a variety of social care interventions being based in EDs and justifies the establishment of a research programme which can provide answers to key outstanding questions.

Conceptualizing holism in international interdisciplinary critical perspective: Toward a framework for understanding holistic health	SOCIAL THEORY & HEALTH			English	Article						holism; mind-body; interconnection; systems science; interdisciplinary; international	YOGA; CARE	The concept of holism is defined in disparate ways. This article offers foundational understandings of this term from various parts of the world, illustrating the virtually universal, historical, as well as contemporary nature of ideas such as interconnectedness, unity and oneness. Throughout human history, holistic worldviews were dominant until the past 400 years or so. At present, a revival of holistic thought-forms is taking place in many parts of the world. The purpose of this article is to sketch the landscape of holistic philosophical foundations, discuss systems science in this context and apply these underpinnings to holistic health in the hope that it will increase our understanding of both the conceptual foundations of holism, as well as its applications to health promotion, disease prevention, treatment of ill health and palliation. The article will conclude with the recommendation that holistic health-care practitioners take social inequities into account, so that this integrative health-care can become a means for individuals to take action for wellness, as well as a means to create structural changes toward equitable resource distribution.

Why parents cross for children's health care: Transnational cultural capital in the United States-Mexico border region	SOCIAL THEORY & HEALTH			English	Article						Cultural capital; children's asthma; transnational; US-Mexico border; El Paso; Texas; Ciudad Juarez; Chihuahua	SOCIAL SPACE; EL-PASO; BOURDIEU; INEQUALITIES; ACCESS	To investigate how cultural capital functions in transnational health fields, the experiences of 13 low-income parents of Mexican-decent Living in El Paso, Texas and 11 low-income Mexican parents living in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico are considered as they negotiate the US-Mexican border for health care for their children with asthma. Parents on both sides crossed to receive affordable care, 'better' services, and/or the 'correct' diagnosis. When parents did not cross, it was because of a lack of documentation, incomplete knowledge and other constraints. To understand these crossing behaviors, the concept of transnational cultural capital, that is the transnational power to achieve desired ends in a health-care field that spans borders, is introduced, building off Pierre Bourdieu. Transnational cultural capital is relevant in other transnational settings, such as large urban areas whereby immigrants, have the option to access treatments from their home country, the United States, and other naturopathic remedies.

The implementation of the vaccines, however, is far from universal or equitable. Socio-economically marginalized women in emerging and developing, and many advanced economies alike, suffer a disproportionately large burden of cervical cancer. Despite the marketing of Human Papillomavirus vaccines as the solution to cervical cancer, the market authorization (licensing) of the vaccines has not translated into universal equitable access. Vaccine implementation for vulnerable girls and women faces multiple barriers that include high vaccine costs, inadequate delivery infrastructure, and lack of community engagement to generate awareness about cervical cancer and early screening tools. For Human Papillomavirus vaccines to work as a public health solution, the quality-assured delivery of cheaper vaccines must be integrated with strengthened capacity for community-based health education and screening.

More than 90% of these tumors of the mucosal lining are classified as squamous cell carcinoma developed from premalignant lesions such as leukoplakia and erythroleukoplakia. These carcinomas are associated to environmental and lifestyle risk factors, among which tobacco and alcohol play a major role. In addition to tobacco smoking, tobacco chewing is another risk factor as well as chewing betel quid and areca nut in Asia. Certain strains of virus, such as the sexually transmitted human papilloma virus, also play a carcinogenetic role. The temporal trends in incidence of these tumors relate to environmental factors; there is an increase in tendency in countries without prevention and a decrease in countries having an active policy of prevention of alcohol and tobacco consumption. In contrast, an increased incidence occurs in the world at tumor sites related to human papilloma virus infection in relation to changes in sexual habits.

Medline bibliometrics were used to estimate epidemiological publication output by country. Key informant surveys, Internet and literature searches and author knowledge and networks were used to elicit perspectives on epidemiological training, research, funding and workforce. Findings The WPR has the lowest age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) rate per 1000 of the six WHO regions, with non-communicable disease making the largest percentage contributions in both low- and middle-income countries (LMICs, 68%) and high-income countries (HICs, 84%) in the WPR. The number of Medline-indexed epidemiological research publications per year was greatest for Japan, Australia and China. However, the rate per head of population was greatest for Micronesia and New Zealand. The substantive focus of research roughly equated with burden of disease patterns. Research capacity (staff, funding, infrastructure) varies hugely between countries. Epidemiology training embedded within academic Masters of Public Health programmes is the dominant vehicle for training in most countries. Field epidemiology and in-service training are also common. The Pacific Island countries and territories, because of sparse populations over large distances and chronic workforce and funding capacity problems, rely on outside agencies (e.g. WHO, universities) for provision of training. Cross-national networks and collaborations are increasing. Conclusion Communicable disease surveillance and research need consolidation (especially in eastern Asian WPR countries), and non-communicable disease epidemiological capacity requires strengthening to match disease trends. Capacity and sustainability of both training and research within LMICs in WPR are ongoing priorities. China in particular is advancing quickly. One role for the IEA in building capacity is facilitating collaborative networks within WPR.

J	Sanders, D; Baum, FE; Benos, A; Legge, D				Sanders, David; Baum, Fran E.; Benos, Alexis; Legge, David			Revitalising primary healthcare requires an equitable global economic system - now more than ever	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							EXPERIENCE	The promised revitalisation of primary healthcare (PHC) is happening at a time when the contradictions and unfairness of the global economic system have become clear, suggesting that the current system is unsustainable. In the past two decades, one of the most significant impediments to the implementation of comprehensive PHC has been neoliberal economic policies and their imposition globally. This article questions what will be required for PHC to flourish. PHC incorporates five key principles: equitable provision of services, comprehensive care, intersectoral action, community involvement and appropriate technology. This article considers intersectoral action and comprehensiveness and their potential to be implemented in the current global environment. It highlights the constraints to intersectoral action through a case study of nutrition in the context of globalisation of the food chain. It also explores the challenges to implementing a comprehensive approach to health that are posed by neoliberal health sector reforms and donor practices. The paper concludes that even well-designed health systems based on PHC have little influence over the broader economic forces that shape their operation and their ability to improve health. Reforming these economic forces will require greater regulation of the national and global economic environment to emphasise people's health rather than private profit, and action to address climate change. Revitalisation of PHC and progress towards health equity are unlikely without strong regulation of the market. The further development and strengthening of social movements for health will be key to successful advocacy action.

J	Ollila, E				Ollila, Eeva			Health in All Policies: From rhetoric to action	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Equity; Health in All Policies; health policy; intersectoral action for health; national health programmes; public policy		Aims: The fact that health is largely constructed outside the remits of the health sector has been known for a long time. However, implementing intersectoral health policies is difficult. The aim of this article is to study possibilities for strengthening the implementation of Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach. Methods: The article analyses earlier efforts in intersectoral health policy-making and adapts Kingdon's theory on policy change for exploring opportunities and challenges for strengthening HiAP approach. Results: Opportunities for HiAP can be identified by analysing possibilities for amending health determinants on the one hand, and by analysing policy trends, proposals, and actors, especially in fields other than health, on the other. Four basic strategies for HiAP are identified, namely: health strategy, win-win strategy, cooperation strategy, and damage limitation strategy. Their strengths in various situations are explored. Using an adaptation of Kingdon's framework, possibilities for creating opportunities for HiAP by raising health issues on the agenda, developing appropriate tools and by creating conducive momentums are discussed. Conclusions: It is concluded that systematic efforts of experts in public health, health policy, and international health are important in identifying and prioritising the needs for HiAP, in analysing health implications of policies and policy proposals and making these understood by the policy-makers, as well as in suggesting feasible solutions. Improving health literacy of the public, the policy-makers, and the media is key for improved understanding on health implications of policies. Participatory and transparent approaches to policy-making are prerequisites for strengthening HiAP.

International comparisons of countries with different welfare state regimes may provide further understanding of the social determinants of sex inequalities in health. This study aims to evaluate (1) whether there are sex inequalities in health functioning as measured by the Short Form 36 (SF-36), and (2) whether work characteristics contribute to the sex inequalities in health among employees from Britain, Finland, and Japan, representing liberal, social democratic, and conservative welfare state regimes, respectively. The participants were 7340 (5122 men and 2218 women) British employees, 2297 (1638 men and 659 women) Japanese employees, and 8164 (1649 men and 6515 women) Finnish employees. All the participants were civil servants aged 40-60 years. We found that more women than men tended to have disadvantaged work characteristics (i.e. low employment grade, low job control, high job demands, and long work hours) but such sex differences were relatively smaller among employees from Finland, where more gender equal policies exist than Britain and Japan. The age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of women for poor physical functioning was the largest for British women (OR = 2.08), followed by for Japanese women (OR = 1.72), and then for Finnish women (OR = 1.51). The age-adjusted OR of women for poor mental functioning was the largest for Japanese women (OR = 1.91), followed by for British women (OR = 1.45), and then for Finnish women (OR = 1.07). Thus, sex differences in physical and mental health was the smallest in the Finnish population. The larger the sex differences in work characteristics, the larger the sex differences in health and the reduction in the sex differences in health after adjustment for work characteristics. These results suggest that egalitarian and gender equal policies may contribute to smaller sex differences in health, through smaller differences in disadvantaged work characteristics between men and women.

Stature and robusticity during the agricultural transition: Evidence from the bioarchaeological record	ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Stature; Skeletal robusticity; Agricultural transition; Paleopathology	LONG-BONE-GROWTH; POSTCRANIAL ROBUSTICITY; SKELETAL GROWTH; PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS; GLOBAL DATABASE; ADULT STATURE; DARK-AGES; BODY-SIZE; HEALTH; MORTALITY	The population explosion that followed the Neolithic revolution was initially explained by improved health experiences for agriculturalists. However, empirical studies of societies shifting subsistence from foraging to primary food production have found evidence for deteriorating health from an increase in infectious and dental disease and a rise in nutritional deficiencies. In Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture (Cohen and Armelagos, 1984), this trend towards declining health was observed for 19 of 21 societies undergoing the agricultural transformation. The counterintuitive increase in nutritional diseases resulted from seasonal hunger, reliance on single crops deficient in essential nutrients, crop blights, social inequalities, and trade. In this study, we examined the evidence of stature reduction in studies since 1984 to evaluate if the trend towards decreased health after agricultural transitions remains. The trend towards a decrease in adult height and a general reduction of overall health during times of subsistence change remains valid, with the majority of studies finding stature to decline as the reliance on agriculture increased. The impact of agriculture, accompanied by increasing population density and a rise in infectious disease, was observed to decrease stature in populations from across the entire globe and regardless of the temporal period during which agriculture was adopted, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, South America, and North America.

Children's health and parental socioeconomic factors: a population-based survey in Finland	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						child; health; socioeconomic factors; population-based study	SELF-ASSESSED HEALTH; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; FAMILY POVERTY; INEQUALITIES; INCOME; ADOLESCENTS; CHILDHOOD; YOUTH	Background: Socioeconomic inequalities in health are a global problem, not only among the adult population but also among children. However, studies concerning young children especially are rare. The aim of this study was to describe the health of Finnish children under 12 years of age, and the socioeconomic factors associated with health. The socioeconomic factors were parental education level, household net income, and working status. Methods: A population-based survey among Finnish children aged under 12 years (n = 6,000) was conducted in spring 2007. A questionnaire was sent to parents, and a response rate of 67% was achieved. Each child's health was explored by asking a parent to report the child's health status on a 5-point Likert scale, current symptoms from a symptoms list, and current disease(s) diagnosed by a physician. The final three outcome measures were poor health, the prevalences of psychosomatic symptoms, and long-term diseases. Data were analysed using Pearson's Chi-Square tests, and logistic regression analysis with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). P-values <= 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results: In total, 3% of parents reported that their child's health status was poor. The prevalences of psychosomatic symptoms and long-term diseases were both 11%. The probability for poor health status was lowest among children aged 3-6 and 7-11 years, and for psychosomatic symptoms among 3-6-year-old children, whereas the odds ratios for long-term diseases was highest among children aged 7-11 years. Parental socioeconomic factors were not associated with the children's health. Conclusions: Most of the children were reported by their parent to have good health status, and approximately one tenth had experienced some psychosomatic symptoms or long-term diseases. Our study suggests that parental socioeconomic factors are not associated with the health of children aged under 12 years in Finland.

A review of global progress toward the Millennium Development Goal 1 Hunger Target	FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN			English	Review						Determinants; food systems; hunger; MDG1; poverty; undernutrition	SEVERE ACUTE MALNUTRITION; CHILD UNDERNUTRITION; RURAL AREA; NUTRITION; MORTALITY; HEALTH; FOOD	Background. The hunger component of the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG) aims to reduce the proportion of people who suffer from hunger by half between 1990 and 2015. In low- and middle-income countries, progress has been mixed, with approximately 925 million people hungry and 125 million and 195 million children underweight and stunted, respectively Objective. To assess global progress on the hunger component of MDG1 and evaluate the success of interventions and country programs in reducing undernutrition. Methods. We review global progress on the hunger component of MDG I, examining experience from 40 community-based programs as well as national efforts to move interventions to scale drawn from the published and gray literature, alongside personal interviews with representatives of governments and development agencies. Results. Based on this review, most strategies being implemented and scaled are focusing on treatment of malnutrition and rooted within the health sector. While critical, these programs generally address disease-related effects and emphasize the immediate determinants of undernutrition. Other major strategies to tackle undernutrition rely on the production of staple grains within the agriculture sector. These programs address hunger, as opposed to improving the quality of diets within communities. Strategies that adopt multisectoral programming as crucial to address longer-term determinants of undernutrition, such as poverty, gender equality, and functioning food and health systems, remain underdeveloped and under-researched. Conclusions. This review suggests that accelerating progress toward the MDG1 targets is less about the development of novel innovations and new technologies and more about putting what is already known into practice. Success will hinge on linking clear policies with effective delivery systems in working towards an evidence-based and contextually relevant multisectoral package of interventions that can rapidly be taken to scale.

We conducted a repeated population-based cross-sectional study to determine trends in health, functioning and physical activity in the young-old Finnish population. Methods: Representative samples of community-dwelling people aged 65-69 years in 1988 (n=362), 1996 (n=320) and 2004 (n=292) were compared in socio-economic status, self-rated health, chronic diseases, memory problems, ability to carry out instrumental activities of daily living, physical activity, and five-year mortality. Results: Significant improvement in all the investigated modalities, except that of chronic diseases, was observed in the newer cohorts. In logistic regression analysis, after controlling for socioeconomic status and gender, cohort effects remained significant for memory problems, IADL difficulties and physical activity. Cox regression analyses showed significant improvement in survival when later cohorts were compared with the earlier ones. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of improving levels of socio-economic status, self-rated health, functioning, physical activity, and lower risk of mortality in the newer cohorts of the Finnish young-old, but this was not accompanied by a parallel diminution in chronic diseases.

Children's independent mobility (i.e., outdoor play and traveling to destinations unsupervised), an integral component of physical activity in childhood, has also declined radically in recent decades. Safety-conscious parenting practices, car reliance and auto-centric urban design have converged to produce children living increasingly sedentary lives. This research investigates how urban neighborhood environments can support or enable or restrict children's independent mobility, thereby influencing physical activity accumulation and participation in daily life. Methods/Design: The study is located in six Auckland, New Zealand neighborhoods, diverse in terms of urban design attributes, particularly residential density. Participants comprise 160 children aged 9-11 years and their parents/caregivers. Objective measures (global positioning systems, accelerometers, geographical information systems, observational audits) assessed children's independent mobility and physical activity, neighborhood infrastructure, and streetscape attributes. Parent and child neighborhood perceptions and experiences were assessed using qualitative research methods. Discussion: This study is one of the first internationally to examine the association of specific urban design attributes with child independent mobility. Using robust, appropriate, and best practice objective measures, this study provides robust epidemiological information regarding the relationships between the built environment and health outcomes for this population.

J	Chuma, J; Okungu, V				Chuma, Jane; Okungu, Vincent			Viewing the Kenyan health system through an equity lens: implications for universal coverage	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article							USER FEES; HOUSEHOLD LEVEL; SECTOR REFORMS; RURAL KENYA; CARE; AFRICA; IMPACT; FRAMEWORK; LESSONS; CHARGES	Introduction: Equity and universal coverage currently dominate policy debates worldwide. Health financing approaches are central to universal coverage. The way funds are collected, pooled, and used to purchase or provide services should be carefully considered to ensure that population needs are addressed under a universal health system. The aim of this paper is to assess the extent to which the Kenyan health financing system meets the key requirements for universal coverage, including income and risk cross-subsidisation. Recommendations on how to address existing equity challenges and progress towards universal coverage are made. Methods: An extensive review of published and gray literature was conducted to identify the sources of health care funds in Kenya. Documents were mainly sourced from the Ministry of Medical Services and the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation. Country level documents were the main sources of data. In cases where data were not available at the country level, they were sought from the World Health Organisation website. Each financing mechanism was analysed in respect to key functions namely, revenue generation, pooling and purchasing. Results: The Kenyan health sector relies heavily on out-of-pocket payments. Government funds are mainly allocated through historical incremental approach. The sector is largely underfunded and health care contributions are regressive (i.e. the poor contribute a larger proportion of their income to health care than the rich). Health financing in Kenya is fragmented and there is very limited risk and income cross-subsidisation. The country has made little progress towards achieving international benchmarks including the Abuja target of allocating 15% of government's budget to the health sector. Conclusions: The Kenyan health system is highly inequitable and policies aimed at promoting equity and addressing the needs of the poor and vulnerable have not been successful. Some progress has been made towards addressing equity challenges, but universal coverage will not be achieved unless the country adopts a systemic approach to health financing reforms. Such an approach should be informed by the wider health system goals of equity and efficiency.

J	Pearce, JR; Maddison, R				Pearce, Jamie R.; Maddison, Ralph			Do enhancements to the urban built environment improve physical activity levels among socially disadvantaged populations?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Physical activity; neighbourhoods; connectivity; open space; green space; health inequalities; New Zealand	BODY-MASS INDEX; PUBLIC OPEN SPACES; NEIGHBORHOOD GREENNESS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; RECREATIONAL RESOURCES; NATURAL-ENVIRONMENT; NEW-ZEALAND; HEALTH; WALKING; OBESITY	Background: There is growing recognition that the urban built environment influences physical activity at the population level, although the effects on disadvantaged groups are less well understood. Using the examples of open/green space and street connectivity, this paper explores whether enhancements to the built environment have potential for addressing physical activity-related health inequalities among Maori, Pacific and low income communities in New Zealand. Method: A high-level review of the international literature relating open space and street connectivity to physical activity and/or related health outcomes at a population level was completed. Consideration was given to whether these features of the built environment have a disproportionate effect on disadvantaged populations. Results: Findings from international studies suggest that open space and street connectivity have a beneficial effect on physical activity. Enhancing the built environment may be particularly advantageous for improving physical activity levels among disadvantaged populations. Conclusion: It is likely that open space and street connectivity have a positive effect on physical activity behaviour; however due to the cross-sectional nature of existing research and the paucity of research among disadvantaged populations definitive conclusions about the effect in these populations cannot be made. Further research is required (e. g. natural experiments or quasi experimental research designs) to determine the effect of changing the environment on physical activity and obesity.

J	Stuart, AL; Zeager, M				Stuart, Amy L.; Zeager, Michelle			An inequality study of ambient nitrogen dioxide and traffic levels near elementary schools in the Tampa area	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Environmental equity; Intra-urban exposure disparities; Race/ethnicity; Traffic	AIR-POLLUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL-HEALTH; EXPOSURE; POPULATIONS; DISPARITIES; SEGREGATION; TOXICS; BAY	Environmental equity has been identified as a challenge and goal of national to global air quality management. Here, relationships between traffic-related air pollution measures and the social demographics of elementary schools are investigated. Ogawa passive samplers were used to measure ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels near 75 randomly selected elementary schools in the county containing Tampa, FL over one week in March 2008. Concentrations were determined using colorimetric reaction using Hach nitrite reagent and photometric detection at 545 nm. NO2 levels, two metrics of traffic (highest annual average daily traffic count within 500 m and 1000 m), and school enrollment data by demographic subgroup (racial/ethnic and socioeconomic) were then compared. Data were analyzed for distribution statistics, linear correlations, and differences in subgroup category means. Weighted average values of NO2 and traffic count were also calculated for each subgroup. All measured NO2 levels were low, with a mean of 2.7 ppbv and range from 0.8 to 4.7 ppbv. Values were largest at sites near downtown. Results from all analyses show comparatively higher potential exposures to measured NO2 and traffic count for black school children, and lower values for white and Asian or Pacific Islander school children. The economically disadvantaged and Hispanic subgroups were also associated with higher levels of NO2 and traffic counts, but the relationship was not as strong or robust. Although measured NO2 levels were low and the differences between groups are small, results suggest disparities by racial/ethnic and economic status in children's exposures to air pollution for the Tampa area.

J	Brikci, N; Holder, A				Brikci, Nouria; Holder, Alison			MDG4-HOPE OR DESPAIR FOR AFRICA?	REVISTA DE ECONOMIA MUNDIAL			English	Article						Millenium Development Goals; Child Health; Health Systems	SCALING-UP; HEALTH; MORTALITY; ASSISTANCE	Sub-Saharan Africa is repeatedly painted as a failure in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This article focuses on MDG4 (reduction of two thirds in the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015) and analyses the relative merit of the MDG framework as well as the success or failure of SSA in achieving this target. The authors argue that despite the positive impetus which the MDG4 target has represented for child health, it has failed to provide a framework within which equity considerations could be analysed, has detracted from the recognition of the importance of social determinants of health and has failed to highlight the interconnectedness of all MDGs. Further, whilst SSA is fairing worst in terms of MDG4, some countries have managed to get on track to achieve MDG4 or improve the health prospects of their children. A combination of intervention scale-up, additional resource allocation, health systems strengthening approach, partly explain these successes. Overall however, real challenges remain: lack of international and national resources, lack of health systems strengthening, lack of human resources at all levels of the health system, limited social protection mechanisms, slow 'diagonalisation' of programmes, and persistent environmental and socio-political factors.

Prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its association with educational inequalities among Brazilian adults: a population-based study	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Metabolic syndrome; Prevalence; Brazil; Diabetes	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; RISK-FACTORS; DEFINITION; MORTALITY; CRITERIA; HEALTH	The present study estimated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) according to the criteria established by the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and analyzed the contribution of social factors in an adult urban population in the Southeastern region of Brazil. The sample plan was based on multistage probability sampling according to family head income and educational level. A random sample of 1116 subjects aged 30 to 79 years was studied. Participants answered a questionnaire about socio-demographic variables and medical history. Fasting capillary glucose (FCG), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides were determined and all non-diabetic subjects were submitted to the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)), waist circumference and blood pressure (BP) were determined. Age-and gender-adjusted prevalence of MS was 35.9 and 43.2% according to NCEP-ATPIII and IDF criteria, respectively. Substantial agreement was found between NCEP-ATPIII and IDF definitions. Low HDL-C levels and high BP were the most prevalent MS components according to NCEP-ATPIII criteria (76.3 and 59.2%, respectively). Considering the diagnostic criteria adopted, 13.5% of the subjects had diabetes and 9.7% had FCG >= 100 mg/dL. MS prevalence was significantly associated with age, skin color, BMI, and educational level. This cross-sectional population-based study in the Southeastern region of Brazil indicates that MS is highly prevalent and associated with an important social indicator, i.e., educational level. This result suggests that in developing countries health policy planning to reduce the risk of MS, in particular, should consider improvement in education.	[Gronner, M. F.; Carvalho, A.

Past research in the social sciences suggests that environmental experiences related to social status contribute to these disparities, but the underlying biological mechanisms are only partially understood. Here, we review research related to three domains of environmental exposure that point to epigenetic contributions to health disparities: nutrition, psychosocial stress and environmental toxicant exposure. Each exposure has effects that may persist across the life course and in some instances may be transmitted to offspring via epigenetic inheritance. Since epigenetic markings provide a "memory" of past experiences, minimizing future disparities in health will be partially contingent upon our ability to address inequality in the current environment. We suggest that future research in environmental epigenetics focus on establishing the reversibility of stress-induced epigenetic modifications, and also on identifying positive epigenetic effects of environmental enrichment.

Methods: The participants were municipal employees without previous sciatica, aged 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 years at baseline (n = 5261, 80% women). Sciatica was defined as low back pain radiating to the calf or the foot. Data on occupational class, physical and psychosocial working conditions, body mass index, smoking, leisure-time physical activity, neck pain, local low back pain, and sciatica were obtained from baseline questionnaire surveys in 2000-2002. The question on sciatica was repeated in a follow-up survey in 2007. Logistic regression analysis was used. Results: In women, manual occupational class (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0-1.6 compared with managers/professionals), overweight (1.3; 1.1-1.5), obesity (1.4; 1.1-1.7), smoking (1.5; 1.2-1.7), low leisure-time physical activity (1.3; 1.0-1.7), previous acute (1.5; 1.3-1.7) and chronic (1.5; 1.1-2.0) local low back pain, and acute (1.20; 1.0-1.4) and chronic (1.5; 1.2-1.9) neck pain predicted the onset of sciatica in a multivariable model. In men, semi-professionals (1.5; 1.1-2.1) and manual workers (2.0; 1.4-2.8) had an increased risk compared with managers/professionals; also acute (1.5; 1.2-2.0) and chronic (2.1; 1.2-3.9) local low back pain predicted sciatica. Conclusions: Manual occupational class in both genders and semi-professional occupations in men, unhealthy behaviours and previous pain both in the neck and the lower back predicted sciatica, while physical and psychosocial working conditions had no independent effect.

J	Anderson, I; Axelson, H; Tan, BK				Anderson, Ian; Axelson, Henrik; Tan, B-K			The other crisis: the economics and financing of maternal, newborn and child health in Asia	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Global financial crisis and health; MDGs; maternal; newborn and child heath; health expenditures; Asia	CARE; EXPENDITURE; BANGLADESH; MORTALITY	The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008/2009 was the largest economic slowdown since the Great Depression. It undermined the growth and development prospects of developing countries. Several recent studies estimate the impact of economic shocks on the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children. Infant and child mortality rates are still likely to continue to decline, but at lower rates than would have been the case in the absence of the GFC. Asia faces special challenges. Despite having been the fastest growing region in the world for decades, and even before the current crisis, this region accounted for nearly 34% of global deaths of children under 5, more than 40% of maternal deaths and 60% of newborn deaths. Global development goals cannot be achieved without much faster and deeper progress in Asia. Current health financing systems in much of Asia are not well placed to respond to the needs of women and their children, or the recent global financial and economic slowdown. Public expenditure is often already too low, and high levels of out-of-pocket health expenditure are an independent cause of inequity and impoverishment for women and their children. The GFC highlights the need for reforms that will improve health outcomes for the poor, protect the vulnerable from financial distress, improve public expenditure patterns and resource allocation decisions, and so strengthen health systems. This paper aims to highlight the most recent assessments of how economic shocks, including the GFC, affect the poor in developing countries, especially vulnerable women and children in Asia. It concludes that conditional cash transfers, increasing taxation on tobacco and increasing the level, and quality, of public expenditure through well-designed investment programmes are particularly relevant in the context of an economic shock. That is because these initiatives simultaneously improve health outcomes for the poor and vulnerable, protect them from further financial distress, improve public financing and/or provide a much-needed counter-cyclical stimulus at times of economic slowdown.

Socioeconomic status and weight gain in early infancy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						socioeconomic status; birth cohort; weight gain; infancy; breast-feeding	CHILDHOOD OBESITY; BIRTH-WEIGHT; OVERWEIGHT; GROWTH; APPETITE; CHILDREN; RISK; DETERMINANTS; TRAJECTORIES; INEQUALITIES	Context: The association between low socioeconomic status (SES) and childhood obesity foreshadows lifelong inequalities in health. Insight into the causal mechanisms linking childhood adversity to long-term health could be provided by discovering when the negative SES gradient in weight emerges and what early life experiences are associated with it. Objective: SES differences in infant weight gain in the first 3 months of life were examined, and contributions of parental body mass index, maternal smoking and feeding method to this association were assessed. Design: Observational study using longitudinal weight data from 2402 families taking part in the Gemini Study; a twin birth cohort recruited from all twin births between March and December 2007 in England and Wales. Outcome measures: Infant weights at birth and 3 months converted to standard deviation scores (SDS), change in weight SDS and rapid growth. SES was indexed by occupation and maternal education. Results: There were no SES differences in birth weight, but lower SES was associated with higher 3-month weight, greater change in weight and a higher prevalence of rapid growth (all P<0.01), with graded associations across levels of SES. Including parental overweight or smoking in pregnancy in the regression model did not affect the association between SES and weight gain, but including feeding method attenuated the SES effect on weight gain by at least 62% and rendered it nonsignificant. Conclusion: The foundations for lifelong socioeconomic inequalities in obesity risk may be laid in early infancy, with infant-feeding practices having a part in the diverging weight trajectories.

J	Akazili, J; Gyapong, J; McIntyre, D				Akazili, James; Gyapong, John; McIntyre, Diane			Who pays for health care in Ghana?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article							FINANCE; EQUITY; PROGRESSIVITY; EXPENDITURE	Background: Financial protection against the cost of unforeseen ill health has become a global concern as expressed in the 2005 World Health Assembly resolution (WHA58.33), which urges its member states to "plan the transition to universal coverage of their citizens". An important element of financial risk protection is to distribute health care financing fairly in relation to ability to pay. The distribution of health care financing burden across socio-economic groups has been estimated for European countries, the USA and Asia. Until recently there was no such analysis in Africa and this paper seeks to contribute to filling this gap. It presents the first comprehensive analysis of the distribution of health care financing in relation to ability to pay in Ghana. Methods: Secondary data from the Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS) 2005/2006 were used. This was triangulated with data from the Ministry of Finance and other relevant sources, and further complemented with primary household data collected in six districts. We implored standard methodologies (including Kakwani index and test for dominance) for assessing progressivity in health care financing in this paper. Results: Ghana's health care financing system is generally progressive. The progressivity of health financing is driven largely by the overall progressivity of taxes, which account for close to 50% of health care funding. The national health insurance (NHI) levy (part of VAT) is mildly progressive and formal sector NHI payroll deductions are also progressive. However, informal sector NHI contributions were found to be regressive. Out-of-pocket payments, which account for 45% of funding, are regressive form of health payment to households. Conclusion: For Ghana to attain adequate financial risk protection and ultimately achieve universal coverage, it needs to extend pre-payment cover to all in the informal sector, possibly through funding their contributions entirely from tax, and address other issues affecting the expansion of the National Health Insurance. Furthermore, the pre-payment funding pool for health care needs to grow so budgetary allocation to the health sector can be enhanced.

J	Whitmarsh, I				Whitmarsh, Ian			American Genomics in Barbados: Race, Illness, and Pleasure in the Science of Personalized Medicine	BODY & SOCIETY			English	Article						asthma; biomedicalization; genomics; race	HEALTH	Barbados is a center of international genetic research premised on race. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork following Johns Hopkins studies carried out in Barbados, this article explores this travel for research. This biomedical science relies on a conflicting significance of Barbados: as a site of suffering, due to the disparities of disease, and, conversely, a site of ease, playing on desires and pleasures of escaping too much asceticism in biomedicine. For the American researchers, Barbados becomes a locus of desire to ethically address the African diaspora without the quandaries of accusations and recriminations experienced in carrying out such work in urban America. The concept of cathartic science is used to describe an endeavor that creates a controlled space to know and act on some perceived sufferer without risk of being complicit in the suffering. These medical migrations of researchers to Barbados are paralleled by Bajan families participating in the American studies as a kind of proxy medical migration to the US, bitterly reflecting on the care available to them at home. This article explores the motives of this mutual travel, as a biomedicalized Barbados becomes a spectral figure for patients and researchers fraught with race, injustice, and desire. The article extends the concept of cathartic science from genomics of race to medical anthropology to foreground the desires and anxieties of any science of suffering.

J	Ejaz, I; Shaikh, BT; Rizvi, N				Ejaz, Iram; Shaikh, Babar T.; Rizvi, Narjis			NGOs and government partnership for health systems strengthening: A qualitative study presenting viewpoints of government, NGOs and donors in Pakistan	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						non-governmental organizations health systems strengthening; public private partnership; developing countries; Pakistan	CARE	Background: Health systems are expected to serve the population needs in an effective, efficient and equitable manner. Therefore, the importance of strengthening of public, private and community health systems has been emphasized time and again. In most of the developing countries, certain weaknesses and gaps in the government health systems have been hampering the achievement of improved health outcomes. Public sector in Pakistan has been deficient in the capacity to deliver equitable and quality health services and thus has been grossly underutilized. Methods: A qualitative study comprising in-depth interviews was conducted capturing the perceptions of the government functionaries, NGO representatives and donor community about the role and position of NGOs in health systems strengthening in Pakistan's context. Analysis of the data was done manually to generate nodes, sub-nodes and themes. Results: Since many years, international and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have endeavored to fill the gaps in health service delivery, research and advocacy. NGOs have relatively performed better and achieved the results because of the flexible planning and the ability to design population based projects on health education, health promotion, social marketing, community development and advocacy. This paper captures the need and the opportunity of public private partnership in Pakistan and presents a framework for a meaningful engagement of the government and the private and nonprofit NGOs. Conclusion: Involving the NGOs for health system strengthening may eventually contribute to create a healthcare system reflecting an increased efficiency, more equity and good governance in the wake of the Millennium Development Goals. Nevertheless, few questions need to be answered and pre-requisites have to be fulfilled before moving on.

We identify three sources of data error which are due to data updating; formula revisions; and thresholds to classify a country's development status. We propose a simple statistical framework to calculate country specific measures of data uncertainty and investigate how data error biases rank assignments. We find that up to 34% of countries are misclassified and, by replicating prior studies, we show that key estimated parameters vary by up to 100% due to data error.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						asthma; hay fever; health services needs and demand; immunological desensitization; quality of life	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; RHINITIS; ASTHMA; PREVALENCE; IMMUNOTHERAPY; DISEASE; IMPACT; GINA	Background: Little is known about characteristics of patients receiving allergen-specific immunotherapy. Identifying obstacles to appropriate treatment according to guidelines may facilitate the development of strategies aiming at improved treatment of patients with allergic respiratory diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in disease severity, demographic and socioeconomic status between allergic rhinitis patients receiving allergen-specific immunotherapy and allergic rhinitis patients not receiving allergen-specific immunotherapy. Methods: A total of 366 patients were studied of whom 210 were going to receive subcutaneously administrated immunotherapy (SIT) against grass pollen and/or house dust mite allergy. The severity of rhino-conjunctivitis (hay fever) and/or asthma was classified according to international guidelines. The questionnaires included an EQ-5D visual analogue scale instrument and some socio-economic questions. Results: Severity of disease, young age, high level of education as well as greater perceived impairment of health-related quality of life due to allergic symptoms were significantly associated with use of SIT. Somewhat unexpectedly, household income was not associated with use of SIT. Conclusion: Use of SIT was associated with both disease severity measures and educational level, but not income level. These results suggest social inequality as reflected by lower use of SIT among patients with lower educational level may represent an obstacle to treatment with SIT.

This paper addresses what it might mean to harm future generations, whether we might harm them, and what our duties toward future generations might be. After introducing the "Global Health Impact" (GHI) concept as a unit of measurement that evaluates the effects of human actions on the health of all organisms, an incomplete theory of human justice is proposed. Having shown that the negative GHIs of our current generation cause unfair harm to future generations, I argue that each human being must be allocated a fair threshold of negative GHIs that should not be exceeded. By emphasising the need to consider all the GHIs of human actions, the theory of human justice developed here is highly relevant to evaluate human actions that might affect future generations, for example those related to climate change.

Several key issues in this longstanding debate are how much external or coercive influence women experience (or acknowledge) in their choice to pursue surgery, whether they are aware of sexist ideology more so than non-recipients, and whether their choice to pursue surgery exemplifies a strong sense of self worth. To test this agency hypothesis, we draw on survey data from a volunteer sample of 202 adult women ages 19-86 years from the southern California region in the U.S. to compare cosmetic surgery recipients to non-recipients across these key socio-cultural and personal domains. Results reveal that cosmetic surgery recipients were more likely to have friends who had undergone cosmetic surgery, endorsed more covert sexist beliefs, exhibited greater media usage, and had higher household incomes, than non-recipients. Recipients also evidenced lower ratings in global self-esteem than non-recipients. These findings challenge some of the notions attendant to agency claims, and engage with conceptions of autonomy introduced in the feminist philosophical literature.

Such a narrative emphasizes mineral technology and private property as the key elements of growth processes. I will criticize the above narrative, from a socio-environmental history perspective, for its inability to account for two crucial aspects of energy history: 1. the role of social power as key determinant in how energy sources are used and to what ends: 2. the socio-ecological costs associated with the increase of energy consumption. I will then review Environmental History studies on energy/industrialization and highlight possible future developments in the field. The article makes a strong point for the need to look at energy transitions as social processes, and to include the unequal distribution of environmental, health, and social costs of mineral energy into global history narratives.

Role of Students in Global Health Delivery	MOUNT SINAI JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							EXPERIENCE; ELECTIVES	What role do students have in global health activities? On one hand, students have much to offer, including innovative ideas, fresh knowledge and perspective, and inspiring energy. At the same time, students lack technical credentials and may drain resources from host communities. Here, we examine the dynamic, contemporary roles of students in global health activities, including health delivery. We focus on 3 themes that guide engagement: (I) fostering an enabling policy environment (eg, toward greater health equity); (2) understanding and working within the local context and governments' needs; and (3) leading bidirectional partnerships.

A supply-demand model of the birth rate explains that a rise in international trade reduces the demand for children and encourages an earlier onset of the mortality revolution. These two effects caused by the rise of international trade lead to a lower birth rate. A time-series cross-section empirical analysis for a large sample of developed and developing countries exhibits that international trade has a statistically significant and inverse effect on the birth rate. The policy implications relating to trade, economic growth, and conflict are discussed in the conclusion.

Comparative evaluation of the potential impact of rotavirus versus hpv vaccination in GAVI-eligible countries: A preliminary analysis focused on the relative disease burden	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							CERVICAL-CANCER PREVENTION; GROUP-A ROTAVIRUS; HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; MATHEMATICAL-MODELS; NATURAL-HISTORY; ECONOMIC-IMPACT; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; CHILD-MORTALITY; LATIN-AMERICA	Background: Immunization policymakers at global and local levels need to establish priorities among new vaccines competing for limited resources. However, comparison of the potential impact of single vaccination programs is challenging, primarily due to the limited number of vaccine analyses as well as their differing analytic approaches and reporting formats. The purpose of this study is to provide early insight into how the comparative impact of different new vaccines could be assessed in resource-poor settings with respect to affordability, cost-effectiveness, and distributional equity. Methods: We compared the health, economic, and financial consequences of introducing the two vaccines in 72 GAVI-eligible countries using a number of different outcome measures to evaluate affordability, cost-effectiveness, and distributional equity. We use simple static models to standardize the analytic framework and improve comparability between the two new vaccines. These simple models were validated by leveraging previously developed, more complex models for rotavirus and human papillomavirus (HPV). Results: With 70% coverage of a single-age cohort of infants and pre-adolescent girls, the lives saved with rotavirus (similar to 274,000) and HPV vaccines (similar to 286,000) are similar, although the timing of averted mortality differs; rotavirus-attributable deaths occur in close proximity to infection, while HPV-related cancer deaths occur largely after age 30. Deaths averted per 1000 vaccinated are 5.2 (rotavirus) and 12.6 (HPV). Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted were similar to 7.15 million (rotavirus) and similar to 1.30 million (HPV), reflecting the greater influence of discounting on the latter, given the lagtime between vaccination and averted cancer. In most countries (68 for rotavirus and 66 for HPV, at the cost of I$ 25 per vaccinated individual) the incremental cost per DALY averted was lower than each country's GDP per capita. Financial resources required for vaccination with rotavirus are higher than with HPV since both genders are vaccinated. Conclusions: While lifesaving benefits of rotavirus and HPV vaccines will be realized at different times, the number of lives saved over each target populations' lifetimes will be similar. Model-based analyses that use a standardized analytic approach and generate comparable outputs can enrich the priority-setting dialogue. Although new vaccines may be deemed cost-effective, other factors including affordability and distributional equity need to be considered in different settings. We caution that for priority setting in an individual country, more rigorous comparisons should be performed, using more comprehensive models and considering all relevant vaccines and delivery strategies.

J	Rudra, N				Rudra, Nita			Openness and the Politics of Potable Water	COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES			English	Article						water; natural resources; domestic politics; development; trade; income inequality; India; Vietnam; export pressures; water access; political economy of water; globalization	ECONOMIC-INTEGRATION; INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; WELFARE-STATE; TRADE; POLICY; GLOBALIZATION; LIBERALIZATION; INEQUALITY; GROWTH	Improving access to potable water has become an increasingly urgent concern for developing nations in the current era of globalization. According to standard wisdom, if developing countries undertake certain domestic reforms, such as investing in infrastructure and engineering, then safe and clean drinking water will improve. This analysis uncovers, however, that in addition to such domestic efforts, one of the greatest factors affecting water uncertainty is, in fact, internationally induced: trade. Surprisingly, both scholars and practitioners have neglected the potential impacts of expanding trade on access to potable water. This analysis is the first large-N cross-national study of water that focuses on the interplay of trade and politics-both international and domestic-as the primary driving forces behind improvements in (or constraints to) water access. The author hypothesizes that growing export pressures are constraining drinkable water in poor countries, but a particular domestic condition can mitigate this effect: the existence of lower levels of income inequality. As the socioeconomic actors disadvantaged by openness, particularly in more equal countries, seek reparations for the growing threats to potable water, the adverse affects of trade on water may be averted. Empirical evidence from 77 developing countries and case studies of Vietnam and India provide support for this hypothesis.

We analysed cross-sectional data of 1,048 persons with SCI from 14 countries based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). We used penalized logistic regression to identify ICF categories distinguishing lower- and higher-resourced countries. Hierarchical linear models were employed to predict the number of problems in functioning. The association structure of ICF categories was compared between higher- and lower-resourced countries using graphical models. A total of 96 ICF categories separated lower- and higher-resourced countries. Differences were not univocal. Lower resources and unequal distribution were predictive of more functional problems in persons with higher age or tetraplegia. In the graphical models, few associations between ICF categories persisted across countries. Higher-resourced countries do not score higher in all ICF categories. Countries' economic resources and their distribution are significant predictors of disability in vulnerable groups such as tetraplegics and the elderly. Functioning is multi-dimensional and structures of association suggest that country-specific pathways towards disability exist.	[Reinhardt, Jan D.; Fellinghauer, Bernd A.

The West vs. the rest of Scotland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article							IRISH CATHOLIC DESCENT; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; SPATIAL DEPENDENCE; MAMMOGRAPHY USE; HEALTH; HETEROGENEITY; RISK; DETERMINANTS; INEQUALITIES; ASSOCIATION	Background: A growing body of research emphasizes the importance of contextual factors on health outcomes. Using postcode sector data for Scotland (UK), this study tests the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between area-level deprivation and mortality to determine if contextual differences in the West vs. the rest of Scotland influence this relationship. Research into health inequalities frequently fails to recognise spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-health relationship, assuming that global relationships apply uniformly across geographical areas. In this study, exploratory spatial data analysis methods are used to assess local patterns in deprivation and mortality. Spatial regression models are then implemented to examine the relationship between deprivation and mortality more formally. Results: The initial exploratory spatial data analysis reveals concentrations of high standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and deprivation (hotspots) in the West of Scotland and concentrations of low values (coldspots) for both variables in the rest of the country. The main spatial regression result is that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship, this relation does not vary between regions in any of the models. This result is robust to a number of specifications, including weighting for population size, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, assuming a non-linear relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation, separating the dependent variable into male and female SMRs, and distinguishing between West, North and Southeast regions. The rejection of the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality complements prior research on the stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time. Conclusions: The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e. g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.

Cross-National Sources of Health Inequality: Education and Tobacco Use in the World Health Survey	DEMOGRAPHY			English	Article						Health inequality; SES; Tobacco use; Cross-national; Education	SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; UNITED-STATES; SMOKING; MORTALITY; GENDER; AFRICA; AGE	The spread of tobacco use from the West to other parts of the world, especially among disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, raises concerns not only about the indisputable harm to global health but also about worsening health inequality. Arguments relating to economic cost and diffusion posit that rising educational disparities in tobacco use-and associated disparities in health and premature mortality-are associated with higher national income and more advanced stages of cigarette diffusion, particularly among younger persons and males. To test these arguments, we use World Health Survey data for 99,661 men and 123,953 women from 50 low-income to upper-middle-income nations. Multilevel logistic regression models show that increases in national income and cigarette diffusion widen educational disparities in smoking among young persons and men but have weaker influences among older persons and women. The results suggest that the social and economic patterns of cigarette adoption across low- and middle-income nations foretell continuing, and perhaps widening, disparities in mortality.

Design: Literature review. Setting: Australian and international PHC settings, and hospitals. Measures: Australian and international peer-reviewed literature identified from database searches, reference lists, desktop searches, texts, and relevant website searches (e.g., government and health-related departments and agencies). Focus was literature with the keywords 'integrative' or 'integrated' in conjunction with 'medicine' or 'health care'. Articles were analysed for descriptions of continuous and integrative services involving contemporary IM practices, their background, characteristics, and implementation. Findings and discussion: Classifications of IM in the literature present various ways that IM can be implemented, and it appears that strategies have been successfully developed to facilitate integration. Although few of the barriers to the integration of CAM and conventional medicine have been resolved, concerns over the legitimacy of CAM in health care (e.g., safety, biomedical evidence, and efficacy) are being overcome by the use of evidence-based practice in IM delivery. There are two dominant models of IM that have been developed. One is the selective combination of both biomedical evidence and experience-based evidence of both CAM and conventional medicine. The other is the selective incorporation of exclusively evidence-based CAMS into conventional medicine. The two model types signify different levels of equity between CAM and conventional medicine in regard to the power, autonomy, and control held by each. However, the factors common to all IM models, whether describing CAM as supplementary (and subordinate) or complementary (and partnered) to conventional medicine, is the concept of a health care model that aspires to be client-centred and holistic, with focus on health rather than disease as well as mutual respect among peer practitioners. Conclusions: The growth and viability of IM will depend on evidence-based practices, non-hierarchal IM practices, and identifying the successful influences on the integration of CAM and conventional medicine for recognition of its inherent value in PHC.

J	Chapman, AR				Chapman, Audrey R.			Missed Opportunities: The Human Rights Gap in the Report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health	JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								In August 2008, the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) of the World Health Organization published its report, Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity Through Action on the Social Determinants of Health. The report integrates extensive data from a wide variety of sources on the significant role of the social determinants of health in shaping health outcomes and generating inequalities in health status within and among countries. This analysis is juxtaposed with a compelling justice ethic. The report addresses many of the same issues and expresses many of the same concerns as the health and human rights community and more broadly human right scholarship and advocacy on other economic and social rights. Nevertheless, the CSDH did not acknowledge this common ground. Nor did the report explicitly place access to the key social determinants of health in a human right framework. This article addresses the implications of the CSDH's unwillingness to acknowledge its shared ground with and to adopt at least some elements of the human rights paradigm for its report. It discusses areas of overlap and difference between a human rights paradigm and the social determinants and equity framework adopted by the CSDH. It argues that the failure to incorporate an explicit human rights approach weakened the line of reasoning in some sections of Closing the Gap in a Generation, reduced prospects for adoption of its recommendation and diminished the likelihood of fulfilling its mandate to foster a global movement to promote health equity.

In this article, I undertake three major tasks. First, I outline the processes that have led to that deepening, identify the underlying set of values, and indicate the connection with influences on population health. Second, I compare and contrast a policy perspective that takes seriously economic and social rights related to health with the values of the global marketplace. Third, I argue that emerging aspects of globalization underscore the urgency of the human rights challenge to the global marketplace. I also suggest a research agenda focusing on the conditions under which governments are likely to respond in ways that strengthen their commitment to economic and social rights domestically and internationally, while at the same time offering some rather pessimistic observations about the prospects for policy change.

J	Gagnon, ML; Labonté, R				Gagnon, Michelle L.; Labonte, Ronald			Human Rights in Global Health Diplomacy: A Critical Assessment	JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							GLOBALIZATION; POLICY	There is no question that health has risen higher in foreign policy, with health aid quadrupling in the past 20 years and most Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) directly (or indirectly via determinants) addressing critical health inequities. The idea that governments should consider health seriously within their foreign policy became an official UN General Assembly Resolution in early 2009. Several countries have already issued formal statements on health as a foreign policy issue while others are crafting thought pieces that are nudging health forward in foreign policy discussions. There is even a new movement combining academia and bureaucracy under the rubric of global health diplomacy; the process by which government, multilateral, and civil society actors attempt to position health higher in foreign policy arguments. But for global health diplomacy (the "how") to have traction in foreign affairs, it needs a clear articulation of the "why." In looking more closely at country statements, what is apparent is the confusing mix of interconnections between wildly differing motives and drivers for the integration of health into foreign policy, not all of which cohere with one another. What arguments exist for why health (and notably health equity, the reduction of preventable inequalities in health within and between nations) should be a prominent foreign policy concern? Within the polyphony of possible arguments, where is there reference to human rights and have invocations to human rights by governments with stated commitments to health in their foreign policy mattered in how they actually behave? This article begins to address these questions.

J	Van Tuyckom, C				Van Tuyckom, Charlotte			Macro-environmental factors associated with leisure-time physical activity: A cross-national analysis of EU countries	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Cross-national comparison; European Union; leisure-time physical activity; macro-environment; policy	PUBLIC-HEALTH; SOCIAL-STRATIFICATION; PERCEIVED ENVIRONMENT; PARTICIPATION; POLICY; SPORT; INEQUALITIES; EXERCISE; IMPACT	Background: Although there is a growing agreement among researchers that the modern environment contributes to the current trend of decreasing leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), there are very few studies addressing environmental and policy correlates of LTPA within a cross-national European context. This study describes LTPA patterns across the European Union and identifies some macro-environmental factors associated with LTPA rates at a national level. Methods: Data on LTPA and indicators of the economic, physical, and policy environment were assembled from international databases for the 27 European member states. To examine the association of each of the independent macro-environmental variables and LTPA as a continuous dependent variable, bivariate linear regression models were employed. Separate analyses were done for the overall, male, and female groups. Results: With respect to LTPA, striking differences between European member states and genders were found, with higher rates in Western and Northern European countries, and among males. Statistical significant associations were observed between overall LTPA and variables from the economic (GDP, real GDP, and public expenditures on health), food (available fat, available fruit, and vegetables), urbanisation (urban population, total and new passenger cars), and policy (all governance indicators) domains. Associations for male and female LTPA were similar, except that for males available fruit and vegetables, and for females available fat and urban population were not significant. Conclusions: This exploratory study seeks to plead for the need for cross-nationally comparable LTPA data and more sophisticated research in order to understand the role of macro-economic environments, with a special focus on policy-related variables and gender-specific differences.

This article describes three classes of psychological impacts: direct (e.g., acute or traumatic effects of extreme weather events and a changed environment); indirect (e.g., threats to emotional well-being based on observation of impacts and concern or uncertainty about future risks); and psychosocial (e.g., chronic social and community effects of heat, drought, migrations, and climate-related conflicts, and postdisaster adjustment). Responses include providing psychological interventions in the wake of acute impacts and reducing the vulnerabilities contributing to their severity; promoting emotional resiliency and empowerment in the context of indirect impacts; and acting at systems and policy levels to address broad psychosocial impacts. The challenge of climate change calls for increased ecological literacy, a widened ethical responsibility, investigations into a range of psychological and social adaptations, and an allocation of resources and training to improve psychologists' competency in addressing climate change-related impacts.

This paper outlines some of those major dilemmas and while acknowledging the difficulties inherent in resolving some of these issues, proposes areas of common ground and a series of next steps, which emphasize the importance of research and assessment as identifying marks of the professional psychologist, the requirements for accountability and standards in training, the need to develop behavioral medicine and neuropsychology as the field increases its partnership with health care, the importance of collaboration with school psychologists and international psychologists, the need to emphasize public sector service, and the imperative to develop these goals in a thoughtful way with new technology.

J	Pollock, A				Pollock, Anne			Transforming the critique of Big Pharma	BIOSOCIETIES			English	Article						pharmaceuticals; Pfizer; blockbuster drugs; heart disease; financial crisis; philanthropy	PHARMACEUTICALS; TORCETRAPIB; POLITICS; HEALTH; DRUGS	Intersecting fields of scholarship have accounted for pharmaceutical companies' extraordinary success in promoting and profiting from their wares. This article instead tracks resistances and failures in the terrain of Big Pharma amid economic, epistemological and political challenges to their business models. Pfizer has been a key player in the rise of Big Pharma, and its fortunes since 2006 provide windows into the industry's stagnation - the failure of Pfizer's would be blockbuster torcetrapib, the closing of its heart disease research unit, its free drug program for newly unemployed Americans. These illustrate transformations in 'least neglected diseases' and in pricing structures, and can be understood in the contexts of both biotech and Global South critique. Biotech companies have remained profitable by creating biologics for niche subsets of rich populations with a high willingness to pay (including lucrative treatments I call 'drugs for short lives'). At the same time, dominant global capitalists/philanthropists have brought unprecedented funding to making treatment for AIDS and TB available to the poor and tackling long-neglected diseases like malaria. Now that pharmaceutical profits and markets seem less than infinite in their expansion and philanthropy has been pharmaceuticalized, the stakes of demands like 'medicine for people not for profit' are changing. STS critique of pharmaceuticals should take these transformations into account as it deepens its systemic critique of global inequality.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF NUTRITION SERVICES WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND LONGEVITY, IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES: A RE-ANALYSIS OF 38 STUDIES	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						health care systems; health care services; nutritional services; physicians; mortality; longevity	POPULATION HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; MEDICAL-CARE; INCOME INEQUALITY; HEART-DISEASE; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; INTERVENTION; AVAILABILITY; PHYSICIANS	Background: The United Nations' Global Population Pyramid is undertaking a shift from pyramid to cube. The concomitant decline in fertility and mortality rates produces a higher portion of older people, and, thus, an increased number of deaths due to cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Limited studies have investigated the effect of health care services on longevity. In this work, findings from studies throughout the world are presented and re-analysed in order to evaluate the effect of health care services on population's health status. Methods: Studies that have assessed the associations of nutritional and other health care services (i.e., physicians supply, technical support, inter-collaboration) on longevity and health status were retrieved (searches in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, up to January 2010), and summarized here. Results: Few studies, mostly located in the US and the UK, have evaluated the role of health care services on population's health status. The majority of the studies reported a beneficial association between the frequency of physicians and mortality, while some other studies reported weak or no associations between physician's supply and longevity. Also nutritional services (screening) seem to promote better clinical outcome. Conclusion: Although very few data are available, it seems that there is a positive correlation between the quality and quantity of health care services and longevity. Strong primary health care seems to be effective on the population's health outcome. Active health policy and enhancement of health and nutritional services within the health care system may contribute to improved population's health and their overall quality of life.

This is a major public health concern for cities now and looking toward the future because the interactions of global climate change, urban heat islands, and air pollution are predicted to place increasing health burdens on cities. The proposed mitigation and adaptation strategies in cities' climate risk management plans may produce health co-benefits by reducing emissions and cooling temperatures through changes in the built environment. There are challenges, however, to implementing the plans and the most widely documented beneficial policy to date is the adoption of heat warning and air quality alert systems to trigger emergency responses.

Methods and results Data were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO www.who.int/whosis/database/mort/table.cfm), and represent national vital statistics as reported by 39 countries (European and Central Asian countries) using a standard format and population-based cardiovascular surveys. Total numbers of deaths by stroke (International Classification of Diseases 430-438, 444) and the age, sex-adjusted incidence rates were obtained and grouped according to three standard demographic categories: A, B, and C (WHO). A Bayesian linear mixed effect model was fitted to the annual mortality rates. Higher rates of stroke mortality were observed for B and C group countries as compared with those countries belonging to Group A (e. g. Bulgaria 273.9 and 281.1; Israel 37.7 and 45.4 per 100 000 men and women, respectively). Even though the mortality rates within the country groupings were relatively similar, countries with marked deviation from the average were observed, mainly in Groups B and C. Stroke mortality decreased sharply in Group A during the period of study; conversely it had increased substantially in Group B and to a lesser extent in Group C. For both sexes markedly higher rates were noted moving from west to east, with some exceptions. Conclusion We have entered a period of rapidly increasing international inequality in stroke risk, where countries with low adult mortality in the latter 20th century extended their downward trend and countries with moderate as well as high mortality have on average seen unprecedented increases in death rates from stroke.

This article argues that the right to be free from sexual violence is a fundamental component of the right to health, and the need is particularly acute in post-disaster contexts. This article uses post-earthquake Haiti as a case study to illustrate conditions for women and girls who suffer daily threats of physical, emotional, economic, and social harm in ways that have no direct parallels for their male counterparts. In addition, this article discusses the reasons that the humanitarian response in Haiti has not effectively protected women and girls and has instead exacerbated structural inequalities, making women, girls, and their families even more vulnerable to human rights violations including interference in their right to health. The article argues that the failure to guarantee the right of women to be free from sexual violence - an essential component of the right to health - is due in large part to the exclusion of displaced women from meaningful participation in formal humanitarian interventions.

J	Braithwaite, J; Travaglia, JF; Corbett, A				Braithwaite, Jeffrey; Travaglia, Joanne F.; Corbett, Angus			Can Questions of the Privatization and Corporatization, and the Autonomy and Accountability of Public Hospitals, Ever be Resolved?	HEALTH CARE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Hospitals; Health systems reform; Privatization; Corporatization; Autonomy; Accountability	QUALITY-OF-CARE; HEALTH-CARE; LATIN-AMERICA; MENTAL-HEALTH; SERVICES; REFORMS; SECTOR; MARKET; COUNTRIES; COMPETITION	Although there is a long-standing international debate concerning the privatization and corporatization of health services, there has been relatively little systematic analysis of the ways these types of reform manifest. We examine the impact of privatization and corporatization on public hospitals, and in particular on hospitals' autonomy and accountability, with two aims: to uncover the key themes in the literature, and to consider implementation issues. The review of 2,319 articles was conducted using content analysis and a discussion of selected key issues. Several major themes appear in the privatization and corporatization literature, including their use as tools in health systems reform, and the role of governments in sponsoring the processes. We show that much of the underlying argument is ideological rather than evidence based. Those who promote versions of privatization or corporatization claim that decreased government involvement in the management of hospitals leads inter alia to benefits such as greater efficiency, better quality services, and increased choice for patients. Those who argue against say that increased privatization leads to deleterious outcomes such as decreased equity, compromised efficiency and poorer quality of care. The evidence is often weak and at times conflicting. Privatization and corporatization are difficult to implement, and at best produce mixed results, and their impact seems to depend more on the motivation of the evaluator than the standard of the results. These debates are of a type that is to a large extent only resolvable ideologically.

Our aims were to provide policy-makers with a synthesis of international research evidence that assesses the effectiveness of early childhood interventions aimed at equitably promoting cognitive and social development and suggest potential areas for action in Scotland. Methods: A rapid review was conducted of review level studies of early childhood interventions with outcome measures relating to child cognitive-language or social-emotional development, subsequent academic and life achievement. Websites were searched and interviews were conducted to identify relevant interventions, policies and programmes delivered in Scotland. Results: Early childhood intervention programmes can reduce disadvantage due to social and environmental factors. Scottish health policy demonstrates a clear commitment to early childhood development but much work remains in terms of detail of policy implementation, identification of high risk children and families, and early childhood monitoring systems. Conclusions: Programmes should provide a universal seamless continuum of care and support from pregnancy through to school entry with the intensity of support graded according to need. The current information systems in Scotland would be inadequate for monitoring the effects of early childhood interventions especially in relation to cognitive-language and social-emotional development.

The essence of global health has to be promoting health equity globally. The global health agenda must embrace design of mixed health systems, involving both private and public components to address the emerging threat of noncommunicable diseases and existing communicable diseases as well as to reduce health inequity. The priority agenda for the twenty-first century is challenging but the improvements of the past give hope that the barriers to improving global health are surmountable.

In middle-income and lower-income countries, universities are becoming more engaged with the communities in which they are located to try to solve the difficult problems of poverty and poor health. Global collaborations and reform of medical education in the twenty-first century will help move universities out of cloistered academic settings and into the community to bring the changes needed to equitably meet the health needs of all.

This paper analyses the reasons for this political neglect through the lens of four areas of political power: the power of the ideas, the power of the issue, the power of the actors, and the power of the political context (using a modified Political Power Framework by Shiffman and Smith. Lancet 370 [2007] 1370). The analysis reveals that political priority for global oral health is low, resulting from a set of complex issues deeply rooted in the current global oral health sector, its stakeholders and their remit, the lack of coherence and coalescence; as well as the lack of agreement on the problem, its portrayal and possible solutions. The shortcomings and weaknesses demonstrated in the analysis range from rather basic matters, such as defining the issue in an agreed way, to complex and multi-levelled issues concerning appropriate data collection and agreement on adequate solutions. The political priority of Global Oral Health can only be improved by addressing the underlying reasons that resulted in the wide disconnection between the international health discourse and the small sector of Global Oral Health. We hope that this analysis may serve as a starting point for a long overdue, broad and candid international analysis of political, social, cultural, communication, financial and other factors related to better prioritisation of oral health. Without such an analysis and the resulting concerted action the inequities in Global Oral Health will grow and increasingly impact on health systems, development and, most importantly, human lives.

However, young welfare states in developing countries are emerging in response to different pressures than those faced by early welfare state; while globalization influences both young and established welfare states. Using newly released data for Latin America, this article provides a systematic comparison of social spending, spending on welfare and social security and government health spending in the OECD and Latin America and the Caribbean in the 1980s and 1990s. Results from cross-section time-series models indicate that the logic of industrialism welfare state approach is useful for examining social spending in Latin America. Namely, unemployment is associated with higher levels of social spending and spending on welfare and social security in both regions while a larger proportion of elderly population is associated with higher spending in Latin America. Globalization in the form of trade openness is associated with lower spending in the OECD across outcomes. In Latin America and the Caribbean the presence of international financial institutions powerfully pattern health and social spending: decreasing spending on welfare and social security and increasing health spending.

It begins by reviewing the considerable methodological problems confronting economic work on international remittances, and then examines the strengths and weaknesses of various economic studies of the impact of remittances in the developing world on such outcomes as: poverty and inequality, health and education, investment and savings, labour supply and participation, and economic growth. It finds that while international remittances generally have a positive impact on poverty and health in the developing world, remittances can have negative effects on labour supply, education and economic growth.

J	Klugman, J; Rodríguez, F; Choi, HJ				Klugman, Jeni; Rodriguez, Francisco; Choi, Hyung-Jin			The HDI 2010: new controversies, old critiques	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INEQUALITY			English	Article						Human development; Education; Health; Developing countries; Inequality; Poverty	HUMAN-DEVELOPMENT INDEX; GROWTH; AGENCY	Since its introduction in the first Human Development Report in 1990, the Human Development Index (HDI) has attracted great interest in policy and academic circles, as well as in the media and national audiences around the world. Its popularity can be attributed to the simplicity of its characterization of development - an average of achievements in health, education and income - and to its underlying message that development is much more than economic growth. The index was originally conceived by the late Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq, in collaboration with Amartya Sen and other scholars, as a response to their dissatisfaction with GDP as the standard measure of development. As Haq noted, "Any measure that values a gun several hundred times more than a bottle of milk is bound to raise serious questions about its relevance for human progress." Yet the HDI's very simplicity prompted critiques from the start, with some contending that it was too simplistic, while others who accepted its self-imposed limitations still questioned its choice of indicators and its computational methodology. This article discusses the concept and key insights learnt from the HDI, provides a detailed review of key critiques of the HDI, today and in the past, and explains the recent changes introduced to the HDI formula and indicators. Recent controversies are highlighted and placed in the context of longer running debates. The innovations to broaden the measurement of deprivations and disparities in human development are introduced, with some key global and regional insights.

The overarching goal of this issue was to significantly advance the previous sparse literature on these impacts. The result is an international, interdisciplinary, methodologically, and theoretically diverse collection of original empirical research articles that collectively address three broad questions: (1) What are the social and psychological effects of marriage amendment campaigns and policies? (2) How does civil marriage compare to other statuses for same-sex couples or marriage in other countries? (3) How do anti-gay initiatives affect heterosexual allies and intergroup relationships? Across the diverse approaches and populations that comprise this volume, findings converge in demonstrating that the denial of civil marriage rights is a significant public health issue with important policy implications.

J	Gibbs, A; Jobson, G				Gibbs, Andrew; Jobson, Geoff			Narratives of masculinity in the <i>Daily Sun</i>: implications for HIV risk and prevention	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Daily Sun; HIV; masculinity; media; narrative psychology	SOUTH-AFRICA; GENDER; HEALTH; AIDS; MEN; REPRESENTATIONS; SEXUALITY; DISCOURSE; HIV/AIDS; MAGAZINE	Dominant and hegemonic masculinities typically place women and men at risk of contracting HIV through reinforcing gender inequalities. Challenging these nnasculinities is increasingly seen as a precondition for tackling HIV&AIDS. Narratives of masculinity are the symbolic tools, which men draw upon to construct their social identities. Understanding the composition of these narratives of masculinity is central for understanding how narratives of masculinity may, or may not, shape HIV-related health behaviours. The media is a central space in which narratives of masculinity are produced and reproduced. We analyse five days' worth of the newspaper, the Daily Sun, in December 2008 to identify the different narratives of masculinity that circulate in the newspaper. Through thematic analysis we identify three different global-narratives: (i) Masculinity and work, (ii) Masculinity, violence and crime, and (iii) Masculinity and HIV. We explore each of these narratives and suggest how they may create contexts in which certain HIV-related health behaviours are more or less likely. We suggest that despite the variation in the narratives of masculinity circulating in the Daily Sun these narratives are limited and typically undermine HIV-related health behaviours by either sustaining a masculine ideal that is unachievable, emphasising a narrative of a disempowered masculinity, or by providing limited masculine narratives around HIV&AIDS. We emphasise how this undermines HIV prevention and suggest possible approaches to challenging these narratives.

Such pollution is especially harmful to poor people, so the co-benefits from global climate change policies in terms of reduced local air pollution can have positive equity impacts. Health impacts (mortality and morbidity) of PM10 pollution are quantified for different socio-economic groups in Delhi. The spatial PM10 concentration levels are overlaid with spatial socio-economic data. Improvement in air quality would result in bigger health benefits for the poor. Most measures that reduce PM10 pollutants also reduce CO2 emissions while simultaneously imposing more costs on the better-off. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, oxygen supplies are intermittent throughout the developing world. Although oxygen is well established as a treatment for hypoxemic pneumonia, quantitative evidence for its effect is lacking. This review aims to assess the utility of oxygen systems as a method for reducing childhood mortality from pneumonia. Methods: Aiming to improve priority setting methods, The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) has developed a common framework to score competing interventions into child health. That framework involves the assessment of 12 different criteria upon which interventions can be compared. This report follows the proposed framework, using a semi-systematic literature review and the results of a structured exercise gathering opinion from experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies), to assess and score each criterion as their "collective optimism" towards each, on a scale from 0 to 100%. Results: A rough estimate from an analysis of the literature suggests that global strengthening of oxygen systems could save lives of up to 122,000 children from pneumonia annually. Following 12 CHNRI criteria, the experts expressed very high levels of optimism (over 80%) for answerability, low development cost and low product cost; high levels of optimism (60-80%) for low implementation cost, likelihood of efficacy, deliverability, acceptance to end users and health workers; and moderate levels of optimism (40-60%) for impact on equity, affordability and sustainability. The median estimate of potential effectiveness of oxygen systems to reduce the overall childhood pneumonia mortality was similar to 20% (interquartile range: 10-35%, min. 0%, max. 50%). However, problems with oxygen systems in terms of affordability, sustainability and impact on equity are noted in both expert opinion scores and on review. Conclusion: Oxygen systems are likely to be an effective intervention in combating childhood mortality from pneumonia. However, a number of gaps in the evidence base exist that should be addressed to complete the investment case and research addressing these issues merit greater funding attention.

Neisseria meningitidis group A (MenA) is responsible for major epidemics in Africa. Recently W-135 has emerged as an important pathogen. Currently, the strategy for control of such outbreaks is emergency use of meningococcal (MC) polysaccharide vaccines, but these have a limited ability to induce herd immunity and elicit an adequate immune response in infant and young children. In recent times initiatives have been taken to introduce meningococcal conjugate vaccine in these African countries. Currently there are two different types of MC conjugate vaccines at late stages of development covering serogroup A and W-135: a multivalent MC conjugate vaccine against serogroup A,C,Y and W-135; and a monovalent conjugate vaccine against serogroup A. We aimed to perform a structured assessment of these emerging meningococcal vaccines as a means of reducing global meningococal disease burden among children under 5 years of age. Methods: We used a modified CHNRI methodology for setting priorities in health research investments. This was done in two stages. In the first stage we systematically reviewed the literature related to emerging MC vaccines relevant to 12 criteria of interest. In Stage II, we conducted an expert opinion exercise by inviting 20 experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies). They answered questions from CHNRI framework and their "collective optimism" towards each criterion was documented on a scale from 0 to 100%. Results: For MenA conjugate vaccine the experts showed very high level of optimism (similar to 90% or more) for 7 out of the 12 criteria. The experts felt that the likelihood of efficacy on meningitis was very high (similar to 90%). Deliverability, acceptability to health workers, end users and the effect on equity were all seen as highly likely (similar to 90%). In terms of the maximum potential impact on meningitis disease burden, the median potential effectiveness of the vaccines in reduction of overall meningitis mortality was estimated to be 20%; (interquartile range 20-40% and min. 8%, max 50 %). For the multivalent meningococcal vaccines the experts had similar optimism for most of the 12 CHNRI criteria with slightly lower optimism in answerability and low development cost criteria. The main concern was expressed over the cost of product, its affordability and cost of implementation. Conclusions: With increasing recognition of the burden of meningococcal meningitis, especially during epidemics in Africa, it is vitally important that strategies are taken to reduce the morbidity and mortality attributable to this disease. Improved MC vaccines are a promising investment that could substantially contribute to reduction of child meningitis mortality world-wide.

Despite being a vaccine-preventable disease, measles remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in young children. Although a safe and effective injectable measles vaccine has been available for over 50 years it has not been possible to achieve the uniformly high levels of coverage (required to achieve measles eradication) in most parts of the developing world. Aerosolised measles vaccines are now under development with the hope of challenging the delivery factors currently limiting the coverage of the existing vaccine. Methods: We used a modified CHNRI methodology for setting priorities in health research investments to assess the strengths and weaknesses of this emerging intervention to decrease the burden of childhood pneumonia. This was done in two stages. In Stage I, we systematically reviewed the literature related to emerging aerosol vaccines against measles relevant to several criteria of interest. Although there are a number of different aerosol vaccine approaches under development, for the purpose of this exercise, all were considered as one intervention. The criteria of interest were: answerability; cost of development, production and implementation; efficacy and effectiveness; deliverability, affordability and sustainability; maximum potential impact on disease burden reduction; acceptability to the end users and health workers; and effect on equity. In Stage II, we conducted an expert opinion exercise by inviting 20 experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies). The policy makers and industry representatives accepted our invitation on the condition of anonymity, due to the sensitive nature of their involvement in such exercises. They answered questions from the CHNRI framework and their "collective optimism" towards each criterion was documented on a scale from 0 to 100%. Results: The panel of experts expressed mixed feelings about an aerosol measles vaccine. The group expressed low levels of optimism regarding the criteria of likelihood of efficacy and low cost of development (scores around 50%); moderate levels of optimism regarding answerability, low cost of production, low cost of implementation and affordability (score around 60%); and high levels of optimism regarding deliverability, impact on equity and acceptability to health workers and end-users (scores over 80%). Finally, the experts felt that this intervention will have a modest but nevertheless important impact on reduction of burden of disease due to childhood pneumonia (median: 5%, interquartile range 1-15%, minimum 0%, maximum 45%). Conclusion: Aerosol measles vaccine is at an advanced stage of development, with evidence of good immunogenicity. This new intervention will be presented as a feasible candidate strategy in the campaign for global elimination of measles. It also presents an unique opportunity to decrease the overall burden of disease due to severe pneumonia in young children.

It is also one of the leading nosocomial pathogens in both developed and developing countries and is responsible for a wide range of life threatening infections, especially in patients who are immunocompromised, post-surgery, undergoing haemodialysis and those who are treated with catheters and ventilators. Over the past two decades, the incidence of nosocomial staphylococcal infections has increased dramatically. Currently there are at least seven vaccine and immunotherapy candidates against S. aureus in the developmental phase targeting both active and passive immunization. Methods: We used a modified CHNRI methodology for setting priorities in health research investments. This was done in two stages. In Stage I, we systematically reviewed the literature related to emerging vaccines against Staphylococcus aureus relevant to several criteria of interest: answerability; cost of development, production and implementation; efficacy and effectiveness; deliverability, affordability and sustainability; maximum potential impact on disease burden reduction; acceptability to the end users and health workers; and effect on equity. In Stage II, we conducted an expert opinion exercise by inviting 20 experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies) to participate. The policy makers and industry representatives accepted our invitation on the condition of anonymity, due to sensitive nature of their involvement in such exercises. They answered questions from CHNRI framework and their "collective optimism" towards each criterion was documented on a scale from 0 to 100%. Results: The panel of experts expressed low levels of optimism (score around or below 50%) on the criteria of answerability, efficacy, maximum disease burden reduction potential, low cost of production, low cost of implementation and affordability; moderate levels of optimism (scores around 60 to 80%) that these vaccines could be developed at a low cost, and thus on the deliverability, sustainability and impact on equity; and high levels of optimism (scores above 80%) regarding acceptable of such a product to both the end-users and health workers. While assessing the candidates for passive immunization against S. aureus, the experts were poorly optimistic regarding low production cost, low implementation cost, efficacy, deliverability, sustainability, affordability and equity; moderately optimistic regarding answerability and acceptability to health workers and end-users. They were of the opinion that these interventions would have only a modest impact (3 to 5%) on the burden of childhood pneumonia. Conclusion: In order to provide an effective vaccine against S. aureus, a number of unresolved issues in vaccine development relating to optimal antigenic target identification, criteria for acceptable efficacy, identification of target population, commercial development limitations, optimal timing of immunization strategy, storage, cold chain requirements and cost need to be addressed properly. There is still a great deal unknown about the complex interaction between S. aureus and the human host. However, given the nature of S. aureus and the lessons learned from the recent failure of two emerging vaccines, it is clear that a multi-component vaccine is essential. Combating only one virulence factor is not sufficient in the human host but finding the right combination of factors will be very challenging.

It is estimated to cause approximately 33.8 million new episodes of ALRI in children annually, 96% of these occurring in developing countries. It is also estimated to result in about 53,000 to 199,000 deaths annually in young children. Currently there are several vaccine and immunoprophylaxis candidates against RSV in the developmental phase targeting active and passive immunization. Methods: We used a modified CHNRI methodology for setting priorities in health research investments. This was done in two stages. In Stage I, we systematically reviewed the literature related to emerging vaccines against RSV relevant to 12 criteria of interest. In Stage II, we conducted an expert opinion exercise by inviting 20 experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies). The policy makers and industry representatives accepted our invitation on the condition of anonymity, due to the sensitive nature of their involvement in such exercises. They answered questions from the CHNRI framework and their "collective optimism" towards each criterion was documented on a scale from 0 to 100%. Results: In the case of candidate vaccines for active immunization of infants against RSV, the experts expressed very low levels of optimism for low product cost, affordability and low cost of development; moderate levels of optimism regarding the criteria of answerability, likelihood of efficacy, deliverability, sustainability and acceptance to end users for the interventions; and high levels of optimism regarding impact on equity and acceptance to health workers. While considering the candidate vaccines targeting pregnant women, the panel expressed low levels of optimism for low product cost, affordability, answerability and low development cost; moderate levels of optimism for likelihood of efficacy, deliverability, sustainability and impact on equity; high levels of optimism regarding acceptance to end users and health workers. The group also evaluated immunoprophylaxis against RSV using monoclonal antibodies and expressed no optimism towards low product cost; very low levels of optimism regarding deliverability, affordability, sustainability, low implementation cost and impact on equity; moderate levels of optimism against the criteria of answerability, likelihood of efficacy, acceptance to end-users and health workers; and high levels of optimism regarding low development cost. They felt that either of these vaccines would have a high impact on reducing burden of childhood ALRI due to RSV and reduce the overall childhood ALRI burden by a maximum of about 10%. Conclusion: Although monoclonal antibodies have proven to be effective in providing protection to high-risk infants, their introduction in resource poor settings might be limited by high cost associated with them. Candidate vaccines for active immunization of infants against RSV hold greatest promise. Introduction of a low cost vaccine against RSV would reduce the inequitable distribution of burden due to childhood ALRI and will most likely have a high impact on morbidity and mortality due to severe ALRI.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) or pneumococcus is estimated to cause 821,000 child deaths each year. It has over 90 serotypes, of which 7 to 13 serotypes are included in current formulations of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that are efficacious in young children. To further reduce the burden from SP pneumonia, a vaccine is required that could protect children from a greater diversity of serotypes. Two different types of vaccines against pneumococcal pneumonia are currently at varying stages of development: a multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine covering additional SP serotypes; and a conserved common pneumococcal protein antigen (PPA) vaccine offering protection for all serotypes. Methods: We used a modified CHNRI methodology for setting priorities in health research investments. This was done in two stages. In Stage I, we systematically reviewed the literature related to emerging SP vaccines relevant to several criteria of interest: answerability; efficacy and effectiveness; cost of development, production and implementation; deliverability, affordability and sustainability; maximum potential for disease burden reduction; acceptability to the end users and health workers; and effect on equity. In Stage II, we conducted an expert opinion exercise by inviting 20 experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies). The policy makers and industry representatives accepted our invitation on the condition of anonymity, due to sensitive nature of their involvement in such exercises. They answered questions from CHNRI framework and their "collective optimism" towards each criterion was documented on a scale from 0 to 100%. Results: The experts expressed very high level of optimism (over 80%) that low-cost polysaccharide conjugate SP vaccines would satisfy each of the 9 relevant CHNRI criteria. The median potential effectiveness of conjugate SP vaccines in reduction of overall childhood pneumonia mortality was predicted to be about 25% (interquartile range 20-38%, min. 15%, max 45%). For low cost, cross-protective common protein vaccines for SP the experts expressed concerns over answerability (72%) and the level of development costs (50%), while the scores for all other criteria were over 80%. The median potential effectiveness of common protein vaccines in reduction of overall childhood pneumonia mortality was predicted to be about 30% (interquartile range 26-40%, min. 20%, max 45%). Conclusions: Improved SP vaccines are a very promising investment that could substantially contribute to reduction of child mortality world-wide.

In this report, we examine the historical development and components of the Brazilian health system, focusing on the reform process during the past 40 years, including the creation of the Unified Health System. A defining characteristic of the contemporary health sector reform in Brazil is that it was driven by civil society rather than by governments, political parties, or international organisations. The advent of the Unified Health System increased access to health care for a substantial proportion of the Brazilian population, at a time when the system was becoming increasingly privatised. Much is still to be done if universal health care is to be achieved. Over the past 20 years, there have been other advances, including investments in human resources, science and technology, and primary care, and a substantial decentralisation process, widespread social participation, and growing public awareness of a right to health care. If the Brazilian health system is to overcome the challenges with which it is presently faced, strengthened political support is needed so that financing can be restructured and the roles of both the public and private sector can be redefined.

Globally, the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) declined from 400 to 260 per 100000 live births between 1990 and 2008. During the same period, MMR in sub-Saharan Africa decreased from 870 to 640. The decreased in MMR has been attributed to increase in the proportion of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel. Global improvements maternal health and health service provision indicators mask inequalities both between and within countries. In Namibia, there are significant inequities in births attended by skilled providers that favour those that are economically better off. The objective of this study was to identify the drivers of wealth-related inequalities in child delivery by skilled health providers. Methods: Namibia Demographic and Health Survey data of 2006-07 are analysed for the causes of inequities in skilled birth attendance using a decomposable health concentration index and the framework of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Results: About 80.3% of the deliveries were attended by skilled health providers. Skilled birth attendance in the richest quintile is about 70% more than that of the poorest quintile. The rate of skilled attendance among educated women is almost twice that of women with no education. Furthermore, women in urban areas access the services of trained birth attendant 30% more than those in rural areas. Use of skilled birth attendants is over 90% in Erongo, Hardap, Karas and Khomas Regions, while the lowest (about 60-70%) is seen in Kavango, Kunene and Ohangwena. The concentration curve and concentration index show statistically significant wealth-related inequalities in delivery by skilled providers that are to the advantage of women from economically better off households (C = 0.0979; P < 0.001). Delivery by skilled health provider by various maternal and household characteristics was 21 percentage points higher in urban than rural areas; 39 percentage points higher among those in richest wealth quintile than the poorest; 47 percentage points higher among mothers with higher level of education than those with no education; 5 percentage points higher among female headed households than those headed by men; 20 percentage points higher among people with health insurance cover than those without; and 31 percentage points higher in Karas region than Kavango region. Conclusion: Inequalities in wealth and education of the mother are seen to be the main drivers of inequities in the percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel. This clearly implies that addressing inequalities in access to child delivery services should not be confined to the health system and that a concerted multi-sectoral action is needed in line with the principles of the Primary health Care.

Our aim was to identify potential socioeconomic determinants of pandemic mortality and explain between-country variation. Methodology: Based on data from a total of 30 European countries, we applied random-effects Poisson regression models to study the relationship between pandemic mortality rates (May 2009 to May 2010) and a set of representative environmental, health care-associated, economic and demographic country-level parameters. The study was completed by June 2010. Principal Findings: Most regression approaches indicated a consistent, statistically significant inverse association between pandemic influenza-related mortality and per capita government expenditure on health. The findings were similar in univariable [coefficient: -0.00028, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -0.00046, -0.00010, p = 0.002] and multivariable analyses (including all covariates, coefficient: -0.00107, 95% CI: -0.00196, -0.00018, p = 0.018). The estimate was barely insignificant when the multivariable model included only significant covariates from the univariate step (coefficient: -0.00046, 95% CI: -0.00095, 0.00003, p = 0.063). Conclusions: Our findings imply a significant inverse association between public spending on health and pandemic influenza mortality. In an attempt to interpret the estimated coefficient (-0.00028) for the per capita government expenditure on health, we observed that a rise of 100 international dollars was associated with a reduction in the pandemic influenza mortality rate by approximately 2.8%. However, further work needs to be done to unravel the mechanisms by which reduced government spending on health may have affected the 2009 pandemic influenza mortality.

Washington	JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES			English	Article						energy; environmental justice; petrochemicals; political-economy		This article suggests the need for a new "green" and "Earth-based" reassessment of the work of Booker Taliafaro Washington. Although it includes global and national perspectives, the African American community of South Central Los Angeles will provide the primary perspective. A general societal overreliance on petroleum-based chemicals has worked to the long-term environmental detriment of the African American community there. This article draws upon the works of four key environmental activists: Benjamin Chavis Muhammad, Robert Bullard, Van Jones, and Majora Carter. Working across a range of academic disciplines, the authors integrate contemporary "diagnostic" concepts of community health and environmental justice with older "prescriptive" concepts of employment in the primary trades and community self-reliance. The authors suggest that these old "Bookerite" concepts merit reconsideration, reframing, and re-messaging. The life's work of Washington has therefore been recast here, in light of its newfound green relevance for the African American community, today.

Post-apartheid policymakers have sought to address prior inequalities in education, health care and employment, concerns central to biodiversity conservation initiatives. This article examines the role of school gardening programs on the distribution and transmission of local phytomedicinal knowledge. Urban Cape Town, an area of high biocultural diversity, presents a unique environment in which to observe cultural distinctions in medicinal plant utilization, the impact of school gardening, and the recent cultural amalgamation in local knowledge transmission. Local healers chose 16 common medicinal plants, which were used to examine fifth and seventh graders' knowledge of local remedies. Results indicate that knowledge of different plants was concentrated in specific ethnic groups and amongst recent migrants. It is proposed that ethnic separation during the apartheid era insulated cultures on socioeconomic and geo-environmental strata, thereby preserving local knowledge.	[Philander, Lisa E.

Private actors and governments in Southeast Asia are promoting the medical tourist industry, but the potential impact on health systems, particularly in terms of equity in access and availability for local consumers, is unclear. This article presents a conceptual framework that outlines the policy implications of medical tourism's growth for health systems, drawing on the cases of Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia, three regional hubs for medical tourism, via an extensive review of academic and grey literature. Variables for further analysis of the potential impact of medical tourism on health systems are also identified. The framework can provide a basis for empirical, in country studies weighing the benefits and disadvantages of medical tourism for health systems. The policy implications described are of particular relevance for policymakers and industry practitioners in other Southeast Asian countries with similar health systems where governments have expressed interest in facilitating the growth of the medical tourist industry. This article calls for a universal definition of medical tourism and medical tourists to be enunciated, as well as concerted data collection efforts, to be undertaken prior to any meaningful empirical analysis of medical tourism's impact on health systems.

We develop a cross-country measurement model for health, in which functional limitations, self-reports of health, and a physical measure are interrelated to construct health indices. To establish comparability across countries, we define the measurement scales by the physical measure while other parameters vary by country to reflect cultural and linguistic differences in response patterns. We find significant cross-country variation in response styles of health reports along with variability in genuine health that is related to differences in national income. Our health indices achieve satisfactory reliability of about 80% and their gradients by age, income, and wealth for the most part show the expected patterns. Moreover, the health indices correlate much more strongly with income and net worth than self-reported health measures. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Bowser, DM; Mahal, A				Bowser, Diana M.; Mahal, Ajay			Guatemala: The economic burden of illness and health system implications	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Health expenditures; Poverty; Health systems; Guatemala	CARE FINANCE; EQUITY	Objectives: To assess the economic burden of ill health in Guatemala, the characteristics of Guatemala's health system that potentially explain this burden, and to identify policies to help ameliorate it. Methods: Data from the 2000 and 2006 Living Standard Measurement Surveys are used to assess levels of financial burden from ill health, along with information on health system characteristics of Guatemala and recent reform experiences of several middle- and low-income countries. Results: Despite some gains over the period from 2000 to 2006, there continues to be both a high level and inequitable distribution of financial burden associated with ill health in Guatemala. Low levels of insurance coverage, a heavy concentration of the uninsured among the less well off and rural populations, as well as their low levels of access to public services are important drivers of out of pocket spending on health. Households with older members also appear to be at increased risk for out of pocket payments. Conclusions: High levels of catastrophic health spending and poverty co-exist with significant economic inequality and poverty in Guatemala. With health system features and a large informal sector similar to many other developing countries, recent international experience can provide useful lessons to help Guatemala devise innovative financing and payment mechanisms to address these concerns.

By using a more updated and larger international homicide data set, the current multiple regression analysis did not support Neapolitan's argument. Instead, structural factors such as high level of poverty, income inequality, illiteracy, and alcohol consumption level, were shown to be more important predictors for the high homicide rates in Latin America. Thus, the research result weakened Neapolitan's suggestion (1994) that there are unique components, like regional culture of violence, in Latin American for its high homicide rate. Thus, the current research overcame a biased cultural view by Neapolitan's study (1994). Finally, the current paper discusses the weaknesses of Neapolitan's subcultural perspective.

J	Whittaker, A				Whittaker, Andrea			Cross-border assisted reproduction care in Asia: implications for access, equity and regulations	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						cross-border reproductive care; reproductive tourism; assisted reproductive technologies; commercialisation; Asia region	HEALTH; TRADE; TECHNOLOGIES; TOURISM; LEGAL; CONCEPTION	This paper gives an overview of the global commercialised market in assisted reproduction treatment in low-resource countries in Asia and raises concerns about access and equity, the potential commercial exploitation of the bodies of subaltern women to service the demand for donated ova and surrogate pregnancy, and the need for protections through regulations. A lack of systematic data about cross-border reproductive care is a significant obstacle to debate and policy intervention. Little is known about the extent, experience or conditions of cross-border reproductive care outside of Europe and the United States. Further research is needed in Asia on the local effects of this trade upon local health systems, couples seeking care, and those women whose body tissues and nurturing capacities facilitate it. More attention needs to be paid to the provision of publicly funded reproductive health services to address the inequitable distribution of treatment and to investigate means to regulate this trade by governments, international NGOs, professional organisations and civil society groups in developing countries. The global trade in assisted reproduction challenges us to balance the rights of individuals to pursue health care across national borders with the rights of those providing services to meet their needs, especially vulnerable groups in situations of economic disparity.

Communities that were randomly assigned to the treatment group began receiving the BDH in 2004 and those randomly assigned to the comparison group began receiving benefits two years later. Families enrolled in the BDH received a monthly cash stipend ($15USD) representing an approximate 6-10% increase in household income. Participants analyzed in this study are children aged 12-35 months from treatment (n = 797) and comparison (n = 399) communities in rural and urban Ecuador. Main outcomes measured were language skills (the Fundacion MacArthur Inventorio del Desarollo de Habilidades Comunicativas - Breve), height-for-age z-score, and hemoglobin concentration. Results indicate that in rural areas, being randomized to receive the BDH in very early childhood led to significantly better performance on the number of words a child was saying, and on the probability that the child was combining two or more words. There were no significant effects on language development for children in urban areas and there were no effects on height-for-age z-score or hemoglobin concentration in rural or urban areas. A limited number of potential pathways with respect to cognitive/language stimulation, health behaviors, and parenting quality were also explored. Findings indicate that compared to children in comparison areas, rural children in treatment areas were more likely to have received vitamin A or iron supplementation and have been bought a toy in the past six months. This study provides evidence for significant benefits of an unconditional cash transfer program for language development in very young children in rural areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the conviction of Binayak Sen: Neocolonialism, political violence and the political economy of health in the central Indian tribal belt	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						India; Binayak Sen; Public health; Indigenous peoples; Insurgency; Naxalites; Political economy	INDIGENOUS HEALTH	The health of adivasis' (Scheduled Tribes or indigenous peoples) is far worse than the general Indian population. Binayak Sen, a renowned Indian public health practitioner, has worked with adivasis in central India for over thirty years. On Christmas Eve 2010 Sen was convicted of involvement with Maoist insurgents and sentenced to life in prison. Sen's conviction has been condemned by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, and medical journals such as The Lancet and the British Medical Journal are campaigning for his release. This short report addresses the apparently vexing question of how such a miscarriage of justice could happen to a well-reputed physician in a country that is widely referred to as 'the world's largest democracy'. Both Sen's conviction and the health crisis among adivasis in central India are symptoms of what Paul Farmer (2005) refers to as 'deeper pathologies of power': specifically, the neocolonial political economy in which the state is very active in dispossessing adivasis but inactive in providing benevolent functions. Thus, the case demonstrates the manner in which public health is intimately related to social, economic and political processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the basis of a critical analysis of literature on international medical electives and experiences (IMEs), the article explores trends in IMEs and exposes several prominent issues, including paradoxes in underlying motivations, missing or ad hoc curricula and pedagogical approaches in IMEs, and ethical challenges that frequently arise. By engaging perspectives from critical educational theory, the authors suggest that IMEs as currently conceived are potentially ripe sites for the reproduction of colonialist ideas of North-South relationships. The authors conclude that IMEs will do little to address historically and politically rooted global health inequities unless critical consciousness is raised through improved global health curricula and appropriate pedagogical strategies.

Cambodia's national deworming program currently targets SAC through bi-annual school-based distributions of a single dose of mebendazole. A 30-cluster household survey was conducted in the rural province Kampot, to validate mebendazole treatment coverage in SAC and to assess the level of improved water supply and sanitation. Bi-annual primary school-based distributions proved to be an effective strategy in reaching school attending SAC, with treatment coverage rates between 84.1% and 88.8%. However, significantly lower rates (23.3-48.8%) were seen among SAC not enrolled in primary schools. Often members of the most marginalized families of the community, they are particularly at risk of STH infection. Methods to reach these children need to be explored to avoid treatment inequities.

Such a shift is required to sufficiently modify and credibly reduce the present dominance of perverse market forces on global health. New scientific discoveries can make wide-ranging contributions to improved health; however, improved global health depends on achieving greater social justice, economic redistribution, and enhanced democratization of production, caring social institutions for essential health care, education, and other public goods. As with the quest for an HIV vaccine, the challenge of improved global health requires an ambitious multidisciplinary research program.

J	Azetsop, J				Azetsop, Jacquineau			NEW DIRECTIONS IN AFRICAN BIOETHICS: WAYS OF INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS IN THE BIOETHICS AGENDA	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						Africa; bioethics; health care; justice; traditional knowledge; health priorities	EQUITY	Research ethics is the most developed aspect of bioethics in Africa. Most African countries have set up Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) to provide guidelines for research and to comply with international norms. However, bioethics has not been responsive to local needs and values in the rest of the continent. A new direction is needed in African bioethics. This new direction promotes the development of a locally-grounded bioethics, shaped by a dynamic understanding of local cultures and informed by structural and institutional problems that impact the public's health, as well as cognisant of the salient contribution of social sciences and social epidemiology which can bring a lasting impact on African local communities. In today's post-Structural Adjustment Africa, where healthcare has been liberalized and its cost increased, a bioethics agenda that focuses essentially on disease management and clinical work remains blind in the face of a structural marginalization of the masses of poor. Instead, the multidimensional public health crisis, with which most African countries are confronted, calls for a bioethics agenda that focuses primarily, but not exclusively, on health promotion and advocacy. Such an approach to bioethics reckons with the macro-determinants of health and well-being and places clinical and research ethics in the broader context of population's health. The same approach underscores the need to become political, not only by addressing health policymaking processes and procedures, but also by becoming an advocacy forum that includes other constituencies equipped with the potentialities to impact the population's health.

J	Kaelin, L				Kaelin, Lukas			A QUESTION OF JUSTICE: ASSESSING NURSE MIGRATION FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						bioethics; justice; nurse migration; philosophy		The intensified nurse migration leads to severe problems for the health care systems in many developing countries. Using the Philippines as an example, this paper will address the question of global nurse migration from a philosophical perspective. John Rawls' liberal and Michael Walzer's communitarian theory of justice will be examined in view of the ethical problem of nurse migration. In line with Rawls' A Theory of Justice, nurse migration undermines the ability of the people in developing countries to make use of their basic rights and liberties. Walzer's communitarian assessment of nurse migration, on the other hand, will stress the shared 'thin' morality, as well as the shared history between the 'donating' and receiving countries. This paper argues that the commonality of a shared history and common values implies the moral obligation to ensure a fairer distribution of nurses.

The paper does not focus on the case study findings or content, but rather on the researcher-policy actor partnership that developed in the process of producing the case study and its report. The paper is set against the broader literature on researcher-policy collaboration and is written to share lessons that may help others quickly establish or improve researcher-policy partnerships. It sets out six key elements for success in a framework for partnership that can meet policy rather than academic timeframes and which can effectively co-produce knowledge that meets both research and policy objectives.

The increasing global crisis in NCDs is a barrier to development goals including poverty reduction, health equity, economic stability, and human security. The Lancet NCD Action Group and the NCD Alliance propose five overarching priority actions for the response to the crisis leadership, prevention, treatment, international cooperation, and monitoring and accountability and the delivery of five priority interventions tobacco control, salt reduction, improved diets and physical activity, reduction in hazardous alcohol intake, and essential drugs and technologies. The priority interventions were chosen for their health effects, cost-effectiveness, low costs of implementation, and political and financial feasibility. The most urgent and immediate priority is tobacco control. We propose as a goal for 2040, a world essentially free from tobacco where less than 5% of people use tobacco. Implementation of the priority interventions, at an estimated global commitment of about US$9 billion per year, will bring enormous benefits to social and economic development and to the health sector. If widely adopted, these interventions will achieve the global goal of reducing NCD death rates by 2% per year, averting tens of millions of premature deaths in this decade.

EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER			English	Article						achievement; comparative education; social stratification	SOCIAL-CLASS; MATHEMATICS ACHIEVEMENT; INCOME INEQUALITY; UNITED-STATES; SCHOOL; COUNTRY; HEALTH; FAMILY	Explanations for U.S. students' performance on international comparisons of educational achievement abound, with much of the scholarly and public discussion centering on cross-national differences in education systems. The author argues that the connection between economic inequality and educational achievement in affluent societies deserves far more attention than it receives. Analyses of data from the 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment and other sources indicate that egalitarian countries have higher average achievement, higher percentages of very highly skilled students, and lower percentages of very low-skilled students than do less egalitarian countries. These patterns suggest that egalitarianism and educational excellence are compatible goals for affluent societies. The author discusses the implications of these findings for educational and economic policy in the United States.

Methods: Case examples were chosen to illustrate several aspects of context: its historical, global, and dynamic nature; its multidimensional character; and its macro- and micro-level influences. These criteria were selected based on findings from an extensive literature review undertaken for the Public Health Agency of Canada and from two invitational symposia on multiple intervention programmes, one with a focus on equity, the other with a focus on context. Findings: Contextual influences are pervasive yet specific, and diffuse yet structurally embedded. Historical contexts that have produced inequities have contemporary influences. The global forces of context cross jurisdictional boundaries. A complex set of social actors intersect with socio-political structures to dynamically co-create contextual influences. Conclusions: These contextual influences raise critical challenges for the field of population health intervention research. These challenges must be addressed if we are going to succeed in the calls for action to reduce health inequities. Implications for future public health research and research-funding agencies must be carefully considered.

The aim of the current study was to identify ethical concerns regarding food. University students (N = 403) from Finland, Denmark and Italy completed a word association task, in which the given stimulus words were "ethical food" and "unethical food". The data was first analysed qualitatively. Next, the most relevant, core categories were identified based on the frequency, rank and contextual stability. The results indicated that fourteen categories reflect the content and nature of ethical thinking with respect to food. The identified categories were required/prohibited food, natural/unnatural, local/global, healthy/unhealthy, equality/inequality, good animal welfare/poor animal welfare, rules and descriptions. In all countries, the core categories emerging from the stimulus word "ethical food" were the required food and the natural, while the core category identified from the stimulus word "unethical food" was the prohibited food. The most prevalent differences between the countries concerned the role of health, country of origin and the descriptions. In conclusion, various ethical aspects are considered when food is evaluated in ethical terms, but the relevance of these aspects differ, even in the European context. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In Ohio, bed bugs have become a virtual epidemic in many towns and cities, especially in central and southwestern regions of the state. These blood-feeding insects cause an array of adverse health effects in humans. Furthermore, bed bugs disproportionately occur in urban areas, and housing and the built environment are now recognized as dominant influences on health. Bed bugs' potential role in disease transmission remains unqualified to date, and research on this issue is urgently needed. The escalating global bed bug resurgence leaves the divided public health community in a precarious social justice position if the lack of response to bed bug infestations disproportionately impacts underserved populations. Bed bugs are an urgent public health and environmental justice concern, and the authors recommend that public health agencies respond with authority of agency.

J	North, S				North, Scott			Deadly virtues: Inner-worldly asceticism and <i>karoshi</i> in Japan	CURRENT SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						globalization; karoshi (death caused by being overworked); Japan; service overtime; work ethic; working life		This article explores the relationship between Japanese workers' persistent inner-worldly asceticism and today's globalizing economy. The interplay of values and corporate cultural practices, global market forces and individual health outcomes is illustrated in the case of an Osaka stockbroker killed by overwork (karoshi) during the 1990 Gulf War and resultant collapse of Japan's 'bubble economy'. The analysis centres on corporate documents and events which publicly valorized the broker as the embodiment of the ideal employee. The tradition of discipline, dedication and deference that he came to symbolize interacted with inequalities in the global division of labour to produce tragic consequences for him and his family. Viewed through historical, micro and macro lenses, the negative potential of such ascetic work ethics comes into focus. But the analysis also shows how such cases become catalysts for social movements that emphasize the value of care.

Qualitative interviews were conducted with 220 young people (15-17 years), and 78 service providers in a rural area of Ireland, in order to yield contextualized narratives of their experiences of drug use and achieve a wider exploration of processes, drug transitions and realities of rural youth. The thematic analysis of the research described varied pathways, attitudes and typologies of rural youth drug use, ranging from abstinent, recreational and moderated to maturing out. The research suggests support for a 'differentiated' normalization theory (Shildrick, T. (2002). Young people, illicit drug use and the question of normalisation theory. Journal of Youth Studies, 5, 35-48) in terms of consumerist and normative rural youth drug use transitions in their negotiation of risk within integrating rural and urban dichotomies. In conclusion, it is recommended that drug education programmes need to situate localized rural drug taking behaviours within a wider understanding of rural community life.

Methods and Materials All patients (n = 432) diagnosed with occupational pneumoconiosis during 1986-2006 were recruited from the registry of the National Research Center of Occupational Diseases, which was linked to the National Mortality Registry of Mongolia to obtain the survival function. We simulated age and gender matched referents group based on the life table in 2000. The survival ratio between patients and referents was used to extrapolate and calculate the LE. The average expected years of life loss (EYLL) of pneumoconiosis were calculated as the mean survival difference between patients and referents. We adopted utility values for workers with pneumoconiosis and multiplied them with the survival function to estimate the QALE, which was then used to calculate the loss of QALE. Results The life expectancy and EYLL of a patient with pneumoconiosis were 18.1 and 9.5 years respectively. QALE and loss of QALE were 15.1 and 12.5 QALYs (quality-adjusted life years), respectively, indicating a health gap of 45%. Conclusion The health inequality suffered by miners in Mongolia must be addressed through prevention, including exposure monitoring and control, early diagnosis and case management and rehabilitation of pneumoconiosis.

Group therapy for adolescents with repeated self harm: randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation	BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							DELIBERATELY POISONED THEMSELVES; SUICIDE ATTEMPTS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; RISK-FACTORS; YOUNG-PEOPLE; SERVICE USE; CHILDREN; INTERVENTION; BEHAVIOR; HEALTH	Objective To examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group therapy for self harm in young people. Design Two arm, single (assessor) blinded parallel randomised allocation trial of a group therapy intervention in addition to routine care, compared with routine care alone. Randomisation was by minimisation controlling for baseline frequency of self harm, presence of conduct disorder, depressive disorder, and severity of psychosocial stress. Participants Adolescents aged 12-17 years with at least two past episodes of self harm within the previous 12 months. Exclusion criteria were: not speaking English, low weight anorexia nervosa, acute psychosis, substantial learning difficulties (defined by need for specialist school), current containment in secure care. Setting Eight child and adolescent mental health services in the northwest UK. Interventions Manual based developmental group therapy programme specifically designed for adolescents who harm themselves, with an acute phase over six weekly sessions followed by a booster phase of weekly groups as long as needed. Details of routine care were gathered from participating centres. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was frequency of subsequent repeated episodes of self harm. Secondary outcomes were severity of subsequent self harm, mood disorder, suicidal ideation, and global functioning. Total costs of health, social care, education, and criminal justice sector services, plus family related costs and productivity losses, were recorded. Results 183 adolescents were allocated to each arm (total n=366). Loss to follow-up was low (<4%). On all outcomes the trial cohort as a whole showed significant improvement from baseline to follow-up. On the primary outcome of frequency of self harm, proportional odds ratio of group therapy versus routine care adjusting for relevant baseline variables was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.44, P=0.95) at 6 months and 0.88 (0.59 to 1.33, P=0.52) at 1 year. For severity of subsequent self harm the equivalent odds ratios were 0.81 (0.54 to 1.20, P=0.29) at 6 months and 0.94 (0.63 to 1.40, P=0.75) at 1 year. Total 1 year costs were higher in the group therapy arm (21 pound 781) than for routine care (15 pound 372) but the difference was not significant (95% CI -1416 to 10782, P=0.132). Conclusions The addition of this targeted group therapy programme did not improve self harm outcomes for adolescents who repeatedly self harmed, nor was there evidence of cost effectiveness. The outcomes to end point for the cohort as a whole were better than current clinical expectations.	[Green, J. M.; Kerfoot, M.

Breast cancer management in middle-resource countries (MRCs): Consensus statement from the Breast Health Global Initiative	BREAST			English	Article						Breast cancer; Middle resource countries; Early detection; Treatment; Multidisciplinary services; Health care financing	GUIDELINE IMPLEMENTATION; INCOME COUNTRIES; QUALITY-ASSURANCE; CARE; AMERICAN; PATHOLOGY; TRIAL; SOCIETY; DELAY	In middle resource countries (MRCs), cancer control programs are becoming a priority as the pattern of disease shifts from infectious diseases to non-communicable diseases such as breast cancer, the most common cancer among women in MRCs. The Middle Resource Scenarios Working Group of the BHGI 2010 Global Summit met to identify common issues and obstacles to breast cancer detection, diagnosis and treatment in MRCs. They concluded that breast cancer early detection programs continue to be important, should include clinical breast examination (CBE) with or without mammography, and should be coupled with active awareness programs. Mammographic screening is usually opportunistic and early detection programs are often hampered by logistical and financial problems, as well as socio-cultural barriers, despite improved public educational efforts. Although multidisciplinary services for treatment are available, geographical and economic limitations to these services can lead to an inequity in health care access. Without adequate health insurance coverage, limited personal finances can be a significant barrier to care for many patients. Despite the improved availability of services (surgery, pathology, radiology and radiotherapy), quality assurance programs remain a challenge. Better access to anticancer drugs is needed to improve outcomes, as are rehabilitation programs for survivors. Focused and sustained government health care financing in MRCs is needed to improve early detection and treatment of breast cancer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design: Analysis of baseline data collected in two cross-sectional cohort studies between 2000 and 2005: the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe (HAPIEE) study and the Finnish Helsinki Health Study (HHS). Setting: Urban populations in the Czech Republic, Russia, Poland and Finland. Subjects: In the HAPIEE study, random samples of men and women aged 45-69 years were drawn from population registers and electoral lists of selected cities. In the HHS, men and women aged 40-60 years employed by the City of Helsinki were recruited. Data on 21 326 working subjects from both cohorts were analysed. Results: Healthy food habits were, in general, positively associated with higher education, occupational position and fewer economic difficulties, but there were differences in the strength of the gradient by food and country. Fruit consumption showed the most consistent gradients, especially in relation to socio-economic status among men (country-specific relative index of inequality (RII) =2.02-5.17) and women (RII=2.09-3.57). Conclusions: The associations between socio-economic indicators and healthy food habits showed heterogeneity between countries. Future studies of dietary behaviours should consider multiple measures of socio-economic position.

A cross-sectional comparative survey of 6,502 British and German holidaymakers aged 16 to 35 years was undertaken in airports in Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Results. Overall, 3.8% of participants reported having been in a physical fight (violence) on holiday and 5.9% reported unintentional injury. Two thirds reported having been drunk on holiday and over 10% using illicit drugs. Levels of drunkenness, drug use, violence, and unintentional injury all varied with nationality and holiday destination. Violence was independently associated with being male, choosing the destination for its nightlife, staying 8 to 14 days, smoking and using drugs on holiday, frequent drunkenness, and visiting Majorca (both nationalities) or Crete (British only). Predictors of unintentional injury were being male, younger, using drugs other than just cannabis on holiday, frequent drunkenness, and visiting Crete (both nationalities). Conclusions. Violence and unintentional injury are substantial risks for patrons of international resorts offering a hedonistic nightlife. Understanding those characteristics of resorts and their visitors most closely associated with such risks should help inform prevention initiatives that protect both the health of tourists and the economy of resorts marketed as safe and enjoyable places to visit.

Analyses are based on the European Social Survey Round 3 (N = 34,443). Education was coded according to the International Standard Classification of Education. Depressive symptoms are measured by the shortened Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 8). The results of multiple logistic regressions show that people with low education have elevated risks of experiencing a high score of depressive symptoms. Relatively large inequalities were observed among both sexes for Hungary and Slovenia, small and non-significant inequalities for Austria, Denmark, and Estonia. The results indicate that educational inequalities in depressive symptoms are a generalized although not invariant phenomenon.

Aid alignment for global health research: the role of HIROs	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article								The lack of a mechanism that aligns financial flows for global health research towards public health priorities limits the impact of health research on health and health equity. Collaborative groups of health research funders appear to be particularly well situated to ameliorate this situation and to initiate discussion on aid alignment for global health research. One such group is the Heads of International Research Organizations (HIROs), which brings together a large number of major government and philanthropic funders of biomedical research. Surprisingly, there is hardly any information publicly available on HIROs' objectives, or on how it aims to achieve more harmonization in the field of research for health. Greater transparency on HIROs' objectives and on its current efforts towards addressing the gap between global health research needs and investments would be desirable, given the enormous potential benefits of more coordination by this group.

J	Donchin, A				Donchin, Anne			IN WHOSE INTEREST? POLICY AND POLITICS IN ASSISTED REPRODUCTION	BIOETHICS			English	Article						assisted reproduction; reproductive regulation; reproductive policy; infertility; reproductive justice		This paper interprets the British legislative process that initiated the first comprehensive national regulation of embryo research and fertility services and examines subsequent efforts to restrain the assisted reproduction industry. After describing and evaluating British regulatory measures, I consider successive failures to control the assisted reproduction industry in the US. I discuss disparities between UK and US regulatory initiatives and their bearing on regulation in other countries. Then I turn to the political and social structures in which the assisted reproduction industry is embedded. I argue that regulatory bodies are seldom neutral arbiters. They tend to respond most readily to special interests and neglect strategies that could more effectively meet the health needs of the people they represent. Neither national nor international bodies have aggressively pursued policies to harness the industry, reduce infertility rates, or meet the needs of people whose fertility is threatened by substandard healthcare and environmental neglect. In conclusion, I consider recent initiatives by activist groups to mount an alternative response to the industry's current practices and build a transnational reproductive justice movement.

J	Rehm, J; Zatonksi, W; Taylor, B; Anderson, P				Rehm, Juergen; Zatonksi, Witold; Taylor, Ben; Anderson, Peter			Epidemiology and alcohol policy in Europe	ADDICTION			English	Article						Age; alcohol; attributable risk; inequalities; injuries; mortality	GLOBAL BURDEN; HEALTH CONSEQUENCES; UNDERAGE DRINKING; HEART-DISEASE; CONSUMPTION; MORTALITY; RISK; INJURY; CARCINOGENICITY; INTERVENTIONS	Aims To describe three aspects of the epidemiology of alcohol-attributable deaths in Europe, dose, demography and place, and to illustrate how such knowledge can better be used to inform alcohol policy formulation and implementation. Design epidemiological and population health modeling. Setting Europe. Participants Based on country-specific aggregate statistics. Measurements Exposure: country-specific adult per capita consumption triangulated with survey data; outcomes: mortality statistics. Findings The absolute risk of dying from an alcohol-attributable disease and injury (accounting for a protective effect for ischaemic diseases) increases with increasing daily alcohol consumption beyond 10g alcohol per day, the first data point. Over 2/3 of all alcohol-attributable deaths occurring amongst the 20-64 year old population of the European Union (minus Cyprus and Malta) occur in the 45-64 year olds. About 25% of the difference in life expectancy between western and eastern Europe for men aged 20-64 years in 2002 can be attributed to alcohol, largely, but not exclusively, as a result of differences in heavy episodic drinking patterns. Conclusions Any reduction in the dose of alcohol consumed, at least down to 10g/day, will reduce the annual and lifetime risk of an alcohol-related death. There is a need for alcohol policy to focus on measures in reducing alcohol consumption, throughout middle age, with immediacy of impact. Policy should strive to reduce alcohol-related health inequalities, with the specific recommendations for policy depending on the cost-effectiveness of interventions related to the epidemiological profile of the country or region under consideration. Fortunately, there are evidence-based policy options that reduce the amount of alcohol consumed and many alcohol-related harms with immediate effect, that reduce the risk of an alcohol-related death in middle age, and that would help to close the health gap between eastern and western Europe.

Life expectancy at birth differs between countries by as much as 27 years. This article suggests that asymmetric economic growth, unplanned urbanization, marked environmental change, unequal improvements in daily living conditions, and the unequal distribution and access to quality health care have contributed to health inequities in the Asia Pacific region. Contextually specific evidence and action are needed. This requires ongoing monitoring of health inequities and systematic evaluation of societal changes and their impact on health inequities. It requires better understanding of how to translate theoretical and empirical demonstrations of the social and environmental impact on health inequities into evidence-informed policies and programs, in diverse geopolitical, socioeconomic, and sociocultural contexts across the Asia Pacific region and the range of associated complex policy processes. A spotlight is needed on health inequities and their causes else the status quo will persist.

The Development and Validation of the Guidelines for Stalking Assessment and Management	BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES & THE LAW			English	Article							VIOLENCE RISK; PREVALENCE; PSYCHOPATHY; COMMUNITY; STALKERS; IMPACT	International research has established that stalking is a prevalent problem with serious and often life-threatening consequences for victims. Stalking is also a unique form of violence due to its nature and diversity, making it difficult for criminal justice and health professionals to establish which perpetrators and victims have the greatest need for services and protection. Risk assessment is one way to address these problems but few tools exist. This article describes the development of the Guidelines for Stalking Assessment and Management (SAM), the first risk assessment instrument designed specifically for the stalking situation. Preliminary data are presented, indicating that the SAM has promise for use by professionals working with stalkers and their victims. Results indicated that interrater reliabilities for the SAM risk factors and total scores range from fair to good, and the structural reliability of the SAM is sound. Moreover, the SAM showed good concurrent validity when compared with two other measures of violence propensity: the Psychopathy Checklist Screening Version (PCL:SV) and the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG). Limitations of the study are discussed, especially those related to the difficulties inherent in file-based research, and suggestions for future research are offered.

Global Climate Change and Children's Health: Threats and Strategies for Prevention	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Review						environmental justice; global burden of disease; global warming; pediatric environmental health; vulnerable populations; weather	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; COMPARATIVE RISK-ASSESSMENT; PUBLIC-HEALTH; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; INTERPREGNANCY INTERVAL; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; DIARRHEAL DISEASE; AIR-POLLUTION; UNITED-STATES	BACKGROUND: Global climate change will have multiple effects on human health. Vulnerable populations-children, the elderly, and the poor-will be disproportionately affected. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed projected impacts of climate change on children's health, the pathways involved in these effects, and prevention strategies. DATA SOURCES: We assessed primary studies, review articles, and organizational reports. DATA SYNTHESIS: Climate change is increasing the global burden of disease and in the year 2000 was responsible for > 150,000 deaths worldwide. Of this disease burden, 88% fell upon children. Documented health effects include changing ranges of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue; increased diarrheal and respiratory disease; increased morbidity and mortality from extreme weather; changed exposures to toxic chemicals; worsened poverty; food and physical insecurity; and threats to human habitation. Heat-related health effects for which research is emerging include diminished school performance, increased rates of pregnancy complications, and renal effects. Stark variation in these outcomes is evident by geographic region and socioeconomic status, and these impacts will exacerbate health disparities. Prevention strategies to reduce health impacts of climate change include reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation through multiple public health interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Further quantification of the effects of climate change on children's health is needed globally and also at regional and local levels through enhanced monitoring of children's environmental health and by tracking selected indicators. Climate change preparedness strategies need to be incorporated into public health programs.

The Photovoice project engaged and empowered immigrant residents of St. Jamestown to influence public policy and secure improved local services for promoting health and well-being. Twenty-seven residents used photography and storytelling to record neighbourhood characteristics and their implications on residents' health and well-being. Eight participants presented recommendations actionable at neighbourhood level to the councillor and worked with the city to carry out the recommendations made that were recognized as important for neighbourhood residents' health and well-being. The results indicate Photovoice can be used to generate dialogue on community concerns and priorities and promote community action.

Methods: This was a study of contrasted cases. Two districts were selected, Keita and Abalak; Keita is supported by an international NGO. In 2009, we carried out socio-anthropological surveys in all the health facilities of both districts and qualitative interviews with 211 individuals. Results: Keita district launched the policy before Abalak did, and its implementation was more effective. The populations and the health workers of both districts were relatively well aware of the user fees abolition. Both districts experienced significant delays in the reimbursement of treatments provided free of charge in the health centres (9 months in Keita, 24 months in Abalak). The presence of the NGO compensated for the State's shortcomings, particularly with respect to maintaining the drug supply, which became difficult because of payment delays. In Abalak, district officials reinstated user fees.

J	Mogford, E; Gould, L; Devoght, A				Mogford, Elizabeth; Gould, Linn; Devoght, Andra			Teaching critical health literacy in the US as a means to action on the social determinants of health	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						social determinants of health; health equity; advocacy; health education	PUBLIC-HEALTH; EDUCATION; COMMUNICATION; DISPARITIES; SYSTEMS; SCHOOLS; EQUITY	In spite of improvements in global health over the 20th century, health inequities are increasing. Mounting evidence suggests that reducing health inequities requires taking action on the social determinants of health (SDOH), which include income, education, employment, political empowerment and other factors. This paper introduces an alternative health education curriculum, developed by the US-based non-profit organization Just Health Action, which teaches critical health literacy as a step towards empowering people to achieve health equity. Critical health literacy is defined as an individual's understanding of the SDOH combined with the skills to take action at both the individual and the community level. Prior to describing our curricular framework, we connect the recommendations of the World Health Organization Commission on the SDOH with the objectives of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion by arguing that achieving them is reliant on critical health literacy. Then we describe our four-part curricular framework for teaching critical health literacy. Part 1, Knowledge, focuses on teaching the SDOH and the paradigm of health as a human right. Part 2, Compass, refers to activities that help students find their own direction as a social change agent. Part 3, Skills, refers to teaching specific advocacy tools and strategies. Part 4, Action, refers to the development and implementation of an action intended to increase health equity by addressing the SDOH. We describe activities that we use to motivate, engage and empower students to take action on the SDOH and provide examples of advocacy skills students have learned and actions they have implemented.

J	Snyder, J; Crooks, V; Turner, L				Snyder, Jeremy; Crooks, Valorie; Turner, Leigh			Issues and Challenges in Research on the Ethics of Medical Tourism: Reflections from a Conference	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						Medical tourism; Medical travel	PUBLIC-HEALTH; INDIA	The authors co-organized (Snyder and Crooks) and gave a keynote presentation at (Turner) a conference on ethical issues in medical tourism. Medical tourism involves travel across international borders with the intention of receiving medical care. This care is typically paid for out-of-pocket and is motivated by an interest in cost savings and/or avoiding wait times for care in the patient's home country. This practice raises numerous ethical concerns, including potentially exacerbating health inequities in destination and source countries and disrupting continuity of care for patients. In this report, we synthesize conference presentations and present three lessons from the conference: 1) Medical tourism research has the potential for cross-or inter-disciplinarity but must bridge the gap between researchers trained in ethical theory and scholars unfamiliar with normative frameworks; 2) Medical tourism research must engage with empirical research from a variety of disciplines; and 3) Ethical analyses of medical tourism must incorporate both individual and population-level perspectives. While these lessons are presented in the context of research on medical tourism, we argue that they are applicable in other areas of research where global practices, such as human subject research and health worker migration, are occurring in the face of limited regulatory oversight.

Part II: Evidence summaries	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Health screening; Diagnostic test; Screening test; Screening program; Direct evidence; Indirect evidence; Evidence summary	BREAST-CANCER MORTALITY; CORE NEEDLE-BIOPSY; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; FOLLOW-UP; WOMEN 40; AGE; MAMMOGRAPHY; TRIAL; METAANALYSIS	Evidence on the effectiveness of health screening strategies may be direct (i.e., studies on screening vs. no screening) or indirect (i.e., studies that separately evaluate the screening test[s], the confirmatory test, or the treatment). Critical trade-offs in the balance between harm and benefit for many screening strategies mandate that advocates of health screening adhere to the ethical precepts of nonmaleficence, autonomy, confidentiality, and equity. In our first article, we pointed out five prerequisites to justifying a health screening program: (I) the burden of illness should be high, (2) the screening and confirmatory tests should be accurate, (3) early treatment (or prevention) must be more effective than late treatment, (4) the tests and the treatment(s) must be safe, and (5) the cost of the screening strategy must be commensurate with the potential benefit. As can be gleaned from these criteria, recommendations on screening must be tailored to specific populations. Recommendations in one country, no matter how authoritative, cannot be generalized to apply to all other countries. Although accuracy, effectiveness, and safety data may be global (criteria 2-4), burden of illness and efficiency (criteria 1 and 5) will always vary from country to country. Rather than review various national guidelines, in this last article of our two-part series, we present evidence summaries to illustrate health screening. Our examples were selected to address special issues related to four situations screening for cancer, risk factors for disease, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Vulnerability of Health to Market Forces	MEDICAL CARE			English	Article						health care industry; free market; public health; pharmaceutical industry; corporations	PUBLIC-HEALTH; CARDIAC REHABILITATION; PRACTICE GUIDELINES; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; UNITED-STATES; PRIMARY-CARE; INDUSTRY; ASSOCIATION; OWNERSHIP; TRIALS	Objectives: This article reviews adverse influences of for-profit enterprises on health care and public health, and examines significance for public policy. Research Design: Narrative review. Results: For-profit health-care industries may increase costs and reduce quality, leading to market failure and contributing to the USA's unflattering position in international comparisons of healthcare efficiency. Drug and device corporations use strategies such as making biased inferences, influencing scientists and physicians, marketing rather than informing the public, and lobbying to control their own industry regulations to create market advantage. Successful marketing leads to the increased use of costly profit-making drugs and procedures over cheaper, nonpatented therapies. Because resources are limited, the overuse of costly modalities contributes to expensive health care, which presents a challenge to universal coverage. The free market also fosters the proliferation of industries, such as tobacco, food, and chemicals, which externalize costs to maximize profits, seek to unduly influence research by paying experts and universities, and attempt to control the media and regulatory agencies. Most vulnerable to the cumulative harm of these tactics are children, the poor, the sick, and the least educated. Conclusions: The free market can harm health and health care. The corporate obligation to increase profits and ensure a return to shareholders affects public health. Such excesses of capitalism pose formidable challenges to social justice and public health. The recognition of the health risks entailed by corporation-controlled markets has important implications for public policy. Reforms are required to limit the power of corporations.

J	Racine, L; Petrucka, P				Racine, Louise; Petrucka, Pammla			Enhancing decolonization and knowledge transfer in nursing research with non-western populations: examining the congruence between primary healthcare and postcolonial feminist approaches	NURSING INQUIRY			English	Article						knowledge transfer; non-western populations; photovoice; postcolonial feminism; primary healthcare; research decolonization	CULTURAL SAFETY; PHOTOVOICE	This article is a call for reflection from two distinct programs of research which converge on common interests pertaining to issues of health, social justice, and globalization. One of the authors has developed a research program related to the health and well-being of non-western populations, while the other author has expanded the field of Aboriginal and international research in Canada and abroad. Based on examples drawn from our respective programs of research, we suggest conciliating the philosophy of primary healthcare to postcolonial feminism for decolonizing research and enhancing knowledge transfer with non-western populations. We contend that applying the theoretical and methodological strengths of these two approaches is a means to decolonize nursing research and to avoid western neocolonization. In conciliating primary health care and postcolonial feminism, the goal is to enhance the pragmatic relevance of postcolonial feminism to generate resistance through transformative research for achieving social justice. In tapping into the synergistic and complementary epistemological assumptions of the philosophy of primary health care and postcolonial 'feminisms', nurse researchers reinforce the anti-oppresive goals of postcolonial feminist research. Consequently, this approach may enhance both decolonization and knowledge transfer through strategies like photovoice.

J	Frenk, J; Chen, L				Frenk, Julio; Chen, Lincoln			Overcoming gaps to advance global health equity: a symposium on new directions for research	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article								The 20th anniversary of the groundbreaking report of the Commission on Health Research for Development inspired a Symposium to assess progress made in strengthening essential national health research capacity in developing countries and in global research partnerships. Significant aspects of the health gains achieved in the 20th century can be attributed to the advancement and translation of knowledge, and knowledge continues to occupy center stage amidst growing complexity that characterizes the global health field. The way forward will entail a reinvigoration of research-generated knowledge as a crucial ingredient for global cooperation and global health advances. To do this we will need to overcome daunting gaps, including the divides between domestic and global health, among the disciplines of research (biomedical, clinical, epidemiological, health systems), between clinical and public health approaches, public and private investments, and between knowledge gained and action implemented. Overcoming systematically these obstacles can accelerate progress towards research for equity in health and development.

Methods: To better understand the relationship between prison conditions, the criminal justice system, and HIV and TB in Zambian prisons, we conducted a mixed-method study, including: facility assessments and in-depth interviews with 246 prisoners and 30 prison officers at six Zambian prisons; a review of Zambian legislation and policy governing prisons and the criminal justice system; and 46 key informant interviews with government and non-governmental organization officials and representatives of international agencies and donors. Results: The facility assessments, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews found serious barriers to HIV and TB prevention and treatment, and extended pre-trial detention that contributed to overcrowded conditions. Disparities both between prisons and among different categories of prisoners within prisons were noted, with juveniles, women, pre-trial detainees and immigration detainees significantly less likely to access health services. Conclusions: Current conditions and the lack of available medical care in Zambia's prisons violate human rights protections and threaten prisoners' health. In order to protect the health of prisoners, prison-based health services, linkages to community-based health care, general prison conditions and failures of the criminal justice system that exacerbate overcrowding must be immediately improved. International donors should work with the Zambian government to support prison and justice system reform and ensure that their provision of funding in such areas as health services respect human rights standards, including non-discrimination. Human rights protections against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and criminal justice system rights, are essential to curbing the spread of HIV and TB in Zambian prisons, and to achieving broader goals to reduce HIV and TB in Zambia.

METHODS: We based our work on a Swedish prospective cohort study that recruited participants at 16 years of age (N = 1083 at age 16; 403 women and 429 men at age 43, 78% of those still alive [N = 1071]). Blood pressure (BP) and BMI were assessed when participants were 16 and 21 years of age. At age 43, the metabolic syndrome was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation guidelines. Socioeconomic status (SES) was operationalized by the participant (age 21 and 43) or parent's (age 16) occupational status. Information on smoking, snuff, alcohol, and inactivity was collected at age 43. RESULTS: In women, SES at age 16 was independently related to the risk of metabolic syndrome. In women and men, BMI at age 16 was related to metabolic syndrome but was attenuated by BMI at age 21, which was significant in the final model; in women systolic BP displayed similar patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our data seem to suggest two independent life course pathways for metabolic syndrome: one metabolic pathway for both women and men operating through BMI (for women also systolic BP) in adolescence and early adulthood, and for women, an apparently independent pathway through adolescent socioeconomic disadvantage.

Initial published evidence from the NBCSP concurs with international evidence on similar colorectal cancer screening programs about the unequal participation by different population sub-groups. The aim of the paper is to present an analysis of the equity of the NBCSP for South Australia, using the concept of horizontal equity, in order to identify geographical areas and population groups which may benefit from targeted approaches to increase participation rates in colorectal cancer screening. Method: De-identified data from the NBCSP (February 2007 to July 2008) were provided by Medicare Australia. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were undertaken in order to identify the predictors of participation rates in the NBCSP. Results: The overall participation rate was 46.1%, although this was statistically significantly different (p<0.001) by gender (42.6% for males and 49.5% for females), socioeconomic status (40% in most deprived quintile through to 48.1% in most affluent quintile) and remoteness (45.6% for metropolitan, 46% for remote and 48.6% for rural areas). These findings were confirmed in multivariate analyses. Of the NBCSP participants, 0.24% (CI 95% 0.20-0.30) identified themselves as Indigenous and 8% (CI 95% 7.7-8.3) reported speaking a language other than English at home. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest inequities in participation in the NBCSP on the basis of gender, geographical location, Indigenous status and language spoken at home.

Michael			Socioeconomic Variation in the Prevalence, Introduction, Retention, and Removal of Smoke-Free Policies among Smokers: Findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						tobacco smoke pollution; smoking; public policy; socioeconomic factors; United States; Canada; Australia; United Kingdom	FREE WORKPLACE POLICIES; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; SECONDHAND SMOKE; FREE HOMES; SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; FREE LEGISLATION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; SELF-EFFICACY; EXPOSURE; SCOTLAND	Introduction: Exposure to secondhand smoke causes premature death and disease in non-smokers and indoor smoke-free policies have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. Although socioeconomic disparities have been documented in tobacco use and cessation, the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and smoke-free policies is less well studied. Methods: Data were obtained from the 2006 and 2007 Waves of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4), a prospective study of nationally representative samples of smokers in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Telephone interviews were administered to 8,245 current and former adult smokers from October 2006 to February 2007. Between September 2007 and February 2008, 5,866 respondents were re-interviewed. Self-reported education and annual household income were used to create SES tertiles. Outcomes included the presence, introduction, and removal of smoke-free policies in homes, worksites, bars, and restaurants. Results: Smokers with high SES had increased odds of both having [OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.27-2.87] and introducing [OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.04-2.13] a total ban on smoking in the home compared to low SES smokers. Continuing smokers with high SES also had decreased odds of removing a total ban [OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.26-0.73]. No consistent association was observed between SES and the presence or introduction of bans in worksites, bars, or restaurants. Conclusions: The presence, introduction, and retention of smoke-free homes increases with increasing SES, but no consistent socioeconomic variation exists in the presence or introduction of total smoking bans in worksites, bars, or restaurants. Opportunities exist to reduce SES disparities in smoke-free homes, while the lack of socioeconomic differences in public workplace, bar, and restaurant smoke-free policies suggest these measures are now equitably distributed in these four countries.

Although there is no shortage of health workers in the region overall, when analysed separately, five low-income countries have some deficit. All countries in southeast Asia face problems of maldistribution of health workers, and rural areas are often understaffed. Despite a high capacity for medical and nursing training in both public and private facilities, there is weak coordination between production of health workers and capacity for employment. Regional experiences and policy responses to address these challenges can be used to inform future policy in the region and elsewhere. A distinctive feature of southeast Asia is its engagement in international trade in health services. Singapore and Malaysia import health workers to meet domestic demand and to provide services to international patients. Thailand attracts many foreign patients for health services. This situation has resulted in the so-called brain drain of highly specialised staff from public medical schools to the private hospitals. The Philippines and Indonesia are the main exporters of doctors and nurses in the region. Agreements about mutual recognition of professional qualifications for three groups of health workers under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Framework Agreement on Services could result in increased movement within the region in the future. To ensure that vital human resources for health are available to meet the needs of the populations that they serve, migration management and retention strategies need to be integrated into ongoing efforts to strengthen health systems in southeast Asia. There is also a need for improved dialogue between the health and trade sectors on how to balance economic opportunities associated with trade in health services with domestic health needs and equity issues.

J	Runnels, V; Labonte, R; Packer, C				Runnels, Vivien; Labonte, Ronald; Packer, Corinne			Reflections on the ethics of recruiting foreign-trained human resources for health	HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH			English	Article							SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; PROFESSIONALS	Background: Developed countries' gains in health human resources (HHR) from developing countries with significantly lower ratios of health workers have raised questions about the ethics or fairness of recruitment from such countries. By attracting and/or facilitating migration for foreign-trained HHR, notably those from poorer, less well-resourced nations, recruitment practices and policies may be compromising the ability of developing countries to meet the health care needs of their own populations. Little is known, however, about actual recruitment practices. In this study we focus on Canada (a country with a long reliance on internationally trained HHR) and recruiters working for Canadian health authorities. Methods: We conducted interviews with health human resources recruiters employed by Canadian health authorities to describe their recruitment practices and perspectives and to determine whether and how they reflect ethical considerations. Results and discussion: We describe the methods that recruiters used to recruit foreign-trained health professionals and the systemic challenges and policies that form the working context for recruiters and recruits. HHR recruiters' reflections on the global flow of health workers from poorer to richer countries mirror much of the content of global-level discourse with regard to HHR recruitment. A predominant market discourse related to shortages of HHR outweighed discussions of human rights and ethical approaches to recruitment policy and action that consider global health impacts. Conclusions: We suggest that the concept of corporate social responsibility may provide a useful approach at the local organizational level for developing policies on ethical recruitment. Such local policies and subsequent practices may inform public debate on the health equity implications of the HHR flows from poorer to richer countries inherent in the global health worker labour market, which in turn could influence political choices at all government and health system levels.

ICBP Module 1 Working Grp	Cancer survival in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the UK, 1995-2007 (the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership): an analysis of population-based cancer registry data	LANCET			English	Article							BREAST-CANCER; DEATHS; STAGE; AGE; DIAGNOSIS; ENGLAND; EUROPE; TRENDS; CARE	Background Cancer survival is a key measure of the effectiveness of health-care systems. Persistent regional and international differences in survival represent many avoidable deaths. Differences in survival have prompted or guided cancer control strategies. This is the first study in a programme to investigate international survival disparities, with the aim of informing health policy to raise standards and reduce inequalities in survival. Methods Data from population-based cancer registries in 12 jurisdictions in six countries were provided for 2.4 million adults diagnosed with primary colorectal, lung, breast (women), or ovarian cancer during 1995-2007, with follow-up to Dec 31, 2007. Data quality control and analyses were done centrally with a common protocol, overseen by external experts. We estimated 1-year and 5-year relative survival, constructing 252 complete life tables to control for background mortality by age, sex, and calendar year. We report age-specific and age-standardised relative survival at 1 and 5 years, and 5-year survival conditional on survival to the first anniversary of diagnosis. We also examined incidence and mortality trends during 1985-2005. Findings Relative survival improved during 1995-2007 for all four cancers in all jurisdictions. Survival was persistently higher in Australia, Canada, and Sweden, intermediate in Norway, and lower in Denmark, England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, particularly in the first year after diagnosis and for patients aged 65 years and older. International differences narrowed at all ages for breast cancer, from about 9% to 5% at 1 year and from about 14% to 8% at 5 years, but less or not at all for the other cancers. For colorectal cancer, the international range narrowed only for patients aged 65 years and older, by 2-6% at 1 year and by 2-3% at 5 years. Interpretation Up-to-date survival trends show increases but persistent differences between countries. Trends in cancer incidence and modality are broadly consistent with these trends in survival. Data quality and changes in classification are not likely explanations. The patterns are consistent with later diagnosis or differences in treatment, particularly in Denmark and the UK, and in patients aged 65 years and older.	[Coleman, M.

W.; de Mello, Meena Cabral; Izutsu, Takashi; Tuan Tran			The Ha Noi Expert Statement: recognition of maternal mental health in resource-constrained settings is essential for achieving the Millennium Development Goals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CHILD-DEVELOPMENT; POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; RISK	Mental health problems in women during pregnancy and after childbirth and their adverse consequences for child health and development have received sustained detailed attention in high-income countries. In contrast, evidence has only been generated more recently in resource-constrained settings. In June 2007 the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organization, the Key Centre for Women's Health in Society, a WHO Collaborating Centre for Women's Health and the Research and Training Centre for Community Development in Vietnam convened the first international expert meeting on maternal mental health and child health and development in resource-constrained settings. It aimed to appraise the evidence about the nature, prevalence and risks for common perinatal mental disorders in women; the consequences of these for child health and development and ameliorative strategies in these contexts. The substantial disparity in rates of perinatal mental disorders between women living in high-and low-income settings, suggests social rather than biological determinants. Risks in resource-constrained contexts include: poverty; crowded living situations; limited reproductive autonomy; unintended pregnancy; lack of empathy from the intimate partner; rigid gender stereotypes about responsibility for household work and infant care; family violence; poor physical health and discrimination. Development is adversely affected if infants lack day-to-day interactions with a caregiver who can interpret their cues, and respond effectively. Women with compromised mental health are less able to provide sensitive, responsive infant care. In resource-constrained settings infants whose mothers are depressed are less likely to thrive and to receive optimal care than those whose mothers are well. The meeting outcome is the Hanoi Expert Statement (Additional file 1). It argues that the Millennium Development Goals to improve maternal health, reduce child mortality, promote gender equality and empower women, achieve universal primary education and eradicate extreme poverty and hunger cannot be attained without a specific focus on women's mental health. It was co-signed by the international expert group; relevant WHO and UNFPA departmental representatives and international authorities. They concur that social rather than medical responses are required.

AFRICAN HEALTH SCIENCES			English	Article						social determinants of health; inequalities; policy priority; CSDH; Africa	INCOME INEQUALITY	Background: The task of improving Social and Economic Determinants of Health (SEDH) imposes a significant challenge to health policy makers in both rich and poor countries. In recent years, while there has been increasing research interest and evidence on the workings of SEDHs, the vast majority of studies on this issue are from developed countries and emphasizes specific concerns of the developed nations of the world. Importantly, they may not fully explain the underlying causal factors and pathways of health inequality in the world's poorest countries. Objective: To explore whether there are specific social determinants of health in the world's poorest countries, and if so, how they could be better identified and researched in Africa in order to promote and support the effort that is currently being made for realizing a better health for all. Methods: Extensive literature review of existing papers on the social and economic determinants of health. Conclusion: Most of the existing studies on the social and economic determinants of health studies may not well provide adequate explanation on the historical and contemporary realties of SEDHs in the world's poorest countries. As these factors vary from one country to another, it becomes necessary to understand country-specific conditions and design appropriate policies that take due cognisance of these country-specific circumstances. Therefore, to support the global effort to close gaps in health disparities, further research is needed in the world's poorest countries, especially on African social determinants of health	[Eshetu, E.

The code itself emphasizes that (i) the practice should be relevant, knowledge-based, sound, and appropriate to the occupational risks and (ii) the objectives and methods of health surveillance must be clearly defined. Because exposure to nanoparticles involves several uncertainties about health effects and may limit the effectiveness of workers' health surveillance, OHPs face a several ethical dilemmas, involving different stakeholders. The dilemmas arising from the practice should be dealt with according to the ethical principles of beneficence, autonomy, and justice in order to take a decision.

Life expectancy and disparity: an international comparison of life table data	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							SURVIVAL-CURVE; MORTALITY; LONGEVITY; EQUITY; HEALTH; RECTANGULARIZATION; COMPRESSION; INEQUALITY; DEATHS; AGE	Objectives: To determine the contribution of progress in averting premature deaths to the increase in life expectancy and the decline in lifespan variation. Design: International comparison of national life table data from the Human Mortality Database. Setting: 40 developed countries and regions, 1840-2009. Population: Men and women of all ages. Main outcome measure: We use two summary measures of mortality: life expectancy and life disparity. Life disparity is a measure of how much lifespans differ among individuals. We define a death as premature if postponing it to a later age would decrease life disparity. Results: In 89 of the 170 years from 1840 to 2009, the country with the highest male life expectancy also had the lowest male life disparity. This was true in 86 years for female life expectancy and disparity. In all years, the top several life expectancy leaders were also the top life disparity leaders. Although only 38% of deaths were premature, fully 84% of the increase in life expectancy resulted from averting premature deaths. The reduction in life disparity resulted from reductions in early-life disparity, that is, disparity caused by premature deaths; late-life disparity levels remained roughly constant. Conclusions: The countries that have been the most successful in averting premature deaths have consistently been the life expectancy leaders. Greater longevity and greater equality of individuals' lifespans are not incompatible goals. Countries can achieve both by reducing premature deaths.

Regional and educational differences in treatment with fluoroquinolone in urinary tract infection of 236 376 Swedish patients	BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY			English	Article							ANTIMICROBIAL CONSUMPTION ESAC; OUTPATIENT ANTIBIOTIC USE; EUROPEAN SURVEILLANCE; HEALTH-CARE; SWEDEN; RESISTANCE; REGISTER; DRUGS	Background: In an international effort to reduce antibiotic resistance, in part suggested to be the effect of inappropriate antibiotic use, several quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic use have been proposed. In this study, geographical and educational differences in fluoroquinolone prescription in the treatment of urinary tract infection in women are presented. Methods: The age-adjusted ratio of women who were dispensed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin) among all 236 376 women dispensed any of the following antibiotics used in the treatment of lower urinary tract infection were studied: ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, pivmecillinam, trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin. Only the first prescription during July 2006 to June 2007 was studied. Prescription data were linked to information on geographical area, marital status, country of birth and educational attainment, which allowed multivariate analysis of the importance of these factors. Results: The rate of fluoroquinolone prescription varied from 29.5% to 17.1% in the 21 regions in Sweden. Middle-aged women with >= 15 years of schooling were more often prescribed fluoroquinolones compared to those with only 9 years (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.34). Conclusion: Quality indicators in healthcare should be developed bearing in mind the overall level of adherence to guidelines and whether there are regional or socioeconomic or other differentials in their distribution in the population because such differentials in healthcare quality might further contribute to inequalities in health.

The author makes a brief historical review of the concepts, approaches and methodologies used to study the relationships between social determinants and health outcomes. By analyzing the current global movement around social determinants of health he emphasizes that the distinctive feature of this movement is the explicit commitment to action through intersectoral public policies that are based on evidence and implemented with the support and participation of broad segments of society. As this special issue of the Cadernos de Saude Publica is dedicated to presenting the results of research related to social determinants of health, the author focuses on an analysis of the difficulties in the production and use of scientific evidence that supports the definition, implementation and evaluation of policies to combat health inequities through action on social determinants of health. To conclude, he presents some recommendations for overcoming these difficulties.

J	Outram, SM				Outram, Simon M.			Epidemiology and Bioethics: A Plea for Reconnecting With the Public	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article						Bioethics; epidemiology; public health	ETHICS	The author takes the position that both epidemiology and bioethics, as practiced within academic establishments, have largely although not entirely abstracted the public context of health and well-being from their respective disciplines. It is argued that by and large both disciplines have been highly successful at what they do. However, this success can in part be attributed to each limiting its ability to look beyond its respective academic niche and thus embrace challenges which are socially challenging, politically charged, and academically messy. This narrow focus has become self-serving and ultimately detracts from fundamental remits of both disciplines in protecting the public from harm. Furthermore, it may re-enforce the inequalities of research into health overall, whereby the greatest concentration of effort remains firmly focused upon those who already have the most. Currently marginalized approaches to each of these disciplines - such as social epidemiology, global bioethics, and critical bioethics - provide us with platforms that challenge mainstream academic epidemiologists and bioethicists to seek out and reconnect their expertise with questions that are more relevant to real-world situations.

Community wide interventions for increasing physical activity	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE PREVENTION; HEALTH-PROMOTION PROGRAM; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; LIFE-STYLE INTERVENTIONS; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; SCHOOL-BASED-PROGRAM; REDUCE RISK-FACTORS; SANTE ST-HENRI; DIABETES PREVENTION; HARTSLAG-LIMBURG	Background Multi-strategic community wide interventions for physical activity are increasingly popular but their ability to achieve population level improvements is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the effects of community wide, multi-strategic interventions upon population levels of physical activity. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ASSIA, The British Nursing Index, Chinese CNKI databases, EPPI Centre (DoPHER, TRoPHI), ERIC, HMIC, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus, Transport Database and Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index). We also scanned websites of the EU Platform on Diet, Physical Activity and Health; Health-Evidence.ca; the International Union for Health Promotion and Education; the NIHR Coordinating Centre for Health Technology (NCCHTA) and NICE and SIGN guidelines. Reference lists of all relevant systematic reviews, guidelines and primary studies were followed up. We contacted experts in the field from the National Obesity Observatory Oxford, Oxford University; Queensland Health, Queensland University of Technology, the University of Central Queensland; the University of Tennessee and Washington University; and handsearched six relevant journals. The searches were last updated to the end of November 2009 and were not restricted by language or publication status. Selection criteria Cluster randomised controlled trials, randomised controlled trials (RCT), quasi-experimental designs which used a control population for comparison, interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, and prospective controlled cohort studies (PCCS) were included. Only studies with a minimum six-month follow up from the start of the intervention to measurement of outcomes were included. Community wide interventions had to comprise at least two broad strategies aimed at physical activity for the whole population. Studies which randomised individuals from the same community were excluded. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of each included study. Non-English language papers were reviewed with the assistance of an epidemiologist interpreter. Each study was assessed for the setting, the number of included components and their intensity. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they were dichotomous (physically active, physically active during leisure time and sedentary or physically inactive) or continuous (leisure time physical activity, walking, energy expenditure). For dichotomous measures we calculated the unadjusted and adjusted risk difference, and the unadjusted and adjusted relative risk. For continuous measures we calculated net percentage change from baseline, unadjusted and adjusted risk difference, and the unadjusted and adjusted relative risk. Main results After the selection process had been completed 25 studies were included in the review. Of the included studies, 19 were set in high income countries, using the World Bank economic classification, and the remaining six were in low income countries. The interventions varied by the number of strategies included and their intensity. Almost all of the interventions included a component of building partnerships with local governments or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (22 studies). None of the studies provided results by socio-economic disadvantage or other markers of equity consideration. However of those included studies undertaken in high income countries, 11 studies were described by the authors as being provided to deprived, disadvantaged, or low socio-economic communities. Fifteen studies were identified as having a high risk of bias, 10 studies were unclear, and no studies had a low risk of bias. Selection bias was a major concern with these studies, with only one study using randomisation to allocate communities (Simon 2008). No studies were judged as being at low risk of selection bias although 16 studies were considered to have an unclear risk of bias. Eleven studies had a high risk of detection bias, 10 with an unclear risk and four with no risk. Assessment of detection bias included an assessment of the validity of the measurement tools and quality of outcome measures. The effects reported were inconsistent across the studies and the measures. Some of the better designed studies showed no improvement in measures of physical activity. Publication bias was evident. Authors' conclusions Although numerous studies have been undertaken, there is a noticeable inconsistency of the findings of the available studies and this is confounded by serious methodological issues within the included studies. The body of evidence in this review does not support the hypothesis that multi-component community wide interventions effectively increase population levels of physical activity. There is a clear need for well-designed intervention studies and such studies should focus on the quality of the measurement of physical activity, the frequency of measurement and the allocation to intervention and control communities.

Interventions for preventing obesity in children	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Adolescent; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Diet; Exercise; Obesity [diet therapy; prevention & control]; Treatment Outcome; Child; Humans	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION; BODY-MASS INDEX; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY INTERVENTION; HEALTH-EDUCATION INTERVENTION; GEORGIA FITKID PROJECT; EXCESSIVE WEIGHT-GAIN; LOW-CHOLESTEROL DIET; REDUCE RISK-FACTORS; LOW-SATURATED FAT	Background Prevention of childhood obesity is an international public health priority given the significant impact of obesity on acute and chronic diseases, general health, development and well-being. The international evidence base for strategies that governments, communities and families can implement to prevent obesity, and promote health, has been accumulating but remains unclear. Objectives This review primarily aims to update the previous Cochrane review of childhood obesity prevention research and determine the effectiveness of evaluated interventions intended to prevent obesity in children, assessed by change in Body Mass Index (BMI). Secondary aims were to examine the characteristics of the programs and strategies to answer the questions "What works for whom, why and for what cost?" Search methods The searches were re-run in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and CINAHL in March 2010 and searched relevant websites. Non-English language papers were included and experts were contacted. Selection criteria The review includes data from childhood obesity prevention studies that used a controlled study design (with or without randomisation). Studies were included if they evaluated interventions, policies or programs in place for twelve weeks or more. If studies were randomised at a cluster level, 6 clusters were required. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data was extracted on intervention implementation, cost, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured adiposity, physical activity (PA)-related behaviours or diet-related behaviours. Adverse outcomes were recorded. A meta-analysis was conducted using available BMI or standardised BMI (zBMI) score data with subgroup analysis by age group (0-5, 6-12, 13-18 years, corresponding to stages of developmental and childhood settings). Main results This review includes 55 studies (an additional 36 studies found for this update). The majority of studies targeted children aged 612 years. The meta-analysis included 37 studies of 27,946 children and demonstrated that programmes were effective at reducing adiposity, although not all individual interventions were effective, and there was a high level of observed heterogeneity (I-2=82%). Overall, children in the intervention group had a standardised mean difference in adiposity (measured as BMI or zBMI) of -0.15kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.21 to -0.09). Intervention effects by age subgroups were -0.26kg/m(2) (95% CI:-0.53 to 0.00) (05 years), -0.15kg/m(2) (95% CI -0.23 to -0.08) (6-12 years), and -0.09kg/m(2) (95% CI -0.20 to 0.03) (13-18 years). Heterogeneity was apparent in all three age groups and could not explained by randomisation status or the type, duration or setting of the intervention. Only eight studies reported on adverse effects and no evidence of adverse outcomes such as unhealthy dieting practices, increased prevalence of underweight or body image sensitivities was found. Interventions did not appear to increase health inequalities although this was examined in fewer studies.

J	Mohindra, KS; Labonté, R; Spitzer, D				Mohindra, K. S.; Labonte, Ronald; Spitzer, Denise			The global financial crisis: whither women's health?	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						women's health; global financial crisis; economic crises	ECONOMIC-CRISIS; GENDER; GLOBALIZATION; POLICY; CUBA; VIOLENCE; EQUITY; IMPACT; POWER; FOOD	The global integration of trade and financial markets that has been the hallmark of the past 30 years of neoliberal globalization means that local economies can be shaped by economic events seemingly unrelated to the scale or geography where women's empowerment projects unfold. These global-local interactions raise questions so far largely absent in public discussions of the 2008 crisis precipitated by the US sub-prime loan scandal: what are the gendered effects of global financial crises; specifically, how do these crises affect women? And how do these market crises intersect with the non-market activities that are key to understanding gendered health issues in developing countries. This article addresses these questions by reviewing the literature on gendered health impacts of financial crises over the past two decades. We find that the manner in which national governments and the broader international community react to crises can either magnify (as illustrated through the impacts of structural adjustment programmes on women's health) or mitigate (as illustrated through the policies pursued following the loss of support from the collapsed Soviet Union on Cuban women's health) gendered health-negative effects. Lack of attention to gender-specific consequences of past crises or health-positive interventions into such crises has weakened the ability to advance policy advice on protecting women's health during the present crisis. The article concludes with a gender-focused critique of the dominant policy responses to the 2008 financial crisis and a call to undertake real-time investigation of gendered health risks and opportunities arising from the present crisis.

CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES			English	Review						sustainable agriculture; agroecology; food security; environmental impact; natural resources; multifunctionality; multi-criteria	FARMING SYSTEMS; LAND-USE; HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; GREEN-REVOLUTION; GLOBAL PATTERNS; SOIL-EROSION; FOOD; BIODIVERSITY; WATER	In this paper the environmental impact of current agriculture practices is reviewed. Soil loss (along with soil fertility), increasing water demand from agricultural practices and environmental pollution caused by the intensive use of agrochemicals, are among the most pressing issues concerning agriculture sustainability. Biodiversity loss due to land use change and emission of greenhouse gasses from agricultural activities are also causes for concern. A number of alternative agricultural practices are also presented that can help to make agriculture less environmentally damaging by reducing the use of natural resources, limiting inputs and preserving soil fertility and biodiversity. We think that there is room for a different and more ecological agriculture and that research should be implemented in order to better assess the potential and constraints of the different options. However, notwithstanding the great achievements of the oGreen Revolution,o the world will need 70 to 100% more food by 2050. So a new challenge lies ahead: how to feed nine billion with less land, water and energy, while at the same time preserving natural resources and soil fertility? Technical advances are important in order to meet the future needs, but addressing key socioeconomic issues, such as the inequality in the access to resources, population growth, and access to education are also a priority if we want to properly deal with sustainability. It may require our society to change some of its paradigms and ovalueso if we wish to preserve our support system, the soil and its health, for the future generations.

J	María-Dolores, R; Martínez-Carrión, JM				Maria-Dolores, Ramon; Miguel Martinez-Carrion, Jose			The relationship between height and economic development in Spain, 1850-1958	ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Height; Health; Income; Education; Economic development; Cointegration	UNIT-ROOT; HEALTH; INCOME; STATURE; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; NETHERLANDS; POPULATION; INEQUALITY; NUTRITION	We investigate the relationship between height and some economic-development indicators in modern Spain by means of a recently constructed times series of data on conscripts. We estimate a Vector Autoregressive Equilibrium Correction Model (VECqM) to quantify the height and GDP per capita response to various living-standard indicators. We observe that conditions that perpetuate an elevated level of sickness and mortality and that raise the relative price of consumption goods tend to impede human growth, as reflected in a decline in average adult height, whereas factors that promote the purchase of health services and that help to open up the economy to international trade and ideas have tended to have an opposite effect from the 1850s onward. Our results also indicate that neither the level of per capita GDP nor its growth rate has a unidirectional relation to various measures of living standards, chiefly adult stature. Instead, our findings suggest that there may be behavioral factors (e.g., emphasis on health services), political factors (e.g., degree of openness), and economic factors (e.g., relative consumer costs to GDP deflator) whose affects may have been influenced the level of GDP, over the sample period.

As the curriculum does not often mention the term sustainability, a key with which to investigate signs of education for sustainable development in the three curricula was created. The key encourages a holistic view of sustainable development, where economic, environmental and social factors are not treated as separate entities. It was designed to reflect the goals of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014) with research on environmental education and education for sustainable development in mind. The key has seven characteristics: values, opinions and emotions about nature and environment; knowledge contributing to a sensible use of nature; welfare and public health; democracy, participation, and action competence; equality and multicultural issues; global awareness; and finally, economic development and future prospects. Using the key, a variety of signs and indicators that provide a space for teachers and schools to deal with issues of sustainable development were identified.

'All her children are born that way': gendered experiences of stigma in families affected by sickle cell disorder in rural Kenya	ETHNICITY & HEALTH			English	Article						sickle cell disorder; Africa; stigmatisation; gender; health policy	HUMAN-GENOME-PROJECT; AIDS-RELATED STIGMA; INFORMED-CONSENT; GLOBAL HEALTH; DISEASE; AFRICA; BURDEN; WILL	Objectives. To explore early experiences of sickle cell disorder (SCD) in families with a young affected child, and the way these experiences influence relations within families. To consider ways in which stigma could be counteracted in health and research programmes in sub Saharan Africa. Design. A qualitative study was conducted in a rural area of coastal Kenya including in-depth interviews with 13 families affected by SCD and 12 staff of a local biomedical research progamme. Purposive selection aimed to maximize diversity in socioeconomic and educational status, religion, severity of illness burden and religion amongst families and draw on relevant experience for staffs. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using the constant comparative method for family interviews and a thematic framework approach for staff data. Results. Low initial recognition of SCD and its cause were associated with lay practices of surveillance within affected families, contributing to stigmatisation that occurred independently of genetic knowledge. Blame was often placed on mothers, including a risk of blame for misaligned paternity. Mothers are often particularly affected by SCD through the loss of independent livelihoods and their limited options in coping with this chronic condition. Conclusions. Mothers of children with SCD were particularly vulnerable to stigmatisation within families, with underlying structural influences that suggest these findings may apply to other similar settings in Africa, and have relevance for other genetic conditions. The potential, nature and form of stigmatisation point to the role of effective communication and SCD management in addressing for blame and discriminative effects of having a child with SCD. The findings highlight the importance of broader social programmes targeting underlying gender and economic inequalities.

J	Hawkins, R				Hawkins, Roberta			'One Pack = One Vaccine' = one global motherhood? A feminist analysis of ethical consumption	GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE			English	Article						cause-related marketing; ethical consumption; third world women; development; North-South	FAIR TRADE; SPACES; GEOGRAPHIES; RESPONSIBILITY; GLOBALIZATION; POLITICS	This article is inspired by a recent television commercial for Pampers (a brand of disposable diapers) which announces that by buying this brand of diapers 'you can help the world's babies in need, because one pack of Pampers equals one life saving vaccine'. This commercial promotes the 'One Pack = One Vaccine' initiative between Pampers and UNICEF, a cause-related marketing (CRM) campaign that supplies a tetanus vaccine to a woman in the South with each purchase of Pampers in North America. This article critically examines the way that CRM (and the One Pack initiative in particular) links individual consumption choices to development while simultaneously delinking consumption from environmental degradation, health risks and global inequalities. Taking this argument further, it uses a feminist perspective to examine the ways in which the narratives of 'first world women' and 'third world women' are depicted and used in the One Pack initiative, to make certain North-South power dynamics invisible while highlighting others. This is accomplished through a discourse of an imagined community of global motherhood. Drawing on insights gained from key informant interviews and discourse analysis, it is argued that the One Pack initiative discourses constrain North-South connections to those based on capitalist and colonial power relations. This limits the potential of CRM to promote more engaged, responsible and just terms of connection between the North and South.

J	Ingram, A				Ingram, Alan			The Pentagon's HIV/AIDS Programmes: Governmentality, Political Economy, Security	GEOPOLITICS			English	Article								This article brings together governmentality and political economic readings of security to offer a critical examination of the international HIV/AIDS programmes operated by the US Department of Defense, particularly as they focus on populations in Africa. Reaching groups often left out of national HIV/AIDS strategies and conducting research into HIV vaccines, US military HIV/AIDS programmes can be read as supportive of the broader global health effort to secure populations from HIV. However, a consideration of publicly available material shows that growing US commitment to addressing the problem of HIV/AIDS parallels, and in the case of military programmes intersects with, the idea of Africa as a locus of strategic resources, fragile states and potential terrorist threats. These ideas are furthermore articulated in terms of a neoliberal teleology, in which health programmes appear as part of an effort to help populations along the path to normal, healthy development, occluding the exploitative manner in which populations and regions highly affected by HIV have been incorporated into the global political economy. Such rationalities are problematic in that they obviate a more substantive grounding of health in ideas of peace or equity and thus provide a poor guide to a more healthy global order. While noting the contribution of US military programmes to the international response to HIV/AIDS, the article emphasises the importance of examining associations between HIV/AIDS, military forces and security in terms of the broader web of rationalities and relationships within which they are situated.

Cross-sectional and empirical research studies in particular on the effects of non-economic factors such as reproductive rights remain few and far between. Objective: This study investigates the influence of two components of an empowerment strategy, gender equality, and reproductive rights on women's reproductive health in developing countries. The empowerment strategy for improving reproductive health is theoretically situated on a number of background factors such as economic and social development. Design: Cross-national socioeconomic and demographic data from a number of international organizations on 142 developing countries are used to test a model of reproductive rights and reproductive health. Results: The findings suggest that both economic and democratic development have significant positive effects on levels of gender equality. The level of social development plays a prominent role in promoting reproductive rights. It is found that reproductive rights channel the influences of social structural factors and gender equality on reproductive health.

We argue that the responses to both rapid population growth and AIDS reflect a particular model for approaching development issues: the global crisis model. This model provides a framework in which development issues become classified as (1) global in scope, (2) highly urgent and unique, (3) a threat to international stability and (4) addressable through a concerted global response. By reviewing the population control movement and the past, present and possible future of the AIDS response, we examine the evolution of the global crisis model and its consequences in shaping development priorities, problems and solutions. We argue that the model mobilises significant financial resources, but it skews the allocation of development assistance, creates narrow, technical interventions, and fails to examine or remedy the social inequalities that produce health and development disparities.

The authors classified three approaches to measuring inequity in health care according to: (1) collective expert judgments (clinical standard approach), (2) average health care use based on need (population standard approach), and (3) assessment of health care users or providers (direct approach). The clinical standard approach has strong face validity and immediate policy implication, while lacking global policy implications. The population standard approach offers a global picture of inequity but has weak face validity. The direct approach can reveal private information of health care users and offer opportunity for managing public expectation. Strengths and limitations of these approaches are complementary, suggesting directions for future improvements of each approach. This study will help researchers make a well-informed choice of measurement approach and assist policymakers in resolving some of the problems caused by the diverse findings of studies, partly due to the measurement approaches taken.

These institutions maintain that individual private health insurance systems are more appropriate than previously established national public health structures for overcoming inequities in health care in developing countries. The reforms carried out following international financial institution guidelines are known as "neoliberal reforms." This qualitative study explores consumer health choices and associated factors, based on interviews with citizens living in Medellin, Colombia, in 2005-2006. The results show that most study participants belonging to low-income and middle-income strata, even with medical expense subsidies, faced significant barriers to accessing health care. Only upper-income participants reported a selection of different options without barriers, such as complementary and alternative medicines, along with private Western biomedicine. This study is unique in that the informal health system is linked to overall neoliberal policy change.

In a comparative analysis among countries, the authors find there is no single model; rather, each country has a unique structure of institutions and norms that have important implications for the operation of its health system. Brazil shares some similarities with other countries that have adopted a decentralized system and is assuming features ever closer to U.S. federalism, with a complex web of relationships. The degree of inequality among Brazilian municipalities and states, along with the budgetary imbalances caused by the minimal levels of resource utilization, undermines Brazil's constitutional principles and, consequently, its federalism. To ensure the constitutional mandate in Brazil, it is essential, as in other countries, to create a stable source of funds and increase the volume and efficiency of spending. Also important are investing in the training of managers, improving information systems, strengthening the principles of autonomy and interdependence, and defining patterns of cooperation within the federation.

Therefore, this study aims at summarizing and discussing the available knowledge on incarcerated mentally ill offenders concerning: (1) the screening and assessment for detecting mental health; (2) the psychiatric expertise in order to evaluate the mental status; and (3) the development and provision of forensic psychiatric treatment and care. These findings will be applied to the current situation in Belgium, which is a particularly interesting case. Belgium is currently facing difficulties concerning a large population of interned mentally ill offenders residing in correctional establishments. Implications with regard to the penal code, general or mental health legislation, screening, assessment, and treatment could deliver interesting viewpoints on how this problem could be tackled more effectively. Therefore, the findings will be discussed with reference to the international scientific and policy debate, focusing on ethical implications. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Human rights discourse is rarely used to shape professional standards for 'health and safety. Yet there is much potential for synergy by applying human rights approaches to workplace health and safety and professional ethics. A review of international treaties confirms an extensive articulation of the right to workplace health and safety. A case study of pesticide exposure risks to small farmers in developing countries illustrates the links between human rights, occupational health practice, and professional ethics. OHPs have a responsibility to assist in the realization of workers' occupational health rights, particularly by promoting meaningful participation of those affected by hazardous exposures. Human rights approaches may assist the prevention of work-related morbidity.

RELIGIOUS, SPIRITUAL, AND TRADITIONAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES AND THE ETHICS OF MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH IN LESS WEALTHY COUNTRIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY IN MEDICINE			English	Article						religion; spirituality; mental health; ethics	INTERCESSORY PRAYER; STEP	This discussion article contributes to ethics reform by introducing the contribution of religious, spiritual, and traditional beliefs and practices to both subject vulnerability and patient improvement. A growing body of evidence suggests that religious, spiritual, and traditional beliefs and practices may provide positive benefits, although in some cases mixed or negative consequences to mental and physical health. These beliefs and practices add a new level of complexity to ethical deliberations, in terms of what ignoring them may mean for both distributive justice and respect for persons. International ethical guidelines need to be created that are expansive enough to cover an array of social groups and circumstances. It is proposed that these guidelines incorporate the religious, spiritual, and/or traditional principles that characterize a local population. Providing effective mental health-care requires respecting and understanding how differences, including ones that express a population's religious, spiritual, or traditional belief systems, play into the complex deliberations and negotiations that must be undertaken if researchers are to adhere to ethical imperatives in research and treatment.

Less than 10% of research funds are spent on the diseases that account for 90% of the global disease burden. This case study of north-south, south-south collaborations in Sri Lanka is a classic example of the issues faced by mental health researchers in low and middle income countries (LMICs). In this paper, work carried out by the Institute of Psychiatry (IoP), King's College London and the Institute for Research and Development (IRD) partnership since 1997 in Sri Lanka is presented to show an example of a successful private research institution based in a LMIC as a product of south-south and north-south collaboration in mental health research. The evidence of scarcity of mental health research and resources is overwhelmingly abundant in the context of Sri Lanka. IRD-IoP partnership showcases a successful north-south partnership with equality and efficiency. It has moved beyond start-up phase and has become a sustainable initiative in terms of funding, collaboration, research output and policy impact. International funding agencies, academics, and other bodies need to address sustaining such initiatives as priorities in reducing scarcity and inequity in mental health research in developing countries.

This article investigates how preferences for reform and its eventual design were shaped by the country's social history and commitment to free market values. Data derive from 36 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders deemed knowledgeable about health care financing and delivery in Bermuda, including government officials, provider representatives, insurance executives, and consumer advocates. Data also derive from a variety of documentary sources. Results indicate that although a clear need for health care and the ability to finance it for seniors exists in Bermuda, the scope of reform was circumscribed by preferences for prior policy decisions, creating a favorable tax and business environment for international corporations and a minimalist social welfare state for addressing racial and economic inequality. This suggests that widespread agreement on the challenges in meeting the health and long-term care needs of the elderly does not necessarily lead to equally commensurable solutions to addressing it.

J	Lozano, R; Huisingh, D				Lozano, Rodrigo; Huisingh, Don			Inter-linking issues and dimensions in sustainability reporting	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Sustainability reporting; Sustainable development; Inter-linkages; Cleaner production; Gounded theory; Worker health and safety; Consumer safety; Climate change		During the last decade, Sustainability Reporting (SR) has been increasingly adopted by corporations worldwide. This is evidenced by the adoption of several guidelines, such as the ISO 14000 series, the Social Accountability 8000 standard, and the GRI Sustainability Guidelines. SR shows promise to help corporate leaders and their employees to contribute towards achieving sustainable societies. However, most of the guidelines and standards address sustainability issues through comparmentalisation, thereby, leading to the separation of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions. Due to these divisive approaches, holistic assessments of the effects of their efforts are seldom properly integrated into coporate decisions and procedures to make improvements for example through Cleaner Production, Worker Health and Safety, Consumer Safety, and reductions in the negative short and long-term Social and Environmental Impacts. This paper analyses SR reports from three companies with the help of Grounded Theory's constant comparative analysis. This analytical framework helped the authors to systematically assess the degree to which the companies addressed economic, ecological and social issues separately or in an integrated and inter-linked manner. From the inter-linkages found, a new category is proposed to be added to future SR. This new category can help corporate SR planners and researchers on sustainability reports to better understand how the company leaders understand their responsibilities with regard to SD. These inter-connectednesses are highly relevant in many short and long-term dimensions of supply chain management, global warming, ecological disruption and societal equity issues, especially with regard to the local, national and global energy issues of fuels and oils, the central themes of the conference at which this paper was originally presented. It also plays a key role in real, long-term changes towards Sustainability, where the time dimension plays a key role in human survival on Planet Earth. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This article argues that the time is propitious to reflect on the social nature of the most common behavioral noncommunicable disease determinants, including tobacco and alcohol use, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet. Evidence is presented related to the fact that these diseases are profoundly rooted in social and community ties and points to the need for a modern communication strategy to serve as a linchpin of any successful action to address these public health threats. Several proposals, aimed at promoting health literacy, strengthening health workforce skills, capturing the power of new media and technologies, and targeting vulnerable groups, are discussed.

The paper stresses the critical importance of organizing effective global institutions for the purpose of human development and briefly discusses some major challenges that can and do affect the international community. It summarizes the theoretical underpinnings for the primacy of institutions as derived from two strands of development theory and the extent towards which these ideas have been acted upon in developing frameworks of global governance. The paper discusses these two principles in light of some of the major challenges that can and do affect the international community as a whole, and some of the decentralized forms of governance that are being developed as developing countries assert themselves in debates on institutional organization. It focuses on the global financial crisis as a case study in the inadequacies of current global governance and the reforms advocated by the Commission of Experts of the President of the United Nations General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System to redress these failures.

Give Me Property or Give Me Death: Reconciling Intellectual Property Rights and the Right to Health	JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							INEQUALITIES	Though few would argue against the right to health care on moral grounds, we argue that the greater problem has been over the feasibility of such an idea, especially where the "right to health" has never been clearly defined. We discuss a range of problems in balancing the two values: the right of a creator to protect their intellectual property and the right of everyone to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health care. We argue that to strike a balance between these important values, all countries must work to develop policies that take into account the basic health and developmental interests of developing countries. We also argue that important changes must be made to the current IPR system, especially with respect to the production and pricing of basic goods and services needed to fulfill health subsistence rights. These changes must include allowing developing countries access to essential medicines that support the realization of basic health, welfare, and economic development. We examine an alternative patent compensation system that Pogge (2005a) has proposed. While we highlight the important aspects of this plan, we also argue that Pogge's scheme falls short in that it does not provide enough incentive to break the short-term profit perspective that corporations possess. We propose two amendments to address this issue in Pogge's scheme. We further argue that we need to replace the dominant state-centric paradigm that views the right to health care in strictly nationalistic terms (as simply problems of the state) with a more cosmopolitan paradigm that reflects the true nature of the relationship between IPR and human rights as a "global public good."

At least one in three women worldwide has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused during her lifetime. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, more than three women in the United States die every day from physical abuse suffered at the hands of an intimate partner. IPV is defined as violence that occurs within the private sphere, generally between individuals who are related through intimacy, blood, or law. When perpetrated against women, IPV is generally understood to include physical, sexual, and psychological abuse by intimate male partners.

Methods: We used GPS and Google Earth to identify 5 major health care facilities in Mzuzu (Malawi) and the homes of 79 traditional birth attendants (TBAs). The distance and time required for each TBA to reach the nearest health care facility were measured by both GPS and by self-report of the TBAs. A convenience sample of 1138 pregnant women was interviewed about their choices of birth sites for current and previous pregnancies and the time and cost required to access health care facilities. Results: The correlation coefficient between the objective measurements by GPS and subjective reports by TBAs for time required from their homes to health care facilities was 0.654 (P < .001). Among pregnant women, 45.6% reported that they could reach a health care facility within 2 hours; 23.8% reported paying more than $1 for transportation to health care facilities. For the current study, 82.6% of women intended to give birth at a health care facility. However, only 48.7% of women actually gave birth in a health care facility in a previous pregnancy, and 32.6% were assisted by TBAs. Discussion: Combined GPS and Google Earth can be useful in the evaluation of accessibility of health care facilities, especially for emergency obstetric care.

The uptake of vasectomy provides one measure of men's involvement in reproductive and contraceptive actions, but uptake requires the negotiation of a complex set of social and psychological meanings related to masculinity, sexuality and contraceptive involvement. The limited research in this area paints a largely negative picture around vasectomy, emphasising fears, side effects, and men being pressured into having the operation, but it is not the only account of vasectomy. Objectives: The aim of this research was to examine the accounts of New Zealand men who had undergone vasectomy. Method: Interviews with 28 men who had opted to have a vasectomy (16 had children; 12 did not) based in New Zealand, a country with a high rate of vasectomy, offer a more positive portrayal of the meanings and experiences of vasectomy. Results: Men referred to vasectomy as a positive reflection of their identities, and their choice to have it as exemplifying personal characteristics they valued. Such accounts disrupt the common-sense story of vasectomy as negative or difficult for men, and allow it to be positioned as a positive choice for heterosexual male reproductive involvement and responsibility	[Terry, Gareth; Braun, Virginia] Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol, Auckland 1, New Zealand	University of Auckland	Terry, G (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Dept Psychol, Auckland 1, New Zealand.	g.terry@auckland.ac.nz	Terry, Gareth/JRX-4085-2023; Braun, Virginia/AFL-0795-2022	Braun, Virginia/0000-0002-3435-091X					69	13	15	1	8	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0264-6838	1469-672X		J REPROD INFANT PSYC	J.

MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY			English	Article							MALIAN MIGRANTS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; CARE ACCESS; IMMIGRANTS; POLITICS; HUMANITARIANISM; PARTICIPATION; MIGRATION; REFUGEES; PARIS	Of the estimated 214 million people who have migrated from poorer to richer countries in search of a better life, between 20 and 30 million have migrated on an unauthorized, or "illegal," basis. All have health needs, or will in the future, yet most are denied health care available to citizens and authorized residents. To many, unauthorized im/migrants' exclusion intuitively "makes sense." As scholars of health, social justice, and human rights, we find this logic deeply flawed and are committed to advancing a constructive program of engaged critique. In this commentary, we call on medical anthropologists to claim an active role in reframing scholarly and public debate about this pressing global health issue. We outline four key theoretical issues and five action steps that will help us sharpen our research agenda and translate ourselves for colleagues in partner disciplines and for broader audiences engaged in policymaking, politics, public health, and clinical practice.

From a political economy perspective, one pathway involves processes of social exclusion that take place on articulating local and global fields of power. This study explores such situated processes as they produce and perpetuate embodied inequality at childbirth in the Kilombero Valley of SouthCentral Tanzania. Ethnographic narratives illustrate how these processes differentially affect the kind of care women seek and receive. Also described are women's complex yet pragmatic responses to potential exclusion in the attempt to secure a safe and otherwise positive outcome. In a culturally constructed world of childbirth, face-to-face claims on entitlement to biomedical services collide with enactments of discrimination at multiple levels, creating a space of contestation for social and material positioning as well as for physical well-being.

Objectives: To (a) determine marker positivity for renovascular damage in the total adult population of the Isle of Youth, Cuba; (b) describe marker association with common risk factors for renal and related chronic vascular conditions, and (c) identify best predictors of renovascular damage. Methods: Previous informed consent was obtained, the population studied was 55,646, and subjects were aged 6 20 years. Blood pressure, weight and height were measured and a questionnaire applied. Urine markers for renovascular damage (hematuria, proteinuria and microalbuminuria) were also determined. Results: Positive markers were detected in 21.3%: hematuria (12.6%), microalbuminuria (6.8%), proteinuria (0.9%), and proteinuria + hematuria (0.9%). Risk factors were highly prevalent: 15.1% were aged 6 60 years; 32.3% overweight, 13.9% obese, and 25.1% smokers. Prevalence of high blood pressure (30%), diabetes mellitus (5.4%) and cardiovascular disease (5%) was also high, while cerebrovascular disease registered 0.9%. Markers were more prevalent in older people and in those suffering from diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, overweight or obesity. Risk factor regression tree analysis identified hypertension as the best predictor of renovascular damage. Conclusions: Adult population-wide screening revealed hidden morbidity and permitted better risk stratification. Results serve to inform community-based multidisciplinary and intersectoral disease prevention and management. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

We aimed to use well-known criteria of good epidemiological practice to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Methods: A Medline and ScienceDirect literature search was performed to identify studies on ALS mortality published from 1971 to 2009. The literature was examined following 6 criteria. Results: Of the 29 studies examined, almost all presented a clear definition of the population at risk, but 55% of the papers did not report on the accuracy of death certificates, and the use of both 'underlying' and 'contributory' causes of death was identified in only 41% of cases. When comparing ALS mortality data between calendar dates, the codes from the International Classification of Diseases were consistent overall, except in 3 studies. A majority of articles that compared mortality patterns between geographical regions or ethnic groups discussed the key issues of comparability of health care and equality of access. Overall, among the 29 ALS mortality studies, only 3 complied with all the criteria. In 2 of them, the mortality rates were highly consistent with available incidence data. Conclusion: Only few studies on mortality data followed a high-quality methodology. When studies complied with the criteria, they showed good accuracy with regard to incidence rates. The criteria used in this study could also be used to guide future studies based on mortality data. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

In this paper, we (the malERA Consultative Group on Health Systems and Operational Research) focus on the health systems needs of the elimination phase of malaria eradication and consider groupings of countries at different stages along the pathway to elimination. We examine the difference between the last attempt at eradication of malaria and more recent initiatives, and consider the changing health system challenges as countries make progress towards elimination. We review recent technological and theoretical developments related to health systems and the renewed commitment to strengthening health systems for universal access and greater equity. Finally, we identify a number of needs for research and development, including tools for analyzing and improving effective coverage and strengthening decision making and discuss the relevance of these needs at all levels of the health system from the community to the international level.

It illustrates the complexities around collecting this information and also highlights the dangers of assuming that special educational needs (SENs) equate to disability. The parental survey revealed children with medical and mental health needs, but no SENs, who were unknown to schools. It also revealed children with a recorded SEN whose parents did not consider that they had a disability in line with the DDA definition. It identified a number of children whose disability leads to absences from school, making them vulnerable to underachievement. These findings highlight the importance of having appropriate tools with which to collect these data and developing procedures to support their effective use. We also draw attention to the contextual nature of children's difficulties and the importance of retaining and respecting the place of subjective information. This is central to adopting a definition of disability that hinges on experience or impact.

THE ENDURING CONFLICT OF oJOBS VERSUS THE ENVIRONMENTo: LOCAL POLLUTION HAVENS AS AN INTEGRATIVE EMPIRICAL MEASURE OF ECONOMY VERSUS ENVIRONMENT	SOCIOLOGICAL SPECTRUM			English	Article							TOXIC RELEASES; INEQUALITY; RACE; REGULATIONS; METROPOLITAN; QUALITY; AMERICA; HEALTH; INCOME	The ojobs versus the environmento dichotomy has been a recurring theme in the United States for decades. It is typically taken to refer to a choice or trade-off between economic growth and development and environmental quality or the lack of environmental degradation. Little resolution has occurred after decades of research because of inconsistent or problematic conceptualization and the use of inappropriate spatial units of analysis. Research on international and domestic pollution havens is reviewed in an effort to introduce the Local Pollution Havens concept. Local pollution havens are conceptualized as counties with high levels of pollution per unit of economic reward, high toxicity per unit of economic reward, and low regulation or other social controls. Traditional and spatial statistical techniques are utilized to construct this measure and determine which counties fit the conceptualization. Descriptive statistics and the results of t-tests and logistic regression analyses are presented to demonstrate how these areas differ from other counties. Implications for the remediation of these areas and also avenues of future research are offered.

J	Wiesing, U				Wiesing, Urban			Should Performance-Enhancing Drugs in Sport be Legalized under Medical Supervision?	SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Review								This review examines the question of whether performance-enhancing drugs should be permitted in sport under the control of physicians, and evaluates the expected outcomes of such a scenario. Such a change in regulation would need to be tightly controlled because of the risks involved. The results of legalizing performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sport would be either unhelpful or negative, and the unwanted aspects of doping control would not disappear. Athletes, including children and adolescents who wanted to pursue competitive sports, would be forced to take additional, avoidable health risks. The 'natural lottery' of athletic talents would be compensated for only partially by use of performance-enhancing agents. It would also be complemented by another 'natural lottery' of variable responses to doping measures, combined with the inventiveness of doping doctors. There would be no gain in 'justice' (i.e. fairer results that reflected efforts made) for athletes as a result of legalizing doping. Legalization would not reduce restrictions on athletes' freedom; the control effort would remain the same, if not increased. Extremely complicated international regulations would have to be adopted. The game of the 'tortoise and the hare' between doping athletes and inspectors would remain because prohibited but not identifiable practices could still provide additional benefits from use of permissible drugs. Audience mistrust, particularly toward athletes who achieved outstanding feats, would remain because it would still be possible that these athletes were reliant on illegal doping practices. Doping entails exposing the athletes to avoidable risks that do not need to be taken to increase the appeal of a sport. Most importantly, the function of sport as a role model would definitely be damaged. It is not necessary to clarify the question of what constitutes the 'spirit of sport' and whether this may be changed. From a practical point of view, a legalization of performance-enhancing drugs in sport should not be considered for the simple reason that it has no advantages but many disadvantages.

THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY			English	Article								This article examines an urban centre in the heart of the First World through a critical development lens. It contends that traits of the Third World entail certain characteristics which remain consequential as axes of analysis for a variety of economic, political and geographic settings, including new applications in contexts that are typically excluded from the focus of international development practice and scholarship. The article discusses characteristics of 'third worldality' in relation to Washington DC. It posits that, despite being emblematic as a power centre, the city exhibits many of the characteristics of a Third World city. Highlighting disenfranchisement, socioeconomic inequality, and environmental health issues, the article reveals a paradox: underdevelopment in the heart of the 'developed' world. The article calls for greater recognition of the paradoxes of development theory and practice so as to confront persistent problems of orientalism and lack of self-reflexivity in the field of international development.

Relevance of Gender-Sensitive Policies and General Health Indicators to Compare the Status of South Asian Women's Health	WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES			English	Article							EQUITY	Background: Despite goals for gender equity in South Asia, the relationship between gender-sensitive policies and the empowerment of women is complex and requires an analysis of how policies align with a broad set of social, cultural, political, and economic indicators that relate to women's health. Methods: Through a review of four documents under the umbrella of the World Health Organization and the United Nations, a list of 17 gender-sensitive policy and 17 general health indicators was generated with a focus on health, education, economic, and political empowerment and violence against women. A series of policy documents and international and national databases that are accessible in the public domain were the major tools used to find supporting documentation to address women's health outcomes in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Results: All five South Asian countries had several gender-sensitive policies that were measurable by indicators that contribute to health. Examination of political and economic status, birth sex ratios, human trafficking, illiteracy rates, maternal mortality rates, contraception prevalence, fertility rates, knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention, access to skilled birth attendants, and microfinance show that large gender inequities still prevail despite the presence of gender-sensitive policies. Conclusion: In many cases, the presence of gender-sensitive policies did not reflect the realization of gender equity over a wide range of indicators. Although the economic, political, social, and cultural climates of the five countries may differ, the integration of women's needs into the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of policies is a universal necessity to achieve positive outcomes.

J	Dent, THS				Dent, T. H. S.			Predicting the risk of coronary heart disease I. The use of conventional risk markers	ATHEROSCLEROSIS			English	Review						Coronary heart disease; Risk prediction; Conventional risk factors; Novel biomarkers; Genetics	C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; GLOBAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; PRIMARY PREVENTION; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; SHEFFIELD TABLE; SCORE; VALIDATION; FRAMINGHAM; ACCURACY; DERIVATION	This is the first of two articles reviewing recent findings about the risk of coronary heart disease. This paper is concerned with conventional risk factors; the second will review novel molecular biomarkers, genetic markers of risk and the future of risk prediction. Predicting exactly the future occurrence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is not possible, but the risk can be estimated with models based on cohort studies. Most existing models are based on long-standing research on the residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. The findings from Framingham yield inaccurate results when applied to contemporary populations elsewhere. In particular, they may exacerbate health inequalities. This is because the incidence of and mortality from CHD have fallen recently, the Framingham cohort differs from many groups to which findings from it have been applied, important risk factors such as ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation and family history are absent from the Framingham equations and susceptibility to risk factors varies between populations. Attempts to recalibrate or adjust the Framingham equations to improve their performance have not been shown to overcome these problems. SCORE, QRISK, PROCAM and ASSIGN are risk prediction models that have been developed based on different cohorts. The group developing NICE's guideline on lipid modification was uncertain about which risk prediction model to recommend for use in the NHS. Eventually they selected a modified version of the Framingham equation. However, QRISK appears to offer the best long-term promise. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Venture capital on a shoestring: Bioventures' pioneering life sciences fund in South Africa	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								Background: Since 2000, R&D financing for global health has increased significantly, with innovative proposals for further increases. However, although venture capital (VC) funding has fostered life sciences businesses across the developed world, its application in the developing world and particularly in Africa is relatively new. Is VC feasible in the African context, to foster the development and application of local health innovation? As the most industrially advanced African nation, South Africa serves as a test case for life sciences venture funding. This paper analyzes Bioventures, the first VC company focused on life sciences investment in sub-Saharan Africa. The case study method was used to analyze the formation, operation, and investment support of Bioventures, and to suggest lessons for future health venture funds in Africa that aim to develop health-oriented innovations. Discussion: The modest financial success of Bioventures in challenging circumstances has demonstrated a proof of concept that life sciences VC can work in the region. Beyond providing funds, support given to investees included board participation, contacts, and strategic services. Bioventures had to be proactive in finding and supporting good health R&D. Due to the fund's small size, overhead and management expenses were tightly constrained. Bioventures was at times unable to make follow-on investments, being forced instead to give up equity to raise additional capital, and to sell health investments earlier than might have been optimal. With the benefit of hindsight, the CFO of Bioventures felt that partnering with a larger fund might benefit similar future funds. Being better linked to market intelligence and other entrepreneurial investors was also seen as an unmet need. Summary: BioVentures has learned lessons about how the traditional VC model might evolve to tackle health challenges facing Africa, including how to raise funds and educate investors; how to select, value, and support investments; and how to understand the balance between financial and social returns. The experience of the fund suggests that future health funds targeting ailments of the poor might require investors that accept health benefits as part of their overall "return." Learning from Bioventures may help develop health innovation funding for sub-Saharan African that has combined health, financial, and economic development impacts.

J	Mendis, S				Mendis, Shanthi			The policy agenda for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases	BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN			English	Article						non-communicable diseases; policies; evidence; public sector; prevention; inequalities	MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; PUBLIC-HEALTH POLICY; TRANS-FATTY-ACIDS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; NUTRITION TRANSITION; DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES; INEQUALITIES; CARE; IMPLEMENTATION; INTERVENTIONS	Robust national policies and strategies developed and owned by national authorities are fundamental for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The objective of this paper is to address broad policy areas in respect of NCD prevention and control from a public health perspective, with a special focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The paper is a condensation of current World Health Organization (WHO) reports in this field supported by relevant literature obtained from a Medline search for the period 2000-2010. There is a strong evidence base that underpins the NCD policy agenda. National NCD policies can make a substantive impact on public health in LMIC if they are geared to addressing primary prevention and equity of health systems. National NCD policies help to catalyse, and coherently integrate regulatory, legislative and multisectoral actions across health and other health relevant sectors. Such multisectoral action is integral for creation of conducive environments to support healthy behaviours. There is agreement that health systems need reconfiguration to ensure equitable access to essential NCD interventions. Although the magnitude of the NCD burden is high and is growing in LMIC, international development assistance to address the burden remains negligible. How exactly gaps in formulation, and implementation of NCD policies can be addressed when there are severe limitations in human resource capacity, financial resources and competing health priorities in LMIC is not clear. Context-specific research is required to address implementation gaps in NCD policy, as policy development and implementation are driven by political realities and cultural specificities. Research is also needed to develop innovative approaches for revenue generation for prevention and control of NCDs.

While largely successful in the lowest income countries, we argue that this approach could lead to significant inefficiencies from the standpoint of justice if applied to middle-income countries, where income inequalities are large and lead to national averages that obscure truly needy populations. Instead, we suggest alternative indicators more sensitive to social justice concerns that merit consideration by policy-makers developing new initiatives to redress health inequities in middle-income countries.

J	Brisbois, BW; Ali, SH				Brisbois, Ben W.; Ali, S. Harris			Climate Change, Vector-borne Disease and Interdisciplinary Research: Social Science Perspectives on an Environment and Health Controversy	ECOHEALTH			English	Article						climate change; vector-borne disease; frame; interdisciplinary; scale; equity	EMERGING INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; EAST-AFRICAN HIGHLANDS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; GLOBAL HEALTH; POPULATION HEALTH; MALARIA; POLICY; FUTURE; CHALLENGES; RISK	Over the last two decades, the science of climate change's theoretical impacts on vector-borne disease has generated controversy related to its methodological validity and relevance to disease control policy. Critical social science analysis, drawing on science and technology studies and the sociology of social movements, demonstrates consistency between this controversy and the theory that climate change is serving as a collective action frame for some health researchers. Within this frame, vector-borne disease data are interpreted as a symptom of climate change, with the need for further interdisiplinary research put forth as the logical and necessary next step. Reaction to this tendency on the part of a handful of vector-borne disease specialists exhibits characteristics of academic boundary work aimed at preserving the integrity of existing disciplinary boundaries. Possible reasons for this conflict include the leadership role for health professionals and disciplines in the envisioned interdiscipline, and disagreements over the appropriate scale of interventions to control vector-borne diseases. Analysis of the competing frames in this controversy also allows identification of excluded voices and themes, such as international political economic explanations for the health problems in question. A logical conclusion of this analysis, therefore, is the need for critical reflection on environment and health research and policy to achieve integration with considerations of global health equity.

ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Educational economics; Input output analysis	ATTAINMENT; HEALTH; INCOME; RESOURCES; SCHOOLS; GROWTH	This paper measures and decomposes socioeconomic-related inequality in mathematics achievement in 15 European Union member states. Data is taken from the 2003 wave of the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). There is socioeconomic-related inequality in mathematics achievement, favoring the higher socioeconomic groups in each country. There are important differences among countries. The inequality is higher in Germany, Greece, Great Britain, Belgium, and Portugal and is lower in Sweden and Finland. Socioeconomic factors represent between 14.9% and 34.6% of the overall inequality in education. The decomposition exercises add important insights for policy. Despite the differences. EU-15 member states can be categorized into two main groups. The first includes the Nordic countries plus Great Britain, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Greece, where socioeconomic-related inequality appears to be explained mainly by the students' background characteristics. In Portugal and, to a lesser extent, in Spain the high contribution of socioeconomic background is mainly due to the prevalence of high socioeconomic inequality and socioeconomic concentration of educational resources. The second group includes Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, and France. In these countries, the high impact of schools' composition on individual achievement is the main driver of the studied inequality. Differences between countries are also explored.

The aim of this article is to describe the pattern of gender differences in expected years with and without activity limitations across 25 EU countries and to explore the association between gender differences and macro-level factors. We applied to the Eurostat life table's data from the Statistics of Income and Living Conditions Survey to estimate gender differences in life expectancy with and without activity limitations at age 50 for 2005. We studied the relationship between the gender differences and structural indicators using meta-regression techniques. Differences in years with activity limitations between genders were associated with the life expectancy (LE) and the size of the gender difference in LE. Gender difference in years with activity limitations were larger as the gross domestic product, the expenditure on elderly care and the indicator of life-long learning decreased, and as the inequality in income distribution increased. There was evidence of disparity in the associations between the more established EU countries (EU15) and the newer EU10 countries. Among the EU15, gender differences were positively associated with income inequality, the proportion of the population with a low education and the men's mean exit age from labour force. Among the EU10, inequalities were smaller with increasing expenditure in elderly care, with decreasing poverty risk and with decreasing employment rate of older people. The association between structural indicators and the gender gap in years with activity limitations suggests that gender differences can be reduced.

J	Deckers, J				Deckers, Jan			Should the consumption of farmed animal products be restricted, and if so, by how much?	FOOD POLICY			English	Article						Animal products; Climate change; Diet; Ecological footprint; Ethics	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT; FOOD; SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; JUSTICE; HEALTH; COSTS	Recent studies have proposed that the consumption of farmed animal products must be curtailed to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This paper argues that a careful assessment of the different emissions produced by different actual and potential diets is needed to evaluate whether or not restricting the consumption of farmed animal products could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and if so, by how much. It is also argued that the question of whether or not the consumption of farmed animal products should be restricted must be addressed in the light of information derived from various sustainability indicators, rather than on the basis of a narrow focus on greenhouse gas emissions. A case study from the UK is used to develop a broader understanding of how dietary modifications might reduce a range of problems associated with the consumption of farmed animal products. It is argued that even more comprehensive studies of the different Global Health Impacts (GHIs) are needed to assess the merits and demerits associated with the consumption of farmed animal products.

SESPAS report 2010	GACETA SANITARIA			English	Article						Globalization; Labour markets; Policy; Health inequalities; Social determinants of health	OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; PRECARIOUS EMPLOYMENT; WORK DISORGANIZATION; CONSEQUENCES; DETERMINANTS; EXPANSION	Since the nineteen seventies, high- and low-income countries have undergone a pattern of transnational economic and cultural integration known as globalization. The weight of the available evidence suggests that the effects of globalization on labor markets have increased economic inequality and various forms of economic insecurity that negatively affect workers' health. Research on the relation between labor markets and health is hampered by the social invisibility of many of these health inequalities. Empirical evidence of the impact of employment relations on health inequalities is scarce for low-income countries, small firms, rural settings, and sectors of the economy in which "informality" is widespread. Information is also scarce on the effectiveness of labor market interventions in reducing health inequalities. This pattern is likely to continue in the future unless governments adopt active labor market policies. Such policies include creating jobs through state intervention, regulating the labor market to protect employment, supporting unions, and ensuring occupational safety and health standards.

J	Schensul, JJ				Schensul, Jean J.			2010 Malinowski Award <i>Engaged Universities, Community Based Research Organizations and Third Sector Science in a Global System</i>	HUMAN ORGANIZATION			English	Article						action research; science; community engagement; community based research; technology	BUILDING COMMUNITY CAPACITY; IVORY TOWER; SYSTEMS; PRAXIS	Over the past three decades, since the civil rights era of the late 1960s and 70s, public science funding has shifted to support for military and industrial purposes and the health science. Most universities are now heavily subsidized through private sources, shifting the emphasis in research away form civic society engagement. Engaged scholarship and research conducted by, with and for communities are approaches that together have the potential to reinstate and emphasis on public scholarship that address structural inequities and social, health and cultural disparities. This paper argues that among various approaches to engaged social science, Action Research, endorsed by four generation of anthropologists in the United States, Canada and Latin America has the greatest potential to create knowledge that can be used to address social injustices at the local, national and international levels. Subsuming Action Research conducted by university centers, community based research organizations and other community partners under the rubric of Third Sector Science, the paper links third sector anthropologists with other national and global movements promoting action research to transform the nature of science and scientific knowledge production. It concludes with suggestions for new science and communication technology that can link people in communities with global social movements and the construction of new knowledge "from the ground up."

Beyond accuracy: creating a comprehensive evidence base for tuberculosis diagnostic tools	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Review						impact; evidence; tuberculosis; policy; diagnostics	SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; QUALITY; GRADE; RECOMMENDATIONS; DISTRICT; MALAWI; SPUTUM; TB; MICROSCOPY	The need for a strong and comprehensive evidence base to support decision making with regard to the implementation of new and improved diagnostic tools and approaches has been highlighted by a number of stakeholders; these include members of the New Diagnostics Working Group (NDWG) and the Subgroup for Introducing New Approaches and Tools of the Stop TB Partnership. To compile such evidence in a systematic manner, we have developed an impact assessment framework (IAF) which links evidence on inputs to outcomes. The IAF comprises five interconnected layers: effectiveness analysis, equity analysis, health systems analysis, scale-up analysis and policy analysis. It can be used by new diagnostics developers and other interested research teams to collect as much policy-relevant data as possible prior to, during and after the demonstration phase of tool development. The evidence collated may be used by international and national policy makers to support adoption, implementation and scale-up decisions. The TREAT TB (Technology, Research, Education and Technical Assistance for TB) initiative uses the IAF in its operational research and field evaluations of new tools and approaches for TB diagnosis. It has also been incorporated into the NDWG's recent publication: 'Pathways to better diagnostics for tuberculosis: a blueprint for the development of TB diagnostics'. This article describes the IAF and the process of improving it and suggests next steps in overcoming the challenges in its implementation.

J	Stephenson, R				Stephenson, Rob			Community-Level Gender Equity and Extramarital Sexual Risk-Taking Among Married Men in Eight African Countries	INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Article							SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; HIV; AIDS; PREVALENCE; PARTNERS; NIGERIA; ABSTINENCE; PREVENTION; CONTEXT; MALAWI	CONTEXT: In many parts of Africa, women are most likely to become infected with HIV by having unprotected sex with their husbands, who may have acquired the virus through extramarital sex. However, the ways in which aspects of community environments particularly those related to gender equity-shape men's extramarital sexual risk-taking are not well understood. METHODS: Demographic and Health Survey data from eight African countries (Chad, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) were used to examine associations between married men's engaging in risky extramarital sex (i.e., having had both unprotected sex and extramarital sex) and indicators of gender equity and other community characteristics. Separate multilevel logistic regression models that incorporated individual, household and community measures were created for each country. RESULTS: In five countries, men who lived in communities with more equal ratios of women to men with at least a primary education were less likely to report risky extramarital sexual activity (odds ratios, 0.4-0.6).A similar relationship was found in four countries for the ratio of women to men who were employed (0.4-0.5). In three countries, men who lived in communities with more conservative attitudes toward wife-beating or male decision making had elevated odds of extramarital sexual risk-taking (1.1-1.5). CONCLUSIONS: While HIV prevention programs should focus on reducing gender inequities, they also need to recognize the conservative cultural factors that influence the formation of men's masculine identities and, in turn, affect their sexual behavior.

J	Dorsen, C				Dorsen, Caroline			Vulnerability in homeless adolescents: concept analysis	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						adolescents; concept analysis; homeless; nursing; risk; vulnerability	HIV-RISK BEHAVIORS; HEALTH DISPARITIES; YOUTH; CARE; POPULATIONS; EXPERIENCES; RUNAWAY; WASHINGTON; SEATTLE; NEEDS	P>Aim. This paper is a report of an analysis of the concept of vulnerability in homeless adolescents. Background. Caring for vulnerable populations and reduction of health inequities are top international healthcare priorities. Homeless adolescents experience health disparities as compared to their housed counterparts and are among the most vulnerable of all populations. Understanding the concept of vulnerability as it relates to the homeless adolescent population will assist nurses in addressing the health and social concerns of this population. Data sources. The PubMed, Medline, Cochrane and CINAHL electronic databases were used to search for research papers published between 1980 and 2009. The keywords 'vulnerable', 'vulnerability' and 'homeless', 'adolescent', 'street' and 'youth' were used. Twenty-three papers from multiple disciplines were reviewed in an effort to arrive at a global definition of homeless adolescents' vulnerability. Method. Rodgers' evolutionary method of concept analysis was used for the analysis. Results. Based on this analysis, vulnerability in homeless adolescents is defined as the constellation of past, present and future risk, perceived or real, because of the common human experience of risk, the increased vulnerability of the adolescent period, the consequences of family disruption, and the increased risks of life on the street. Conclusion. There was agreement in the literature regarding the antecedents, attributes, consequences and surrogate terms of the concept. However, differentiation between the concepts of risk and vulnerability, as suggested by seminal nurse researchers, was not supported. More research is needed into self-perceptions of vulnerability and vulnerability in subgroups of homeless adolescents.

The authors empirically assess the influence of social policies (indicated by social spending and welfare regime variables) on homegrown terrorism for fifteen Western European countries during the 1980-2003 period. The authors find that higher social spending in certain fields (health, unemployment benefits, and active labor market programs) is associated with a significant reduction in homegrown terrorism, while spending in other fields (e. g., public housing) is not. Moderate evidence furthermore indicates that the different worlds of welfare capitalism differently affect homeland terrorism. Social democratic welfare regimes that create low levels of market dependence are on average less prone to domestic terrorist activity. The findings suggest that homegrown terrorism in Western Europe may also be fought by higher spending in certain fields and more generous welfare regimes.

Review task groups were given just 3 months to make preliminary evidence-based recommendations. In this paper, we describe the methodology used, and the recommendations made, by the group tasked with inequalities in priority public health conditions. Methods A series of rapid literature reviews of the policy-relevant international evidence base was undertaken. Quantitative studies of any design, which looked at the effects on health inequalities, the social gradient or overall population health effects, of interventions designed to address the social determinants of selected public health priority conditions were examined. Recommendations were distilled using a Delphi approach. Results Five key policy proposals were made: reduce smoking in the most deprived groups; improve availability of and access to healthier food choices amongst low income groups; improve the early detection and treatment of diseases; introduce a minimum price per unit for alcohol and improve the links between physical and mental health care. Conclusion The combination of rapid review and Delphi distillation produced a shortlist of evidence-based recommendations within the allocated time frame. There was a dearth of robust evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the interventions we examined: our proposals had to be based on extrapolation from general population health effects. Extensive, specific and robust evidence is urgently needed to guide policy and programmes. In the meantime, our methodology provides a reasonably sound and pragmatic basis for evidence-based policy-making.

Factors contributing to neonatal mortality rates in Macao: Evidence from 1957-2006 data	NURSING & HEALTH SCIENCES			English	Article						health resources; neonatal mortality rate; socioeconomic instability	INFANT-MORTALITY; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; INCOME INEQUALITY; RISK-FACTORS; HEALTH; COUNTRIES; SERVICES; TRENDS; DEATH	The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and demographic changes, economic instability, and health resource availability in Macao. A retrospective design was used, where yearly data from Macao were collected for the period of 1957-2006. The NMR was the dependent variable and the demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and health resources were the three main explanatory variables. The results showed that higher unemployment rates, higher levels of educated women, and a greater supply of nurses are associated with a lower NMR. The results also indicated that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are at a significantly higher risk of neonatal mortality. In contrast, increasing the number of nurses in health care significantly reduces the risk of neonatal mortality. Further international evidence suggested that greater efforts should be directed towards removing the barriers that impede access to health-care services and increasing preventive care for disadvantaged populations, particularly during economic downturns.

The purpose of the study was to understand community perceptions of maternity services. This article highlights the activities that the research team carried out during each phase of the research process, and how they established team identity, team trust, and team efficacy. This research has created a platform for new avenues for health providers and community to partner to improve maternal-newborn care. Community-based participatory research is one way forward to address the past and present inequities constitutive of global health disparities.

J	Dixon, D; Pollard, B; Rowley, D; Johnson, M				Dixon, Diane; Pollard, Beth; Rowley, David; Johnson, Marie			Application of the ICF to referral delay in total joint arthroplasty	QUALITY & SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article							CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; TOTAL HIP; KNEE REPLACEMENT; PRIORITY; OSTEOARTHRITIS; INSTRUMENTS; EQUITY; SF-36; WOMAC	Background The factors that affect referral for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) have been widely studied. Implicit in this work is the assumption that patient health status should determine priority for surgery. However, specification of patient health status lacks a strong theoretical framework. This study employs the WHO model of health outcomes, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), to examine patient health factors in the referral process for TJA. Methods Within 8 weeks prior to TJA, 260 patients electing for primary TJA completed a questionnaire which measured the ICF (impairment, activity limitations and participation restrictions) and four types of delay in their journey from initial consultation with their primary care physician to surgery. Results Impairment did not affect any stage of the referral process. In contrast, patients who had experienced a delay of 26 weeks or less between referral to a surgeon and being placed on the waiting list for surgery reported greater activity limitations and participation restrictions than patients who had waited more than 26 weeks. Further, patients who reported having wanted surgery for more than 52 weeks reported greater participation restrictions than patients who had wanted surgery for less than 52 weeks. Conclusions The ICF identifies three health outcomes, two of which (activity limitations and participation restrictions) are related to delay in the referral process for TJA. The ICF is a useful theoretical framework for the study of factors that influence prioritisation for surgery. The level of functional and social disability appears to inform prioritisation for TJA by consultant orthopaedic surgeons.

J	Lagos, G; Blanco, E				Lagos, Gustavo; Blanco, Edgar			Mining and development in the region of Antofagasta	RESOURCES POLICY			English	Article						Antofagasta; Chilean mining; Mining development	ARSENIC EXPOSURE	The objective of this paper is to analyse the effect of mining on economic and social development in the region of Antofagasta from 1985 to 2008. Analysis of development is restricted to spheres described by available indicators used by several international and non-governmental organizations such as income distribution, education, health, poverty, human development and security, satisfaction, cost of living, income per capita, GDP per capita, employment, productive activity, added value and its distribution. Correlation between some of these variables is estimated as well as the gap between these indicators and those of developed countries. The region has advanced towards development since the 1990s, especially on what concerns economic indicators such as income per capita and income distribution where it ranks ahead from the rest of Chile and close to some developed countries. However, it is still far behind in some of the key social indicators such as quality of education and health, access to health services, life expectancy and large differences in the quality of life within the region. The hypothesis proposed in this paper is that the coexistence of high income levels and inequalities in the region is not a result of insufficient resources but of a lack of commitment to development by the main regional stakeholders.

Declaration of such a victory for the Cambodian case is premature, however, given that HIV prevalence continues to rise among women and, according to Cambodian health officials, another wave of epidemic could occur soon. This study discusses how the implementation of neoliberal economic policies without counterbalancing social policy measures undermines the sustainability and effectiveness of such short-term measures by creating a risky environment for the epidemic. Trade liberalization policies have exacerbated poverty, mobility, and gender inequality, making women more susceptible and vulnerable to HIV/AIDS.

J	McTavish, S; Moore, S; Harper, S; Lynch, J				McTavish, Sarah; Moore, Spencer; Harper, Sam; Lynch, John			National female literacy, individual socio-economic status, and maternal health care use in sub-Saharan Africa	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Maternal health; Child health; Socio-economic status; Female literacy; Social inequality; Sub-Saharan Africa	LESS-DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES; WOMENS STATUS; MORTALITY; POOR; DETERMINANTS; PATTERNS	The United Nations Millennium Development Goals have identified improving women's access to maternal health care as a key target in reducing maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA). Although individual factors such as income and urban residence can affect maternal health care use, little is known about national-level factors associated with use. Yet, such knowledge may highlight the importance of global and national policies in improving use. This study examines the importance of national female literacy on women's maternal health care use in continental sSA. Data that come from the 2002-2003 World Health Survey. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the association between national female literacy and individual's non-use of maternal health care, while adjusting for individual-level factors and national economic development. Analyses also assessed effect modification of the association between income and non-use by female literacy. Effect modification was evaluated with the likelihood ratio test (G(2)). We found that within countries, individual age, education, urban residence and household income were associated with lack of maternal health care. National female literacy modified the association of household income with lack of maternal health care use. The strength of the association between income and lack of maternal health care was weaker in countries with higher female literacy. We conclude therefore that higher national levels of female literacy may reduce income-related inequalities in use through a range of possible mechanisms, including women's increased labour participation and higher status in society. National policies that are able to address female literacy and women's status in sub-Saharan Africa may help reduce income-related inequalities in maternal health care use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Crane, J				Crane, Johanna			Adverse events and placebo effects: African scientists, HIV, and ethics in the 'global health sciences'	SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE			English	Article						Africa; ethics; HIV; postcolonial technoscience	SINGLE-DOSE NEVIRAPINE; HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS; RESEARCH BIOETHICS; RESEARCH CAPACITY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; UGANDAN CONTEXT; PREVENTION	This paper builds on the growing literature in 'postcolonial technoscience' by examining how science and ethics travel in transnational HIV research. I use examples of two controversial US-funded studies of mother-to-child transmission in Africa as case studies through which to explore quandaries of difference and inequality in global health research. My aim is not to adjudicate the debates over these studies, but rather to raise some questions about transnational research, science, and ethics that often get lost in public controversies over the moral status of such trials. Using interviews conducted with American and Ugandan HIV researchers as well as relevant material published in the popular and medical press, I argue that debates over research practice and the conditions under which practices are deemed ethically legitimate or questionable reflect the challenges faced by African researchers seeking to participate in global health science. In doing so, I show how questions of scientific legitimacy and authority are played out in debates over who decides what constitutes 'the normal' in human biological research and who can legitimately 'speak for Africa' regarding the ethics of research design and practice. I conclude that researchers from 'resource-poor settings' must often walk a tightrope between claims of difference from the global North and assertions of sameness, in which a claim too forceful in either direction can undermine the ethical - and thus scientific - legitimacy of their research.

One such practise is biomedical research. This paper looks at contemporary U.S. biomedical research in particular and argues that it suffers from important epistemic, moral and socio-economic failings. It then discusses and criticises existing approaches to improve on the status quo, most prominently by Thomas Pogge (a political philosopher), Joseph Stiglitz (a Nobel-prize winning economist) and James Robert Brown (a philosopher of science). Finally, it sketches an alternative proposal and argues for its superiority. The proposal has four components: changing the intellectual property regime; instituting independent clinical research; aligning innovators' and patients' interests; and enacting additional regulation.

Targeting accuracy and impact of a community-identified waiver card scheme for primary care user fees in Afghanistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article							LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES; HEALTH-INSURANCE; IMPROVING ACCESS; CAMBODIA; POOR; SERVICE; EQUITY; EXEMPTIONS; SELECTION; POLICIES	Background: User fees are a known common barrier to using health services, particularly among the poor. When fees are present, many facilities have waiver systems for poor patients to exempt them from paying. Targeting waivers to patients who need them most has been a challenge, especially in fragile states, where relevant data are limited and trust in institutions is low. Methods: Community-based targeting of vulnerable households was piloted in Afghanistan and evaluated for its feasibility, accuracy and effect on care-seeking. Waiver cards were distributed to very poor and female-headed households in catchment areas of 26 facilities in 10 provinces of Afghanistan in 2005 as one component of a larger health financing study. Households were nominated by community leaders using general guidelines to support 15% of the poorest members. In most cases, waiver cards were pro-actively distributed to them. Targeting accuracy, perceptions, as well the cards' effects on utilization were evaluated in 2007 through household surveys, health facility data, and in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with facility staff and community leaders. Results: The waiver system was implemented quickly at all but one facility charging fees. Facility staff and community leaders reported favorable perceptions of implementation and targeting accuracy. However, an analysis of the asset index of beneficiaries indicated that although targeting was progressive, significant leakage and high levels of under-coverage occurred; 42% of cards were used by people in the wealthiest three quintiles, and only 19% of people in the poorest quintile received a card. Households with waiver cards reported higher rates of care-seeking for recent illnesses compared to those without cards (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Community identification of beneficiaries is feasible in a fragile state. Several recommendations are discussed to improve targeting accuracy of a waiver card system in the future, in light of this research and other international experiences.				lsteinha@jhsph.edu	Carmena, David/S-4049-2019	Peters, David/0000-0001-8377-3444					52	5	5	0	4	BIOMED CENTRAL LTD	LONDON	236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND	1475-9276			INT J EQUITY HEALTH	Int.

J	Johnston, R; Crooks, VA; Snyder, J; Kingsbury, P				Johnston, Rory; Crooks, Valorie A.; Snyder, Jeremy; Kingsbury, Paul			What is known about the effects of medical tourism in destination and departure countries? A scoping review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Review							HEALTH-SERVICES; TRADE; BORDERS; CARE; IMPACT; TRAVEL	Background: Medical tourism involves patients intentionally leaving their home country to access non-emergency health care services abroad. Growth in the popularity of this practice has resulted in a significant amount of attention being given to it from researchers, policy-makers, and the media. Yet, there has been little effort to systematically synthesize what is known about the effects of this phenomenon. This article presents the findings of a scoping review examining what is known about the effects of medical tourism in destination and departure countries. Methods: Drawing on academic articles, grey literature, and media sources extracted from 18 databases, we follow a widely used scoping review protocol to synthesize what is known about the effects of medical tourism in destination and departure countries. The review design has three main stages: (1) identifying the question and relevant literature; (2) selecting the literature; and (3) charting, collating, and summarizing the data. Results: The large majority of the 203 sources accepted into the review offer a perspective of medical tourism from the Global North, focusing on the flow of patients from high income nations to lower and middle income countries. This greatly shapes any discussion of the effects of medical tourism on destination and departure countries. Five interrelated themes that characterize existing discussion of the effects of this practice were extracted from the reviewed sources. These themes frame medical tourism as a: (1) user of public resources; (2) solution to health system problems; (3) revenue generating industry; (4) standard of care; and (5) source of inequity. It is observed that what is currently known about the effects of medical tourism is minimal, unreliable, geographically restricted and mostly based on speculation. Conclusions: Given its positive and negative effects on the health care systems of departure and destination countries, medical tourism is a highly significant and contested phenomenon. This is especially true given its potential to serve as a powerful force for the inequitable delivery of health care services globally. It is recommended that empirical evidence and other data associated with medical tourism be subjected to clear and coherent definitions, including reports focused on the flows of medical tourists and surgery success rates. Additional primary research on the effects of medical tourism is needed if the industry is to develop in a manner that is beneficial to citizens of both departure and destination countries.

Tools for Thoughtful Action: The Role of Ecosystem Approaches to Health in Enhancing Public Health	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article						Environment; public health; determinants; community participation; social environment; gender identity	DENGUE; MERCURY	The intimate interdependence of human health and the ecosystems in which we are embedded is now a commonplace observation. For much of the history of public health, this was not so obvious. After over a century of focus on diseases, their biologic causes and the correction of exposures (clean water and air) and facilitation of responses (immunizations and nutrition), public health discourse shifted to embrace the concept of determinants of health as extending to social, economic and environmental realms. This moved the discourse and science of public health into an unprecedented level of complexity just as public concern about the environment heightened. To address multifactorial, dynamic impacts on health, a new paradigm was needed which would overcome the separation of humans and ecosystems. Ecosystem approaches to health arose in the 1990s from a rich background of intellectual ferment as Canada wrestled with diverse problems ranging from Great Lakes contamination to zoonotic diseases. Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) played a lead role in supporting an international community of scientists and scholars who advanced ecosystem approaches to health. These collective efforts have enabled a shift to a research paradigm that embraces transdisciplinarity, social justice, gender equity, multi-stakeholder participation and sustainability.

This paper contributes to filling a gap in the literature by assessing the impact of internal migration on household well-being. The study draws on the Albania Living Standards Measurement Survey of 2005, with a focus on migrant households oversampled in pen-urban Tirana, who are compared with nonmigrant rural households. Various statistical procedures are used, yielding the following results: Income improves through migration but consumption does not because of higher living costs. Moreover, migrant households in pen-urban Tirana live in poor dwelling conditions, are employed in irregular and unstable jobs, and experience health problems, especially in the early years of migration.

A framework for identifying similarities among countries to improve cross-national comparisons of health systems	HEALTH & PLACE			English	Article						World heath; Health care evaluation; Cluster analysis; Principal component analysis	INEQUALITIES; PERFORMANCE; MORTALITY	Cross-national research on health system performance can yield important findings for public policy purposes. We seek to further this research by examining the problem of selection bias, an important methodological issue that investigators initially should consider. Because of the logistical difficulties and enormous expense involved in collecting voluminous data from many countries, researchers often must rely on information contained in data sets of international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Under the circumstances, the comparisons that researchers can make will depend to a great extent on the availability and richness of data for certain measures. This situation raises the potential for selection or experimenter bias. We use multivariate statistics to group countries with similar characteristics, an approach that we believe will mitigate the problem. We perform a cluster analysis of 186 countries using principal components derived from 7 demographic variables and 27 mortality and burden of disease variables. Our analysis produced six clusters that we believe represent suitable groupings for comparative purposes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: In this survey, 1029 women aged from 15 to 69 years, living in rural Xinjiang and Anhui provinces, and married, answered a questionnaire designed to collect information on their demographic characteristics, reproductive history (number of pregnancies, level of prenatal care, and mode and place of delivery), and beliefs regarding gender equity. We quantified "belief in gender equity" based on responses to 7 specific statements and graded the responses according to a system scoring the strength of the overall belief (a total score >= 19, strong; 15-18, moderate; and <= 14, weak). Results: Only 34.3% of the women demonstrated strong convictions about gender equity. Even after adjusting for education and ethnicity, the percentage of women who received consistent prenatal care and were delivered at a maternity facility was highest among those scoring 19 or higher, and the reverse was true for women scoring 14 or less. Conclusion: Overall, women in China's rural Xinjiang and Anhui provinces do not hold strong convictions about gender equity. There was a positive correlation between belief in gender equity and use of prenatal and delivery care. (C) 2010 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

J	LaMontagne, B; Stockemer, D				LaMontagne, Bernadette; Stockemer, Daniel			Determinants of HIV prevalence: A global perspective	INTERNATIONAL POLITICS			English	Article						HIV/AIDS; income inequality; Muslim population; contraceptive use	MALE CIRCUMCISION; HIV/AIDS; RISK; AIDS; TRANSMISSION; ACQUISITION; COHORT	Slightly over 25 years since the identification of the virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic has killed millions of people and has expanded to become one of the greatest dangers in the world, threatening individuals, economies, communities and states. To better understand the factors underlying the wide discrepancies in HIV rates across countries, and to better prioritize interventions in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, it is imperative to build sound models that help to identify determinants of worldwide HIV prevalence. While scholars of various disciplines such as political science, anthropology and health studies have engaged in this endeavor, these studies have found divergent results. Seeking to construct a viable model, this current study examines nine theory-informed variables - income inequality, regime type, gender equality, GDP per capita (PPP), control of corruption, per cent Muslims in a country, education, contraceptive use and availability of antiretroviral medication that potentially affect a state's HIV prevalence. This research finds that conditions favorable to a decrease in HIV are low income inequality, a high per cent of Muslims in a country's population and high contraceptive use.

Global Women's Health in 2010: Facing the Challenges	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH			English	Article							MATERNAL MORTALITY; OBSTETRIC FISTULAS; DETERMINANTS; STRATEGIES; BANGLADESH; DISTRICT; AFRICA; TRENDS	Women's health is closely linked to a nation's level of development, with the leading causes of death in women in resource-poor nations attributable to preventable causes. Unlike many health problems in rich nations, the cure relies not only on the discovery of new medications or technology but also getting basic services to the people who need them most and addressing underlying injustice. In order to do this, political will and financial resources must be dedicated to developing and evaluating a scaleable approach to strengthen health systems, support community-based programs, and promote widespread campaigns to address gender inequality, including promoting girls' education. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have highlighted the importance of addressing maternal health and promoting gender equality for the overall development strategy of a nation. We must capitalize on the momentum created by this and other international campaigns and continue to advocate for comprehensive strategies to improve global women's health.

We hypothesize that health researchers can do so through six action strategies. These strategies include (1) becoming fully informed of women's human rights directives to integrate them into research, (2) mainstreaming gender in the research, (3) using the expertise of grass roots women's organizations in the setting, (4) showcasing women's equity and equality in the organizational infrastructure, (5) disseminating research findings to policymakers in the study locale to influence health priorities, and (6) publicizing the social conditions that are linked to women's diseases. We explore conceptual and logistical dilemmas in transforming a study using these principles and also provide a case study of obstetric fistula reduction in Nigeria to illustrate how these strategies can be operationalized. Our intent is to offer a feasible approach to health researchers who, conceptually, may link women's health to social and cultural conditions but are looking for practical implementation strategies to examine a women's health issue through the lens of their human rights.

J	Mackie, P				Mackie, P.			Social justice and social responsibility: Towards a value-base for global public health	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Public health values; Social justice; Equality; Mutuality		Public health and social justice have been seen as one and the same thing, in that public health is - of its very nature - socially just. In this paper, the relationship between public health and social justice is explored through reflecting upon the definitions of the two. Work being undertaken in Scotland in relation to prison health shows that public health action can be intended to have a socially just consequence. However it is not always possible to show that social justice was always the intended outcome of a public health action, as economic intentions can often result in similar public health intervention. In seeking to set out a values base for Global Public Health, the reflection allows two overarching values to be proposed: equality and mutuality. (C) 2010 The Royal Society for Public Health.

J	Denburg, AE				Denburg, Avram Ezra			Global Child Health Ethics: Testing the Limits of Moral Communities	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; RIGHTS; POLICY	This article attempts to map the broad ethical and legal contours of global child health realities. Its interest is in international duties to reduce disparities in the health of children. Specifically, it inquires into loci of collective rights and responsibilities in this context. Clarity on the sources of this responsibility and the nature of such rights will, it is hoped, contribute to enhanced and sustained action to attenuate these inequalities. A review and critique of the current topography of global health ethics is followed by an analysis of international human rights law as it pertains to global health, with a particular focus on the legal dimensions of child health outcomes. Thus grounded, the article seeks to build conceptual synergies between public health ethics and human rights paradigms to underwrite collective action on global child health disparities.

Associations of Employment Frustration with Self-Rated Physical and Mental Health Among Asian American Immigrants in the U.S. Labor Force	PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						Asian Americans; immigrants; occupational health; self-rated health; social justice	LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY; RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; JOB-SATISFACTION; RACIAL/ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION; PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY; PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH; OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; REPORTED HEALTH; NATIONAL LATINO; DISORDERS	Objective This study examined the associations between employment frustration and both self-rated physical health (SRPH) and self-rated mental health (SRMH) among Asian American immigrants. Design and Sample A cross-sectional quantitative analysis was conducted utilizing data from 1,181 Asian immigrants participating in the National Latino and Asian American Study. Measures Employment frustration was measured by self-report of having difficulty finding the work one wants because of being of Asian descent. SRPH and SRMH were each assessed using a global one-item measure, with responses ranging from poor to excellent. Control variables included gender, age, ethnicity, education, occupation, income, whether immigrated for employment, years in the United States, English proficiency, and a general measure for everyday discrimination. Results Ordered logistic regression showed that employment frustration was negatively associated with SRPH. This relationship, however, was no longer significant in multivariate models including English proficiency. The negative association between employment frustration and SRMH persisted even when including all control variables. Conclusions The findings suggest that Asian immigrants in the United States who experience employment frustration report lower levels of both physical and mental health. However, English proficiency may attenuate the relationship of employment frustration with physical health.	[de Castro, A.

On the basis of the characterisation of migration types derived from the review, we distinguished between immigrants from other regions of Spain and those from other countries, and within each group, those from richer or poorer areas, foreign immigrants from low-income countries were also distinguished according to duration of residence. Further stratification by sex and social class was applied. Groups were compared in relation to self-assessed health in two cross-sectional population-based surveys, and in relation to indicators of socio-economic conditions (individual income, an index of material and financial assets, and an index of employment precariousness) in one survey. Social class and gender inequalities were evident in both health and socio-economic conditions, and within both the native and immigrant subgroups Migration-related health inequalities affected both internal and international immigrants, but were mainly limited to those from poor areas, were generally consistent with their socio-economic deprivation, and apparently more pronounced in manual social classes and especially for women Foreign immigrants from poor countries had the poorest socio-economic situation but relatively better health (especially men with shorter length of residence). Our findings on immigrants from Spain highlight the transitory nature of the 'healthy immigrant effect', and that action on inequality in socioeconomic determinants affecting migrant groups should not be deferred.

Trends in Immunization Completion and Disparities in the Context of Health Reforms: The case study of Tanzania	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							VACCINATION COVERAGE; MORTALITY; WEALTH; FACILITIES; MEASLES; VISION; EQUITY; CARE	Background: Of global concern is the decline in under five children mortality which has reversed in some countries in sub Saharan Africa (SSA) since the early 1990 s which could be due to disparities in access to preventive services including immunization. This paper is aimed at determining the trend in disparities in completion of immunization using Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Methods: DHS studies randomly selected representative households from all regions in Tanzania since 1980 s, is repeated every five years in the same enumeration areas. The last three data sets (1990, 1996 and 2004) were downloaded and analyzed using STATA 9.0. The analysis included all children of between 12-23 months who would have completed all vaccinations required at 12 months. Results: Across the time periods 1990, 1996 to 2004/05 the percentage of children completing vaccination was similar (71.0% in 1990, 72.7% in 1996 and 72.3% in 2005). There was no disparity in completion of immunization with wealth strata in 1990 and 1996 (p > 0.05) but not 2004. In 2004/05 there was marked disparity as most poor experienced significant decline in immunization completion while the least poor had significant increase (p < 0.001). All three periods children from households whose head had low education were less likely to complete immunization (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Equity that existed in 1990 and more pronounced in 1996 regressed to inequity in 2005, thus though at national level immunization coverage did not change, but at sub-group there was significant disparity associated with the changing contexts and reforms. To address sub-group disparities in immunization it is recommended to adopt strategies focused at governance and health system to reach all population groups and most poor.

Expansion of cancer care and control in countries of low and middle income: a call to action	LANCET			English	Article							HEALTH SYSTEM REFORM; HIV PREVENTION; BREAST-CANCER; MEXICO; LESSONS; TRENDS	Substantial inequalities exist in cancer survival rates across countries. In addition to prevention of new cancers by reduction of risk factors, strategies are needed to close the gap between developed and developing countries in cancer survival and the effects of the disease on human suffering. We challenge the public health community's assumption that cancers will remain untreated in poor countries, and note the analogy to similarly unfounded arguments from more than a decade ago against provision of HIV treatment. In resource-constrained countries without specialised services, experience has shown that much can be done to prevent and treat cancer by deployment of primary and secondary caregivers, use of off-patent drugs, and application of regional and global mechanisms for financing and procurement. Furthermore, several middle-income countries have included cancer treatment in national health insurance coverage with a focus on people living in poverty. These strategies can reduce costs, increase access to health services, and strengthen health systems to meet the challenge of cancer and other diseases. In 2009, we formed the Global Task Force on Expanded Access to Cancer Care and Control in Developing Countries, which is composed of leaders from the global health and cancer care communities, and is dedicated to proposal, implementation, and evaluation of strategies to advance this agenda.

J	Füssel, HM				Fuessel, Hans-Martin			How inequitable is the global distribution of responsibility, capability, and vulnerability to climate change: A comprehensive indicator-based assessment	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Climate change; Climate impacts; Responsibility; Capability; Vulnerability; Inequity	NATURAL DISASTERS; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; WATER-RESOURCES; SRES EMISSIONS; DEATH TOLL; IMPACTS; HEALTH; COMPENSATION; AGRICULTURE; COUNTRIES	While it is generally asserted that those countries who have contributed least to anthropogenic climate change are most vulnerable to its adverse impacts some recently developed indices of vulnerability to climate change come to a different conclusion. Confirmation or rejection of this assertion is complicated by the lack of an agreed metric for measuring countries' vulnerability to climate change and by conflicting interpretations of vulnerability. This paper presents a comprehensive semi-quantitative analysis of the disparity between countries' responsibility for climate change, their capability to act and assist, and their vulnerability to climate change for four climate-sensitive sectors based on a broad range of disaggregated vulnerability indicators. This analysis finds a double inequity between responsibility and capability on the one hand and the vulnerability of food security, human health, and coastal populations on the other. This double inequity is robust across alternative indicator choices and interpretations of vulnerability. The main cause for the higher vulnerability of poor nations who have generally contributed little to climate change is their lower adaptive capacity. In addition, the biophysical sensitivity and socio-economic exposure of poor nations to climate impacts on food security and human health generally exceeds that of wealthier nations. No definite statement can be made on the inequity associated with climate impacts on water supply due to large uncertainties about future changes in regional water availability and to conflicting indicators of current water scarcity. The robust double inequity between responsibility and vulnerability for most climate-sensitive sectors strengthens the moral case for financial and technical assistance from those countries most responsible for climate change to those countries most vulnerable to its adverse impacts. However, the complex and geographically heterogeneous patterns of vulnerability factors for different climate-sensitive sectors suggest that the allocation of international adaptation funds to developing countries should be guided by sector-specific or hazard-specific criteria despite repeated requests from participants in international climate negotiations to develop a generic index of countries' vulnerability to climate change.

Little is known about sample recruitment in this vulnerable group. This study aimed to determine differences in ethical procedures and sample recruitment in a multicenter research on health of persons with intellectual disabilities. Study questions regarded the practical sampling procedure, how ethical consent was obtained in each country, and which person gave informed consent for each study participant. Study Design and Setting: Exploratory, as part of a multicenter study, in 14 European countries. After developing identical guidelines for all countries, partners collected data on health indicators by orally interviewing 1,269 persons with intellectual disabilities. Subsequently, semistructured interviews were carried out with partners and researchers. Results: Identification of sufficient study participants proved feasible. Sampling frames differed from nationally estimated proportions of persons with intellectual disabilities living with families or in residential settings. Sometimes, people with intellectual disabilities were hard to trace. Consent procedures and legal representation varied broadly. Nonresponse data proved unavailable. Conclusion: To build representative unbiased samples of vulnerable groups with limited academic capacities, international consensus on respectful consent procedures and tailored patient information is necessary.

Methods: Development of a framework based on national and international literature and current service models in Australian paediatric refugee health. Results: Ten elements of a framework for good practice were identified: comprehensive health screening; coordination of initial and ongoing health care; integration of physical, developmental and psychological health care; consumer participation; culturally and linguistically appropriate service provision; inter-sectoral collaboration; accessible and affordable services and treatments; data collection and evaluation to inform evidence-based practice; capacity building and sustainability; and advocacy. Conclusions: High-quality care can be achieved through a range of service models. The elements identified provide a framework for evaluating current services and for planning future service development. The framework for good practice can be applied to facilitate improvements in refugee health care and to reduce the gap between health needs and currently available services.

The setting was New Zealand (NZ), which takes proactive measures to attract disadvantaged smokers to this service. Methods: The NZ arm of the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey (ITC Project) utilizes the New Zealand Health Survey (a national sample) from which we surveyed adult smokers in two waves (N = 1,376 and N = 923) 1 year apart. Results: Quitline use in the last 12 months rose from 8.1% (95% CI = 6.3%-9.8%) in Wave 1 to 11.2% (95% CI = 8.4%-14.0%) at Wave 2. Maori (the indigenous people of NZ) were significantly more likely to call the Quitline than were European/other smokers. Relatively higher call rates also occurred among those reporting higher deprivation, financial stress, a past mental health disorder, a past drug-related disorder, and higher psychological distress (Kessler 10-item index). Independent associations in the multivariate analyses of Quitline use were being Maori, reporting financial stress, and ever having been diagnosed with a mental health disorder. Discussion: This national Quitline service is successfully stimulating disproportionately more calls by Maori smokers and those with some measures of disadvantage. It may therefore be contributing to reducing health inequalities. It appears possible to target quitlines to reach those smokers in greatest need.

This article analyzes the relevance of the international human rights framework (IHRF) to the Commission's goal of reducing health disparities with reference to both social scientific and legal scholarship. We begin with an overview of the IHRF, demonstrating its potential as a challenge to the normative foundations of the emerging global economic order. We then survey the research literature on mechanisms to ensure accountability for realization of health-related rights, emphasizing the potential effectiveness of making human rights enforceable through the courts, and the special need for mechanisms to hold countries and international institutions accountable for obligations related to the human right to health. We conclude by identifying three key directions for further research, policy and advocacy: comparative human rights litigation, specifically the willingness of courts to address broad policy and budgetary issues; the conditions under which governments legislate or constitutionalize economic and social rights; and how rich, powerful countries affect economic and social rights outside their borders.

J	Smith, JA				Smith, J. A.			How much water is enough? Domestic metered water consumption and free basic water volumes: The case of Eastwood, Pietermaritzburg	WATER SA			English	Article						free basic water; indigent; basic water requirements; water usage; municipal water services; urban poor household		This article is based on an in-depth case study of urban water services to poor households in the community of Eastwood, Pietermaritzburg, in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, for the period 2005-2007. The article adopts a mixed-methodological approach. Despite government progress in delivering water infrastructure post-1994, ability to pay for the service limited access. The free basic water policy, initiated by national Government in 2001, sought to provide all citizens, but particularly the poor, with a basic supply of free water. The concessions were envisaged to improve public health, gender and equity, affordability, and as an instrument of post-apartheid redress and poverty alleviation. Once free basic water (FBW) was declared a new imperative for local government the debate on exactly how much was enough, why 6 kl was chosen, the structure of the offering and broader state intentions opened up. This article positions the FBW offering within the prevailing international discourse on 'need' calculation. Through the exploration of actual water consumption patterns of urban poor households, the ideological assumptions and 'scientific' calculations underpinning this discourse were found to have ignored the fluidness of use as well as the value of water beyond mere physiological need. In this regard, access to FBW was conditioned on a small household size and further predicated the modification of normal water activities and lifestyle and carried a disproportionate social cost. The free basic volume of 6 kl was found to have no resonance with actual water volumes consumed by the majority of Eastwood households.	[Smith, J.

REACH Registry Investigators	Attained Educational Level and Incident Atherothrombotic Events in Low- and Middle-Income Compared With High-Income Countries	CIRCULATION			English	Article						cardiovascular diseases; epidemiology; registries; risk factors; smoking	RISK-FACTORS; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; WOMEN; INEQUALITIES; OUTPATIENTS; MORTALITY; OBESITY; DISEASE; IMPACT	Background-Studies report a protective effect of higher attained educational level (AEL) on cardiovascular outcomes. However, most of these studies have been conducted in high-income countries (HICs) and lack representation from low and middle-income countries (LMICs), which bear >80% of the global burden of cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results-The Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry is a prospective study of 67 888 subjects with either established atherothrombotic (coronary, cerebrovascular, and/or peripheral arterial) disease or multiple atherothrombotic risk factors enrolled from 5587 physician practices in 44 countries. At baseline, AEL (0 to 8 years, 9 to 12 years, trade or technical school, and university) was self-reported for 61 332 subjects. Outcomes included the baseline prevalence of atherothrombotic risk factors and the rate of incident cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) through 23 months across AEL groups, stratified by sex and world region (LMICs or HICs). Educational attainment was inversely associated with age and diabetes mellitus and directly associated with hypercholesterolemia in all subjects. However, for other risk factors such as obesity, smoking, hypertension, and baseline burden of vascular disease, AEL was protective (inversely associated) in HICs but not protective in LMICs. The protective effect of greater AEL on incident cardiovascular events was strongest in men from HICs (P<0.0001), more modest in women from HICs (P=0.0026) and in men from LMICs (P=0.082), and essentially absent in women from LMICs (P=0.32). Conclusion-In contrast to HICs, higher AEL may not be protective against cardiovascular events in LMICs, particularly in women. (Circulation. 2010;122:1167-1175.)

We assessed global inequality in eye health by using data on the global burden of disease measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Methods. We estimated the burden of eye disease by calculating the sum of DALYs (from the Global Burden of Disease study, 2004 update) due to trachoma, vitamin A deficiency, glaucoma, cataract, refractive errors, and macular degeneration. We assessed the geographic distribution of eye disease in relation to economic status and etiology by calculating the Gini coefficient, the Theil index, and the Atkinson index. Results. The global burden of eye disease was estimated at 61.4 million DALYs worldwide (4.0% of total DALYs). Vitamin A deficiency and trachoma were distributed more unevenly than were noncommunicable eye diseases, regardless of economic status. For noncommunicable eye diseases, the major contributor was refractive errors, regardless of economic status. The most uneven distribution was observed for cataract (high-income countries) and refractive errors (middle- and low-income countries). Conclusions. Creating new eye health service for refractive errors and reducing the unacceptable eye health disparity in refractive errors should be the highest priorities for international public health services in eye care and eye health.

AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES			English	Article						childhood; inequality; education		This paper is a reflective historical survey of how Australia, despite its affluence, has not delivered 'the good life' to poor Australians, both indigenous and non-indigenous. It argues that, contrary to our national mythology, this country was founded on institutionalised social inequality and on the exclusion of Indigenous people from land rights, property and equal citizenship. As one of the world's twenty richest countries, we perform poorly across a wide range of social and health indicators because we suffer from entrenched, systemic and growing inequality. If we are to survive the challenges that face us from climate change and the global financial crisis, we need to shape policies that mitigate income and social inequality and that promote inclusion and better social cohesion.

J	Cid, RD				Cid, Rodrigo D.			Insane defendants and forensic convicts: before and after the onset of the new forensic psychiatry network and the criminal justice system reform in Chile	CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						criminal justice system; forensic convict; forensic mental patients' rights; forensic psychiatry; forensic psychiatry network; insane defendant; mental health network		Purpose of review Like other Latin American democratic societies, Chile is supposed to respect legal rights of mentally ill people who are in trouble with the law, and provide them protection, treatment and welfare. Therefore, in this decade, the Chilean Criminal Justice and Mental Health System has undergone significant changes. Recent findings Because this article is related to the recent social features that involve different areas such as justice, mental health assistance and forensic psychiatry systems, and thereby the nonexistence of current literature that reviews this matter from a global perspective and its implications for the mental health population involved in the justice system, its review and analysis seems to be interesting. Summary The 'New Forensic Psychiatry Network' (NFPN) has been putting in relevant efforts to offer proper treatment and forensic assessment taking into account the civil rights of mentally insane people, and the 'Criminal Justice System Reform' (CJSR) is making possible legal conditions for better justice ensuring a more just resolution of insane defendants' and mentally ill convicts' lawsuits. From the author's viewpoint, all these changes are leading to a deep cultural impact on a Chilean's mind, changing their vision of justice and how society should respect insane defendants' and mentally ill convicts' legal rights.

The theoretical framework stems from the Pressure-State-Response (P-S-R) model introduced by the OECD, which served as a tool both for modelling the relationship to be studied and for defining comparable indicators to be used in a cross-section time-series setting. The classic P-S-R model was extended and arranged in an original way in order to include the role of transport as well as the effects of economic performance and social progress variables. Hence, among the determinants of air quality not only the pressures exerted by transport infrastructures and vehicle fleet were considered but also indicators of income level, income inequality, health conditions and urbanization. Moreover the ratification of international treaties for the emissions reduction was taken as an indicator of the response by a country to the demand for environmental protection and safety. In the framework of models for panel data, a Hausman-Taylor model was estimated where the unobserved, time-constant and country-specific term was assumed to account for a sort of environmental awareness.

J	Lundy, T				Lundy, Tam			A paradigm to guide health promotion into the 21st century: the integral idea whose time has come	GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						complexity; disciplinary matrix; equity; evidence-based practice; health; human development; multidisciplinarity; sustainability		The field of health promotion and education is at a turning point as it steps up to address the interconnected challenges of health, equity and sustainable development. Professionals and policy makers recognize the need for an integrative thinking and practice approach to foster comprehensive and coherent action in each of these complex areas. An integrative approach to policy and practice builds bridges across disciplines and discourses, supporting our efforts to take important next steps to generate sustainability and health for all. Comprehensive and coherent practice requires comprehensive and coherent theory. This article offers a brief introduction to Ken Wilber's influential Integral model, inviting its consideration as a promising paradigmatic framework that can guide thinking, practice, research and evidence as health promotion and education enter a new era. Currently influencing thought and practice leaders in diverse disciplines and sectors, the Integral approach presents a practical response to the current call for cross-disciplinary collaboration to address health, equity and sustainability. In addition, it addresses the disciplinary call for evidence-based practice that is grounded in, and accountable to, robust theoretical foundations.

J	Haddad, S; Bicaba, A; Feletto, M; Fournier, P; Zunzunegui, MV				Haddad, Slim; Bicaba, Abel; Feletto, Marta; Fournier, Pierre; Zunzunegui, Maria Victoria			Heterogeneity in the validity of administrative-based estimates of immunization coverage across health districts in Burkina Faso: implications for measurement, monitoring and planning	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Immunization; coverage estimates; data quality; health districts; Burkina Faso	UNIVERSAL CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION; VACCINATION COVERAGE; REGIONAL INEQUALITIES; INFANT IMMUNIZATION; GLOBAL INITIATIVES; COUNTRIES; QUALITY; INDIA; INFORMATION; ACCURACY	Background Data aggregation in national information systems begins at the district level. Decentralization has given districts a lead role in health planning and management, therefore validity of administrative-based estimates at that level is important to improve the performance of immunization information systems. Objective To assess the validity of administrative-based immunization estimates and their usability for planning and monitoring activities at district level. Methods DTP3 and measles coverage rates from administrative sources were compared with estimates from the EPI cluster survey (ECS) and Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) carried out in 2003 at national and regional levels. ECS estimates were compared with administrative rates across the 52 districts, which were classified into three groups: those where administrative rates were underestimating, overestimating or concordant with ECS estimates (differences within 95% CI of ECS rate). Results National rates provided by administrative data and ECS are similar (74% and 71% for DTP3 and 68% and 66% for measles, respectively); DHS estimates are much lower. Regional administrative data show large discrepancies when compared against ECS and DHS data (differences sometimes reaching 30 percentage points). At district level, geographical area is correlated with over- or underestimation by administrative sources, which overestimate DTP3 and measles coverage in remote areas. Underestimation is observed in districts near urban and highly populated centres. Over- and underestimation are independent of the antigen under consideration. Conclusions Variability in immunization coverage across districts highlights the limitations of using nationally aggregated indicators. If district data are to be used in monitoring and planning immunization programmes as intended by decentralization, heterogeneity in their validity must be reduced. The authors recommend: (1) strengthening administrative data systems; (2) implementing indicators that are insensitive to population mobility; (3) integrating surveys into monitoring processes at the subnational level; (4) actively promoting the use of coverage information by local personnel and district-level staff.

Data and methods Data are from the 2002 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-being. Weighted frequencies and cross-tabulations were used to estimate the prevalence of each mental morbidity measure and self-rated mental health by selected characteristics. Mean self-rated mental health scores were calculated for each mental morbidity measure. The association between self-rated mental health and each mental morbidity measure was analysed with logistic regression models. Results In 2002, an estimated 1.7 million Canadians aged 15 or older (7%) rated their mental health as fair or poor. Respondents classified with mental morbidity consistently reported lower mean self-rated mental health (SRMH) and had significantly higher odds of reporting fair/poor mental health than did those not classified with mental morbidity. Gradients in mean SRMH scores and odds of reporting fair/poor mental health by recency of WMH-CIDI-measured mental disorders were apparent. A sizeable percentage of respondents classified as having a mental morbidity did not perceive their mental health as fair/poor. Interpretation Although self-rated mental health is not a substitute for specific mental health measures it is potentially useful for monitoring general mental health.

In recent years, the concept of health, which is the bases for this study, has undergone changes to include both dysfunctional elements as well as the individual resources that protect health. The sample was made up of 18,955 adolescents between 11 to 18 years of age, in Spain and with participants in each of the regions making up the kingdom of Spain. Using exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis techniques, the results showed a global dimension of the health, starting from self-report indicators of life satisfaction, health-related quality of life, perception of the general state of health and psychosomatic complaints. This health score decreased as age increased and more notably among girls, as well as in adolescents from low-income families. The comparative analyses between regions showed differences which were, in principle, not attributable to the economic well-being of the geographic area. Finally, these results and their implications were discussed, as well as the importance of the calculation used in the analysis of the social inequalities in health.

Method: Qualitative, exploratory study. One hundred forty-four US and 150 UK ED service users completed a questionnaire developed by the Academy for Eating Disorders. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results: Both samples identified the following as essential aspects of care: good therapeutic relationship, holistic approach, individual psychotherapy/counseling, specialized treatment, client-centered care, and support. In the US sample, the main concerns involved lack of financial accessibility to services and problems with insurance coverage. In the UK sample, lack of and inequity of availability of services were highlighted and three main barriers to accessing care were identified. Discussion: US and UK service users' views suggest that neither country provides early intervention and comprehensive care for EDs at present, although due to dissimilar health care systems the barriers to care differ.

JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article						global health agenda; millennium development goals (mdgs); health equity; traditional medicine		Developing and emerging countries, including China and India, account for a large proportion of the global population, and as measures to address infectious diseases in these countries bear results, we are seeing a transformation in the nature of diseases that affect these countries. It is against this backdrop that cancer is presenting an increasingly serious threat in developing countries (WHO. The World Health Report 2008-primary health care: now more than ever.) 'Global health' has become an often-heard term in discussions on international health, and backed by a number of well-funded global initiatives, it is now positioned as one of the major agenda items for the international community (Reich MR, Takemi K, Roberts MJ, Hsiao WC. Global Action on Health Systems: A Proposal for the Toyako G8 Summit. Lancet 2008;371:865-9). However, cancer has not yet attained its rightful position on this global health agenda. This paper gives an overview of the discussions that took place at the 5(th) Asia Cancer Forum. Based on the challenges and outlook for placing cancer on the global health agenda, we conduct analysis that focuses on top-down mechanisms and bottom-up mechanisms.

J	Murphy, EM; McKenzie, CJ				Murphy, Eileen M.; McKenzie, Catriona J.			Multiple osteochondromas in the archaeological record: a global review	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Multiple osteochondromas; Congenital disease; Orthopaedic deformities; Palaeopathology	NATURAL-HISTORY; HEREDITARY OSTEOCHONDROMATOSIS; EXOSTOSES; FOREARM	Multiple osteochondromas is an inherited autosomal dominant condition of enchondral bone growth. The paper undertakes the first synthesis study of the 16 known cases of the condition that have been identified in the international palaeopathological record. It also includes information derived from two newly discovered cases of the disease in two adult male individuals recovered from the Medieval cemetery at Ballyhanna, Co. Donegal, Ireland. The formation of multiple osteochondromas is the best known characteristic of the disease but it also involves the development of a suite of orthopaedic deformities. These deformities, which include disproportionate short stature, inequality of bone length, forearm deformities, tibiofibular diastasis, coxa valga of the hip and valgus deformity of the knee and ankle, are discussed in relation to the archaeological cases. Numerous synonyms for the disease have been used within the various publications produced by palaeopathologists, and this can generate confusion among readers. As such, the paper recommends that in future palaeopathologists should follow the guidance of the World Health Organization and use the term multiple osteochondromas when discussing the disease.

International epidemiological studies have also shown asthma prevalence is an increasing problem. The objective of this study was to examine the correlates of access to care among asthmatic children age 0-17 in the United States. This is a retrospective study and secondary data analysis of the 2000 National Health Interview Survey. Parametric testing using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed to examine health care utilization among children with asthma in the United States. It was found that Black children were highly associated with not visiting a general doctor in the past 12 months (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30, 0.75). Uninsured asthmatic children were associated with the risk of not seeing a general doctor in the past 12 months (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.23, 0.69). Our study findings indicate disparities among Black children with asthma and their ability to access appropriate health care services. Additional studies are required to identify factors that contribute to the temporal trends in asthma and country of origin.

J	Bell, R; Taylor, S; Marmot, M				Bell, Ruth; Taylor, Sebastian; Marmot, Michael			Global Health Governance: Commission on Social Determinants of Health and the Imperative for Change	JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS			English	Article							DISADVANTAGE	In May 2009 the World Health Assembly passed a resolution on reducing health inequities through action on the social determinants of health, based on the work of the global Commission on Social Determinants of Health, 2005-2008. The Commission's genesis and findings raise some important questions for global health governance. We draw out some of the essential elements, themes, and mechanisms that shaped the Commission. We start by examining the evolving nature of global health and the Commission's foundational inspiration - the universal pattern of health inequity and the imperative, driven by a sense of social justice, to make better and more equal health a global goal. We look at how the Commission was established, how it was structured internally, and how it developed external relationships - with the World Health Organization, with global networks of academics and practitioners, with country governments eager to spearhead action on health equity, and with civil society. We outline the Commission's recommendations as they relate to the architecture of global health governance. Finally, we look at how the Commission is catalyzing a movement to bring social determinants of health to the forefront of international and national policy discourse.

J	Anderko, L				Anderko, Laura			Achieving Health Equity on a Global Scale through a Community-Based, Public Health Framework for Action	JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS			English	Article							ETHICS	Despite good intentions and decades of discussion addressing the need for transformative changes globally to reduce poverty and improve health equity, little progress has been made. A fundamental shift in framing the current conversation is critical to achieve "health for all," moving away from the traditional approaches that use the more narrowly focused medical model, which is intent on treating and curing disease. A public health framework for action is needed, which recognizes and confronts the complex, and often-times difficult-to-achieve social determinants of health. A restructuring of global health policy development and implementation will be ineffective unless key areas are addressed including primary education and the environment, in addition to economic considerations. A public health framework that embraces a community-based participatory approach would provide a comprehensive platform for identifying critical components that impact health, and for developing effective strategies for change. A participatory approach would encourage dialogue and problem-solving for region-specific issues among those most affected by the broader health and social justice issues, with those who create policy.

Global Health Governance and the Challenge of Chronic, Non-Communicable Disease	JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS			English	Article							DEVELOPING-WORLD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; GLOBALIZATION; OBESITY; FOOD; CARE; PREVENTION; MORTALITY	This paper considers how we can conceptualize a "global response" to chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and tobacco-related diseases. These diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in developed countries, and also in developing countries outside sub-Saharan Africa. The paper reviews emerging and proposed initiatives for global NCD governance, explains why NCDs merit a global response, and the ways in which global initiatives ultimately benefit national health outcomes. As the global response to NCDs matures, and the number of initiatives and partnerships increases, it will become increasingly important to map their respective contributions, and to evaluate progress overall. It is not yet clear what institutional mechanism, if any, will rise above the sea of surrounding initiatives to play this global role. This paper therefore aims to provide a conceptual map for making sense of what individual initiatives contribute to global governance. This map also draws attention to the distinctively "global" public health functions that a global response to NCDs should seek to discharge.

JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS			English	Article							BRITISH CIVIL-SERVANTS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; SEX WORKERS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; STRUCTURAL INTERVENTIONS; INCOME INEQUALITY; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; ALLOSTATIC LOAD; SURVIVAL NEEDS; HIV PREVENTION	With the publication of the final report of the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health, it becomes clear that there is considerable convergence between a policy agenda rooted on social epidemiology and one rooted in a concern for human rights. As commentators like Jonathan Mann have argued, concern for human rights and the achievement of social justice can inform and improve public health. In this article, we ask a different question: what does a health perspective adds to the enduring fight for a more just world? We consider three possibilities: (1) that public health, in an inversion of Mann's argument, actually provides useful tools for specifying social injustice; (2) that, contrary to the usual critical stance and assumption of weakness, the institutions of public health bring powerful capacities to the practical promotion of social justice; and (3) that health as a banner mobilizes people who would not be mobilized to act in the name of social justice.

J	Ooms, G				Ooms, Gorik			Why the West Is Perceived as Being Unworthy of Cooperation	JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS			English	Article								Natural selection generated a natural sense of justice. This natural sense of justice created a set of natural rights; rights humans accorded to each other in virtue of being members of the same tribe. Sharing the responsibility for natural rights between all members of the same tribe allowed humans to take advantage of all opportunities for cooperation. Human rights are the present day political emanation of natural rights. Theoretically, human rights are accorded by all humans to all humans in virtue of being humans; however, the idea that the corresponding responsibility is now shared among all humans is not broadly accepted. The natural sense of justice creates an ambiguity: on the one hand humans consider the nation they belong to as the social system that should guarantee their human rights (and likewise they do not consider themselves as having responsibility for the human rights of inhabitants of other nations); on the other hand, as cooperation between nations intensifies, expectations of global mutual responsibility increase as well. As the West does not feel responsible for the human rights of humans in the rest of the world, not even for their most basic survival needs, the West is perceived as unworthy of cooperation. If human rights are understood as conditions for the well-functioning communities, lifting the responsibility for the human rights of all humans to the global level can be understood as a condition to take full advantage of all opportunities globalization presents, or as a condition to adequately address all challenges globalization presents. However, this would have to happen without disregarding the particular feelings of mutual responsibility nations embody; we need a sliding scale of responsibility. The first step would be an acknowledgement that all humans are responsible for meeting the very basis survival needs of all humans, which could be achieved through a Framework Convention on Global Health and a Global Health Fund.

A South African Perspective	JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS			English	Article							ESSENTIAL MEDICINES	This article argues from a South African perspective that national experience in attempting to fulfil the right to health supports the need for an international framework. Secondly, we suggest that this framework is not just a matter of good choice or even of justice but of a direct legal duty that falls on those states that have consented to operate within the international human rights framework by ratifying key treaties such as the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). States can either accept this duty or face with growing pressure from those who believe in global social justice to find lasting solutions to the terrible inequities in global health standards.											22	4	4	0	5	WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC	MALDEN	COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA	1073-1105			J LAW MED ETHICS	J.

Forensic psychiatric nursing: a description of the role of the psychiatric nurse in a high secure psychiatric facility in Ireland	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						competencies; forensic psychiatric nursing; role	HEALTH NEEDS-ASSESSMENT; COMPETENCES; SERVICES; JUSTICE; SKILLS	The Central Mental Hospital is one of the oldest high secure mental health services in Europe dating back to 1845 but has been one of the last to introduce (forensic) psychiatric nurses. This paper describes the role of psychiatric nurses working in this high secure psychiatric facility in Ireland. The United Kingdom Central Council competency framework was considered to be a prudent starting point for beginning to understand this role in an Irish context. The study received a response rate of 74% and found that the Irish Forensic Mental Health Nurse experiences many of the same challenges as their international colleagues. A high proportion of nursing practice is focused on assessment, communication and creating a therapeutic environment based very much in keeping with the mainstream role in mental health nursing. Skills in specialist assessments and addressing offending behaviour were considered important but deficient at that time. The importance of recovery and human rights were considered paramount but challenged by the need for risk management and security.

The general relationship between poverty and illness is understood, but little is known about specific health implications of the 'working poor' status. The proportion of 'working poor' is increasing in Germany. Poverty-related health problems occur because of a lower standard of nutrition and housing, financial restraints, bad labour conditions, high-risk behaviours, and lack of access to health services. Impaired health status, in turn, adversely affects incomes and wages, raising concern about a vicious circle. Limited health-care resources demand preventive policies to improve employment status and income. Health and economic policy demand specific research on the health implications of precarious employment. In some areas, swift action is required.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between social capital and tobacco use in four low-income neighborhoods in Santiago, Chile. A multistage probability sample was used to select households in 4 of the 10 poorest neighborhoods in the district of Puente Alto, in Santiago, Chile. A cross-sectional survey of 781 participants (81.2% response rate for households) included sociodemographic variables, questions pertaining to neighborhood social capital, and questions pertaining to tobacco. Main analyses were carried out at the individual level by performing a multiple logistic regression of individual tobacco use on individual perceptions of community social capital. The prevalence of smoking was 43.9% of the surveyed population. A five-factor structure for social capital was identified, including "perceived trust in neighbors," "perceived trust in organizations," "reciprocity within the neighborhood," "neighborhood integration," and "social participation." An inverse relationship between trust in neighbors and tobacco smoking was statistically significantly with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91-0.99). Trust in neighbors was also significantly inversely associated with the number of cigarettes smoked. Tobacco control remains a significant challenge in global health, requiring innovative strategies that address changing social contexts as well as the changing epidemiological profile of developing regions.

In this paper, we argue that nursing has a clear mandate to ensure access to health and health-care by providing sensitive empowering care to those experiencing inequities and working to change underlying social conditions that result in and perpetuate health inequities. We identify key dimensions of the concept of health (in)equities and identify recommendations to reduce inequities advanced in key global and Canadian documents. Using these documents as context, we advocate a 'critical caring approach' that will assist nurses to understand the social, political, economic and historical context of health inequities and to tackle these inequities through policy advocacy. Numerous societal barriers as well as constraints within the nursing profession must be acknowledged and addressed. We offer recommendations related to nursing practice, education and research to move forward the agenda of reducing health inequities through action on the social determinants of health.

Previous research has suggested that older cancer patients may be less likely to use specialist palliative care, but such research has been limited by retrospective design and the failure to measure clinical need. The objective of this study was to examine the extent to which the use of specialist palliative care in lung cancer patients varies by age, after accounting for need. A cross-sectional survey of patients and their carers attending four hospital lung cancer clinics in London was conducted between June 2006 and April 2007. Two hundred and fifty-two patients and 137 carers participated in the study. Thirty-nine percent of participants received specialist palliative care. Metastatic disease, global quality of life and the clinic where treatment was provided were associated with use of specialist palliative care. Age, gender, deprivation, living alone, current or most recent line of treatment, number of co-morbidities and carer stress were not associated with receipt of such services. This suggests that, for patients within the specialist cancer care system, access to specialist palliative care is offered on the basis of need.

Associations of Marijuana Use and Sex-Related Marijuana Expectancies With HIV/STD Risk Behavior in High-Risk Adolescents	PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						marijuana; cannabis; alcohol; sexual risk behavior; HIV; expectancies	SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED-DISEASES; ALCOHOL-USE; SUBSTANCE USE; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; CANNABIS USE; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; JUVENILE DETAINEES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; YOUNG-ADULTS; HIV RISK	Multiple studies suggest an association of marijuana use with increased rates of sexual risk behavior and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Most studies have focused on global associations of marijuana use with sexual risk outcomes and few have examined relevant cognitive variables. Adolescents in the juvenile justice system are at elevated risk for HIV/STDs and preliminary evidence suggests that marijuana is a potentially important cofactor for sexual risk behavior in this population. This study evaluated global, situational and event-level associations of marijuana use and sex-related marijuana expectancies with sexual risk outcomes in a large, racially diverse sample of adjudicated youth (n = 656, 66% male, mean age = 16.7 years). Cross-sectional and prospective analyses identified associations of marijuana use and dependence symptoms with sexual risk outcomes, including lower frequency of condom use and higher STD incidence. Stronger sex-related marijuana expectancies predicted greater intentions for and frequency of marijuana use in sexual situations. In event-level analyses that controlled for alcohol, marijuana use predicted a significantly decreased likelihood of condom use; this association was moderated by sex-related marijuana expectancies. Mediation analyses suggested that behavioral intentions partly accounted for the prospective association of expectancies with marijuana use before sex. These results provide further evidence that marijuana use is a potentially important cofactor for HIV/STD transmission in high-risk adolescents and suggest that cognitive factors could be important for characterizing this association.

Our approach, which is basically empirical, departs from, the mainstream scholarship. We show new data on wages and heights in several viceroyalties that (1) suggest relatively medium-to-high levels of material welfare among the commoners in Bourbon Hispanic America; and (2) allow us to build indexes of economic inequality. An international comparison of those indexes casts some doubts on the widely accepted view that Viceroyal America's economy was exclusively based on extremely unequal or extractive institutions, as it has been popularized by the influential works by Engerman and Sokoloff and Acemoglu et al.

Participants share a fetal-centered logic that US-funded biomedicine must shoulder the burden of rescuing sub-Saharan Africa from itself by using the bodies of HIV-positive pregnant women to transmit biomedicine's magic bullet-antiretroviral drugs-to the next generation. The survival of the fetus, disguised as the well-being of the HIV-positive woman and accomplished by the magic of biomedical research, becomes the survival of a region otherwise doomed by its present state of economic, political, and medical incapacity. This version of what queer theorist Lee Edelman (2004, No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive) calls "reproductive futurism" redounds to the benefit of the more explicitly women-hating and nationalist ideologies of still-powerful right-wing movements against reproductive and sexual rights.

However, evidence of the impact on SRH of generational status, duration of residence in the US, and socioeconomic status (SES) among immigrants and their offspring is limited and inconsistent. We overcome limitations in existing research on this topic by using a uniquely large and diverse data source, the March Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS: 2003-2007) (n = 637,209). As a result, we are able to disaggregate results by race/ethnicity, account for country of origin, and consider the role of multiple dimensions of SES. We find that overall first-generation immigrants in the US have lower odds of poor/fair SRH compared to the third-generation. This association is particularly strong for blacks and Hispanics but not significant for Asians. Among first-generation Asians and Hispanics, longer duration of residence is positively associated with poor/fair SRH. Finally, socioeconomic gradients in SRH tend to be less pronounced among the first-generation (versus the third) and, within the first-generation, among recent arrivals (versus those with longer durations). Our results highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for multiple immigration-related variables and their interactions with race/ethnicity and SES. Otherwise, studies may misestimate SRH differences by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The continued growth of the US immigrant population and the second-generation underscore the need to examine patterns in immigrant health systematically. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A public-private partnership with the Ministry of Health, CDC, Vestergaard Frandsen and CHF International implemented a one-week integrated multi-disease prevention campaign. Method: Residents of Lurambi, Western Kenya were eligible for participation. The aim was to offer services to at least 80% of those aged 15-49. 31 temporary sites in strategically dispersed locations offered: HIV counseling and testing, 60 male condoms, an insecticide-treated bednet, a household water filter for women or an individual filter for men, and for those testing positive, a 3-month supply of cotrimoxazole and referral for follow-up care and treatment. Findings: Over 7 days, 47,311 people attended the campaign with a 96% uptake of the multi-disease preventive package. Of these, 99.7% were tested for HIV (87% in the target 15-49 age group); 80% had previously never tested. 4% of those tested were positive, 61% were women (5% of women and 3% of men), 6% had median CD4 counts of 541 cell/mL (IQR; 356, 754). 386 certified counselors attended to an average 17 participants per day, consistent with recommended national figures for mass campaigns. Among women, HIV infection varied by age, and was more likely with an ended marriage (e. g. widowed vs. never married, OR. 3.91; 95% CI. 2.87-5.34), and lack of occupation. In men, quantitatively stronger relationships were found (e. g. widowed vs. never married, OR. 7.0; 95% CI. 3.5-13.9). Always using condoms with a non-steady partner was more common among HIV-infected women participants who knew their status compared to those who did not (OR. 5.4 95% CI. 2.3-12.8). Conclusion: Through integrated campaigns it is feasible to efficiently cover large proportions of eligible adults in rural underserved communities with multiple disease preventive services simultaneously achieving various national and international health development goals.

Methods: We used a knowledge translation framework to analyse the HEF policy process between 2000 and 2008. The analysis was based on data from document analysis, key informant interviews and authors' observations. Results: The FIEF policy-making process in Cambodia was both innovative and incremental. Insights from pilot projects were gradually translated into national health policy. The uptake of HEF in health policy was determined by three important factors: a policy context conducive to the creation, dissemination and adoption of lessons gained in HEF pilots; the credibility and timeliness of HEF knowledge generated from pilot projects; and strong commitment, relationships and networks among actors. Conclusions: Knowledge locally generated through pilot projects is crucial for innovative health policy. It can help adapt blueprints and best practices to a local context and creates ownership. While international organisations and donors call take a leading role in innovative interventions in low-income countries, the involvement of government policy makers is necessary for their scaling-up.

J	Ngwena, CG				Ngwena, Charles G.			Protocol to the African Charter on the Rights of Women: Implications for access to abortion at the regional level	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Accessibility; Human rights; Reproductive health; Transparency; Unsafe abortion; Women's health		Article 14(2)(c) of the Protocol to the African Charter on the Rights of Women enjoins States Parties to take appropriate measures "to protect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus." This paper considers the implications of Article 14 for access to safe, legal abortion. It is submitted that Article 14 has the potential to impact positively on regional abortion law, policy, and practice in 3 main areas. First, it takes forward the global consensus on combating abortion as a major public health danger. Second, it provides African countries with not just an incentive, but also an imperative for reforming abortion laws in a transparent manner. Third, if implemented in the context of a treaty that centers on the equality and non-discrimination of women, Article 14 has the potential to contribute toward transforming access to abortion from a crime and punishment model to a reproductive health model.

Risk factors for sedentary behavior in young adults: similarities in the inequalities	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE			English	Article						DOHaD; mismatch; physical activity; programming	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; LEISURE-TIME; MATERNAL SEPARATION; RIBEIRAO-PRETO; LIFE-STYLE; IN-UTERO; GROWTH; HEALTH; EXERCISE	Physical activity is a known protective factor, with benefits for both metabolic and psychological aspects of health. Our objective was to verify early and late determinants of physical activity in young adults. A total of 2063 individuals from a birth cohort in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, were studied at the age of 23-25 years. Poisson regression was performed using three models: (1) early model considering birth weight, gestational age, maternal income, schooling and smoking; (2) late model considering individual's gender, schooling, smoking and body mass index; and (3) combined (early+late) model. Physical activity was evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, stratifying the individuals into active or sedentary. The general rate of sedentary behavior in the sample was 49.6%. In the early model, low birth weight (relative risk (RR)=1.186, confidence interval (95% CI) 1.005-1.399) was a risk factor for sedentary activity. Female gender (RR=1.379, 95% CI=1.259-1.511) and poor schooling (RR=1.126, 95% CI=1.007-1.259) were associated with sedentary behavior in the late model. In the combined model, only female gender and participant's schooling remained significant. An interaction between birth weight and individual's schooling was found, in which sedentary behavior was more prevalent in individuals born with low birth weight only if they had higher educational levels. Variables of early development and social insertion in later life interact to determine an individual's disposition to practice physical activities. This study may support the theoretical model 'Similarities in the inequalities', in which opposed perinatal backgrounds have the same impact over a health outcome in adulthood when facing unequal social achievement during the life-course.

Test of empirical data from the Tsimane' of Bolivia	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Amazon; Bolivia; Tsimane'; Markets; Trade opening; Psyche; Well-being	INCOME INEQUALITY; PERUVIAN AMAZON; PREINDUSTRIAL SOCIETY; HEALTH; ECONOMY; MARKET; HYPOTHESES; HAPPINESS; PATIENCE; ECOLOGY	Despite the pervasiveness of international trade, the effects of trade opening on the psyche have received scant attention. We present three hypotheses about the likely effects of trade opening on the following five dimensions of the psyche: mirth (smiles), anger, addiction, stress, and regret. To test the hypotheses we use a survey of similar to 605 people >= 16 years of age from a highly autarkic native Amazonian society of foragers and farmers in Bolivia (Tsimane') with high levels of impulsivity. As explanatory variables we use four measures of trade opening and a wide range of controls. Regret at buying durable assets during the previous year and addiction bore a positive association with two measures of trade opening: monetary income in the last 2 weeks and outstanding monetary debts owed to one or owed to the rest of the world. International trade theory predicts that trade opening expands choices in consumption, but among impulsive people in a highly autarkic society, more choice can beget more addiction and buyer's regret. We found no association between trade opening and smiles, anger, or stress, consistent with recent findings from industrial societies suggesting weak or ambiguous links between monetary income and these indicators of subjective well-being.

The Employment Precariousness Scale (EPRES) is a newly developed, theory-based, multidimensional questionnaire specifically devised for epidemiological studies among waged and salaried workers. Objective To assess the acceptability, reliability and construct validity of EPRES in a sample of waged and salaried workers in Spain. Methods A sample of 6968 temporary and permanent workers from a population-based survey carried out in 2004-2005 was analysed. The survey questionnaire was interviewer administered and included the six EPRES subscales, and measures of the psychosocial work environment (COPSOQ ISTAS21) and perceived general and mental health (SF-36). Results A high response rate to all EPRES items indicated good acceptability; Cronbach's alpha coefficients, over 0.70 for all subscales and the global score, demonstrated good internal consistency reliability; exploratory factor analysis using principal axis analysis and varimax rotation confirmed the six-subscale structure and the theoretical allocation of all items. Patterns across known groups and correlation coefficients with psychosocial work environment measures and perceived health demonstrated the expected relations, providing evidence of construct validity. Conclusions Our results provide evidence in support of the psychometric properties of EPRES, which appears to be a promising tool for the measurement of employment precariousness in public health research.

This unequal global distribution of AIDS deaths should be of interest to sociologists because of the potential role of structural forces in accounting for these disparities. Yet, there has been relatively little sociological research on this topic. Using underutilized cross-national data on AIDS deaths, this study examines the macro-level sources of variation in AIDS death rates across 115 countries. The analysis focuses on secondary school enrollment as a key structural factor in reducing AIDS deaths. After controlling for the prevalence of HIV infection, secondary school enrollment has the second largest and most robust effect on AIDS death rates. Economic development also reduces AIDS death rates, but this effect is mediated by secondary school enrollment. Schooling matters partly because it reduces HIV prevalence, but education still continues to have a significant negative effect on AIDS deaths even after controlling for prevalence. The education effect is robust in a variety of sensitivity analyses. Ultimately, this study underscores the role of structural factors, particularly education, for understanding the AIDS crisis.

Structural and socio-cultural constraints and forms of violence, including global and local economic inequalities, migration, racism, and intimate, gender-based abuses in both home and receiving countries interact in Antonia's experience to produce suffering and influence a form of gendered agency. This analysis points to the need for research and policies specifically designed to attend to the intersecting vulnerabilities migrant women who suffer DV often face, as well as their agentive acts.

Important process measures that might reflect inequities are treated prevalence and the service utilization rate in a defined period of time. We have previously described a method for estimating N, the distinct number who received service in a year, from a survey of service users at a single point in time. The estimator is based on the random variable 'time since last service', which enables the estimation of treated prevalence. We show that this same data can be used to estimate the service utilization rate, E(J), the mean number of services in the year. If the sample is typical with respect to the time since last visit, the MLE of E(J) is asymptotically unbiased. Confidence intervals and a global test of equality of treated prevalence and service utilization rates among several groups are given. A data set of outpatient mental health services from a county in New York State for which the true values of the parameters are known is analyzed as an illustration of the methods and an appraisal of their accuracy.

J	Maher, D				Maher, Dermot			Re-thinking global health sector efforts for HIV and tuberculosis epidemic control: promoting integration of programme activities within a strengthened health system	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; PREVENTION; TRANSMISSION; MORTALITY; IMPACT; INTERVENTIONS; PROPHYLAXIS; INFECTION; BURDEN	Background: The global financial crisis threatens global health, particularly exacerbating diseases of inequality, e.g. HIV/AIDS, and diseases of poverty, e.g. tuberculosis. The aim of this paper is to reconsider established practices and policies for HIV and tuberculosis epidemic control, aiming at delivering better results and value for money. This may be achieved by promoting greater integration of HIV and tuberculosis control programme activities within a strengthened health system. Discussion: HIV and tuberculosis share many similarities in terms of their disease burden and the recommended stratagems for their control. HIV and tuberculosis programmes implement similar sorts of control activities, e. g. case finding and treatment, which depend for success on generic health system issues, including vital registration, drug procurement and supply, laboratory network, human resources, and financing. However, the current health system approach to HIV and tuberculosis control often involves separate specialised services. Despite some recent progress, collaboration between the programmes remains inadequate, progress in obtaining synergies has been slow, and results remain far below those needed to achieve universal access to key interventions. A fundamental re-think of the current strategic approach involves promoting integrated delivery of HIV and tuberculosis programme activities as part of strengthened general health services: epidemiological surveillance, programme monitoring and evaluation, community awareness of health-seeking behavior, risk behaviour modification, infection control, treatment scale-up (first-line treatment regimens), drug-resistance surveillance, containing and countering drug-resistance (second-line treatment regimens), research and development, global advocacy and global partnership. Health agencies should review policies and progress in HIV and tuberculosis epidemic control, learn mutual lessons for policy development and scaling up interventions, and identify ways of joint planning and joint funding of integrated delivery as part of strengthened health systems. Summary: As both a danger and an opportunity, the global financial crisis may entail disaster or recovery for global health sector efforts for HIV and tuberculosis epidemic control. Review of policies and progress in control paves the way for identification of synergies between the two programmes, within strengthened health services. The silver lining in the global economic crisis could be better control of the HIV and tuberculosis epidemics, better overall health system performance and outcomes, and better value for money.

Methods: We reviewed the medical files of all detainees in a juvenile detention centre in Switzerland in 2007. The health problems for which primary care services were provided were coded using the International Classification for Primary Care, version 2. Analysis was descriptive, stratified by gender. Results: A total of 314 adolescents (18% female) aged 11-19 years were included. Most (89%) had a health assessment and 195 (62%) had consultations with a primary care physician; 80% of the latter had a physical health problem, and 60% had a mental health problem. The most commonly managed problems were skin (49.7%), respiratory (23.6%), behavioural (22.6%) and gynaecological problems (females: 23.9%); 13% females (no males) had sexually transmitted infections (STI), and 8.7% were pregnant. Substance abuse was common (tobacco: 64.6%, alcohol: 26.2%, cannabis: 31.3%). Conclusion: In addition to health problems known to be more prevalent among young offenders, such as mental health problems and STI, these adolescent detainees required care for a range of common primary care problems. These data should inform the development of comprehensive primary care services in all juvenile detention facilities in Europe.	[Haller, D.

Inequities in health within and across nations demand that nursing students examine the interconnectedness between local and global health challenges and contribute to the development and implementation of solutions to these challenges. In this article, we examine concepts related to global citizenship, globalization, social responsibility, and professionalism and link them to curricular innovation in nursing education. We argue that the development of global citizenship is a fundamental goal for all nursing students and that to achieve this, nurse educators must move beyond the creation of international placement opportunities or the use of global examples within existing courses. Nurse educators must develop strategies and design innovative curricula to provide opportunities for all students to become engaged with the concept of global citizenship and the role of nurses in a global world.

The purpose of the symposium was to gather together researchers, representatives from regulatory agencies, and vaccine developers to discuss issues related to advancement of replication-competent viral vector-based HIV vaccines into clinical trials. The meeting introduced the rationale for accelerating the development of replicating viral vectors for use as AIDS vaccines. It noted that the EMEA recently published draft guidelines that are an important first step in providing guidance for advancing live viral vectors into clinical development. Presentations included case studies and development challenges for viral vector-based vaccine candidates. These product development challenges included cell substrates used for vaccine manufacturing, the testing needed to assess vaccine safety, conducting clinical trials with live vectors, and assessment of vaccination risk versus benefit. More in depth discussion of risk and benefit highlighted the fact that AIDS vaccine efficacy trials must be conducted in the developing world where HIV incidence is greatest and how inequities in global health dramatically influence the political and social environment in developing countries.

Community well-being and growth status of indigenous school children in rural Oaxaca, southern Mexico	ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article						Social inequality; Marginalization; Biological well-being; Nutritional status; Overweight; Stunting	BLOOD LEAD LEVELS; SECULAR CHANGE; INTERNATIONAL SURVEY; VALLEY; PERCENTILES; POPULATION; OVERWEIGHT; MENARCHE; OBESITY; URBAN	Objective: To evaluate the relationship between community well-being based on an index of marginalization and growth status of indigenous rural school children in Oaxaca. Methods: Heights and weights of a cross-sectional sample of 11,454 children, 6-14 years, from schools for indigenous rural children (escuelas albergue) in 158 municipios in Oaxaca were measured in 2007. Tertiles of an index of marginalization were used to classify the 158 municipios into three categories of community well-being: lowest (highest marginalization), low, and moderate (lowest marginalization). Multivariate analysis of covariance, controlling for age, relative isolation and population size, was used to compare body size of children by category of community well-being. Contributions of marginalization, isolation and population size to variation in body size were estimated with sex-specific linear regression. Results: Children from municipios lowest in well-being were shorter and lighter than children from municipios low and moderate in well-being. Marginalization and relative isolation accounted for 23% (boys) and 21% (girls) of the variance in height and for 21% of the variance in weight of girls. Marginalization was the predictor of weight in boys (23%). Conclusion: Community well-being was reflected in the growth status of rural indigenous school children. Compromised growth status was consistent with poor health and nutritional conditions that were and are characteristic of rural areas in the state of Oaxaca. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

With reference to concepts embodied in the Yogyakarta Principles, it is proposed that the right to health includes access to health information, participation, equity, equality and non-discrimination. Specifically, the article examines how LB women's health can be considered as a health inequality and discusses international developments to reduce disparities. Drawing on qualitative data collected in an online survey, the article reports on sexual minority women's experiences of health-care. Participants were recruited via a purposive sampling strategy; questionnaires were completed by 6490 respondents of whom 5909 met the study criteria of residence in the UK, sexual orientation and completing the survey once. Analysis revealed four broad themes: heteronormativity in health-care; improving attitudes among healthcare professionals; equality in access; raising awareness and informed communities. The accounts highlight the centrality of human rights principles: fairness, respect, equality, dignity and autonomy. The implications for healthcare policy and practice are discussed including ways to empower staff and service users with knowledge and skills and ensuring non-discrimination in health service delivery.

Millennium Cohort Study Child Hlth	Is childcare associated with the risk of overweight and obesity in the early years? Findings from the UK Millennium Cohort Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						preschool children; childhood obesity; childcare; socio-economic inequalities; public policy	PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; WEIGHT-GAIN; GRANDPARENTS; POLICY	Background: A recent assessment of childcare in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries highlighted the potential for childcare to widen inequalities. Although childcare offers a potential setting for obesity prevention, little research has analysed the association between childcare and overweight, particularly in different socio-economic groups. Objectives: Our primary objective was to explore the association between childcare and overweight (including obesity), both overall and by socio-economic background, in a contemporary UK cohort of children at age 3 years (N = 12 354). Our secondary objective was to explore infant feeding as a potential mediator between childcare in infancy and overweight at age 3 years. Results: After controlling for confounders, children who were cared for in informal childcare (75% grandparents) between the age of 9 months and 3 years were more likely to be overweight than those cared for only by a parent (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.27), particularly if they were in full-time childcare (aRR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.15-1.57). When stratifying by socio-economic background, the increased risk of overweight in informal childcare (compared with parental care) was limited to children from more advantaged groups: those whose mother was from a managerial or professional background (aRR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.02-1.47), had a degree (RR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.13-1.83) or lived in a couple household (RR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32). There was no association between formal childcare and overweight. Infant feeding did not mediate the association between childcare use in infancy and overweight at age 3 years. Conclusions: Children from more advantaged families who use informal childcare are at increased risk of overweight. The UK government's drive to support parents into paid employment should be accompanied by health-related information and support for both informal and formal carers. As the majority of informal carers were grandparents, the recent government announcement to provide grandparents with National Insurance credits for caring for grandchildren provides a potential opportunity for health promotion.

Mortality rates suggest that elderly people in the advanced welfare democracies have experienced dramatically improved health over the past decades. This study examined the importance of public pensions for self-reported health and wellbeing among retired persons in 13 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in 2002-2005. New public pension data make it possible to distinguish between two qualities of pension systems: 'basic security' for those who have no or a short work history, and 'income security' for those with a more extensive contribution record. For enhanced cross-national comparison, relative measures of ill-health and wellbeing were constructed to account for cultural bias in responses to survey questions and heterogeneity among countries in the general level of population health. Overall, better health is found in countries with more generous pensions, although the results are gendered; for women's health, high basic security of the pension system appears to be particularly important. Women's wellbeing also tends to be more dependent on the quality of basic security.

This article analyses the development and design of unemployment insurance and family policy benefits and their links to health outcomes in Estonia, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary from the mid-1990s. Comparing these six transition countries with long-standing welfare democracies reveals important similarities and differences in policy and health. Unemployment benefit schemes resemble corporatist schemes in important respects, however, with lower coverage and average benefits. Subjective wellbeing is also comparatively low among both employed and unemployed in the transition countries. Several transition countries have mixed family policy strategies that simultaneously support dual-earner families and traditional gender roles. One clear exception is Slovenia, which has a highly developed dual-earner support. Family policy generosity is related to lower rates of poverty, infant mortality and child injuries. The article demonstrates the fruitfulness of institutional analyses of the link between social policy and population health in a broader welfare state context.

The article focuses on the role played by the welfare state vis-a-vis GDP in the increase of life expectancy in 17 OECD countries 1900-2000. The article shows that money matters, war kills and the welfare state is good for health. There is a curvilinear relationship between prosperity and longevity: after a certain level, the marginal utility of an extra dollar levels off. In the longer run, growth is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The welfare state plays its role, too. Bigger is better, be it with regard to social spending or the generosity or coverage of social protection. For the life expectancy of a population to increase, it is better to have broader coverage or universal access to care than to have more generous benefits, which are channelled to a limited circle of citizens. It is better to give adequately to all than lavishly to too few.

This article considers the role of legislated welfare state institutions as mediators of effects of political and structural forces on citizens' levels of living of relevance to inequalities in health and mortality. The focus is on institutional structures of welfare state programmes relevant to class inequality, as indicated by income inequalities, and to gender inequality, conceived of as differences in agency. I introduce the Social Citizenship Indicator Program, a database providing quantitative and qualitative information on structures of main social insurance programmes in 18 countries from 1930 to 2000, on about 300,000 data points. It is used to delineate types of distributive institutions of relevance for income inequality. Institutions relevant for gendered agency inequality affect choices by women, especially mothers, between unpaid and paid work. Driving forces behind the emergence of differences in distributive institutions are discussed, and patterns of class and gender inequalities are outlined.

This Supplement includes a number of articles dealing with the role of social policy schemes for public health across the life course. As a key social determinant of health, poverty and its consequences have historically been at the forefront of the public health discussion. But also in rich countries today, economic resources are likely to be important for health and survival, both on an individual and an aggregate level. This introductory article serves as a background for the more specific analyses that follow. The focus is on why income and income inequality could have an effect on individual and population health. We discuss relationships between the individual and population levels and between income and health, and some of the possible mechanisms involved. We also present arguments for why welfare state institutions may matter.

The aim of the study was to estimate the impact of changes in pension rights on old-age mortality. We made a distinction between two dimensions of pension benefits, one of providing basic security (BASIC), and the other of providing income security (INCOME). Analyses were based on data for 18 OECD countries during the post-war period. The outcome comprised old-age excess mortality, defined as the ratio of the mortality rate 65+ to the mortality rate in the age group 30-59 years. The latter was regarded as a proxy for unobserved factors potentially related to old-age mortality as well as pension rights. The pooled cross-sectional time series data were analysed through fixed effects modelling. The results suggest that BASIC (but not INCOME) has a beneficial impact on old-age excess mortality, which was statistically significant. We interpret the results in terms of the poverty-reducing effects of pension entitlements with a basic security orientation.

Issues and challenges for systematic reviews in indigenous health	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; INEQUALITIES	This essay outlines key issues raised during a project that aimed to (1) identify the gaps in the international evidence base of systematic reviews of intervention effectiveness relevant to public health decision making to address health inequalities experienced by indigenous people, and (2) identify priority areas and topics for future reviews. A number of indigenous researchers and clinicians invited to participate in the project expressed reservations about the appropriateness and value of conventional systematic reviews of intervention evidence to indigenous health. Ensuring that systematic review methods for indigenous health research meet the needs of those that use them, including indigenous communities themselves, needs to be a key area of ongoing work. The public health group within the Cochrane Collaboration has recognised this as a priority area and initiated exploration of these issues.

As its implications remain largely unknown, we reviewed claimed benefits and risks. Driven by high health-care costs, long waiting periods, or lack of access to new therapies in developed countries, most medical tourists (largely from the United States, Canada, and Western Europe) seek care in Asia and Latin America. Although individual patient risks may be offset by credentialing and sophistication in (some) destination country facilities, lack of benefits to poorer citizens in developing countries offering medical tourism remains a generic equity issue. Data collection, measures, and studies of medical tourism all need to be greatly improved if countries are to assess better both the magnitude and potential health implications of this trade.

J	Zhang, H; Georgescu, P				Zhang, Hong; Georgescu, Paul			The global properties of an age-dependent <i>SI</i> model involving pathogenic virus release and defence mechanisms for pests	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						Pest management; Age-structured population model; Transport equation; Functional differential equations; Asymptotic analysis; Linearized stability	MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; MICROBIAL CONTROL; DYNAMICS; STABILITY	Insect pests are common but undesirable elements in ecosystems and represent thorny problems for most developing countries. To prevent pest outbreaks, growers often resort to insect-pathogenic viruses rather than to pesticides which affect human health and the environment. The purpose of this paper is to investigate a new age-structured pest management model which describes the interaction between susceptible insect pests, infected insect pests, pathogenic viruses and defence immunity mechanisms. A feature of this model is that it accounts for the dependence of the amount of pathogenic viruses released and of the efficiency of the defence mechanisms upon the so-called age of infection. First, the asymptotic behavior of the system is established via a monotonicity argument which makes use of several integral inequalities, being shown that the infection ultimately dies out, while under certain circumstances the susceptible pests also become extinct. By means of the Michailov criterion, one then analyzes the linearized stability of the trivial equilibrium and of the semi-trivial infected pest-free equilibrium. In this regard, it is observed that the defence mechanisms and maximal length of the infective period play important roles in the dynamics of the system. Several pest controls strategies are further investigated by means of numerical simulations, which show that when the dose of pathogenic viruses released initially is larger than a certain amount the profile of the response of defence mechanisms can be modified by changing this dose. Finally, the paper is concluded with a discussion on the biological significance of the mathematical results and framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Enabling nursing students to focus on the Ottawa Charter and the nurses role in tackling inequalities in health through international exchange	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Ottawa Charter; Health inequalities; Curriculum development; Student nurses; International	EDUCATION; COMMUNITY	Student nurses in a transatlantic exchange program explored the role of registered nurses in five countries' public health systems. The Ottawa Charter provided a framework for students to examine the nurse's responsibilities in public health. Students took practice placements in geographically rural areas on another continent and explored inequalities in health care. If nurses are to understand their role in the health care system then they must be taught the scope of their practice including their role in health promotion, public health practice and community development. For this project nursing instructors developed an assignment relevant to the aims and suitable for students in all five nursing programs. Only three of 48 students offered an assignment which focused on building healthy public policy. Nurse educators need to explore this further to ensure nurses of the future are aware of their role and responsibilities in this area and have skills to work effectively to influence and build healthy policy. The international student exchange supported the students' developing understanding of the breadth of initiatives around the globe where nurses are actively engaged in addressing inequalities of health. Findings from an analysis of their assignments are presented in this evaluative report. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Qualitative evaluation of a physical activity-based chronic disease prevention program in a low-income, rural South African setting	RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH			English	Article						community-based research; health promotion; physical activity; qualitative research	SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION; PROMOTION PROGRAM; EXERCISE PROGRAM; COMMUNITY; OBESITY; INACTIVITY; FITNESS; TRIAL; LIFE	Introduction: Chronic diseases, an increasing global concern, are prevalent in the low-income communities of South Africa, where rural health systems bear the double burden of infectious and chronic diseases. The Discovery Healthy Lifestyle Programme (DHLP) is a physical activity-based chronic disease prevention program that has been implemented in a low-income, rural setting in South Africa. The DHLP consists of both school-and primary healthcare clinic-based interventions for learners (Healthnutz) and adults (Live it Up), facilitated by teachers, nurses and community volunteers. The aim of this evaluation was to qualitatively assess the process by which the DHLP was implemented, identifying enabling factors and barriers. Methods: Data were collected in target communities at schools and clinics from semi-structured focus groups of program leaders and members, teachers and community members (n=45), situational analyses of the school physical activity environment, informal community observations and informal interviews with program coordinators. Results: The target communities faced socioeconomic and health inequalities and remained under-resourced and under-served. In spite of these and other challenges, the DHLP was well received by community members and stakeholders. It was valued by respondents for its health and psychosocial outcomes, evidenced by increased knowledge and awareness of the importance of physical activity and healthy lifestyles, and positively altered perceptions of physical activity. Program implementers believed the Live it Up component was growing, and this suggested the sustainability of the program. There were, however, some concerns about the fidelity of the Healthnutz intervention, due to timetabling difficulties. Despite this, teachers were positive about the program and its value for their learners, staff and school. The community characteristics of being under-resourced and under-served appeared to positively influence DHLP implementation. Local government involvement in the DHLP resulted in greater ownership of the program, which enabled successful implementation. Conclusions: This study presents a unique opportunity to assess the implementation and sustainability requirements of programs in environments of limited resources, considerable burden of infectious and chronic diseases and extensive socioeconomic challenges. The findings suggest that through enhancement of knowledge, transfer of appropriate skills and the provision of an enabling environment, participation in physical activity can be effectively promoted in a low-income, rural setting. Physical activity interventions that promote the participation and empowerment of rural communities can be feasible and accessible, thereby assisting in addressing the growing burden of chronic diseases in low-income.

Juarez represents an opportunity lot researchers to test for patterns of injustice in a recently urbanizing metropolis of the Global South. We use spatial-econometric modeling to predict the four unique hazard variables and a composite hazard variable using socio-demographic variables at the neighborhood level Lower class and higher percentages of children and migrants were statistically significant predictors of composite hazard density These results align with previous studies in the North. However, disaggregating these results by hazard type reveals important and counterintuitive differences in groups at risk based on the market-orientation of the hazard (i.e., domestic vs transnational) and its location within the urban structure.

The impact of national income level, inequality, and poverty on public health in Latin America	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Latin America; Public health; Health inequalities; Income; Income inequality; Poverty	NEO-MATERIALIST THEORY; POPULATION HEALTH; TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIP; CHANGING RELATION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; MORTALITY; DETERMINANT; RECESSIONS; TRANSITION; EXPOSURE	Despite findings indicating that both national income level and income inequality are each determinants of public health, few have studied how national income level, poverty and inequality interact with each other to influence public health outcomes. We analyzed the relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power parity, extreme poverty rates, the gini coefficient for personal income and three common measures of public health: life expectancy, infant mortality rates, and tuberculosis (TB) mortality rates. Introducing poverty and inequality as modifying factors, we then assessed whether the relationship between GDP and health differed during times of increasing, decreasing, and decreasing or constant poverty and inequality. Data were taken from twenty-two Latin American countries from 1960 to 2007 from the December 2008 World Bank World Development Indicators, World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Database 2008, and the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean. Consistent with previous studies, we found increases in GDP have a sizable positive impact on population health. However, the strength of the relationship is powerfully influenced by changing levels of poverty and inequality. When poverty was increasing, greater GDP had no significant effect on life expectancy or TB mortality, and only led to a small reduction in infant mortality rates. When inequality was rising, greater GDP had only a modest effect on life expectancy and infant mortality rates, and no effect on TB mortality rates. In sharp contrast, during times of decreasing or constant poverty and inequality, there was a very strong relationship between increasing GDP and higher life expectancy and lower TB and infant mortality rates. Finally, inequality and poverty were found to exert independent, substantial effects on the relationship between national income level and health. Wealthier is indeed healthier, but how much healthier depends on how increases in wealth are distributed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

'Relief of oppression': An organizing principle for researchers' obligations to participants in observational studies in the developing world	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HARM REDUCTION; ETHICS; PROSTITUTES; JUSTICE	Background: A central question in the debate about exploitation in international research is whether investigators and sponsors from high-income countries (HIC) have obligations to address background conditions of injustice in the communities in which they conduct their research, beyond the healthcare and other research-related needs of participants, to aspects of their basic life circumstances. Discussion: In this paper, we describe the Majengo sexually transmitted disease (STD) Cohort study, a long-term prospective, observational cohort of sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya. Despite important scientific contributions and a wide range of benefits to the women of the cohort, most of the women have remained in the sex trade during their long-standing participation in the cohort, prompting allegations of exploitation. The Majengo STD cohort case extends the debate about justice in international research ethics beyond clinical trials into long-term observational research. We sketch the basic features of a new approach to understanding and operationalizing obligations of observational researchers, which we call 'relief of oppression'. 'Relief of oppression' is an organizing principle, analogous to the principle of harm reduction that is now widely applied in public health practice. Relief of oppression aims to help observational researchers working in conditions of injustice and deprivation to clarify their ethical obligations to participants. It aims to bridge the gap between a narrow, transaction-oriented account of avoiding exploitation and a broad account emphasizing obligations of reparation for historic injustices. We propose that relief of oppression might focus researchers' consideration of benefits on those that have some relevance to background conditions of injustice, and so elevate the priority of these benefits, in relation to others that might be considered and negotiated with participants, according to the degree to which the participating communities are constrained in their realization of fundamental freedoms. Summary: The over-arching aim of relief of oppression is that, within the range of benefits negotiated over time with the local communities and organizations, an increasing proportion reflects a shared interest in improving participants' fundamental freedoms. We describe how harm reduction serves as a useful analogy for how we envision relief of oppression functioning in international research.

Are time-trends of smoking among pregnant immigrant women in Sweden determined by cultural or socioeconomic factors?	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							MATERNAL SMOKING; HEALTH BEHAVIORS; PREVALENCE; OUTCOMES; RISK; DISEASE; LEVEL	Background: The widening socioeconomic gap in smoking during pregnancy remains a challenge to the Swedish antenatal care services. However, the influence of cultural factors in explaining the socioeconomic differences in smoking during pregnancy is not clear among the immigrant women. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the development of smoking prevalence among pregnant immigrant women in Sweden followed the trajectory which could be expected from the stages of the global smoking epidemic model in the women's countries of origin, or not. Methods: Delivery data on pregnancies in Sweden from 1982 to 2001 was collected from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry. From a total of 2,224,469 pregnant women during this period, all immigrant pregnant women (n = 234,731) were selected to this study. A logistic regression analysis and attributable fraction were used to investigate the association between smoking during pregnancy and the socioeconomic differences among immigrant women. Results: Overall, the prevalence of smoking among pregnant immigrant women decreased from 30.3% in 1982 to 11.0% in 2001, albeit with remarkable differences between educational levels and country of origin. The greatest decline of absolute prevalence was recorded among low educated women (27,9%) and among other Nordic countries (17,9%). In relative terms, smoking inequalities increased between educational levels regardless of country of origin. The odds ratios for low educational level for women from other Nordic countries increased from 4.9 (95% CI 4.4-5.4) in 1982 to 13.4 (95% CI 11.2-16.2) in 2001, as compared to women with high education in the same group. Further, the total attributable fraction for educational difference increased from 55% in 1982 to 62% in 2001, demonstrating the strong effect of educational attainment. Conclusions: Our hypothesis that the socioeconomic time trend of smoking based on the stage of the world wide tobacco epidemic model related to country of origin of the immigrant women was not supported by our analyses. Our findings does not support a call for specific "culture sensitive" antismoking policies or interventions in Sweden or similar countries, but reinforce the existing evidence with a focus on women with a low educational level, regardless of cultural background.

The reasons for these ethnic inequalities in health are incompletely understood. The main objective was to examine whether socio-economic position (SEP) as measured by education was related to the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in different ethnic groups in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Methods: A random sample of healthy adults aged 35-60 years. SEP was measured by educational level (secondary school and below (low), and vocational school and above (high)). Metabolic syndrome was measured according to the International Diabetic Federation guidelines. Results: Low education was negatively related to metabolic syndrome but only in White-Dutch people. Among White-Dutch men, the age adjusted prevalence ratio (95% confidence intervals) for low education was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.01-2.10) versus high education. Among White-Dutch women, the adjusted odds ratios for low education was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.39-3.68) versus high education. In both White-Dutch men and women, low education was related to several components of metabolic syndrome. Among African-Surinamese and Hindustani-Surinamese, no significant associations were found between low education and metabolic syndrome and its components. Conclusion: Low education is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome among White-Dutch people but not among other ethnic groups. Community-based strategies to improve metabolic profiles may have to be ethnically devised. Among White-Dutch, targeting people with lower SEP may have an impact. However, among ethnic minority groups, both low and high socio-economic groups may have to be equally targeted to have an impact in reducing ethnic inequalities in health.

Shared Principles of Ethics for Infant and Young Child Nutrition in the Developing World	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL MARKETING CODE; BREAST-MILK SUBSTITUTES; HEALTH; EVERYBODY	Background: The defining event in the area of infant feeding is the aggressive marketing of infant formula in the developing world by transnational companies in the 1970s. This practice shattered the trust of the global health community in the private sector, culminated in a global boycott of Nestle products and has extended to distrust of all commercial efforts to improve infant and young child nutrition. The lack of trust is a key barrier along the critical path to optimal infant and young child nutrition in the developing world. Discussion: To begin to bridge this gap in trust, we developed a set of shared principles based on the following ideals: Integrity; Solidarity; Justice; Equality; Partnership, cooperation, coordination, and communication; Responsible Activity; Sustainability; Transparency; Private enterprise and scale-up; and Fair trading and consumer choice. We hope these principles can serve as a platform on which various parties in the in the infant and young child nutrition arena, can begin a process of authentic trust-building that will ultimately result in coordinated efforts amongst parties. Summary: A set of shared principles of ethics for infant and young child nutrition in the developing world could catalyze the scale-up of low cost, high quality, complementary foods for infants and young children, and eventually contribute to the eradication of infant and child malnutrition in the developing world.

Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its components in relation to socioeconomic status among Jamaican young adults: a cross-sectional study	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							RISK-FACTORS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; NATIONAL-HEALTH; CENTRAL OBESITY; CHILDHOOD; ADOLESCENTS; CIRCUMFERENCES; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY	Background: The metabolic syndrome has a high prevalence in many countries and has been associated with socioeconomic status (SES). This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its components among Jamaican young adults and evaluate its association with parental SES. Methods: A subset of the participants from the 1986 Jamaica Birth Cohort was evaluated at ages 18- 20 years between 2005 and 2007. Trained research nurses obtained blood pressure and anthropometric measurements and collected a venous blood sample for measurement of lipids and glucose. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its components were estimated using the 2009 Consensus Criteria from the International Diabetes Federation, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, American Heart Association, World Heart Federation, International Atherosclerosis Society, and International Association for the Study of Obesity. SES was assessed by questionnaire using occupation of household head, highest education of parent/guardian, and housing tenure of parent/guardian. Analysis yielded means and proportions for metabolic syndrome variables and covariates. Associations with levels of SES variables were obtained using analysis of variance. Multivariable analysis was conducted using logistic regression models. Results: Data from 839 participants (378 males; 461 females) were analyzed. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.5%-1.9%). Prevalence was higher in females (1.7% vs. 0.5%). Prevalence of the components [male: female] were: central obesity, 16.0% [5.3:24.7]; elevated blood pressure, 6.7% [10.8:3.3]; elevated glucose, 1.2% [2.1:0.4]; low HDL, 46.8% [28.8:61.6]; high triglycerides, 0.6% [0.5:0.6]. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome for any of the SES measures used possibly due to lack of statistical power. Prevalence of central obesity was inversely associated with occupation (highly skilled 12.4%, skilled 13.5%, semi-skilled/unskilled 21.8%, p = 0.013) and education (tertiary 12.5%, secondary 14.1%, primary/all-age 28.4%, p = 0.002). In sexspecific multivariate logistic regression adjusted for hip circumference, central obesity remained associated with occupation and education for women only. Conclusion: Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is low, but central obesity and low HDL are present in 16% and 47% of Jamaican youth, respectively. Central obesity is inversely associated with occupation and education in females.	[Ferguson, Trevor S.; Tulloch-Reid, Marshall K.; Younger, Novie O.

Major illnesses can have a serious economic impact on poor households through treatment costs and income loss. However, available methods for measuring the impact of ill-health on household welfare display several shortcomings and new methods are thus needed. To understand the potential complex impact of major illnesses on household livelihoods, a study on poverty and illness was conducted in rural Cambodia, as part of an international comparative research project. A cross-sectional survey was performed to identify households affected by major illness for further in-depth interviews. Methodology and Principal Findings: 5,975 households in three rural health districts were randomly selected through a two-stage cluster sampling and interviewed. 27% of the households reported at least one member with a serious illness in the year preceding the survey and 15% of the household members reported suffering from at least one serious illness. The most reported conditions include common tropical infectious diseases, chronic diseases (notably hypertension and heart diseases) and road traffic accidents. Such conditions were particularly concentrated among the poor, children under five, women, and the elderly. Poor women often reported complications related to pregnancy and delivery as serious illnesses. Conclusions and Significance: Despite some methodological limitations, this study provides new information on the frequency of self-reported serious illnesses among the rural Cambodia's population, which serves as a basis for further in-depth investigation on 'major illnesses' and their economic consequences on poor households. This can in turn help policy makers to formulate appropriate interventions to protect the poor from the financial burden associated with ill-health. Our findings suggest that every year a considerable proportion of rural population in Cambodia, especially the poor and vulnerable, are affected by serious illnesses, both communicable and non-communicable diseases.

J	Macklin, R				Macklin, Ruth			THE DEATH OF BIOETHICS (AS WE ONCE KNEW IT)	BIOETHICS			English	Article						future of bioethics; history of bioethics; demise of bioethics		Fast forward 50 years into the future. A look back at what occurred in the field of bioethics since 2010 reveals that a conference in 2050 commemorated the death of bioethics. In a steady progression over the years, the field became increasingly fragmented and bureaucratized. Disagreement and dissension were rife, and this once flourishing, multidisciplinary field began to splinter in multiple ways. Prominent journals folded, one by one, and were replaced with specialized publications dealing with genethics, reproethics, nanoethics, and necroethics. Mainstream bioethics organizations also collapsed, giving way to new associations along disciplinary and sub-disciplinary lines. Physicians established their own journals, and specialty groups broke away from more general associations of medical ethics. Lawyers also split into three separate factions, and philosophers rejected all but the most rigorous, analytic articles into their newly established journal. Matters finally came to a head with global warming, the world-wide spread of malaria and dengue, and the cost of medical treatments out of reach for almost everyone. The result was the need to develop plans for strict rationing of medical care. At the same time, recognition emerged of the importance of the right to health and the need for global justice in health. By 2060, a spark of hope was ignited, opening the door to the resuscitation of bioethics and involvement of the global community.

J	Applbaum, K				Applbaum, Kalman			Shadow science: Zyprexa, Eli Lilly and the globalization of pharmaceutical damage control	BIOSOCIETIES			English	Article						pharmaceuticals; marketing; Japan; antipsychotics; globalization; regulation	HARMONIZATION; CITIZENSHIP; OLANZAPINE; MARKETS; RISKS	In 2002, following reports of adverse side effects experienced by Japanese patients taking the antipsychotic medication, Zyprexa, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare required Eli Lilly & Co. to place a new warning label on its drug and to send out a 'doctors letter'. The company feared that this would threaten its sales of Zyprexa not just in Japan, but globally. US court documents from suits against Lilly in 2006 show how Lilly focused their scientific and sales attention not on the reported side effects of their drug, but on how prescribing physicians perceived the side effect profile of the drug. The company actively pursued a strategy of creating a shadow science to drown out noncompany-sponsored (and competitors') research reports on the side effects of the drug. I draw on ethnographic research in Japan to describe how Lilly dealt with the threat to the brand equity of Zyprexa there, and how they sought to keep their global marketing program for the drug on course. I conclude with a discussion of the encounter between the global marketing aspiration of the firm and the contingencies associated with the Japanese environment in particular.

CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS			English	Review						emergency medicine; global health; international; pediatrics	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HEALTH; CHILDREN; SURGERY	Purpose of review Interest in the areas of global health and international emergency medicine has increased dramatically in recent years. This article discusses some of the knowledge gained in these areas, particularly as it pertains to the delivery of pediatric emergency care in resource-limited settings. Recent trends Advances in global health have come in many forms, including an increase in the quality and number of training programs available, the development of clinical guidelines and protocols that are locally applicable, attempts to decrease inequities in the delivery of and access to care and an increase in the sharing of knowledge through partnerships and electronic media. Summary Tremendous advances have been made in global health but there are still major obstacles to overcome. One of the areas that have yet to receive much attention is the delivery of pediatric emergency care. By working with our colleagues around the world and disseminating what we have learned, we can improve emergency care for all children.

Hence, the purpose of this study was to develop an innovative methodological approach for predicting the incidence rates of jaw fractures and estimating the demand for oral health services within Australia. Materials and methods: Population data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and was divided across Australia by statistical local area and related to a validated remoteness index. Every episode of discharge from all hospitals in Western Australia for the financial years 1999/2000 to 2004/2005 indicating a jaw fracture as the principle oral condition, as classified by the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10AM), was the inclusion criterion for the study. Hospitalization data were obtained from the Western Australian Hospital Morbidity Data System. Results: The model estimated almost 10 times higher jaw fracture rates for Indigenous populations than their non-Indigenous counterparts. Moreover, incidence of jaw fractures was higher among Indigenous people living in rural and remote areas compared with their urban and semi-urban counterparts. In contrast, in the non-Indigenous population, higher rates of jaw fractures were estimated for urban and semi-urban inhabitants compared with their rural and remote counterparts. Conclusions: This geographic modelling technique could be improved by methodological refinements and further research. It will be useful in developing strategies for health management and reducing the burden of jaw fractures and the cost of treatment within Australia. This model will also have direct implications for strategic planning for prevention and management policies in Australia aimed at reducing the inequalities gap both in terms of geography as well as Aboriginality.

Environmental injustices in transnational context: urbanization and industrial hazards in El Paso/Ciudad Juarez	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE			English	Article							SINGLE-MOTHER FAMILIES; AIR-POLLUTION; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; JUSTICE ANALYSIS; CIUDAD-JUAREZ; HEALTH-RISKS; TOXICS; EQUITY; INEQUALITY; HAMILTON	The sister cities of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua form one of the largest manufacturing complexes in the world, and provide a unique context in which to examine transnational patterns of environmental injustice. In this paper, we explore residential patterns of environmental injustice related to the location of industrial facilities (ie maquiladoras and facilities regulated by the Toxics Release Inventory) in the El Paso Juarez metropolis, taking a comparative approach. Our results indicate a striking injustice in the raw level of industrial hazard confronted by residents on the Mexican side of the border compared with those on the US side-a direct result of location within the global economy. In terms of multivariate spatial regression results, patterns of exposure to residential hazards diverged between the two cities. In Mexico, generally marginal neighborhoods (based on low social class and higher proportions of migrants to the city) were located farther away from industry, whereas they were located closer in the US. We explain these findings on the basis of sociospatial differences in urbanization, social marginality, and industrial development between El Paso and Juarez, which reflect the two cities' juxtaposition vis-a-vis global political-economic dynamics. Future research is needed to test relationships between social marginality and industrial hazards in transnational and Southern contexts to determine if similar or divergent patterns exist.

Sociological pathways and perspectives for health promotion	GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						behaviour; control; inequalities; neighbourhood; school; social networks		Socio economic inequalities in adult health behaviour are consistently observed. Despite a well-documented pattern, social determinants of variations in health behaviour have not been sufficiently clarified. This article therefore presents sociological pathways to explain the existing inequalities in health behaviour. At a micro level, control beliefs have been part of several behavioural theories. We suggest that these beliefs might bridge the gap between sociology and psychology by emphasising their roots in fundamental socio-economic environments. At a meso level, social networks and support have not been explicitly considered as behavioural determinants. This contribution states that these social factors influence health behaviour while being unequally distributed across society. At a macro level, characteristics of the neighbourhood environment influence health behaviour of its residents above and beyond their individual background. Providing further opportunity for policy makers, it is shown that peer and school context equalise inequalities in risky behaviour in adolescence. As a conclusion, factors such as control expectations, social networks, neighbourhood characteristics, and school context should be included as strategies to improve health behaviour in socially disadvantaged people.

However, work-family conflicts and health behaviors have been little studied. This study examined the associations of conflicts between paid work and family life with unhealthy behaviors among British, Finnish, and Japanese employees. Data were derived from postal questionnaire surveys among 40 to 60 years old employees from three cohorts, the British Whitehall II Study (n = 3,397), the Finnish Helsinki Health Study (n = 4,958), and the Japanese Civil Servants Study (n = 2,901). Outcomes were current smoking, heavy drinking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy food habits. Work-family conflicts were measured with eight items. Age, marital status, and occupational class were adjusted for in logistic regression analyses. Work-family conflicts had few and inconsistent associations with unhealthy behaviors in all three cohorts. In the Finnish cohort, strong work-family conflicts were associated with current smoking among men. Women with strong conflicts had more often unhealthy food habits and were more often heavy drinkers than women with weaker conflicts. Likewise, British women with strong work-family conflicts were more often heavy drinkers. Although work-family conflicts were fairly prevalent in the examined cohorts, these conflicts had but few associations with the studied key health behaviors.

Addressing this challenge requires complex and multidisciplinary approaches. Sharing successful experiences from across Europe may therefore be of benefit. We describe the state of the art of cancer control structures in the 27 European Union countries, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, at the beginning of 2008. Information on cancer plans, cancer registries, cancer screening, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and smoking restrictions in each country was identified through PubMed, the official websites of national and international organizations and Google(TM) searches. Experts and/or health authorities from each country completed and validated the information. Sixteen countries had implemented national cancer plans in 2008. Twenty four countries had population-based cancer registries with 100% coverage. The exceptions were Greece and Luxembourg (no population-based registry yet), France, Italy and Spain (<50%), and Switzerland (62%). In 9 countries, population coverage of breast cancer screening was 100% with participation ranging from 26 to 87%; 8 countries did not have organized programmes. Seven countries had cervical cancer screening programmes with 100% coverage with participation ranging from 10 to 80%; 8 countries had no organized programme. Nine countries had announced national HPV vaccination policies by early 2008. Six countries had organized colorectal cancer screening programmes. Five countries had complete bans on smoking in public places. There is wide international heterogeneity in cancer control structures in Europe. This provides considerable scope and motivation for cooperation and sharing of experience.

Using a quantitative, cross-national analysis of data from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) among other sources, I find that child HIV/AIDS infections and adult female prevalence of the disease increase child mortality while female empowerment and gender equality decrease its prevalence. In addition, an interaction between female empowerment and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the adult population also reduces child mortality, revealing the significance of gender for where the disease is more concentrated. Findings are net of controls for economic development, population pressure, democratization, economic globalization, child health, child hunger, and region. The global realities of HIV/AIDS reveal the need for increasingly undertaking cross-national analysis of the disease and issues of gender, development, and women's contributions to human security.

Unethical female stereotyping in reproductive health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Discrimination; Ethics; Human rights; Moral agency; Reproductive health; Sexual health; Stereotyping	ADOLESCENTS	Stereotypes are generalized preconceptions defining individuals by group categories into which they are placed. Women have become stereotyped as homemakers and mothers, with the negative effect of precluding them from other roles and functions. Legislation and judicial constructions show a history, and often a continuing practice, of confining women to these stereotypical functions. In access to reproductive and sexual health care, for instance, women's requests have been professionally subject to approval of their husbands, fathers or comparable males. Choice of abortion is particularly significant, because it embeds moral values. Women's capacity to act as responsible moral agents is denied by stereotypical attitudes shown by legislators, judges, heads of religious denominations, and healthcare providers who consider women incapable of exercising responsible moral choice. These attitudes violate ethical requirements of treating patients with respect and equal justice. They can also result in violations of human rights laws that prohibit discrimination against women.

However, evidence of benefit remains weak. We report on the impact of a 10-year public health partnership between the UK and Swaziland. Swaziland has the highest rates of TB and HIV in the world. Health services are being overwhelmed and patients suffer the cost and inconvenience of centralized services. Our international health partnership was set up to promote the translation of public health research into practice. Methods The partnership is based on six principles: sustainability; robust measurement; evidence-based practice; patient-centred improvement; systems approach and researchers as implementers. Based on rigorous health needs assessments and informed by international evidence, we have achieved a number of successful changes. Results The partnership has been successful in the development of a community TB service; a chronic disease programme for epilepsy; implementation of guidelines; implementation of ART programmes; nurse-led community ART clinics; innovations to improve follow-up and expert patients. Conclusion Global inequalities are increasing rapidly and international partnership has an important role in tackling this threat.

Fred			Effect of time and exercise on the clearance rate of <SUP>201</SUP>Tl in normal and ischemic myocardium	NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						ischemia; myocardium; simultaneous dual isotope-single photon emission computed tomography; technetium; thallium	BLOOD-FLOW; KINETICS	Purpose Simultaneous dual isotope (SDI) acquisition of Tl-201 rest/Tc-99m-sestamibi stress-myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography is a desirable new procedure in nuclear cardiology. In this protocol Tl-201 is injected at rest but imaging is performed not earlier than after exercise. Therefore, one must be convinced that throughout exercise Tl-201 remains distributed in an identical pattern as at rest. Before SDI can be applied clinically, Tl-201 rest MPS before and after exercise test needs to be compared for equality. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of time and exercise on the clearance of preinjected Tl-201 in normal and ischemic myocardium. Methods In 122 patients rest Tl-201 and delayed (n=20) or poststress (n=102) Tl-201 imaging was performed. Quantitative analysis of mean counts-per-pixel was performed for each segment in a 17-segment model. Differences between rest and delayed or poststress Tl-201 MPS were calculated. Patients with a poststress Tl-201 image were divided into normal (N=66) and ischemic (N=36) groups. Visual analysis was performed by two independent observers scoring the 17 segments on a scale of 0-4. Results The overall difference between rest Tl-201 and poststress Tl-201 MPS was - 15.4%. Normal and ischemic patients showed 16.2 and 14.0% (P=0.17) washout, respectively. Visual assessment by two independent observers revealed no regional differences between rest Tl-201 and delayed or poststress Tl-201 MPS. Conclusion Tl-201 poststress MPS shows significant washout of thallium. This washout is not segmental, but global over the myocardium. No significant differences are found between normal and ischemic myocardium. The poststress Tl-201 MPS is a reliable reflection of rest perfusion. SDI acquisition of Tl-201 rest/Tc-99m-sestamibi stress-MPS is clinically applicable. Nucl Med Commun 31: 539-546 (C) 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Using a social-ecological framework, this study aimed to determine the individual, social and neighbourhood environmental correlates of physical activity amongst women living in such neighbourhoods. During 2007-2008 women (n = 4108) aged 18-45 years randomly selected from urban and rural neighbourhoods of low socioeconomic status in Victoria, Australia completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (long). They reported on individual (self-efficacy, enjoyment, intentions, outcome expectancies, skills), social (childcare, social support from family and friends/colleagues, dog ownership) and neighbourhood environmental (neighbourhood cohesion, aesthetics, personal safety, 'walking environment') factors. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the odds of increasing categories of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and transport-related physical activity (TRPA) for each individual, social and environmental factor. In partially adjusted analyses, all individual, social and environmental variables were positively associated with LTPA, while all individual factors, family and friend support and the walking environment were positively associated with TRPA. In fully adjusted multivariable models, all individual and social factors remained significantly associated with LTPA, while self-efficacy, enjoyment, intentions, social support, and neighbourhood 'walking environment' variables remained significantly associated with TRPA. In conclusion, individual and social factors were most important for LTPA, while individual, social and neighbourhood environmental factors were all associated with TRPA. Acknowledging the cross-sectional design, the findings highlight the importance of different levels of potential influence on physical activity in different domains, which should be considered when developing strategies to promote physical activity amongst women living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods.

The percent of demand satisfied is used as a proxy measure for access to family planning. In all regions, married women aged 15-19 have greater difficulty than older women in meeting their need for contraceptive services. Inequities in the percent of demand satisfied among individuals of varying economic status, area of residence, and education are observed in all regions except Central Asia. These gaps are larger and more common in sub-Saharan Africa. Strategies that seek to increase contraceptive use rapidly without consideration for disadvantaged groups are likely to increase observed inequities in percent of demand satisfied in the short term. Efforts to monitor progress toward the goals enumerated in 1994 at the International Conference on Population and Development and toward other development goals must go beyond global, regional, and national averages to address the needs of population groups that are at greatest risk of adverse health outcomes.

J	Richardson, E; Pearce, J; Mitchell, R; Day, P; Kingham, S				Richardson, Elizabeth; Pearce, Jamie; Mitchell, Richard; Day, Peter; Kingham, Simon			The association between green space and cause-specific mortality in urban New Zealand: an ecological analysis of green space utility	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; NATURAL-ENVIRONMENT; POSSIBLE MECHANISM; HEALTH; ADULTS; AREAS; PARTICIPATION; RESOURCE; EXPOSURE; GARDENS	Background: There is mounting international evidence that exposure to green environments is associated with health benefits, including lower mortality rates. Consequently, it has been suggested that the uneven distribution of such environments may contribute to health inequalities. Possible causative mechanisms behind the green space and health relationship include the provision of physical activity opportunities, facilitation of social contact and the restorative effects of nature. In the New Zealand context we investigated whether there was a socioeconomic gradient in green space exposure and whether green space exposure was associated with cause-specific mortality (cardiovascular disease and lung cancer). We subsequently asked what is the mechanism(s) by which green space availability may influence mortality outcomes, by contrasting health associations for different types of green space. Methods: This was an observational study on a population of 1,546,405 living in 1009 small urban areas in New Zealand. A neighbourhood-level classification was developed to distinguish between usable (i.e., visitable) and non-usable green space (i.e., visible but not visitable) in the urban areas. Negative binomial regression models were fitted to examine the association between quartiles of area-level green space availability and risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease (n = 9,484; 1996 - 2005) and from lung cancer (n = 2,603; 1996 - 2005), after control for age, sex, socio-economic deprivation, smoking, air pollution and population density. Results: Deprived neighbourhoods were relatively disadvantaged in total green space availability (11% less total green space for a one standard deviation increase in NZDep2001 deprivation score, p < 0.001), but had marginally more usable green space (2% more for a one standard deviation increase in deprivation score, p = 0.002). No significant associations between usable or total green space and mortality were observed after adjustment for confounders. Conclusion: Contrary to expectations we found no evidence that green space influenced cardiovascular disease mortality in New Zealand, suggesting that green space and health relationships may vary according to national, societal or environmental context. Hence we were unable to infer the mechanism in the relationship. Our inability to adjust for individual-level factors with a significant influence on cardiovascular disease and lung cancer mortality risk (e. g., diet and alcohol consumption) will have limited the ability of the analyses to detect green space effects, if present. Additionally, green space variation may have lesser relevance for health in New Zealand because green space is generally more abundant and there is less social and spatial variation in its availability than found in other contexts.

Setting and participants A total of 22 224 male and 4444 female adults who had served a sentence of at least 1 day in correctional facilities for illegal drug-related offences were identified from the judiciary records of the Ministry of Justice, Taiwan. Design and measurements The underlying causes of death were defined by the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision. Findings All-cause standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were 7 for schedule I (e.g. heroin) and 3 for schedule II (e.g. methamphetamine) drug offenders, respectively; accidents, suicide and circulatory diseases were three leading causes of death. After release, the risk of death among those drug offenders without subsequent incarceration increased gradually until the 9th month. Those who were aged 30 years or older, had an engagement with a higher-ranked schedule substance or who received severe sentences were two to three times more likely to die. Substantial reduction in the risk of death was linked with re-imprisonment. Conclusions The SMR estimates for external causes were greater than those for disease-related causes in drug offenders, and schedule I drugs-related mortality rate was twice as high as that with schedule II drugs. In transitioning from the correctional setting to the community, the health needs of drug offenders should be addressed by the provision of continuous, adequate medical care tailored to individual background, medical history and drug experience.

However, since passage of the Canada Health Act in the 1970s, that nation's health statistics have become increasingly superior. Although the costs of Canada's health system are high by international standards, they are much lower than U. S. costs. This paper describes several factors likely to be responsible for Canada's better health at lower cost: universal financial coverage through a so-called single payer; features conducive to a strong primary care infrastructure; and provincial autonomy under general principles set by national law.

J	Wagstaff, A				Wagstaff, Adam			SOCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE REEXAMINED	HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						social health insurance; health financing	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; CARE; FINANCE; COUNTRIES; EQUITY; MARKET; EUROPE; ASIA	Social health insurance (SHI) is enjoying something of a revival in parts of the developing world. Many countries that have in the past relied largely on tax finance (and out-of-pocket payments) have introduced SHI, or are thinking about doing so. And countries with SHI already in place are making vigorous efforts to extend coverage to the informal sector. Ironically, this revival is occurring at a time when the traditional SHI countries in Europe have either already reduced payroll financing in favor of general revenues, or are in the process of doing so. This paper examines how SHI fares in health-care delivery, revenue collection, covering the formal sector, and its impacts on the labor market. It argues that SHI does not necessarily deliver good quality care at a low cost, partly because of poor regulation of SHI purchasers. It suggests that the costs of collecting revenues can be substantial, even in the formal sector where non-enrollment and evasion are commonplace, and that while SHI can cover the formal sector and the poor relatively easily, it fares badly in terms of covering the non-poor informal sector workers until the economy has reached a high level of economic development. The paper also argues that SHI can have negative labor market effects. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Myanmar developed a health system strengthening (HSS) strategy and proposal through funding support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). The aim of this paper is to identify critical success factors in the development of the HSS strategy in Myanmar. Methods: The main source of information for this review includes international and national literature, and participant observation by the authors in the health systems analysis and HSS strategy development in Myanmar between 2007 and 2009. Results: Critical success factors in the development of the HSS strategy included evidence-based development of the strategy through a sector analysis, and a long-term approach to strategy development with wide stakeholder participation. This contributed to important strategy breakthroughs in the areas of health planning, health financing, human resource management and civil society partnerships. Conclusion: Implementation of the HSS strategy in Myanmar should position the MOH and partners well to implement challenging system reforms in the areas of health planning, financing and human resource management in the coming years, as well as support more coordinated efforts for relief and recovery effort following the Nargis natural disaster in 2008. These innovations in Myanmar, with evidence of similar breakthroughs in other countries of the Asian region including North Korea, Cambodia, Nepal and Sri Lanka, provides promising evidence of the potential of the HSS approach as an emerging health development paradigm, particularly in relation to responding to the issue of "within country" inequities in access to health care.

Review of the theoretical frameworks for the study of child development within public health and epidemiology	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Review								Background Care for child development has gained international momentum in research and community-based programming. It encompasses various domains including cognitive, psychomotor, emotional, behavioural and social development, and a multitude of factors that have the potential to influence its trajectories. However, the multidisciplinary nature of child development initiatives is marred by a lack of unified perspectives across disciplines, especially basic conceptual understanding generated in the fields of education and psychology, which are not effectively exploited in public health programmes and epidemiological research. Methods The article suggests a four-point evaluation criteria to child development theories based on the ability to communicate in (1) Cross-disciplines, (2) an Overarching facility to address various developmental domains, (3) the capacity to link child development with Lifelong developmental potentials and, most importantly, (4) Epidemiological capability to provide supporting empirical evidence for community-based public health interventions (COLE criteria). Results Key child development theories have been reviewed by broadly grouping them into three categories on the basis of content and approach, such as descriptive theories, psychological construct-based theories, and context-based theories. The strengths and challenges of these theories have been evaluated on the basis of COLE criteria. Conclusion Although most of these theories can contribute at different levels in child development initiatives, context-based theories have been particularly proposed to practitioners, researchers and policy makers for community-based programming, principally for its potential to address issues of social inequality, poverty and childcare practices, which are at the core of public health initiatives, and provide multiple level of opportunities to intervene.

Socioeconomic status and the risk of major depression: the Canadian National Population Health Survey	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							COMMON MENTAL-DISORDERS; BRITISH CIVIL-SERVANTS; SOCIAL-STATUS; INEQUALITIES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POSITION	Background There are few longitudinal studies investigating the risk of major depression by socioeconomic status (SES). In this study, data from the longitudinal cohort of Canadian National Population Health Survey were used to estimate the risk of major depressive episode (MDE) over 6 years by SES levels. Methods The National Population Health Survey used a nationally representative sample of the Canadian general population. In this analysis, participants (n=9589) were followed from 2000/2001 (baseline) to 2006/2007. MDE was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form for Major Depression. Results Low education level (OR=1.86, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.69) and financial strain (OR=1.65, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.28) were associated with an increased risk of MDE in participants who worked in the past 12 months. In those who did not work in the past 12 months, participants with low education were at a lower risk of MDE (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.76), compared with those with high education. Financial strain was not associated with MDE in participants who did not work. Working men who reported low household income (12.9%) and participants who did not work and reported low personal income (5.4%) had a higher incidence of MDE than others. Conclusions SES inequalities in the risk of MDE exist in the general population. However, the inequalities may depend on measures of SES, sex and employment status. These should be considered in interventions of reducing inequalities in MDE. MDE history is an important factor in studies examining inequalities in MDE.	[Wang, J.

Older men, work and health	OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD			English	Review						Employment; gender; health promotion; identity; older men; workplace health	CONSTRUCTION; WOMEN; LIFE	Methods The method used in the literature search was to review national and international research published in English since 1990 on the health and work of older men. Journal articles were the primary source. Databases used included Web of Science, CSA Illumina Social Sciences, CINAHL, Medline and ANGINFO. Results The review of the evidence was structured in terms of key themes emerging from the literature into which issues of gender, ethnicity, age and socio-economic inequalities were cross cut. The current paper now focuses on two of those themes that have particular relevance to occupational medicine: work-caused and work-related ill-health, and secondly promoting workplace health. It begins by setting the scene with a profile of older men in the labour market. Conclusions Two key themes emerge from the review, which are of particular significance. One is the central role that work plays in the lives and identity of men and therefore the impact this has on their health, both in and out of work. Secondly, the occupational histories of men expose them to work-related and work-caused ill-health, which has consequences for life expectancy and chronic disease in old age. These findings have implications for future research, policy formulation and implementation, and for public health practice.

Gender inequity in the provision of care for hip disease: population-based cross-sectional study	OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE			English	Article						Osteoarthritis; Health care provision; Total hip replacement; Gender inequity; Specialist care; General practice; Population-based study; Somerset and Avon Survey of Health (SASH)	KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERY; PATIENT PREFERENCES; HEALTH; EQUITY; OSTEOARTHRITIS; ARTHROPLASTY; REQUIREMENT; ACCESS; NEED; SEX	Objectives: To examine gender differences along the care pathway to total hip replacement. Methods: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of 26,046 individuals aged 35 years and over in Avon and Somerset. Participants completed a questionnaire asking about care provision at five milestones on the pathway to total hip replacement. Those reporting hip disease were invited to a clinical examination. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) [95% confidence intervals (CI)] for provision of care to women compared with men. Results: 3169 people reported hip pain, 2018 were invited for clinical examination, and 1405 attended (69.6%). After adjustment for age and disease severity, women were less likely than men to have consulted their general practitioner (OR 0.78, 95%-CI 0.61-1.00), as likely as men to have received drug therapy for hip pain in the previous year (OR 0.96, 95%-CI 0.74-1.24), but less likely to have been referred to specialist care (OR 0.53, 95%-CI 0.40-0.70), to have consulted an orthopaedic surgeon (OR 0.50, 95%-CI 0.32-0.78), or to be on a waiting list for total hip replacement (OR 0.41, 95%-CI 0.20-0.87). Differences remained in the 746 people who had sought care from their general practitioner, and after adjustment for willingness and fitness for surgery. Conclusions: There are gender inequalities in provision of care for hip disease in England, which are not fully accounted for by gender differences in care seeking and treatment preferences. Differences in referral to specialist care by general practitioners might unwittingly contribute to this inequity. Accurate information about availability, benefits and risks of hip replacement for providers and patients, and continuing education to ensure that clinicians interpret and correct patients' assumptions could help reduce inequalities.

It emphasizes public health, rule of law, and equality-driven socioeconomic development as principal concerns in preventing violence. In parts of Latin America, violence has become a serious public health and security problem. Prior studies have explored the risk factors associated with violence as well as experiences in its prevention. These studies and existing approaches to violence prevention provide evidence on where to direct attention and build prevention efforts. This article argues for integrated community-driven and national interventions to create cooperative national-local linkages and embed international human rights law at the national and local levels. Nations struggling with violence should be encouraged to apply an integrated framework to prevent violence and reinforce human security.

Based on international and national studies, the aims of this study were to develop a multi-dimensional index at the municipality level, to provide information about socio-economic deprivation in Hungary and to investigate the association between socio-economic status and the spatial distribution of premature mortality due to diseases of the circulatory system. Seven municipality level socio-economic indicators were used from the National Information System of Spatial Development (income, low qualification, unemployment, one-parent families, large families, density of housing and car ownership). After normalisation and standardisation, indicator weights were evaluated using factor analysis. A risk analysis study was conducted using the Rapid Inquiry Facility software to evaluate the association between deprivation and the spatial distribution of premature mortality due to diseases of the circulatory system for the years 1998-2004. Areas of significantly high deprivation were identified in the northeastern, eastern and southwestern parts of Hungary. A statistically significant association was found between premature cardiovascular mortality and deprivation status in both genders. The Deprivation Index is the first composite index at the municipality level in Hungary and includes key factors that affect socio-economic status. The identified association highlighted the fact that inequalities in socio-economic status may reflect the spatial distribution of health status in a population. The results can be used to inform prevention strategies and help plan local health promotion programs aimed at reducing health inequalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In Ethiopia, a decline was observed in under-five mortality rates from 204 to 123 per 1000 live births between 1990 and 2005, showing good progress towards the achievement of MDG4. A downward trend was observed in the maternal mortality ratio; however, because of the high degree of sampling variability, it is not possible to reach any firm conclusion about the possibility of achieving MDG5. Regarding MDG6, good progress was observed in controlling HIV/AIDS and malaria, whereas MDG indicators related to tuberculosis are still below international standards. Therefore, performance was not uniform across programmes. In general, interventions that can be routinely scheduled, such as immunisation, had much higher coverage than those that rely on functional health systems and clinical services proximate to households with 24 h availability, such as skilled care at birth. These mixed results highlight that, although MDGs focus on specific diseases and conditions, targets cannot be achieved without strengthening health systems. It is for this reason that the strategic health plan in Ethiopia is focusing on high-impact and cost-effective health interventions and on health systems strengthening.

J	Serafin, A				Serafin, Alina			Developing an understanding between people: The key to global health	TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE			English	Article						Global health; Travel; Medical education; Cultural understanding		Global health and international health are prominent concepts within development issues today. Health is at the heart of many of the Millennium Development Goals, and the idea of a human right to health and health care has taken more hold in the forefronts of our minds. In acknowledgement of the globalised and interdependent society in which we live, this reflective piece uses personal experiences of anthropology and travel throughout the author's medical education to illustrate the pressing need for a better understanding between health workers and local populations. Experiences in Ecuador, Peru, India and Nepal, highlight the plurality of medicine. They show how medical education in the UK forms only one part of medical knowledge, and in particular how clinical practice requires the appreciation of a wider context. Within a multi-cultural society, it is essential that medical students learn new skills for the future. Teaching Anthropology and Sociology within the curriculum in the UK can educate students about how knowledge is created within a culture and to appreciate the diversity between cultures. Consideration of patients' backgrounds and beliefs allows health workers to develop relationships with the local population, which can be of invaluable use in making global health equality a reality.

J	Koehn, P				Koehn, Peter			Climate policy and action 'underneath' Kyoto and Copenhagen: China and the United States	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							GOVERNANCE; NETWORKS	This contribution focuses on the role and promise of municipal-government climate-stabilization policies in the world's two largest greenhouse gases (GHG)-emitting nations. The article compares emission-mitigation authority, drivers, barriers, and activities at the city level in China and the United States. Recent municipal policy initiatives are analyzed within a policy context of climate-driven and climate-incidental municipal framings. For the most part, United States and Chinese cities have not yet adopted policy strategies that are intended to address GHG emissions directly and have not provided normative leadership in the interest of ecological justice. In both countries, however, increasingly independent and networked municipal governments are linking a diverse set of activities that focus on air-quality, health-promotion, and economic security to emissions reduction. These climate-incidental municipal policies establish commitments that are beginning to exert an important global environmental impact. Although noteworthy and exemplary in a political context of national resistance to emission mandates, in the absence of a coordinated and strategically framed commitment among cities across both countries and/or policies and targets agreed upon at national and international levels that generate and reinforce local government initiatives, fragmented, uneven, and incomplete municipal-government actions will continue to exert limited measurable and normative impact on global GHG emissions.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Burden of Disease data base is used to derive for the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) cause-specific rates of death and of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by age for adult women, and percent of total deaths and total DALYs for women in the reproductive ages, as related to maternal conditions and to three selected noncommunicable conditions, namely, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neuropsychiatry conditions. Inequalities by country income category are examined. Results. Maternal health conditions still form a substantial component of the disease burden, with an increasing burden of cardiovascular disease and cancer starting in the late reproductive years and beyond. The burden of neuropsychiatric conditions is also high during the reproductive years, reflecting possibly the stress of multiple roles of women as well as stress of war and conflict that permeate the EMR. Women in low- to middle-income countries suffer more from maternal health conditions and less from neuropsychiatry conditions than women in high-income countries. Conclusion. The wider disease burden of women should be addressed making use of available reproductive health services taking special account of interactions between reproductive and noncommunicable conditions for better health of women during and beyond reproduction. Better measures of the burden of illness should be developed. There is a special need for improved health information systems in the EMR.

Tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure during pregnancy in low- and middle-income countries: the need for social and cultural research	ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Review						Women's health issues in developing countries; tobacco; smoking; secondhand smoke; smokeless tobacco	CIGARETTE-SMOKING; EDUCATIONAL-LEVEL; YOUNG-PEOPLE; WOMEN; PREVALENCE; GENDER; TRENDS; PERCEPTIONS; PATTERNS; INEQUALITIES	Tobacco use is a leading cause of death and of poor pregnancy outcome in many countries. While tobacco use is decreasing in many high-income countries, it is increasing in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where by the year 2030, 80% of deaths caused by tobacco use are expected to occur. In many LMICs, few women smoke tobacco, but strong evidence indicates this is changing; increased tobacco smoking by pregnant women will worsen pregnancy outcomes, especially in resource-poor settings, and threatens to undermine or reverse hard-won gains in maternal and child health. To date, little research has focused on preventing pregnant women's tobacco use and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure in LMICs. Research on social and cultural influences on pregnant women's tobacco use will greatly facilitate the design and implementation of effective prevention programs and policies, including the adaptation of successful strategies used in high-income countries. This paper describes pregnant women's tobacco use and SHS exposure and the social and cultural influences on pregnant women's tobacco exposure; it also presents a research agenda put forward by an international workgroup convened to make recommendations in this area.

In many developing countries, water is a major factor constraining agricultural output, and income of the world's rural poor. Improved agricultural water management can contribute to poverty reduction through several pathways. First, access to reliable water improves production and productivity, enhances employment opportunities and stabilizes income and consumption. Secondly, it encourages the utilization of other yield-enhancing inputs and allows diversification into high-value products, enhances nonfarm outputs and employment, and fulfils multiple needs of households. Third, it may contribute either negatively or positively to nutritional status, health, societal equity and environment. The net impact of agricultural water management interventions on poverty may depend individually and/or synergistically on the working of these pathways. Improved access to water is essential, but not sufficient for sustained poverty reduction. Investments are needed in agricultural science and technology, policies and institutions, economic reform, addressing global agricultural trade inequities, etc. But how best to match the agricultural water management technologies, institutions and policies to the needs of the heterogeneous poor living in diverse agro-ecological settings remains unclear. This article provides a menu of promising pathways through which agricultural water management can contribute to sustained poverty reduction. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Immigration, Employment Relations, and Health: Developing a Research Agenda	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE			English	Article						immigration; employment relations; public health research; working conditions; health inequalities	UNITED-STATES; GENDER; WORK	Background International migration has emerged as a global issue that has transformed the lives of hundreds of millions of persons. Migrant workers contribute to the economic growth of high-income countries often serving as the labour force, performing dangerous, dirty and degrading work that nationals are reluctant to perform. Methods Critical examination of the scientific and "grey" literatures on immigration, employment relations and health. Results Both lay and scientific literatures indicate that public health researchers should be concerned about the health consequences of migration processes. Migrant workers are more represented in dangerous industries and in hazardous jobs, occupations and tasks. They are often hired as labourers in precarious jobs with poverty wages and experience more serious abuse and exploitation at the workplace. Also, analyses document migrant workers' problems of social exclusion, lack of health and safety training, fear of reprisals for demanding better working conditions, linguistic and cultural barriers that minimize the effectiveness of training, incomplete OHS surveillance of foreign workers and difficulty accessing care and compensation when injured. Therefore migrant status can be an important source of occupational health inequalities. Conclusions Available evidence shows that the employment conditions and associated work organization of most migrant workers are dangerous to their health. The overall impact of immigration on population health, however; still is poorly understood and many mechanisms, pathways and overall health impact are poorly documented. Current limitations highlight the need to engage in explicit analytical, intervention and policy research Am. J. Ind. Med. 53:338-343,2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Methods The prevalence of stunting (height-for-age z score below 2 using the Child Growth Standards of the World Health Organization) among children aged less than 5 years was estimated from data collected during national household surveys carried out in Brazil in 1974-75 (n = 34 409), 1989 (n = 7374), 1996 (n = 4149) and 2006-07 (n = 4414). Absolute and relative socioeconomic inequality in stunting was measured by means of the slope index and the concentration index of inequality, respectively. Findings Over a 33-year period, we documented a steady decline in the national prevalence of stunting from 37.1% to 7.1%. Prevalence dropped from 59.0% to 11.2% in the poorest quintile and from 12.1% to 3.3% among the wealthiest quintile. The decline was particularly steep in the last 10 years of the period (1996 to 2007), when the gaps between poor and wealthy families with children under 5 were also reduced in terms of purchasing power; access to education, health care and water and sanitation services; and reproductive health indicators. Conclusion In Brazil, socioeconomic development coupled with equity-oriented public policies have been accompanied by marked improvements in living conditions and a substantial decline in child undernutrition, as well as a reduction of the gap in nutritional status between children in the highest and lowest socioeconomic quintiles. Future studies will show whether these gains will be maintained under the current global economic crisis.

Appreciating that health outcomes are only partly affected by healthcare, clinicians and clinical communities can play a significant role in this crusade by action at local, regional, national and global levels. A concerted and systematic focus on integrating and industrialising upstream interventions at every healthcare encounter is essential to prevent future illness, thus enabling a paradigm shift in the healthcare service from being one of illness management to health preservation. The evidence base demonstrates the cost efficacy of upstream interventions. The challenge is how this evidence is utilised to implement these interventions in everyday healthcare. Today, with a global economic crisis and challenged public sector funding, the need to address prevention has never been more pressing. Clinical engagement at all levels, from the front line to the boardroom is vital. Clinicians must address access, communication, strategy and commissioning to fulfil a professional responsibility to become and remain the corporate memory of a health service focused on preventing illness while simultaneously delivering cost-effective healthcare.

United Nations data shows insufficient progress, especially in developing countries. In order to generate new information about this progress and the main barriers that hinder it, we conducted a systematic review to describe the scientific evidence concerning MDG7, and to analyse the quality of the studies. In order to identify all empirical quantitative studies (ecological, descriptive study, cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort), we searched the following databases between 23 and 26 June 2009: PubMed, EMBASE, ISI WoK, SCOPUS, EBSCO-Greenfile, CAB Abstracts, and LILACS. We identified six empirical studies which reported serious difficulties in the progress of MDG7 and identified socioeconomic inequalities, lack of infrastructure and contamination of water sources as the main barriers hindering its achievement. Environmental issues do not seem to be a priority in research and political agendas, while the international organisations continue to insist that the objective is extremely important. It is necessary to generate scientific knowledge around MDG7, and identify weakness in the indicators in order to adapt policies to the new challenges and make decisions based in best evidence.

International organizations, such as the WHO, have played an important role providing the principles to encourage action in many countries. Evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in health is widespread. National and cross-national research has led to the development of a new set of methodological tools to address the challenges that the available data present. Several methods have been used in the literature to measure inequalities in health; the concentration index approach is becoming widely used. In the future, the research agenda will continue to shift away from documenting health inequalities toward efforts to support the development of policies to improve the health of the most deprived populations and to reduce inequalities in health.

Comparative appraisal of educational inequalities in overweight and obesity among adults in 19 European countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Socio-economic inequalities; overweight; obesity; international overview; socio-economic development	SELF-REPORTED WEIGHT; BODY-MASS INDEX; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; MEDITERRANEAN DIET; HEALTH BEHAVIOR; LIFE-STYLE; POPULATION; HEIGHT; FINLAND; FOOD	Background In Western societies, a lower educational level is often associated with a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity. However, there may be important international differences in the strength and direction of this relationship, perhaps in respect of differing levels of socio-economic development. We aimed to describe educational inequalities in overweight and obesity across Europe, and to explore the contribution of level of socio-economic development to crossnational differences in educational inequalities in overweight and obese adults in Europe. Methods Cross-sectional data, based on self-reports, were derived from national health interview surveys from 19 European countries (N = 127 018; age range = 25-44 years). Height and weight data were used to calculate the body mass index (BMI). Multivariate regression analysis was employed to measure educational inequalities in overweight and obesity, based on BMI. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was used as a measure of level of socio-economic development. Results Inverse educational gradients in overweight and obesity (i.e. higher education, less overweight and obesity) are a generalized phenomenon among European men and even more so among women. Baltic and eastern European men were the exceptions, with weak positive associations between education and overweight and obesity. Educational inequalities in overweight and obesity were largest in Mediterranean women. A 10 000-euro increase in GDP was related to a 3% increase in overweight and obesity for low-educated men, but a 4% decrease for high-educated men. No associations with GDP were observed for women. Conclusion In most European countries, people of lower educational attainment are now most likely to be overweight or obese. An increasing level of socio-economic development was associated with an emergence of inequalities among men, and a persistence of these inequalities among women.

J	Hart, SM				Hart, Susan Margaret			Self-regulation, Corporate Social Responsibility, and the Business Case: Do they Work in Achieving Workplace Equality and Safety?	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						self-regulation; globalization; business case; corporate social responsibility; workplace equality; workplace safety	EQUITY; HEALTH	The political shift toward an economic liberalism in many developed market economies, emphasizing the importance of the marketplace rather than government intervention in the economy and society (Dorman, Systematic Occupational Health and Safety Management: Perspectives on an International Development, 2000; Tombs, Policy and Practice in Health and Safety 3(1):24-25, 2005; Walters, Policy and Practice in Health and Safety 03(2):3-19, 2005), featured a prominent discourse centered on the need for business flexibility and competitiveness in a global economy (Dorman, 2000; Tombs, 2005). Alongside these developments was an increasing pressure for corporate social responsibility (CSR). The business case for CSR - that corporations would benefit from voluntarily being socially responsible - was increasingly promoted by governments and corporations as part of the justification for self-regulation. The aim of the article is to examine more closely the proposition that self-regulation is effective, with particular reference to the business case for workplace equality and safety. Based on a comprehensive literature review and documentary analysis, it was found that current predominant management discourse and practice focusing on diversity and safety management systems (OHSMS) resonate well with a government and corporate preference for the business case and self-regulation. However, the centrality of individual rather than organizational factors in diversity and OHSMS means that systemic discrimination and inherent workplace hazards are downplayed, making it less likely that employers will initiate structural remedies needed for real change. Thus, reliance on the business case in the argument for self-regulation is problematic. In terms of government policy and management practice, the business case needs to be supplemented by strong, proactive legislation, and worker involvement.

Racial discrimination and health: A systematic review of scales with a focus on their psychometric properties	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Review						Race relations; Prejudice; Causality; Questionnaires; Psychometrics; Systematic review; Racial discrimination	PERCEIVED ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION; SELF-REPORT; VALIDATION; RACE; STRESS; QUESTIONNAIRE; ASSOCIATIONS; PERCEPTIONS; RELIABILITY; EXPERIENCES	The literature addressing the use of the race variable to study causes of racial inequities in health is characterized by a dense discussion on the pitfalls in interpreting statistical associations as causal relationships. In contrast, fewer studies have addressed the use of racial discrimination scales to estimate discrimination effects on health, and none of them provided a thorough assessment of the scales' psychometric properties. Our aim was to systematically review self-reported racial discrimination scales to describe their development processes and to provide a synthesis of their psychometric properties. A computer-based search in PubMed, LILACS, PsycInfo, Scielo, Scopus and Web of Science was conducted without any type of restriction, using search queries containing free and controlled vocabulary. After initially identifying 3060 references, 24 scales were included in the review. Despite the fact that discrimination stands as topic of international relevance, 23 (96%) scales were developed within the United States. Most studies (67%, N = 16) were published in the last 12 years, documenting initial attempts at scale development, with a dearth of investigations on scale refinements or cross-cultural adaptations. Psychometric properties were acceptable; sixteen of all scales presented reliability scores above 0.7, 19 out of 20 instruments confirmed at least 75% of all previously stated hypotheses regarding the constructs under consideration, and conceptual dimensional structure was supported by means of any type of factor analysis in 17 of 21 scales. However, independent researchers, apart from the original scale developers, have rarely examined such scales. The use of racial terminology and how it may influence self-reported experiences of discrimination has not yet been thoroughly examined. The need to consider other types of unfair treatment as concurrently important health-damaging exposures, and the idea of a universal instrument which would permit cross-cultural adaptations, should be discussed among researchers in this emerging field of inquiry.

J	López-Cevallos, DF; Chi, CH				Lopez-Cevallos, Daniel F.; Chi, Chunhuei			Assessing the context of health care utilization in Ecuador: A spatial and multilevel analysis	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							INCOME INEQUALITY; NEIGHBORHOOD; PERSPECTIVE; PHYSICIANS; MODELS; PLACE	Background: There are few studies that have analyzed the context of health care utilization, particularly in Latin America. This study examines the context of utilization of health services in Ecuador; focusing on the relationship between provision of services and use of both preventive and curative services. Methods: This study is cross-sectional and analyzes data from the 2004 National Demographic and Maternal & Child Health dataset. Provider variables come from the Ecuadorian System of Social Indicators (SIISE). Global Moran's I statistic is used to assess spatial autocorrelation of the provider variables. Multilevel modeling is used for the simultaneous analysis of provision of services at the province-level with use of services at the individual level. Results: Spatial analysis indicates no significant differences in the density of health care providers among Ecuadorian provinces. After adjusting for various predisposing, enabling, need factors and interaction terms, density of public practice health personnel was positively associated with use of preventive care, particularly among rural households. On the other hand, density of private practice physicians was positively associated with use of curative care, particularly among urban households. Conclusions: There are significant public/private, urban/rural gaps in provision of services in Ecuador; which in turn affect people's use of services. It is necessary to strengthen the public health care delivery system (which includes addressing distribution of health workers) and national health information systems. These efforts could improve access to health care, and inform the civil society and policymakers on the advances of health care reform.

J	Smith, K				Smith, Katherine			Research, policy and funding - academic treadmills and the squeeze on intellectual spaces	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						Public sociology; research funding; evidence-based policy; knowledge transfer; health inequalities; UK	PUBLIC-HEALTH POLICY; SOCIAL-SCIENCE; INEQUALITIES; IDEAS; KNOWLEDGE; SOCIOLOGY; RELEVANCE; GEOGRAPHY; POLITICS; ACCOUNTABILITY	In recent years, there has been a great deal of collective rumination about social scientists' role in society. In the post-1997 UK context, public policy commitments to 'evidence-based policy' and 'knowledge transfer' have further stimulated such reflections. More recently, Michael Burawoy's 2004 address to the American Sociological Association, which called for greater engagement with 'public sociology' has reverberated throughout the discipline, motivating a series of debates about the purpose of sociological research. To date, most such contributions have been based on personal experience and anecdotal evidence. In contrast, this paper responds directly to Burawoy's suggestion that we should 'apply sociology to ourselves,' in order that we 'become more conscious of the global forces' driving our research (Burawoy 2005: 285). Drawing on an empirical research project designed to explore of the relationship between health inequalities research and policy in Scotland and England, in the period from 1997 until 2007, this paper discusses data from interviews with academic researchers. The findings suggest that the growing pressure to produce 'policy relevant' research is diminishing the capacity of academia to provide a space in which innovative and transformative ideas can be developed, and is instead promoting the construction of institutionalized and vehicular (chameleon-like) ideas. Such a claim supports Edward Said's (1994) insistence that creative, intellectual spaces within the social sciences are increasingly being squeezed. More specifically, the paper argues we ought to pay far greater attention to how the process of seeking research funding shapes academic research and mediates the interplay between research and policy.

Socio-economic inequalities in childhood mortality in low- and middle-income countries: a review of the international evidence	BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN			English	Review						health inequality; child mortality; low- and middle-income countries; socioeconomic factors; review	HEALTH-CARE; INFANT-MORTALITY; MATERNAL EDUCATION; POOR; SURVIVAL; DETERMINANTS; INEQUITIES; EQUITY; GROWTH; RATES	In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the probability of dying in childhood is strongly related to the socio-economic position of the parents or household in which the child is born. This article reviews the evidence on the magnitude of socio-economic inequalities in childhood mortality within LMICs, discusses possible causes and highlights entry points for intervention. Evidence on socio-economic inequalities in childhood mortality in LMICs is mostly based on data from household surveys and demographic surveillance sites. Childhood mortality is systematically and considerably higher among lower socio-economic groups within countries. Also most proximate mortality determinants, including malnutrition, exposure to infections, maternal characteristics and health care use show worse levels among more deprived groups. The magnitude of inequality varies between countries and over time, suggesting its amenability to intervention. Reducing inequalities in childhood mortality would substantially contribute to improving population health and reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The contribution of specific determinants, including national policies, to childhood mortality inequalities remains uncertain. What works to reduce these inequalities, in particular whether policies should be universal or targeted to the poor, is much debated. The increasing political attention for addressing health inequalities needs to be accompanied by more evidence on the contribution of specific determinants, and on ways to ensure that interventions reach lower socio-economic groups.

A.; Otgonbold, Altankhuyag			Tracking maternal mortality declines in Mongolia between 1992 and 2007: the importance of collaboration	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article							STRATEGIES	Objective To describe the declining trend in maternal mortality observed in Mongolia from 1992 to 2007 and its acceleration after 2001 following implementation of the Maternal Mortality Reduction Strategy by the Ministry of Health and other partners. Methods We performed a descriptive analysis of maternal mortality data collected through Mongolia's vital registration system and provided by the Mongolian Ministry of Health. The Observed declining mortality trend was analysed for statistical significance using simple linear regression. We present the maternal mortality ratios from 1992 to 2007 by year and review the basic components of Mongolia's Maternal Mortality Reduction Strategy for 2001-2004 and 2005-2010. Findings Mongolia achieved a statistically significant annual decrease in its maternal mortality ratio of almost 10 deaths per 100 000 live births over the period 1992-2007. From 2001 to 2007, the maternal mortality ratio in Mongolia decreased approximately 47%, from 169 to 89.6 deaths per 100 000 live births. Conclusion Disparities in maternal mortality represent one of the major persisting health inequities between low- and high-resource countries. Nonetheless, important reductions in low-resource settings are possible through collaborative strategies based on a horizontal approach and the coordinated involvement of key partners, including health ministries, national and international agencies and donors, health-care professionals, the media, nongovernmental organizations and the general public.

Our objective was to better understand what is currently known about Aboriginal infant mortality rates (IMR) in Canada. Methods: As part of a larger international systematic review of Indigenous IMR calculation, we searched the published literature for original research regarding the calculation of First Nations, Inuit, and Metis infant mortality rates at the national and provincial/territorial level. Synthesis: We identified major deficiencies in the coverage and quality of infant mortality data for Aboriginal populations in Canada. The review of provincial and territorial reporting of infant mortality for Aboriginal populations revealed substantial provincial and territorial variation in the way that birth and death data were collected. With respect to coverage, high-quality IMRs were available only for Status Indians and communities with a high proportion of Inuit residents. No rates were available for Metis or non-Status Indians. Conclusion: Striking and persistent disparities persist in the IMRs for Status Indians and in communities with a high proportion of Inuit residents, compared to the general Canadian population. There is an urgent need to work in partnership with First Nations, Indian, Inuit, and Metis stakeholder groups to improve the quality and coverage of Aboriginal IMR information and to acquire information that would help to better understand and address the underlying causes of disparities in infant mortality between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal population in Canada.

Social inequality in perceived oral health among Sri Lankan adolescents	COMMUNITY DENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Adolescents; oral impacts; perceived oral health status; social inequality	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; BEHAVIOR; ADULTS	Objectives: to assess socio-economic inequalities in two perceived oral health outcomes namely perceived oral health status and perceived oral impacts among adolescents in Sri Lanka. Design: A cross-sectional study where the data where collected by means of structured questionnaires to the children and their parents. Participants: A total 1,225 15-year-old adolescents attending state, private and international schools in the Colombo district of Sri Lanka. Results: Inverse social gradients in perceived oral health status and perceived oral impacts were observed in relation to six socioeconomic indicators in the bivariate analyses. Adolescents from lower social positions had significantly reported more oral impacts and had rated their oral health as poor. But it was mainly the indicators of family material affluence that emerged as significant predictors of perceived oral health outcomes in the logistic regression analyses. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the existence of significant social gradients in perceived oral health outcomes among adolescents from a developing country. Further studies to assess causes of social gradients in perceived oral health outcomes are recommended.

The central aim of this research was to determine the form and coherence of oral health promotion elements within health policies of post-apartheid South Africa. The study set out to test the hypothesis that oral health promotion elements are fully integrated into health policy and programmatic efforts. A conceptual framework was developed to systematically analyse oral health promotion policy and subsequent decision-making across the country at national and provincial levels. The information was drawn from policy documents, protocols and programme plans, complemented by interviews. The results indicate distinct contradictions between the policy formulation process and its impact on health system decision-making. South African health policy was found to be strong on the rhetoric of equity, health promotion, integration and several other features of the Primary Health Care Approach, but showed little evidence of translating this into action. The development and implementation of oral health promotion appears to be dominated by the influence of dental professionals that perpetuate a curative focus on service delivery. There is an urgent need to re-examine the process and content of oral health policy-making in South Africa. The conceptual framework developed for this study could facilitate further research in this area.

The Prostitution Reform Act 2003 was created to protect sex workers from exploitation and to give them the same rights as other workers by protecting their occupation health and safety. It is an example of community empowerment in which a small and relatively powerless group of women strived to achieve social justice and equity for all sex workers. This article provides, for the first time, the story of how the NZPC was not only able to decriminalize prostitution but also to form a framework that safeguarded the rights of all sex workers in New Zealand. It is a fascinating case study that provides insightful information into how one civil society group had a direct influence on public policy. The implications of the case study to health promotion practice are discussed and will be of interest to planners and practitioners involved in the strengthening of community empowerment.

Method: Mental health researchers from 114 LAMIC in three continents were identified through their publications in two databases (Medline and PsycInfo) and from local grey literature. A questionnaire was developed and sent to authors to elicit information about researchers' background, available resources and details of up to three recent projects. Results: 4208 researchers from 83 countries were identified through 6340 mental health indexed-publications and 3598 publications from the grey literature. 912 researchers from 52 countries completed the questionnaires. Researchers and publications were concentrated in 10% of the countries. Respondents reported participation in 1847 projects, most of which were devoted to depression and anxiety disorders, substance misuse and psychoses. Epidemiologic studies, social, psychological and clinical research accounted for 80% of all projects. Two-thirds of projects had received external funding, and less than one-third of them were conducted in collaboration with other countries.

We then review recent progress in scaling up the coverage of health interventions. This includes a considerable increase in the volume of aid, accompanied by numerous new health initiatives and financing mechanisms. There have also been improvements in health outcomes and some examples of successful large-scale programmes. Finally, we reflect on the importance of obtaining a better understanding of how to deliver priority health interventions at scale, the current emphasis on health system strengthening and the challenges of sustaining scaling up in the prevailing global economic environment.

A nationally representative study of maternal obesity in England, UK: trends in incidence and demographic inequalities in 619 323 births, 1989-2007	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						maternal obesity; pregnancy; body mass index; health inequalities; epidemiology	BODY-MASS-INDEX; GESTATIONAL WEIGHT-GAIN; PREGNANCY; WOMEN; IMPACT	Background: There is an absence of national statistics for maternal obesity in the UK. This study is the first to describe a nationally representative maternal obesity research data set in England. Design: Retrospective epidemiological study of first trimester obesity. Methods: Data from 34 maternity units were analysed, including 619 323 births between 1989 and 2007. Data analysis included trends in first trimester maternal body bass index status over time, and geographical distribution of maternal obesity. Population demographics including maternal age, parity, ethnic group, deprivation and employment were analysed to identify any maternal obesity-associated health inequalities. All demographics were tested for multicollinearity. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for all demographics as confounders. Results: First trimester maternal obesity is significantly increasing over time, having more than doubled from 7.6% to 15.6% over 19 years (P<0.001), and shows geographic variation in incidence. There are also demographic health inequalities associated with maternal obesity, including increased odds of being obese with increasing age, parity, Black ethnic group and deprivation. There is also an association between morbid obesity and increased levels of unemployment. Conclusions: The increase in maternal obesity has serious implications for the health of mothers, infants and service providers, yielding an additional 47 500 women per year requiring high dependency care in England. The demography of women most at risk of first trimester obesity highlights health inequalities associated with maternal obesity, which urgently needs to be addressed.

A comprehensive, systematic, electronic search of Clinical Evidence, the Cochrane Library and PubMed, and a manual search of the Campbell Library and a journal supplement was carried out. Only two studies with randomization of sick leave were found. Patients, who were suspected of having whiplash injuries following a car accident, were randomly assigned to either 14 days on sick leave wearing a neck collar, or no neck collar or sick leave, and employees with musculoskeletal disorders were randomized to part-time sick leave and work adjustments, or full-time sick leave. Over 99% of the studies on sick leave were observational. The reason for the scarcity of randomized controlled trials is unknown. There is a definite, urgent need for randomized, controlled studies of the effects that sick leave has on health issues.

Culture, context and community: ethical considerations for global nursing research	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						Capacity Building; Developing Countries; Nursing; Qualitative Methods; Research Ethics	INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; SOCIAL DESIRABILITY; HEALTH; GLOBALIZATION; PERSPECTIVE; SERVICES	High-quality research is essential for the generation of scientific nursing knowledge and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. However, the incorporation of Western bioethical principles in the study design may not be suitable, sufficient or relevant to participants in low-income countries and may indeed be harmful and disrespectful. Before engaging in global health studies, nurses must consider carefully the cultural and social context and values of the proposed setting in order to situate the research within the appropriate ethical framework. The purpose of this paper was to examine the ethical principles and considerations that guide health research conducted in international settings using the example of a qualitative study of Ugandan nurses and nurse-midwives by a Canadian researcher. The application of Western bioethical principles with their emphasis on autonomy fails to acknowledge the importance of relevant contextual aspects in the conduct of global research. Because ethics is concerned with how people interact and live together, it is essential that studies conducted across borders be respectful of, and congruent with, the values and needs of the community in which it occurs. The use of a communitarian ethical framework will allow nurse scientists to contribute to the elimination of inequities between those who enjoy prosperity and good health, and those who do not.

To investigate the effects of socioeconomic instability and the availability of health resources on infant mortality rate. Background. In 1960, the infant mortality rate was 46 center dot 3 infants per 1000 live births in Macau but by 2006 it had declined to 2 center dot 7 infants per 1000 live births. Design. A retrospective design collecting yearly data for the Macau covering the period from 1957-2006. The infant mortality rate was the dependent variable and demographics, socioeconomic status and health resources are three main explanatory variables to determine the mortality rate. Methods. Regression modelling. Results. Results show that higher birth (Beta = 0 center dot 029, p = 0 center dot 004) and unemployment rates (Beta = -0 center dot 120, p = 0 center dot 036) and more public expenditure on health (Beta = -0 center dot 282, p < 0 center dot 001) were significantly more likely to reduce the infant mortality rate. Conclusions. These results indicate that the socioeconomically disadvantaged are at a significantly higher risk for infant mortality. In contrast, more public expenditure on health resources significantly reduces the risk for infant mortality. This study provides further international evidence that suggests that improving aspects of the healthcare system may be one way to compensate for the negative effects of social inequalities on health outcomes. Relevance to clinical practice. The implication of these results is that more effort, particularly during economic downturns, should be put into removing the barriers that impede access to healthcare services and increasing preventive care for the population that currently has less access to health care in communities where there is a scarcity of medical resources. In addition, efforts should be made to expand and improve the coverage of prenatal and infant healthcare programmes to alleviate regional differences in the use of health care and improve the overall health status of infants in Macau.

The benefits that are financed by taxation in one country may need to be purchased out of disposable income in another. We estimate the size and incidence of in-kind or "noncash" benefits from public housing subsidies, education, and health care for five European countries using comparable methods and data. Inequality in the augmented income measure is dramatically lower than in disposable income, with the effects of the three components varying in importance across countries. Adapting equivalence scales to take proper account of differences in needs for health care and education across population members reduces the scale of the effect, but does not eliminate it.

Stakeholder analysis for health research: Case studies from low- and middle-income countries	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Low- and middle-income countries; Health policy; Stakeholder analysis	POLICY; KNOWLEDGE	Objectives: Future Health Systems: Innovations for Equity (FHS) is working in six partner countries in Asia and Africa, focusing on strengthening the research-policy interface in relation to specific health system research projects. These projects present an opportunity to study the influence of stakeholders on research and policy processes. Study design: Qualitative stakeholder analysis. Methods: Stakeholder analysis was conducted in each FHS country using a structured approach. A cross-country evaluation was performed concentrating on six key areas: chosen research topic; type of intervention considered; inclusion/exclusion of stakeholder groups; general stakeholder considerations; power level, power type and agreement level of stakeholders; and classification of and approaches to identified stakeholders. Results: All six countries identified a range of stakeholders but each country had a different focus. Four of the six countries identified stakeholders in addition to the guidelines, while some of the stakeholder categories were not identified by countries. The mean power level of identified stakeholders was between 3.4 and 4.5 (1 = very low; 5 = very high). The percentage of classified stakeholders that were either drivers or supporters ranged from 60% to 91%. Conclusion: Three important common areas emerge when examining the execution of the FHS country stakeholder analyses: clarity on the purpose of the analyses; value of internal vs external analysts; and the role of primary vs secondary analyses. This paper adds to the global body of knowledge on the utilization of stakeholder analysis to strengthen the research-policy interface in the developing world.

The ability to track individuals as they make decisions and negotiate space may provide a fundamental advance. This paper introduces the need to move beyond conventional place-based perspectives in health research, and invokes the theoretical contributions of time geography and spatial ecology as opportunities to integrate human agency into contextual models of health. Issues around the geographical representation of place are reviewed, and the concept of the healthscape is introduced as an approach to operationalizing context as expressed by the spatial and temporal activities of individuals. We also discuss how these concepts have the potential to influence and contribute to empirical place and health research. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ethical dilemmas surrounding reproductive decisions and the care of preterm newborns impact the delivery of interventions, and are not well understood in low-resource settings. Issues such as how to address the moral and cultural attitudes surrounding stillbirths, have cross-cutting implications for global visibility of the disease burden. This analysis identifies ethical issues impacting definitions, discovery, development, and delivery of effective interventions to decrease the global burden of preterm birth and stillbirth. Methods: This review is based on a comprehensive literature review; an ethical analysis of other articles within this global report; and discussions with GAPPS's Scientific Advisory Council, team of international investigators, and a community of international experts on maternal, newborn, and child health and bioethics from the 2009 International Conference on Prematurity and Stillbirth. The literature review includes articles in PubMed, Academic Search Complete (EBSCO), and Philosopher's Index with a range of 1995-2008. Results: Advancements in discovery science relating to preterm birth and stillbirth require careful consideration in the design and use of repositories containing maternal specimens and data. Equally important is the need to improve clinical translation from basic science research to delivery of interventions, and to ensure global needs inform discovery science agenda-setting. Ethical issues in the development of interventions include a need to balance immediate versus long-term impacts-such as caring for preterm newborns rather than preventing preterm births. The delivery of interventions must address: women's health disparities as determinants of preterm birth and stillbirth; improving measurements of impact on equity in coverage; balancing maternal and newborn outcomes in choosing interventions; and understanding the personal and cross-cultural experiences of preterm birth and stillbirth among women, families and communities. Conclusion: Efforts to improve visibility, funding, research and the successful delivery of interventions for preterm birth and stillbirth face a number of ethical concerns. Thoughtful input from those in health policy, bioethics and international research ethics helped shape an interdisciplinary global action agenda to prevent preterm birth and stillbirth.

GAPPS Review Grp	Global report on preterm birth and stillbirth (7 of 7): mobilizing resources to accelerate innovative solutions (Global Action Agenda)	BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH			English	Review								Background: Preterm birth and stillbirth are complex local and global health problems requiring an interdisciplinary approach and an international commitment. Stakeholders developed recommendations for a Global Action Agenda (GAA) at the 2009 International Conference on Prematurity and Stillbirth. The primary goal of this GAA is to forge a collaborative effort toward achieving common goals to prevent preterm birth and stillbirth, and to improve related maternal, newborn, and child health outcomes. Conference participants: GAPPS co-convened this four-day conference with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, March of Dimes, PATH, Save the Children, UNICEF and the World Health Organization. Participants included about 200 leading international researchers, policymakers, health care practitioners and philanthropists. A near-final draft of this report was sent three weeks in advance to help co-chairs and participants prepare for workgroup discussions. Global Action Agenda: Twelve thematic workgroups, composed of interdisciplinary experts, made recommendations on short-, intermediate-, and long-term milestones, and success metrics. Recommendations are based on the following themes: (1) advance discovery of the magnitude, causes and innovative solutions; (2) promote development and delivery of low-cost, proven interventions; (3) improve advocacy efforts to increase awareness that preterm birth and stillbirth are leading contributors to the global health burden; (4) increase resources for research and implementation; and (5) consider ethical and social justice implications throughout all efforts. Summary: The conference provided an unprecedented opportunity for maternal, newborn and child health stakeholders to create a collaborative strategy for addressing preterm birth and stillbirth globally. Participants and others have already completed or launched work on key milestones identified in the GAA. Updates will be provided at www.gapps.org.

J	Dziak, E; Janzen, BL; Muhajarine, N				Dziak, Ewelina; Janzen, Bonnie L.; Muhajarine, Nazeem			Inequalities in the psychological well-being of employed, single and partnered mothers: the role of psychosocial work quality and work-family conflict	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article							MENTAL-HEALTH; SCREENING SCALES; DISTRESS; STRESS; STRAIN	Background: A large body of international research reveals that single mothers experience poorer mental health than their partnered counterparts, with socioeconomic disadvantage identified as an important contributory factor in understanding this health disparity. Much less research, however, has focused specifically on the psychological well-being of single mothers who are employed, despite their growing presence in the labor force. Of the research which has considered employment, the focus has been on employment status per se rather than on other important work-related factors which may impact psychological health, such as psychosocial work quality and work-family conflict. The aim of this study was to: (1) compare employed single mothers and employed partnered mothers on measures of psychological distress, psychosocial work quality and work-family conflict; and (2) explore the potential role of work-family conflict and psychosocial work quality as explanations for any observed differences in psychological distress based on partner status. Method: Analysis of data obtained from a cross-sectional telephone survey of employed parents in a mid-sized Western Canadian city. Analyses were based on 674 employed mothers (438 partnered and 236 single), who were 25-50 years old, with at least one child in the household. Results: Compared to employed single mothers, employed partnered mothers were older, had more education and reported fewer hours of paid work. Single mothers reported higher levels of psychological distress, financial hardship, work-family conflict and poor psychosocial work quality. Statistical adjustment for income adequacy, psychosocial work quality and work-family conflict each independently resulted in single motherhood no longer being associated with psychological distress. Conclusions: While single employed mothers did experience higher levels of psychological distress than their partnered counterparts, differences between these groups of women in income adequacy, psychosocial work quality, and work-family conflict were found to explain this relationship. Future research employing a longitudinal design and subject to lower selection biases is required to tease out the interrelationship of these three life strains and to point to the most appropriate economic and social policies to support single mothers in the workforce.

J	Sumskas, L; Lenciauskiene, I; Zaborskis, A				Sumskas, Linas; Lenciauskiene, Ilona; Zaborskis, Apolinaras			Health behavior inequalities among Lithuanian, Polish and Russian school-aged children in Lithuania	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article						Adolescents; Ethnicity; Self-rated health; Health behavior; Inequalities	DETERMINANTS; ETHNICITY	The aim of this study was to compare and get a deeper insight into issues of the health and health behavior inequalities among Lithuanian, Polish and Russian school-aged children in national and international contexts. Investigations were carried out in the framework of Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) study - a WHO collaborative cross-national survey. Five thousand seven hundred and seventy six randomly selected students aged 11, 13, and 15 years of age answered questionnaires in the classroom in 108 schools located in different regions in Lithuania in March-April of 2006. Questions on perceived health and health related behaviors were addressed to the respondent (response rate was 95%). 5632 questionnaires were selected for further analysis by the international data center in Bergen. SPSS version 11.5 and multilevel analysis program MLwiN 2.0 was applied for statistical analysis of data. Relatively minor inequalities in health and health behavior were established when comparing different health and health behavior indicators in Lithuanian, Polish and Russian school-aged children in Lithuania. These disparities are lower in comparison with differences, which were established among respondents of HBSC international studies. Odds ratios to have negative self-rated health evaluation were higher in girls of Russian (OR-1.71, p<0.05) and Polish (OR-1.62, p<0.05) nationality. Therefore, Russian and Polish students were tending to have higher odds ratios for perception of happiness (p<0.05). Respondents of Russian nationality have expressed less somatic and psychological complaints. Polish boys (OR=1.38, p<0.05) were tending for higher prevalence of headache, but have expressed fewer complaints for depression (OR=0.65, p<0.05), anxiety (OR=0.71, p<0.05). Chances to be involved in risk taking behaviors (alcohol consumption, smoking, drug use) were lower among Polish and Russian respondents. In schools with Lithuanian language based-schoold, health and health behavior indicators were more negative in Polish and Russian respondents in comparisons with their Lithuanian peers However, Lithuanian students, who were enrolled in Russian and Polish schools, tending to have better perceived health evaluation and better health behavior in comparison with their peers of Polish and Russian nationality. Analysis shows, that Polish and Russian students are integrated well into Lithuanian society and being a member of the minority class is not related to poor health or negative lifestyle. Therefore, with few exceptions universal health promotion programs should be provided to school-aged children of all ethnicities and cultural backgrounds.

J	Bolte, G; Tamburlini, G; Kohlhuber, M				Bolte, Gabriele; Tamburlini, Giorgio; Kohlhuber, Martina			Environmental inequalities among children in Europe-evaluation of scientific evidence and policy implications	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						exposure; health inequalities; pollution; social determinants; socio-economic position	ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE; TOBACCO-SMOKE EXPOSURE; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; HEALTH DISPARITIES; LIVING-CONDITIONS; AIR-POLLUTION; DETERMINANTS; AIRCRAFT; POVERTY; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Background: Socio-economic inequalities in the living environment are major contributing factors to health inequalities. Consequently, protecting children from undesirable environmental exposures by taking socio-economic conditions into account has been identified as a policy priority area in Europe. This review aims to evaluate the evidence on environmental inequalities among children in Europe and to discuss its policy implications. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in various literature databases. Further sources for information were reviews, international reports and working documents for a WHO expert meeting on environmental inequalities in 2009. One major inclusion criterion for publications was consideration of socio-economic factors as influencing factors, not merely as confounder. Results: The overall pattern based on the available fragmentary data is that children living in adverse social circumstances suffer from multiple and cumulative exposures. A low socio-economic position is associated with an increased exposure of children to traffic-related air pollution, noise, lead, environmental tobacco smoke, inadequate housing and residential conditions and less opportunities for physical activity. For most topics and exposures reviewed here there were no studies investigating the modification of the exposure-response function by socio-economic factors. Due to a variety of methodological approaches and studies on one hand and lack of data for many topics and countries on the other hand it was not possible to quantify the magnitude of environmental inequalities. Conclusion: Action is needed along the whole causal pathway of the social divide in environmental hazards with priority to policy measures aiming at removing socially determined differences in environmental conditions.

J	Deguen, S; Zmirou-Navier, D				Deguen, Severine; Zmirou-Navier, Denis			Social inequalities resulting from health risks related to ambient air quality-A European review	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						air pollution; environmental inequalities; health inequalities; social determinants	ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; DAILY MORTALITY; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; POLLUTION; DEPRIVATION; EXPOSURE; JUSTICE; MODIFIERS; LEEDS	Background: Environmental nuisances, including ambient air pollution, are thought to contribute to social inequalities in health. There are two major mechanisms, which may act independently or synergistically, through which air pollution may play this role. Disadvantaged groups are recognized as being more often exposed to air pollution (differential exposure) and may also be more susceptible to the resultant health effects (differential susceptibility). Method: European research articles were obtained through a literature search in the Medline database using keywords 'Socioeconomic Factors, Air Pollution, Health' and synonymous expressions. Results: Some studies found that poorer people were more exposed to air pollution whereas the reverse was observed in other papers. A general pattern, however, is that, irrespective of exposure, subjects of low socio-economic status experience greater health effects of air pollution. So far as we are aware, no European study has explored this relationship among children. Conclusion: The housing market biases land use decisions and may explain why some subgroups suffer from both a low socio-economic status and high exposure to air pollution. Some data may be based on inaccurate exposure assessment. Cumulative exposures should be taken into account to explore health problems more accurately. The issue of exposure and health inequalities in relation to ambient air quality is complex and calls for global appraisal. There is no single pattern. Policies aimed at reducing the root causes of these inequalities could be based on urban multipolarity and diversity, two attributes that require long-term urban planning.

National income, self-reported wheezing and asthma diagnosis from the World Health Survey	EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL			English	Article						Asthma; income inequality; prevalence; wheezing; World Health Survey	HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS; ATOPIC ECZEMA; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; DISEASES	The aims of this study were to quantify and describe the variations in respiratory symptoms and diagnosis prevalence across regions of the world according to national income. In 2002 and 2003, the World Health Organization implemented the World Health Survey (WHS), which used a standardised survey instrument to compile comprehensive baseline information on health and healthcare expenditure. We analysed the WHS data to assess the global patterns of self-reported wheeze and doctor-diagnosed asthma, two commonly reported measures of respiratory health. In total there were 308,218 participants with complete records, from 64 countries. The weighted mean age of the survey population was 43 yrs. Global prevalence of current wheezing symptoms ranged from 2.4% in Vietnam to 24% in Brazil; the prevalence of diagnosed asthma ranged from 1.8% in Vietnam to 32.8% in Australia. Overall, the prevalence of symptoms and diagnosis showed a U-shaped pattern with the largest prevalence reported in low- and high-income countries. The smallest prevalence was consistently found in middle-income countries. These WHS analyses have provided global prevalence estimates of wheeze and doctor-diagnosed asthma using data gathered simultaneously and consistently across six continents. These findings support the need for continued global respiratory illness surveillance for disease prevention, health policy and management.

J	Marmot, M; Bell, R				Marmot, Michael; Bell, Ruth			Health Equity and Development: the Commission on Social Determinants of Health	EUROPEAN REVIEW			English	Article								From the start, the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health built its case for taking action on the social determinants of health, unashamedly, on principles of social justice. Quite simply, the Commission stated that health inequities in the sense of avoidable and preventable differences in health between countries, and between groups within countries according to income, occupation, education, ethnicity or between men and women, are unjust. Taking this position has brought praise and blame: praise for the Commission's boldness in putting fairness on the global health agenda(1) in the face of the dominant global model of economic growth as an end in itself, and blame for the Commission's unworldliness in apparently not recognising that economic arguments push the political agenda.

J	Vågerö, D				Vagero, Denny			The East-West Health Divide in Europe: Growing and Shifting Eastwards	EUROPEAN REVIEW			English	Article								Over a four-decade long period, a health gap has opened up between European countries, in particular along the East/West dimension. One could speak of a European health divide. The divide is growing larger and, at the same time, shifting eastwards, leaving countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova at an increasing health disadvantage. Health inequalities, or differences between social classes, within European countries also seem to have been growing for the last couple of decades. Those countries that were previously led by communist regimes today show larger health inequalities than do countries in Western Europe. The countries that were once part of the Soviet Union demonstrate the most alarming health trends, with large segments of the population actually experiencing falling life expectancies. Reducing global and European health inequalities so that the health chances of a newborn child are not dependent on which country and social class he or she is born in, is a truly formidable task, which implies an entirely new way of seeing human development.

J	Paul, P; Mukhopadhyay, K				Paul, Pallab; Mukhopadhyay, Kausiki			Growth via Intellectual Property Rights Versus Gendered Inequity in Emerging Economies: An Ethical Dilemma for International Business	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						agricultural sector; equity; gender; growth; intellectual property rights; multilayered governance	CORPORATE; HEALTH; INDIA; FOOD; AGRICULTURE; ACCESS	In this paper, we critique the emergent international normative framework of growth - the knowledge economy. We point out that the standardized character of knowledge economy's flagship - intellectual property rights (IPRs) - has an adverse impact on women in emerging economies, such as India. Conversely, this impact on women, a significant consumer segment, has a feedback effect in terms of market growth. Conceptually, we analyze the consequences of knowledge economy and standardized IPR through a feminist lens. We extend the analyses by pointing to various contradictions surrounding growth norms; for example, there are inherent contradictions between established "formal" legalistic interpretation of IPR, "soft law" norms of corporate social responsibility, a fluid situation of moral claims of human rights, and different institutional capabilities at the international and domestic level. Consequently, we are able to demonstrate how standard IPR laws fail to deliver equity for all. We argue our case through exploring the growth aspects of the agricultural sector in India and the adverse impact of standard biopatenting on women farmers' rights (as producers and consumers) and preservation of environment. We suggest that desired gendered equity is better achieved when there is a constellation of actors - private-sector business, the state, and civil-society leaders - working together to ensure a balanced development through tailoring of IPR to local needs.

Time trends in childhood and adolescent obesity in England from 1995 to 2007 and projections of prevalence to 2015	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; FOLLOW-UP; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; CHILDREN; OVERWEIGHT; HEALTH; MORTALITY; NUTRITION; AGE	Background The aim was to examine the 1995-2007 childhood and adolescent obesity trends and project prevalence to 2015 by age group and social class. Methods Participants were children aged 2-10 and adolescents aged 11-18 years from general population households in England studied using repeated cross-sectional surveys. Obesity was computed using international standards. Prevalence projections to 2015 were based on extrapolation of linear and non-linear trends. Results Obesity prevalence increased from 1995 to 2007 from 3.1% to 6.9% among boys, and 5.2% to 7.4% among girls. There are signs of a levelling off trend past 2004/5. Assuming a linear trend, the 2015 projected obesity prevalence is 10.1% (95% CI 7.5 to 12.6) in boys and 8.9% (5.8 to 12.1) in girls, and 8.0% (4.5, 11.5) in male and 9.7% (6.0, 13.3) in female adolescents. Projected prevalence in manual social classes is markedly higher than in non-manual classes [ boys: 10.7% (6.6 to 14.9) vs 7.9% (3.7 to 12.1); girls: 11.2% (7.0 to 15.3) vs 5.4% (1.3 to 9.4); male adolescents: 10.0% (5.2 to 14.8) vs 6.7% (3.4 to 10.0); female adolescents: 10.4% (5.0 to 15.8) vs 8.3% (4.3 to 12.4)]. Conclusion If the trends in young obesity continue, the percentage and numbers of obese young people in England will increase considerably by 2015 and the existing obesity gap between manual and non-manual classes will widen further. This highlights the need for public health action to reverse recent trends and narrow social inequalities in health.

Although undocumented migration has become an issue of high international relevance, it has been strikingly understudied in Canada, especially with respect to its impact on health. The purpose of this study is to explore the concept of undocumentedness in Canada through a scoping review of peer-reviewed and grey literature written in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish between 2002 and 2008. The specific aims are to: (i) summarize and disseminate current academic and community-based findings on the health, service access and working conditions of undocumented migrants in Canada; (ii) examine the sources and use of evidence; (iii) identify significant gaps in existing knowledge; (iv) set recommendations for policy and research, including considerations on transnationalism, ethics, interdisciplinary approaches, gender differences, resilience, and impact on the children of non-status parents.

Methods: Data came from the Spanish COPSOQ (ISTAS 21) and the Danish COPSOQ II surveys both performed in 2004-05 and based on national representative samples of employees with a 60% response rate. Study population was 3,359 Danish and 6,685 Spanish women and men. Only identical items from both surveys were included to construct 18 psychosocial scales. Socioeconomic status was categorized according to the European Socioeconomic Classification System. Analysis included ordinal logistic regression and multiple correspondence analysis after categorizing all scales. Results: A relationship between socioeconomic status and psychosocial work environment in both Denmark and Spain was observed, with wider social inequalities in Spain for many scales, describing a strong interaction effect between socioeconomic status and country. Conclusions: Socioeconomic status is related to psychosocial work environment and some adverse psychosocial conditions tend to cluster in lower socioeconomic status groups in both Spain and Denmark. This effect could be modified by a country's characteristics, such as economic and labour market structures, normative regulations and industrial relations including work organization. Hence, preventive strategies to reduce social inequalities in working conditions should consider the combination of actions at the macro and micro levels.

Types of translational research are said to involve questionable benefits, special risks, additional barriers to informed consent, and severe conflicts of interest. Translational research conducted on the global poor is thought to exploit them and increase international disparities. Some commentators support especially stringent ethical review. However, such concerns are grounded only in pre-approval translational research (now called T1). Whether or not T1 has these features, translational research beyond approval (T2: phase IV, health services, and implementation research) is unlikely to and, when conducted on the global poor, may support development. Therefore, insofar as T1 is morally problematic, and no independent objections to T2 exist, the ethics of translational research is diverse: while some translational research is problematic, some is not. Funding and oversight should reflect this diversity, and T2 should be encouraged, particularly when conducted among the global poor.

How to Do Research Fairly in an Unjust World	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS			English	Article						developing countries; fair benefits; global; justice; research ethics	HUMAN-RIGHTS; EXPLOITATION; HEALTH; BENEFITS; TRIALS; TRANSMISSION; EQUALITY	International research, sponsored by for-profit companies, is regularly criticised as unethical on the grounds that it exploits research subjects in developing countries. Many commentators agree that exploitation occurs when the benefits of cooperative activity are unfairly distributed between the parties. To determine whether international research is exploitative we therefore need an account of fair distribution. Procedural accounts of fair bargaining have been popular solutions to this problem, but I argue that they are insufficient to protect against exploitation. I argue instead that a maximin principle of fair distribution provides a more compelling normative account of fairness in relationships characterised by extreme vulnerability and inequality of bargaining potential between the parties. A global tax on international research would provide a mechanism for implementing the maximin account of fair benefits. This model has the capacity to ensure fair benefits and thereby prevent exploitation in international research.

Translating Research Evidence Into Practice to Reduce Health Disparities: A Social Determinants Approach	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							HIV PREVENTION; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT; POLICY; CANCER; RISK	Translating research evidence to reduce health disparities has emerged as a global priority. The 2008 World Health Organization Commission on Social Determinants of Health recently urged that gaps in health attributable to political, social, and economic factors should be closed in a generation. Achieving this goal requires a social determinants approach to create public health systems that translate efficacy documented by research into effectiveness in the community. We review the scope, definitions, and framing of health disparities and explore local, national, and global programs that address specific health disparities. Such efforts translate research evidence into real-world settings and harness collaborative social action for broad-scale, sustainable change.

This papers aims to 1) examine the effects of different socioeconomic factors on physical functioning and psychological well-being among older adults in a rural community in northern Vietnam; and 2) investigate the extent to which the two outcomes variables co-vary within individuals. Methods: We analyzed the data from the WHO/INDEPTH study on global ageing and adult health conducted on 8535 people aged 50 years old and over in Bavi district of Vietnam in 2006. A multivariate response model was constructed to answer our research questions. The model treats the individual as a level two unit and the multiple measurements observed within an individual as a level one unit. Results: Lower physical functioning and psychological well-being were found in 1) women; 2) older people; 3) people with lower education level; 4) people who were currently single; 5) respondents from poorer household; and 6) mountainous dwellers compared to that in those of other category(ies) of the same variable. Socioeconomic factors accounted for about 24% and 7% of variation in physical functioning and psychological well-being scores, respectively. The adjusted correlation coefficient (0.35) indicates that physical functioning and psychological well-being did not strongly co-vary. Conclusions: The present study shows that there exist problems of inequality in health among older adults in the study setting. This finding highlights the importance of analyzing multiple dimensions of health status simultaneously in inequality investigations.

Compiling mortality statistics from civil registration systems in Viet Nam: the long road ahead	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article							VITAL-STATISTICS; VERBAL AUTOPSY; DEATH	Accurate mortality statistics, needed for population health assessment, health policy and research, are best derived from data in vital registration systems. However, mortality statistics from vital registration systems are not available for several countries including Viet Nam. We used a mixed methods case study approach to assess vital registration operations in 2006 in three provinces in Viet Nam (Hoa Binh, Thua Thien-Hue and Binh Duong), and provide recommendations to strengthen vital registration systems in the country. For each province we developed life tables from population and mortality data compiled by sex and age group. Demographic methods were used to estimate completeness of death registration as an indicator of vital registration performance. Qualitative methods (document review, key informant interviews and focus group discussions) were used to assess administrative, technical and societal aspects of vital registration systems. Completeness of death registration was low in all three provinces. Problems were identified with the legal framework for registration of early neonatal deaths and deaths of temporary residents or migrants. The system does not conform to international standards for reporting cause of death or for recording detailed statistics by age, sex and cause of death. Capacity-building along with an intersectoral coordination committee involving the Ministries of Justice and Health and the General Statistics Office would improve the vital registration system, especially with regard to procedures for death registration. There appears to be strong political support for sentinel surveillance systems to generate reliable mortality statistics in Viet Nam.

The failure of systematic reviews to consider effects on health equity is cited by decision-makers as a limitation to their ability to inform policy and program decisions. Objectives To systematically review methods to assess effects on health equity in systematic reviews of effectiveness. Search strategy We searched the following databases up to July 2 2010: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, the Cochrane Methodology Register, CINAHL, Education Resources Information Center, Education Abstracts, Criminal Justice Abstracts, Index to Legal Periodicals, PAIS International, Social Services Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Digital Dissertations and the Health Technology Assessment Database. We searched SCOPUS to identify articles that cited any of the included studies on October 7 2010. Selection criteria We included empirical studies of cohorts of systematic reviews that assessed methods for measuring effects on health inequalities. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted using a pre-tested form by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias was appraised for included studies according to the potential for bias in selection and detection of systematic reviews. Main results Thirty-four methodological studies were included. The methods used by these included studies were: 1) Targeted approaches (n=22); 2) gap approaches (n=12) and gradient approach (n=1). Gender or sex was assessed in eight out of 34 studies, socioeconomic status in ten studies, race/ethnicity in seven studies, age in seven studies, low and middle income countries in 14 studies, and two studies assessed multiple factors across health inequity may exist. Only three studies provided a definition of health equity. Four methodological approaches to assessing effects on health equity were identified: 1) descriptive assessment of reporting and analysis in systematic reviews (all 34 studies used a type of descriptive method); 2) descriptive assessment of reporting and analysis in original trials (12/34 studies); 3) analytic approaches (10/34 studies); and 4) applicability assessment (11/34 studies). Both analytic and applicability approaches were not reported transparently nor in sufficient detail to judge their credibility. Authors' conclusions There is a need for improvement in conceptual clarity about the definition of health equity, describing sufficient detail about analytic approaches (including subgroup analyses) and transparent reporting of judgments required for applicability assessments in order to assess and report effects on health equity in systematic reviews.

Capitalising on these advances is a critical step in empowering the professions and a sound investment in the health of the nation. There remains a need to energise and empower the professions, to see our work as an enterprise that has value and a sense of worth because of our professional activities as well as for the political and economic contributions we make to health and wellbeing, quality of life and social justice. The contributions made by nurses and midwives need to be articulated in the policy arena, focused in professional decision-making and elaborated in our research agendas. Our professional organisations provide opportunities for solidarity, and the leverage we need to effect change at the bedside, the community and the whole of society. Renewed commitment to primary health care at the global, national and community level provides a timely rallying call to the professions to refine the way we articulate our position in health care, re-commit to culturally appropriate, socially just actions and embolden our professional goals to inspire the next generations of nurses for a more equitable future.

J	Perera, S				Perera, Suvendrini			Torturous dialogues: Geographies of trauma and spaces of exception	CONTINUUM-JOURNAL OF MEDIA & CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article								How are suffering, damage and disaster produced and made visible across different sites, and how are they made to count, to matter? This essay considers certain philosophical, historical and geopolitical coordinates that locate trauma and disaster in the context of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. Trauma in its various significations - the banal, the aesthetic, the philosophical, the medicalized, the political, the pathologized - is an essential form of currency in the torturous dialogues that make, define and delineate the contours of disaster, damage and suffering. These are constitutively geopoliticized, as they are racialized and gendered, processes. Trauma is a medium that enables dialogue and exchange; it is eminently transactable, mobile and adaptable in its circulation between the refugee camp and the disaster victims' camp; it ramifies, with uneven meanings and effects, across and between subjects, scenes, sites, practices and relations. This essay considers the geopolitics of the tsunami as a globalized trauma-event and asks how the biopolitics of trauma, as a set of institutionalized practices for managing and ordering the life and health of populations, plays out across the necropolitical terrain of global inequality and in relation to those it locates as bare life.

J	Lee, K				Lee, Kelley			How do we move forward on the social determinants of health: the global governance challenges	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						inequalities; health equity; World Health Organisation		The final report of the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health is the culmination of a huge analytical effort to review the evidence and produce clear policy measures for achieving health equity. Further consideration needs to be given to an effective political strategy for taking forward these measures. Framing health equity in relation to global health, linking it to other key policy priorities, recognising that normative differences rather than lack of evidence lies at the heart of the problem, creating an appropriate institutional form for taking forward the Commission's recommendations, being prepared to challenge the status quo in global governance, and reflecting on the strengths and limitations of WHO's role in global governance should be part of such a strategy.

Sickness benefit reform and the politics of (ill) health	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						disability; public policy; politics	HIDDEN UNEMPLOYMENT; EMPLOYMENT; WELFARE; ABSENCE; DISABILITY; MORTALITY; POLICY; INEQUALITIES; WORKFARE; ENGLAND	Income maintenance during unemployment, old age or long-term sickness is a key facet of welfare provision and an important mediatory factor in the relationship between socio-economic position and health status. Since October 2008, the main long-term sickness absence benefit in the UK (Incapacity Benefit) has been replaced by Employment Support Allowance. Despite the importance of income maintenance for health and health inequalities, this change has been largely ignored within public health circles. After outlining these reforms and providing a historical policy context, this article utilises welfare reform theory and empirical literature to argue that these changes represent a broader international transformation from welfare to workfare states, the re-emergence of labour discipline, and a political shift in how people suffering from ill health are categorised as disabled or not and perceived as 'deserving' or 'undeserving' of state support. Finally, the case is made for the need to develop a new critical public health research and practice agenda around worklessness.

J	Hanlon, P; Carlisle, S				Hanlon, Phil; Carlisle, Sandra			Re-orienting public health: rhetoric, challenges and possibilities for sustainability	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						consumption; critique; environment	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENERGY; WILL	We make a case in this article for re-orienting public health, based on evidence that societies across the globe are now facing inevitable change for which public health remains insufficiently prepared. We focus on the relationship between different sustainability ideals, displayed through rhetoric and discourse and the reality of a number of challenges in the 'modern' world. We briefly describe discernible elements of public and policy rhetoric around sustainability, as an important background for public health efforts, and present two significant public health discourses. We then outline some of the challenges to sustainability; some relate to the powerful social systems and cultural values associated with modernity, while others refer to broader environmental issues. These are not unconnected. We conclude by outlining the possibilities for sustainability, which include a transition to a more sustainable form of society that could lessen global inequalities, combat emerging problems, such as obesity, depression and addictive behaviours, and improve individual and social levels of well-being. We believe that this may well require a change of consciousness for a change of age, so the scope and scale of the required response should not be underestimated.

The report makes important recommendations for political and economic reform, but stops short of calling for major change to the conventional neo-liberal model of economic development and growth. Yet the challenge of global warming appears to make growth according to this model unfeasible. In this article, we explore opportunities in the work of the Commission for combining goals of health equity and sustainability, and discuss ideas for economic reforms which further challenge the dominant model, and seek to accommodate the imperatives of reversing climate change.

The paper highlights significant variations in practice across the 17 countries. Common themes emerge from each of these practices and standards in terms of political interest in policies and awareness of CRC (both of which need to be enhanced), affordability (in terms of scarcity of resources in some countries and out-of-pocket payments for parts of the overall treatment process), access (in terms of the significant variation that has been observed within and across countries with regard to diagnostics, treatment and certain pharmaceuticals) and quality of CRC services (which may arise due to variations in treatment and pharmaceutical guidelines as well as minimal monitoring). When considering policy options for the future, it is important to, first, improve data collection both within as well as across countries through international co-operation; second, it is critical to have greater national and international support for cancer screening activities proven to be effective and cost-effective; third, endoscopy capacity in individual countries needs to be improved, also allowing more choice to ensure timely diagnosis, regardless of screening activities; fourth, public and political awareness needs to be enhanced as it is the key to improving CRC outcomes; fifth, where appropriate, to give consideration to the principles of equity, human dignity and disease severity, among others, when deciding on the uptake of new (targeted) treatments, rather than base decisions solely on cost-effectiveness criteria; and sixth, to firm up national guidelines including screening, diagnosis, treatment, pharmaceutical treatments and surveillance, with a view to enhancing their timeliness, evidence-base and free access to all.

J	McParland, JL; Knussen, C				McParland, Joanna L.; Knussen, Christina			Just world beliefs moderate the relationship of pain intensity and disability with psychological distress in chronic pain support group members	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						Chronic pain support groups; Just world beliefs; Pain intensity; Disability; Psychological distress	GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE; BACK-PAIN; IMPACT; SELF; DISTINCTION; VALIDATION; DEPRESSION; ATTITUDES; SEVERITY; BEHAVIOR	The impact of pain beliefs on coping and adjustment is well established. However, less is known about how beliefs unrelated to pain might impact upon this experience. In particular, just world beliefs could impact upon and be influenced by chronic pain, given that pain is not experienced in a vacuum but instead is experienced in a social context where justice issues are potentially salient. The focus of this Study was the ability of personal and general just world beliefs to moderate the relationships psychological distress held with pain intensity and disability in chronic pain. The sample (N = 95) was recruited from members of arthritis and fibromyalgia support groups to investigate these social beliefs in a controlled community pain context. A cross-sectional, questionnaire design was adopted. The personal just world belief was endorsed significantly more than the general just world belief, and endorsement of the personal just world belief was negatively correlated with pain intensity, disability and psychological distress, while the general just world belief was unrelated to these variables. When interaction terms relating to personal and general just world beliefs were entered simultaneously into regression analyses, the personal just world belief did not predict psychological distress. However, pain intensity positively predicted psychological distress at low but not high levels of the general just world belief, while disability predicted psychological distress at low and high levels of this belief. This suggests that a strong general just world belief has implications for psychological well-being in chronic pain, and as such this belief may occupy a potential coping function in this context.

J	Minh, HV; Byass, P; Nguyen, TKC; Wall, S				Hoang Van Minh; Byass, Peter; Nguyen Thi Kim Chuc; Wall, Stig			Patterns of health status and quality of life among older people in rural Viet Nam	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						older people; health status; quality of life; rural; Viet Nam; INDEPTH WHO-SAGE	SELF-RATED HEALTH; REPORTED HEALTH; GENDER	Background: To effectively and efficiently respond to the growing health needs of older people, it is critical to have an indepth understanding about their health status, quality of life (QoL) and related factors. This paper, taking advantage of the INDEPTH WHO-SAGE study on global ageing and adult health, aims to describe the pattern of health status and QoL among older adults in a rural community of Viet Nam, and examine their associations with some socio-economic factors. Methods: The study was carried out in the Bavi District, a rural community located 60 km west of Hanoi, the capital, within the Epidemiological Field Laboratory of Bavi (FilaBavi). Face-to-face household interviews were conducted with people aged 50 years and over who lived in the FilaBavi area. The interviews were performed by trained surveyors from FilaBavi using a standard summary version SAGE questionnaire. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were used to examine the patterns of health status and QoL, and associations with socio-economic factors. Results: Higher proportions of women reported both poor health status and poor QoL compared to men. Age was shown to be a factor significantly associated with poor health status and poor QoL. Higher educational level was a significant positive predictor of both health status and QoL among the study subjects. Higher economic status was also associated with both health status and QoL. The respondents whose families included more older people were significantly less likely to have poor QoL. Conclusion: The findings reveal problems of inequality in health status and QoL among older adults in the study setting by sex, age, education and socio-economic status. Given the findings, actions targeted towards improving the health of disadvantaged people (women, older people and lower education and economic status) are needed in this setting.

Understanding sex-related health differences, recognising groups at risk of poor health and identifying determinants of poor health are therefore very important for both improving health trajectories and planning for the health needs of ageing populations. Objectives: To determine the extent to which demographic and socio-economic factors impact upon measures of health in older populations in Africa and Asia; to examine sex differences in health and further explain how these differences can be attributed to demographic and socio-economic determinants. Methods: A total of 46,269 individuals aged 50 years and over in eight Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) sites within the INDEPTH Network were studied during 2006-2007 using an abbreviated version of the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave I instrument. The survey data were then linked to longitudinal HDSS background information. A health score was calculated based on self-reported health derived from eight health domains. Multivariable regression and post-regression decomposition provide ways of measuring and explaining the health score gap between men and women. Results: Older men have better self-reported health than older women. Differences in household socioeconomic levels, age, education levels, marital status and living arrangements explained from about 82% and 71% of the gaps in health score observed between men and women in South Africa and Kenya, respectively, to almost nothing in Bangladesh. Different health domains contributed differently to the overall health scores for men and women in each country. Conclusion: This study confirmed the existence of sex differences in self-reported health in low-and middle-income countries even after adjustments for differences in demographic and socio-economic factors. A decomposition analysis suggested that sex differences in health differed across the HDSS sites, with the greatest level of inequality found in Bangladesh. The analysis showed considerable variation in how differences in socio-demographic and economic characteristics explained the gaps in self-reported health observed between older men and women in African and Asian settings. The overall health score was a robust indicator of health, with two domains, pain and sleep/energy, contributing consistently across the HDSS sites. Further studies are warranted to understand other significant individual and contextual determinants to which these sex differences in health can be attributed. This will lay a foundation for a more evidence-based approach to resource allocation, and to developing health promotion programmes for older men and women in these settings.

J	Goicolea, I				Goicolea, Isabel			Adolescent pregnancies in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador: a rights and gender approach to adolescents' sexual and reproductive health	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Review						adolescent pregnancy; reproductive and sexual rights; gender relations; gender structures; agency	RISK-FACTORS; GIRLS; WOMEN; CHILDBIRTH; PREVENTION; MORBIDITY	In the Andean region of Latin America over one million adolescent girls get pregnant every year. Adolescent pregnancy (AP) has been associated with adverse health and social outcomes, but it has also been favorably viewed as a pathway to adulthood. AP can also be conceptualized as a marker of inequity, since it disproportionately affects girls from the poorest households and those who have not been able to attend school. Using results from a study carried out in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador, this paper explores APs and adolescents' sexual and reproductive health from a rights and gender approach. The paper points out the main features of a rights and gender approach, and how it can be applied to explore APs. Afterward it describes the methodologies (quantitative and qualitative) and main results of the study, framing the findings within the rights and gender approach. Finally, some implications that could be generalizable to global research on APs are highlighted. The application of the rights and gender framework to explore APs contributes to a more integral view of the issue. The rights and gender framework stresses the importance of the interaction between rights-holders and duty-bearers on the realization of sexual and reproductive rights, and acknowledges the importance of gender-power relations on sexual and reproductive decisions.

J	Kasenga, F				Kasenga, Fyson			Making it happen: prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV in rural Malawi	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Review						HIV and AIDS; PMTCT; policies; antenatal care; rural Malawi	SERVICES	HIV and AIDS, in resource-limited settings, contribute to increased maternal and infant mortality where such vital indicators are already high. In these settings, babies born to HIV-positive women continue to have added risks of acquiring HIV infection and dying from it before their fifth birthdays if no interventions are employed. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is an international initiative whose implications within the local context need to be known. An operational research approach was adopted to study the demand and adherence of key components within the PMTCT Programme among women in rural Malawi. This study was carried out at Malamulo SDA Hospital in rural Malawi and employed the mixture of both quantitative and qualitative approaches. While the introduction of innovative policies in antenatal care (ANC) that has positive impact particularly on marginalised women's access to the services, negative effects are also inevitable. Marginalised women in resource-poor settings fail to deliver at the health facility due to lack of transportation, economic difficulties, gender inequalities, tradition and negative attitude of health workers. Integration of HIV testing and opt-out testing in ANC coupled with the introduction of free maternal care resulted in more women accessing maternal services and PMTCT services. It is as a result of this that institutional delivery facilitates increased adherence to antiretroviral prophylaxis and is supported by both women and the communities. The paper summarises the research conducted and elaborates on how it contributed to actions to improve staff attitude, increase male involvement in reproductive health care and discussions on how available resources can be maximised.

Methods: Information was collected by a reflective exploration of team proposals and progress reports, a content analysis of the outputs from an all-team meeting and review of the literature. Results: Teams adopted equity-centered, problem-focused, systems-based approaches intended to find upstream determinants that could make people more resilient to social and ecological factors impacting their health. Long-term visions and time frames were needed to develop and solidify fully functional interdisciplinary, multinational, multicultural partnerships. The implementation of research into practice was a motivating factor for all teams, but to do this, they recognized the need for evidence-based advice on how to best do this. Traditional measures of biomedical research excellence were necessary but not sufficient to encompass views of excellence of team-based interdisciplinary research, which includes features like originality, coherence and cumulative contributions to fields of study, acceptance by peers and success in translating research into gains in health status. An innovative and nuanced approached to GHR ethics was needed to deal with some unique ethical issues because the needs for GHR were not adequately addressed by institutional biomedical research ethics boards. Core competencies for GHR researchers were a blend of those needed for health promotion, population health, international development, sustainable development, and systems science. Discussion: Developing acceptable and meaningful ways to evaluate the short-term contributions for GHR and forecast its long-term impacts is a strategic priority needed to defend decisions being made in GHR development. Planning and investing to support the underlying GHR elements and competencies that allow for adaptive, innovative, and supportive research partnerships to achieve 'health for all' are more likely to have long-term impacts than building research strategies around specific diseases of interest.

Framing and the politics of public health: An examination of competing health narratives in Honduras	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						global health agenda; issue framing; donor prioritisation; inequality; reproductive rights	WORLD-BANK	According to the World Bank, Honduras is a health and development success story. Over the past few decades, it has experienced economic growth, expanded public health infrastructure, and improved key health indicators. However, these achievements do not serve as evidence of success for global public health agencies, such as the World Health Organisation ( WHO) and the Pan American Health Organisation ( PAHO). The WHO has identified Honduras as a 'priority country' due to extreme levels of poverty, inequality, indebtedness, and poor health. What accounts for these divergent evaluations, and what are their consequences for vulnerable and marginalised populations? I argue that the framing of health is important and demands examination because it reveals political dynamics and shapes policy options. Furthermore, individual frames are incomplete, differentially inclusive, and ultimately inadequate as explanatory and analytic frameworks.

Achievement of equity and universal access in China's health service: A commentary on the historical reform perspective from the UK National Health Service	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						health reform; cross-national; policy directions; UK; China	CARE-SYSTEM; NHS; BRITAIN; PAYMENT; IMPACT	This paper aims to examine the UK National Health Service (NHS) in the historical context of its background reforms and to investigate future developmental strategies for China's health system. We focus on the central issues facing China's future healthcare development: equity and access. China and the UK have approached healthcare reform from opposite perspectives, the NHS has maintained the core principle of providing universal health coverage throughout the decades. However, due to increasing demand, reforms to improve and sustain efficiency have meant increasing government funding while introducing elements of a market system. Conversely, China has moved from a centrally planned system to a fee-for-service system, but serious problems of inequity and access call for new methods of organisation and financing. With the future of both systems under constant debate, international experience will play a vital role in formulating health system reform strategies.	[Wan, Y.

First, we argue that the economic value of health delivery in resource-limited settings is not fully captured through the adding up of successive assessments of individual interventions. Second, we suggest that economic valuations can be used to identify social barriers to the success of health technologies in resource-limited settings. Third, we briefly discuss new directions for research on economic valuations given the interdependency between poor health and economic impoverishment.

Evolving values in ethics and global health research	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						ethics review; international health research; changing values; social justice; developing countries	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; PRIORITIES; JUSTICE; AFRICA; TRIALS	Over the past 25 years, the ethics of international health research have shifted from addressing narrow issues such as cultural differences in informed consent practices towards a greater emphasis on development and social justice. We anticipate that the next 'era' in international research ethics will involve an intensification of this focus on the role of research in achieving global justice. Three values, in particular, will shape how ethics considerations should evolve: solidarity; respect for Southern innovation; and commitment to action. We expect continuing debate on whether researchers and research sponsors should recognise more than a minimal set of obligations for the care and benefit of research participants and their communities. As the debate about the role of research in development intensifies, we expect to see new and more elaborate mechanisms for financing on-going access to beneficial interventions, ancillary care and other research-related benefits, as well as a greater involvement in research funding by developing country governments and private foundations. Ethics review and oversight need to reflect on these new values and on ways of operationalising them, or risk becoming marginalised in the research process.	[IJsselmuiden, C.

Implementation effects of GFATM-supported HIV/AIDS projects on the health sector, civil society and affected communities in Peru 2004-2007	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						HIV/AIDS; health systems; access; stigma and discrimination; social capital	EPIDEMIC	The emergence of opportunities for support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) for HIV-related projects has so far generated funding of over US$75 million for three proposals in Peru. The size of this investment creates the need for close monitoring to ensure a reasonable impact. This paper describes the effects of collaboration with the GFATM on key actors involved in HIV-related activities and on decision-making processes; on health sector divisions; on policies and sources of financing; on equity of access; and on stigma and discrimination of vulnerable and affected populations. Data analysed included primary data collected through interviews with key informants, in-depth interviews and group discussions with vulnerable and affected populations, as well as several public documents. Multisectorality, encouraged by the GFATM, is incipient; centralist proposals with limited consultation, a lack of consensus and short preparation times prevail. No accountability mechanisms operate at the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) level regarding CCM members or society as a whole. GFATM-funded activities have required significant input from the public sector, sometimes beyond the capacity of its human resources. A significant increase in HIV funding, in absolute amounts and in fractions of the total budget, has been observed from several sources including the National Treasury, and it is unclear whether this has implied reductions in the budget for other priorities. Patterns of social exclusion of people living with HIV/AIDS are diverse: children and women are more valued; while transgender persons and sex workers are often excluded.	[Caceres, C.

Framing health and foreign policy: lessons for global health diplomacy	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Review							PUBLIC-HEALTH; HUMAN-RIGHTS; GLOBALIZATION; INSECURITY; SECURITY; EQUITY	Global health financing has increased dramatically in recent years, indicative of a rise in health as a foreign policy issue. Several governments have issued specific foreign policy statements on global health and a new term, global health diplomacy, has been coined to describe the processes by which state and non-state actors engage to position health issues more prominently in foreign policy decision-making. Their ability to do so is important to advancing international cooperation in health. In this paper we review the arguments for health in foreign policy that inform global health diplomacy. These are organized into six policy frames: security, development, global public goods, trade, human rights and ethical/moral reasoning. Each of these frames has implications for how global health as a foreign policy issue is conceptualized. Differing arguments within and between these policy frames, while overlapping, can also be contradictory. This raises an important question about which arguments prevail in actual state decision-making. This question is addressed through an analysis of policy or policy-related documents and academic literature pertinent to each policy framing with some assessment of policy practice. The reference point for this analysis is the explicit goal of improving global health equity. This goal has increasing national traction within national public health discourse and decision-making and, through the Millennium Development Goals and other multilateral reports and declarations, is entering global health policy discussion. Initial findings support conventional international relations theory that most states, even when committed to health as a foreign policy goal, still make decisions primarily on the basis of the 'high politics' of national security and economic material interests. Development, human rights and ethical/moral arguments for global health assistance, the traditional 'low politics' of foreign policy, are present in discourse but do not appear to dominate practice. While political momentum for health as a foreign policy goal persists, the framing of this goal remains a contested issue. The analysis offered in this article may prove helpful to those engaged in global health diplomacy or in efforts to have global governance across a range of sectoral interests pay more attention to health equity impacts.

J	Titterton, M				Titterton, Mike			Risk for professionals, for schools, and for young people: An extended book review	HEALTH RISK & SOCIETY			English	Review						risk taking; professionals; children; schools; residential care; decision making		This extended book review focuses on three recent books dealing with risk taking in the lives of children and young people in school and leaving care, and for the professionals who look after them, albeit each book approaches risk taking in intriguingly different ways. The books are: Safeguarding Children and Schools, edited by M. Baginsky; Professional Risk and Working with People: decision-making in health, social care and criminal justice, by D. Carson and A. Bain; and Young People's Transitions from Care to Adulthood: international research and practice, edited by M. Stein and E.R. Munro. Taking these three books together, two common threads can be discerned. The first is the way that risk issues emerge in diverse settings, and have many instructive lessons for researchers and practitioners alike. This is one of the motifs in the work of an international NGO like HALE ( www.haletrust.com). Second, there remains the burning issue of how professionals and users of public services, particularly children and young people, conceive of the dilemmas posed by the diverse risks associated with different life stages and transitions. It is to be hoped that future research and future deliberations will use these threads to construct a risk tapestry, which is rich in both density and in detail.				mike@haletrust.com	Titterton, Mike/HPG-5117-2023						5	1	1	0	6	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND	1369-8575			HEALTH RISK SOC	Health Risk Soc.		2010	12	2					189	191	PII 921625206	10.1080/13698570903299040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13698570903299040			3	Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Social Sciences, Biomedical	Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)	Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Biomedical Social Sciences	593UF					2025-01-01	WOS:000277485800008

Is this due to lack of ownership on the part of national governments and the international community? This article examines whether the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and donor policy statements are aligned with MDG priorities and targets. The analysis found a high degree of commitment to MDGs as a whole but both PRSPs and donor statements are selective, consistently emphasising income poverty and social investments for education, health and water but not other targets concerned with empowerment and inclusion of the most vulnerable such as gender violence or women's political representation. The article concludes that a new, ninth Goal needs to be added - to reduce inequality - to make the MDGs aligned to the original purpose of the Millennium Declaration.

THE AMPLIFICATION OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN LESOTHO	INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						women's rights; human rights; Lesotho; gender politics of HIV/AIDS; gender politics of development	NETWORKS; GENDER	Contrasting the socio-political contexts of large-scale development and the HIV/AIDS crisis in Lesotho, our analysis captures important historical conjunctures that expanded opportunities for the mobilization of women's rights as human rights. Local women's rights organizations, such as Women and Law in Southern Africa (WLSA), found greater support and resonance for women's rights claims amid the socio-political context of the AIDS crisis, in marked contrast to the stifling of those same claims during a period of neoliberal, nationalist development initiatives in Lesotho. The AIDS crisis in particular introduced new international actors that helped support a 'frame bridging' strategy whereby women's rights were characterized as health rights, rooted in a critique of the AIDS crisis that identified the role of gender inequality as an important driver of the epidemic. These links to transnational feminist networks as well as to international health agencies bolstered the critiques of gender inequality articulated by WLSA and other women's rights advocates, helping usher in a series of legal changes in Lesotho in 2003 and 2006.

FROM APARTHEID TO NEOLIBERALISM: HEALTH EQUITY IN POST-APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							FINANCING REFORM; INSURANCE; DEMOCRACY; CARE	In 1994, the African National Congress (ANC) won South Africa's first ever democratic election. It inherited a health service that was indelibly marked with the inequities of the apartheid era, highly privatized and distorted toward the hospital needs of urban Whites. The ANC's manifesto promised major improvements, but this study finds only two significant health equity improvements: (1) primary care had funding increased by 83 percent and was better staffed; and (2) health care workers became significantly more race-representative of the population. These improvements, however, were outweighed by equity losses in the deteriorating public-private mix. Policy analysis of the elite actors attributes this failure to the dominance of the Treasury's neoliberal macroeconomic policy (GEAR), which severely limited any increases in public spending. The ANC's nationalist ideology underpinned GEAR and many of the health equity decisions. It united the ANC, international capital, African elites, and White capital in a desire for an African economic renaissance. And it swept the population along with it, becoming the new hegemonic ideology. As this study finds, the successful policies were those that could be made a part of this active hegemonic reformation, symbolically celebrating African nationalism, and did not challenge the interests of the major actors.

J	Katz, AR				Katz, Alison Rosamund			PROSPECTS FOR A GENUINE REVIVAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE-THROUGH THE VISIBLE HAND OF SOCIAL JUSTICE RATHER THAN THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET: PART II	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								This second part of a two-part article explores the prospects for genuine revival of primary health care (PHC) as announced by the WHO in 2008, with reference, briefly, to Global Health Watch 2, published by the People's Health Movement, Medact, and Equity Gauge Alliance, and, in more depth, to the positions of social and people's movements most closely aligned with the original values and principles of Alma-Ata and the structural foundations of the PHC project. The author argues that the social justice struggle for health cannot be limited to curbing capitalism's excesses. The multiple crises of today-in energy, water, food, the environment, finance, science, information, and democracy-must be recognized as capitalist crises and addressed as such. Particular attention is given to ideology, including the distortion of human nature and society under neoliberal capitalism, and to moral foundations of Health for All. Not only must the invisible hand of the market be replaced by the visible hand of social justice, but the single ideology proclaiming the "end of history" and, by implication, the end of politics and political struggle must be exposed and rejected as neoliberal, totalitarian propaganda. In line with the spirit and intention of the U.N. Charter, PHC remains a political project for a fair and safe world in which Health for All is both possible and necessary.

THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND PROGRAMS ON THE HEALTH AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							INFLATION	Decades of underinvestment in public sectors and in teachers and health workers have adversely affected the health and educational outcomes of women. This is partly explained by a general lack of resources. However, the amount a country can spend on social sectors, including teachers and health workers, is also determined by its macroeconomic framework, which is set in agreement with the International Monetary Fund. There is now ample evidence of how IMF-imposed wage ceilings have constrained the ability of governments to hire adequate numbers of trained professionals and increase investment in social sectors. Though the IMF has recently removed wage ceilings from its basket of conditions, little change has taken place to ensure that women are better supported by macroeconomic policies or, at the least, are less adversely affected. Thus far, the IMF's neoliberal policies have either ignored gender concerns or instrumentalized equity, health, and education to support economic development. Unless macroeconomic policies are more flexible and deliberately take into account the different needs of women and men, social outcomes will continue to be poor and inequitable. Governments must pursue alternative, feminist policies that put the goals of social equity at the center of macroeconomic policy. These policies can facilitate increased investment in education and health care, which are vital measures for achieving gender equality and providing both women and men with the skills and training needed to soften the impact of the current economic crisis.

Most health determinants lie outside the control of the health sector, and thus non-health-sector policies have profound positive and negative effects on population health. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is an instrument for identifying the effect of policies, plans, programs, and projects on population health and health equity. It is a feasible, cost-effective, and transparent process that has been adopted by several financial institutions, including members of the World Bank Group. Adopting HIA would assist the IMF in ensuring that the potential health consequences of its policies are identified and addressed.

A systematic review of the literature provides valuable knowledge for research in this area. However, the limited number of studies, the poor quality of methods used, and a lack of theories or concepts have produced inconsistent results. To minimize bias from these limitations and to reach a comprehensive understanding of the complexity and health effects of global employment conditions, this article outlines key strategies for a synthetic, comprehensive, participatory approach: adapting transdisciplinary knowledge acquisition, building a theoretical model, employing multiple sources for data collection, and using a variety of methods (qualitative/quantitative studies and narrative knowledge). This approach provides solutions to important research and policy needs regarding the global context of key employment relations, social mechanisms, and health inequalities. The strategies are adapted to synthesize input from several disciplines (epidemiology, sociology, and political science), social actors, and institutions. The study's main sources of information are a variety of digital, bibliographic databases; the authors reviewed the scientific literature from 1985 to 2008 and books, reports, and other documents from 2000 to 2008.

Countries are categorized into core (21), semi-peripheral (42), and peripheral (71) countries, based on gross national product per capita (Atlas method). Labor market related variables and factors are then used to generate clusters of countries with principal components and cluster analysis methods. The authors then examine the relationship between the resulting clusters and health outcomes. The clusters of countries are largely geographically defined, each cluster with similar historical background and developmental strategy. However, there are interesting exceptions, which warrant further elaboration. The relationship between health outcomes and clusters largely follows the authors' expectations (except for communicable diseases): more egalitarian labor institutions have better health outcomes. The world system, then, can be divided according to different types of labor markets that are predictive of population health outcomes at each level of economic development. As is the case for health and social policies, variability in labor market characteristics is likely to reflect, in part, the relative strength of a country's political actors.

These countries illustrate variations in labor markets and health, categorized into a global empirical typology. The case studies illustrated that workers' health is significantly connected with labor market characteristics and the welfare system. For a core country, the labor market is characterized by a formal sector. The labor institutions of Sweden traditionally have high union density and collective bargaining coverage and a universal health care system, which correlate closely with positive health, in comparison with Spain and the United States. For a semi-periphery country, the labor market is delineated by a growing informal economy. Although South Korea, Venezuela, and El Salvador provide some social welfare benefits, a high proportion of irregular and informal workers are excluded from these benefits and experience hazardous working conditions that adversely affect their health.

In the absence of labor market regulations, the majority of their workers toil in the informal sector in unsafe conditions with inadequate health care.

Consequently, work is increasingly affecting population health and health inequalities, not only as a consequence of harmful working conditions, but also because of employment conditions. Nevertheless, the health consequences of employment conditions are largely neglected in research. The authors describe five types of employment conditions that deviate from standard full-time permanent employment precarious employment, unemployment, informal employment, forced employment or slavery, and child labor and their health consequences, from a worldwide perspective. Despite obvious problems of measurement and international comparability, the findings show that, certainly in the low-income countries, these conditions are largely situated in informality, denying any possible standard of safety, protection, sustainability, and workers' rights. Considerable numbers of the world's working people are affected in geographically and socioeconomically unequal ways. This clearly relates nonstandard employment conditions to health equity consequences. In the future, governments and health agencies should establish more adequate surveillance systems, research programs, and policy awareness regarding the health effects of these nonstandard employment conditions.

Case studies at the country level can provide a flavor of "what works," but they remain essentially subjective. Employment conditions research should provide policies that actually reduce health inequalities among workers. Workplace trials showing some desired effect on the intervention group are insufficient for such a broad policy research area. To provide a positive heuristic, the authors propose a set of new policy research priorities, including placing more focus on "solving" and less on "problematizing" the health effects of employment conditions; developing policy-oriented theoretical frameworks to reduce employment-related inequalities in health; developing research on methods to test the effects of labor market policies; generalizing labor market interventions; engaging, reaching out to, and holding onto workers exposed to multiple forms of unhealthy employment conditions; measuring labor market inequalities in health; planning, early on, for sustainability in labor market interventions; studying intersectoral effects across multiple interventions to reduce health inequalities; and looking for evidence in a global context.

This article identifies some of the issues that arise in considering the application of HIA to the operation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), especially in the context of sub-Saharan Africa. The authors do this in the belief that the IMF's lending conditionalities and macroeconomic policies constitute an important social determinant of health. The recent report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health has created helpful and timely policy space for the development of a health equity and human rights oriented accountability framework for the IMF.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; WORLD-BANK; INTERNATIONAL HEALTH; MATERNAL MORTALITY; THIRD-WORLD; GENDER; INDIA; CARE; ORGANIZATION; EQUITY	Most international programs and policies devised to improve women's health in developing countries have been shaped by powerful agencies and development ideologies, including the tendency to view women solely through the lens of instrumentalism (i.e., as a means to an end). In a literature review, the authors followed the trail of instrumentalism by reviewing the different approaches and paradigms that have guided international development initiatives over the past 50 years. The analysis focuses on three key approaches to international development: the economic development, public health, and women-gender approaches. The findings indicate that progressive changes have adopted a more inclusive development perspective that is potentially beneficial to women's health. On the other hand, most paradigms have largely viewed improving women's lives in general, and their health in particular, as an investment or a means to development rather than an end in itself. Public health strategies did not escape the instrumentalism entrenched in the broader development paradigms. Although there was an opportunity for progress in the 1990s with the emergence of the human development and human rights paradigms and critical advances in Cairo and Beijing promoting women's agency, the current Millennium Development Goals project seems to have relapsed into instrumentalism.

J	Kiima, D; Jenkins, R				Kiima, David; Jenkins, Rachel			Mental health policy in Kenya -an integrated approach to scaling up equitable care for poor populations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS			English	Article								Background: Although most donor and development agency attention is focussed on communicable diseases in Kenya, the importance of non-communicable diseases including mental health and mental illness is increasingly apparent, both in their own right and because of their influence on health, education and social goals. Mental illness is common but the specialist service is extremely sparse and primary care is struggling to cope with major health demands. Non health sectors e. g. education, prisons, police, community development, gender and children, regional administration and local government have significant concerns about mental health, but general health programmes have been surprisingly slow to appreciate the significance of mental health for physical health targets. Despite a people centred post colonial health delivery system, poverty and global social changes have seriously undermined equity. This project sought to meet these challenges, aiming to introduce sustainable mental health policy and implementation across the country, within the context of extremely scarce resources. Methods: A multi-faceted and comprehensive programme which combined situation appraisal to inform planning, sustained intersectoral policy dialogue at national and regional level; establishment of a health sector system for coordination, supervision and training of at each level (national, regional, district and primary care); development workshops; production of toolkits, development of guidelines and standards; encouragement of intersectoral liaison at national, regional, district and local levels; public education; and integration of mental health into health management systems. Results: The programme has achieved detailed situation appraisal, epidemiological needs assessment, inclusion of mental health into the health sector reform plans, and into the National Package of Essential Health Interventions, annual operational plans, mental health policy guidelines to accompany the general health policy, tobacco legislation, adaptation of the WHO primary care guidelines for Kenya, primary care training, construction of a quality system of roles and responsibilities, availability of medicines at primary care level, some strengthening of intersectoral liaison with police, prisons and schools, and public education about mental health. Conclusions: The project has demonstrated the importance of using a multi-faceted and comprehensive programme to promote sustainable system change, key elements of which include a focus on the use of rapid appropriate assessment and treatment at primary care level, strengthening the referral system, interministerial and intersectoral liaison, rehabilitation, social inclusion, promotion and advocacy to mobilize community engagement.

At the same time it has become a focus of debate regarding potential health and other associated risks. Rejection of new nanotechnology innovations could result in loss of trust in regulators, a phenomenon observed previously with nuclear and genetically altered food crop technologies. Due to this uncertainty a precautionary approach is warranted. The anticipated four stages of nanotechnology development, from passive to more active forms, are arrayed against existing risk management strategies of a precautionary nature. The overlay suggests that precaution is appropriate for all stages of nanotechnology development. Other effects from innovation, such as socio-economic inequity, disruptive impact on tabour markets, alteration of global trade and unintended health and environmental impacts, can also be minimised by applying a precautionary approach. The use of a precautionary approach can provide protection to developers of nanotechnology, to individuals and to the environment.

The absence of adequate and quality mental health infrastructure and workforce is increasingly recognized. The ethical implications of inequalities in mental health for people and nations are profound and must be addressed in efforts to fulfil key bioethics principles of medicine and public health: respect for individuals, justice, beneficence, and non-malfeasance. Stigma and discrimination against people living with mental disorders affects their education, employment, access to care and hampers their capacity to contribute to society. Mental health well-being is closely associated to several Millennium Development Goals and economic development sectors including education, labour force participation, and productivity. Limited access to mental health care increases patient and family suffering. Unmet mental health needs have a negative effect on poverty reduction initiatives and economic development. Untreated mental conditions contribute to economic loss because they increase school and work absenteeism and dropout rates, healthcare expenditure, and unemployment. Addressing unmet mental health needs will require development of better mental health infrastructure and workforce and overall integration of mental and physical health services with primary care, especially in the developing nations.

The UN Conventions on the Rights of the Child and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities set out rights to be respected in child and adolescent psychiatric treatment. Rights of participation and inclusion (minimizing of barriers to the involvement of disabled people) can create complex problems in cases of restraint or deprivation of liberty. This paper analyses the consequences of these conventions and other ethics guidelines on child and adolescent psychiatric treatment and research. Beneficence, justice and autonomy are core principles that are mirrored in the problems of inclusion and protection, confidentiality, and the safety of psychopharmacological interventions. Factors of inclusion are involved in the areas of availability of care, participation in best evidence-based treatment, and research. The right of the child to protection, the right of inclusion, and parents' rights and duties to safeguard their child's wellbeing form a triangle. National laws to regulate the treatment of psychiatrically ill children should be created and implemented and these should be non-discriminatory but at the same time safeguard the developing human being.

J	Andermann, L				Andermann, Lisa			Culture and the social construction of gender: Mapping the intersection with mental health	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							WOMEN; DEPRESSION; ILLNESS; DISCOURSES; SUICIDE; FEMALE; SELF; SEX	The social construction of gender is an important concept for better understanding the determinants of mental health in women and men. Going beyond physical and physiological differences and the traditional biomedical approach, interdisciplinary study of the complex factors related to culture and society, power and politics is necessary to be able to find solutions to situations of disparity in mental health, related to both prevalence of disorders, availability and response to treatment. Gender inequality continues to be a source of suffering for many women around the world, and this can lead to adverse mental health outcomes. This review focuses on developments in the literature on culture, gender and mental health over the past decade, focusing on themes around the social construction of gender, mental health and the media, a look at cultural competence through a gender lens, gender and the body, providing some examples of the intersection between mental health and gender in low-income countries as well as the more developed world, and the impact of migration and resettlement on mental health. At the clinical level, using a bio-psycho-social-spiritual model that can integrate and negotiate between both traditional and biomedical perspectives is necessary, combined with use of a cultural formulation that takes gender identity into account. Research involving both qualitative and quantitative perspectives, and in many cases an ethnographic framework, is essential in tackling these global issues.

J	Mohamed, FG				Mohamed, Feisal G.			Poignancy as Human Rights Aesthetic	JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								This essay offers an aesthetic of "poignancy" as a potential theoretical ground of human rights, as opposed to Kantian formulations currently finding expression in the language of "cosmopolitanism." The lack of concern with health and life found in Immanuel Kant's definition of human freedom is reproduced in what the author calls "magisterial" human rights practice, which tends to emphasize civil proceduralism and is advanced by a global elite. An immanental aesthetic indebted to Theodor Adorno, by contrast, might coincide with an immanental justice responsive to the physical and spiritual demands of human subjects, thus advancing vital if underdeveloped impulses of the UDHR, namely those expressed in its recognition of freedom from want and freedom of worship. This aesthetic is described with reference to the Orpheus myth, to John Keats's odes, and to a January 2009 account of shelling in Gaza. It is furthermore deployed in response to the dismissal of human rights emerging from such leftist intellectuals as Alain Badiou and Slavoj Zizek.

Staffs' knowledge and perceptions of working with women with intellectual disabilities and mental health problems	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH			English	Article						intellectual disability; resilience; protective; risk factors; mental health; women	LIFE EVENTS; ADULTS; DEPRESSION	Aim There is a growing evidence of the physical and mental health inequalities in people with intellectual disability (ID) although less has been written concerning the mental health of women with ID (International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual Disabilities). This is compared with the substantive literature published within mainstream psychiatry on gender. The aim of this study was to explore a range of health and social care staffs' knowledge and perceptions of caring for women with ID who have mental health problems focusing upon risk and resilient/protective factors. Method A qualitative methodology was used. Eight focus groups were conducted with hospital, community and residential staff across one region of the UK. The focus groups were audiotaped and the transcriptions were subjected to a thematic content analysis using Newell & Burnard's framework. Findings Six inter-related risk factors were identified by the participants as potential causes for the women with ID to develop a mental illness and these were: having an ID and being female, unmet expectations, dysfunctional family upbringing, unstable relationships/loss of children, domestic violence and negative life experiences. Few of the participants acknowledged hormonal issues as a risk factor. Resilient/protective factors included being proactive, greater community participation, early recognition and mental health maintenance. Conclusion These results are discussed in light of current developments and policy within mainstream psychiatric gender approaches. Greater recognition of a proactive health approach for both staff and women with an ID is recommended.

Implications of Food Insecurity on Global Health Policy and Nursing Practice	JOURNAL OF NURSING SCHOLARSHIP			English	Article						Food insecurity; food security; health policy; review	RESOURCES; NUTRITION; ACCESS	Purpose: The purpose is to discuss the concept of food insecurity (FI) and its impact on current global health policy and nursing practice. Organizing Construct: Food insecurity. Methods: Literature review. Findings: FI means a nonsustainable food system that interferes with optimal self-reliance and social justice. Individuals experiencing FI lack nutritionally adequate and safe foods in their diet. Resources play a significant role in FI by affecting whether or not people obtain culturally, socially acceptable food through regular marketplace sources as opposed to severe coping strategies, such as emergency food sources, scavenging, and stealing. Persons who are living in poverty, female heads of household, single parents, people living with many siblings, landless people, migrants, immigrants, and those living in certain geographical regions constitute populations at risk and most vulnerable to FI. Conclusions: FI influences economics through annual losses of gross domestic product due to reduced human productivity. FI affects individuals and households and is largely an unobservable condition, making data collection and analysis challenging. Policy and research have focused on macronutrient sufficiency and deprivation, making it difficult to draw attention and research dollars to FI. Clinical Relevance: Persons experiencing FI exhibit clinical signs such as less healthy diets, poor health status, poor diabetes and chronic disease management, and impaired cognitive function. Nurses can recognize the physical, psychosocial, and personal consequences that those with FI face and manage daily.

Aim: We carried out a detailed exploration of the international service-learning (ISL) experience of three medical students and the value of critical reflection as a pedagogical approach to enhance medical students' conceptions of the Canadian Medical Education Directions for Specialists (CanMEDS) Health Advocate Role. Method: A phenomenological approach enabled us to study in considerable depth the students' experience from their perspective. Students kept reflective journals and wrote essays including detailed accounts of their experiences. The content of the students' journals and essays was analyzed using the critical incident technique. Results: Students noted an increasingly meaningful sense of what it means to be vulnerable and marginalized, a heightened level of awareness of the social determinants of health and the related importance of community engagement, and a deeper appreciation of the health advocate role and key concepts embedded within it. Conclusion: This in-depth phenomenological study focused on the detailed experiences of three students from whom we learned that social justice-oriented approaches to service-learning, coupled with critical reflection, provide potentially viable pedagogical approaches for learning the health advocate role. How this experience will affect the students' future medical practice is yet unknown.

The purpose of this descriptive paper is to inspire and empower health professionals to build a theoretical bridge to practice with an occupational justice lens. Using illustrations from a study of leisure and the use of everyday technology in the lives of very old people in Northern Sweden, the authors argue that an occupational justice lens may inspire and empower health professionals to engage in critical dialogue on occupational justice; use global thinking about occupation, health, justice, and the environment; and combine population and individualized approaches. The authors propose that taking these initiatives to bridge theory and practice will energize health professionals to enable inclusive participation in everyday occupations in diverse contexts.

J	Maclean, GD				Maclean, Gaynor D.			An historical overview of the first two decades of striving towards Safe Motherhood	SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE			English	Article						Safe Motherhood; Skilled attendance; Human rights; Millennium Development Goals	MATERNAL HEALTH; MORTALITY; CONTEXT	The paper examines some of the progress and problems encountered during the first two decades of the Safe Motherhood Initiative. Sufficient statistics are cited to identify the immensity of the persisting problems associated with maternal death and morbidity before the study focuses on some of the endeavours designed to enable women to survive their natural function of giving birth. Varying attitudes and approaches that have characterised the initiatives launched in the past 20 years are reviewed and their changing emphases noted. The stress on treating the medical causes of maternal death in the early years have been complemented by increasing attention to social and political issues as time has elapsed. The advent of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has impelled efforts to provide skilled attendance for all women during childbirth: the poor, socially disadvantaged and vulnerable being those most at risk. MDG 5, concerning maternal health, is perceived as pivotal in the context of global development. Maternal death when viewed from the human rights perspective is perceived as a social injustice rather than a health disadvantage and Safe Motherhood is currently considered increasingly as a basic human right. The study offers a synthesis of concepts and actions that are contributing to building Safe Motherhood across the globe in the 21st century. In considering the factors that inhibit the degree of safety associated with giving birth, global efforts that are tackling a persisting buffer zone are identified and continuous action urged in order to strive towards the targets set for 2015.

J	De Jong, JTVM				De Jong, Joop T. V. M.			A public health framework to translate risk factors related to political violence and war into multi-level preventive interventions	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Political violence; Armed conflict; War; Prevention; Economy; Military; Diplomacy; Education; Traumatic stress; Interventions	CONFLICT	Political violence, armed conflicts and human rights violations are produced by a variety of political, economic and socio-cultural factors. Conflicts can be analyzed with an interdisciplinary approach to obtain a global understanding of the relative contribution of risk and protective factors. A public health framework was designed to address these risk factors and protective factors. The framework resulted in a matrix that combined primary, secondary and tertiary interventions with their implementation on the levels of the society-at-large, the community, and the family and individual. Subsequently, the risk and protective factors were translated into multi-sectoral, multi-modal and multi-level preventive interventions involving the economy, governance, diplomacy, the military, human rights, agriculture, health, and education. Then the interventions were slotted in their appropriate place in the matrix. The interventions can be applied in an integrative form by international agencies, governments and non-governmental organizations, and molded to meet the requirements of the historic, political-economic and socio-cultural context. The framework maps the complementary fit among the different actors while engaging themselves in preventive, rehabilitative and reconstructive interventions. The framework shows how the economic, diplomatic, political, criminal justice, human rights, military, health and rural development sectors can collaborate to promote peace or prevent the aggravation or continuation of violence. A deeper understanding of the association between risk and protective factors and the developmental pathways of generic, country-specific and culture-specific factors leading to political violence is needed.

Cancer Disparities in the Federated States of Micronesia: Funding Challenges of a Developing Nation in Epidemiological Transition	SOCIAL WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Cancer; prevention and control; disparities; Federated States of Micronesia; funding; US Compact of Free Association		This article describes funding and other challenges to cancer control in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and examines funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) as a critical facet in implementation of the U.S. Compact of Free Association (COFA). As a health-relevant policy, COFA commits the United States to improve the health of FSM citizens and, specifically, allows the FSM to apply for U.S. federal health FOAs. Emerging research suggests discrepancies in the intent and implementation of COFA and indicates that the capacity of the FSM to secure U.S. health funding may be at least partially hindered by the ways in which FOAs are structured. Current cancer-related FOAs were identified to evaluate their relevance to the FSM. Eligibility requirements of all FOAs were systematically reviewed and compared with FSM infrastructural and human resources. Findings indicate that most FOAs have requirements more likely to be met in fully developed health service entities. Such requirements disadvantage the FSM when competed with the relatively more resource-rich U.S. states and health services systems. This situation predisposes the FSM to increased risk of disparate cancer outcomes. Highlighted is the need for distributive justice and specific efforts that enhance the health services infrastructure in the FSM and increase opportunities for resource-appropriate interventions. Findings provide considerations for those in international social welfare, public health, and other disciplines interested in the advancement of global health partnerships to eliminate cancer disparities in underresourced nations.

The automatic system is not a guaranty for success. Internationally a project oriented system of the international organizations is known instead of an automatic system but the final goal is not always very clear. Multiple Objectives Optimization looks more robust to obtain regional and international development. Moreover a system of transfer payments is not sufficient to measure the well being of a regional population. In the well-being economy, each individual would have to feel good concerning material wealth, health, education, all kind of security and concerning the environment. With other words, multiple objectives have to be fulfilled. However, these different multiple objectives are expressed in different units. Weights are most of the time used to equalize these different units. Introduction of weights means introduction of subjectivity. In order to avoid this dilemma, the internal mechanical solution of a ratio system, producing dimensionless numbers, is preferred: MOORA. In addition, this outcome creates the opportunity to use an additional non-subjective reference point theory. The choice and importance of the objectives is also non-subjective if all stakeholders involved come to an agreement. This theory is applied on the different counties of Lithuania. At that moment it is no more only a question of redistribution of income but also of a national policy of new constructions, of tourism development, of pollution abatement and of energy renewables, after the European Commission "related to the promotion of local employment".

J	Ogneva-Himmelberger, Y; Cooperman, B				Ogneva-Himmelberger, Yelena; Cooperman, Brian			Spatio-temporal Analysis of Noise Pollution near Boston Logan Airport: Who Carries the Cost?	URBAN STUDIES			English	Article							RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY-VALUES; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; INTERNATIONAL-AIRPORT; AIRCRAFT NOISE; EXPOSURE; IMPACT; HEALTH; SCALE	Airports are often located near densely populated residential areas, affecting a large number of people. Thus, knowing socio-demographic characteristics of the noise-affected areas is important for the development of policies on noise control and abatement. This study proposes a new methodology that combines airport noise models with spatial statistics and geographical information systems to identify spatial clusters of socio-demographic characteristics in relationship to the noise level. Statistically significant 'hot' and 'cold' socio-demographic clusters represent spatial concentrations of certain social groups, corresponding to various levels of vulnerability to environmental impacts. Results show that the population 'paying' for the cost of noise from Logan International Airport in Boston, USA, is highly vulnerable as there are more minority and lower-income populations, and lower house prices in the noise-affected areas. These results should draw the attention of policy-makers and the public as policies for noise abatement are being developed.

A range of interventions have demonstrable efficacy in improving the lives of people experiencing such problems. However many people are disadvantaged, either because they are unable to access primary care, or because access does not lead to adequate help. New methods are needed to understand the problems of access and generate solutions. In this paper we describe our methodological approach to managing multiple and diverse sources of evidence, within a research programme to increase equity of access to high quality mental health services in primary care. Methods: We began with a scoping review to identify the range and extent of relevant published material, and establish key concepts related to access. We then devised a strategy to collect - in parallel - evidence from six separate sources: a systematic review of published quantitative data on access-related studies; a meta-synthesis of published qualitative data on patient perspectives; dialogues with local stakeholders; a review of grey literature from statutory and voluntary service providers; secondary analysis of patient transcripts from previous qualitative studies; and primary data from interviews with service users and carers. We synthesised the findings from these diverse sources, made judgements on key emerging issues in relation to needs and services, and proposed a range of potential interventions. These proposals were debated and refined using iterative electronic and focus group consultation procedures involving international experts, local stakeholders and service users. Conclusions: Our methods break new ground by generating and synthesising multiple sources of evidence, connecting scientific understanding with the perspectives of users, in order to develop innovative ways to meet the mental health needs of under-served groups.

While not universally agreed upon, this reassessment of policy priorities acknowledges that there are multiple other health problems that deserve renewed attention from the international community. It also highlights the fact that the impacts of the HIV pandemic are exacerbated by widespread poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition, and gender inequality. Nowhere is this more evident than in sub-Saharan Africa, where multiple epidemics conflate and seriously compromise the survival of individuals and communities. Given the widespread occurrence of famine in sub-Saharan Africa, issues of food and economic security become of paramount importance in efforts to address the region's HIV epidemics. This paper examines the historical, political-economic, and cultural dimensions of the HIV epidemic in the context of the growing problem of food and economic insecurity. Furthermore, using theoretical frameworks that emphasize the dynamic interrelation between HIV/AIDS and food insecurity, we present suggestions for combining traditional HIV-prevention strategies with food production and nutrition-education programming. In light of the complex interactions between HIV/AIDS and food insecurity and the lack of accessible treatment modalities, such programming could potentially reduce the risk for transmission of HIV through behavioural changes and improved nutritional and immune status, and increase the life expectancy of people living with HIV or AIDS.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether patients who were diagnosed with new-onset chronic heart failure (CHF) by a noncardiologist consulted with a cardiologist, and identify the factors associated with delayed consultation. METHODS: Physician reimbursement administrative data were obtained for all adults with suspected new-onset CHF in the year 2000 in Quebec, defined operationally as a physician visit for CHF (based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnostic codes), with no previous physician visit code for CHF in the preceding three years. Among those first diagnosed by a noncardiologist, Cox regression modelling was used to identify patient and physician characteristics associated with time to cardiology consultation. RESULTS: Of the 13,523 persons coded as having incident CHF, 54.9% consulted a cardiologist within the next 2.5 to 3.5 years, and 67.4% were seen by an internist or cardiologist. Older patients, women, and those with lower comorbidity and socioeconomic status had significantly longer times to cardiology consultation. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that many patients with suspected new-onset CHF do not receive prompt cardiology care, as Stipulated by current recommendations. Equity of access for women and those with lower socioeconomic status appears to be problematic.

J	Blomqvist, Å				Blomqvist, Ake			Health system reform in China: What role for private insurance?	CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW			English	Article						China; Health-care reform		The purpose of the present paper is to show that much of the literature on health economics and on the international experience with different forms of health system organization can be interpreted IS Supporting the idea that reliance oil an unregulated market mechanism for organizing the production and financing of health services is likely to result in major problems both with respect to efficiency and equity. However, reliance on a centralized "command-and-control" model managed by government has also been shown to entail problems in practice. For this reason I argue that the best option at China's current state of development may be a compromise model in which competing private providers are given all important role, both for the production of health services and in the provision of health insurance. but in which the government intervenes (through regulation and direct provision) in such a way as to attain both a high degree of equity of access to health care, and to avoid the most significant forms of "market failure" that Would arise in an unregulated private system.

I argue that this requirement places greater obstacles in the path of ethical xenotransplantation than has previously been recognised. The relevant community is global and there are no existing institutions with democratic credentials sufficient to establish this consent. The distribution of the risks and benefits from xenotransplantation also means that consent is unlikely to be forthcoming. Proceeding on the basis of hypothetical consent to a package of global health measures that includes xenotransplantation, as Rothblatt has recently advocated, is more problematic than she acknowledges. Given that it may place the lives of citizens of poor nations at risk to benefit the citizens of wealthy nations, xenotransplantation raises significant questions of international justice.

J	Morgan, A; Haglund, BJA				Morgan, Antony; Haglund, Bo J. A.			Social capital does matter for adolescent health: evidence from the English HBSC study	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						adolescent; health; health behaviour; social capital		Social capital has grown out of the recognition that health-related behaviours are shaped and constrained by a range of social and community contexts and that the ways in which an individual relates to social networks and communities has important effects on their health and well-being. Given the strong and complex inequalities that exist in adolescent health at both the national and international levels, social capital, acting a protective factor (or asset), may help reduce poor outcomes. The aim of this study was to measure and assess the relative importance of a range of social indicators representing the different domains of social capital on the health, wellbeing and health-related behaviours of young people. The study population was a random sample of 6425 school children aged 11-15 years old in 80 schools in England. Data were collected by a standardized questionnaire under supervised conditions in the classroom developed as part of the WHO Health Behaviour in School Aged Children (HBSC) study. This study has shown that social capital matters for young people's health, statistically significant relationships were found between the range of social capital indicators and the health and health-related outcomes selected for study. For example, young people with a low sense of family belonging and low involvement in the neighbourhood were almost twice as likely to report poor health (OR = 1.87 and 1.96, respectively). Low involvement in the neighbourhood was also highly associated with low consumption of fruit (OR = 2.48) and vegetables (OR = 2.62). Overall, however the strength of associations found varied across health behaviours and indicators of social capital and this requires further examination.

Design: The data to perform analyses were taken from the nationally representative Health and Welfare Survey (HWS) and Socioeconomic Survey (SES) 2007 in Thailand. Participants: Data of 15,736 representative Thai children (aged below 15 years) were selected. Methods: Descriptive analyses were performed to reveal the features of dental care utilisation among Thai children, in addition to use the concentration index (Cl) to measure socioeconomic-related inequality in dental care utilisation. Logistic regression was employed to determine inequality in dental care across socioeconomic strata. Results: The unequivocal gradient in dental care utilisation persistence among Thai children and the socioeconomic-related inequality in dental care utilisation is more concentrated among the better-off as the positive Cl value (equals 0.069) emerged. Poor children, however, are more likely to utilise dental care at public facilities, particularly primary care facilities. Conclusion: The evidence from Thailand, where universal coverage has been virtually achieved, provides some lesson for other countries particularly developing countries. Although the socioeconomic-related inequality in dental care utilisation among Thai children still exists, the pro-poor dental care utilisation at public facilities, particularly primary care facilities substantiate the impressive stride towards the concerted effort to reducing inequitable dental care delivery for Thai children.

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of data for primiparous women with singleton deliveries between 2003 and 2004 from the National Information System of Live-Births (6 064 799 live births). Robust Poisson regression modeling was applied to estimate prevalence ratios of cesarean deliveries for ethnic group and level of access to hospital delivery according to residence. Results: There were 2 438 180 primiparous deliveries and the cesarean rate was 45.8%. Ethnic inequalities in cesarean delivery rates showed lower rates for all ethnic groups compared with white women, with the lowest rates recorded for indigenous women. The association between ethnicity and cesarean delivery was higher in states with lower access to hospital (P < 0.001). Multiple regression models showed that this association was, in part, explained by older maternal age and higher levels of education and prenatal care. Conclusions: Overuse of cesarean delivery and strong evidence of ethnic inequalities in cesarean rates exist in Brazil. The inequalities are greater in states with lower access to hospital and were partially explained by socioeconomic factors and prenatal care, suggesting a misuse of medical technology at birth.

Morbidity is related to a green living environment	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							URBAN-RURAL VARIATIONS; HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; CONTEXT; AREAS	Background: As a result of increasing urbanisation, people face the prospect of living in environments with few green spaces. There is increasing evidence for a positive relation between green space in people's living environment and self-reported indicators of physical and mental health. This study investigates whether physician-assessed morbidity is also related to green space in people's living environment. Methods: Morbidity data were derived from electronic medical records of 195 general practitioners in 96 Dutch practices, serving a population of 345 143 people. Morbidity was classified by the general practitioners according to the International Classification of Primary Care. The percentage of green space within a 1 km and 3 km radius around the postal code coordinates was derived from an existing database and was calculated for each household. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Results: The annual prevalence rate of 15 of the 24 disease clusters was lower in living environments with more green space in a 1 km radius. The relation was strongest for anxiety disorder and depression. The relation was stronger for children and people with a lower socioeconomic status. Furthermore, the relation was strongest in slightly urban areas and not apparent in very strongly urban areas. Conclusion: This study indicates that the previously established relation between green space and a number of self-reported general indicators of physical and mental health can also be found for clusters of specific physician-assessed morbidity. The study stresses the importance of green space close to home for children and lower socioeconomic groups.	[Maas, J.; Schellevis, F.

J	Barton, H				Barton, Hugh			Land use planning and health and well-being	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Spatial planning; Healthy urban planning; Healthy towns; Physical activity and planning	MEASURED PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; URBAN FORM; ENVIRONMENT; NEIGHBORHOODS; INEQUALITIES; OBESITY	This paper is concerned with the relationship between the planning of settlements and health. It gives a brief introduction to the issues before summarising the evidence in relation to a range of topics, concluding with some more speculative thoughts on likely future findings. Modern planning was invented in response to inhumane living conditions in 19th century cities. But in the last century the connection was lost. Only now, with concerns over climate change and obesity, is there beginning to be the realisation that the physical environment is an important determinant of health. The paper uses a particular model of this relationship based oil eco-system and health determinants theories to structure the review of evidence. The review covers: lifestyle choices in relation to physical activity and diet, mental well-being and community, the local economy and income, health inequalities and strategic land use transport planning, pollution and urban form, and finally impacts on global ecology. There is now a growing consensus that while personal factors are critical in determining health, the urban environment exacerbates or mitigates health and well-being outcomes. The level of active travel (walking and cycling) and outdoor recreational activity is strongly affected by accessibility to local facilities. Access to green, natural environments, and to local social networks, are factors in mental well-being. The wider sub-regional pattern of housing, economic development, land use and transport is a determinant of social exclusion and therefore health inequalities. It also affects health-damaging pollution, adaptability in the face of climate change and the level of carbon dioxide emissions. We have literally been building unhealthy conditions into many of our towns and cities. But comparisons with the best cities in Europe indicate that it is possible to reverse the less desirable trends. Success depends, however, oil more radical policies of local authority control over land and finance than any political party has yet advocated. It also requires collaboration between the full range of powerful public and private organizations that influence the built environment. Future research is likely to further strengthen these Conclusions. It will become Much More obvious that planning for health and well-being is not only the NHS, but about creating a health-promoting physical, social and economic environment.

J	Hertzman, C				Hertzman, Clyde			The state of child development in Canada: Are we moving toward, or away from, equity from the start?	PAEDIATRICS & CHILD HEALTH			English	Article						Early child development; Environmental health; Social determinants	HEALTH	Young children have a remarkable capacity for developmental plasticity in response to the environments where they grow up, live and learn. In recognition of this capacity, the World Health Organization International Commission on the Social Determinants of Health recommended in 2008 that "governments build universal coverage of a comprehensive package of quality early child development programs and services for children, mothers, and other caregivers, regardless of ability to pay". Yet, in its recent report card on early learning and care, the United Nations Children's Fund revealed chat Canada met only one out of 10 benchmarks, tying for last place with Ireland out of 26 wealthy Countries. Not surprisingly, in Canada, large socioeconomic disparities emerge early in life in children's physical, social/emotional and language/cognitive development, which are largely attributable to systematic differences in the nature of their early environments. Moreover, there is evidence of decline in the state of early child development in Canada in recent years, concurrent with increasing economic and time pressures on families. To date, Canada has had the weakest public policy response (among the wealthy countries) to the emerging understanding of the importance of the early years. If recent activities and initiatives in Ontario, Quebec, the Canadian Senate and several other provinces are fully realized, Canada will begin to close the gap between what we know and what we do in the early childhood years.

J	McCartney, G; Hanlon, P				McCartney, G.; Hanlon, P.			What can health professionals contribute to the challenge of sustainability?	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Ecological public health; Sustainability; Climate change; Obesity; Inequalities; Well-being	RISING ENERGY COSTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; WILL; FUTURE	Just as doctors have led aspects of social change in the past, health professionals today must contribute to and lead actions on sustainability. Exponential growth and unsustainability can be observed in the global population, energy use, money supply and greenhouse gas emissions. As with all unsustainable systems, they will become sustainable, but the timing and manner are undecided and carry profound health threats. We are trapped using outmoded forms of thinking and by our cognitive dissonance as we consider these threats in the light of our own lifestyles. The aim should be a transition that will lessen inequalities, combat problems such as obesity, depression and addictive behaviours, and improve wellbeing. The challenge is similar to other major public health issues in that the problem needs to be identified, evidence gathered, theories developed, alliances built, policies formulated and actions taken. This paper outlines how this can be done but suggests that the response needed will be unprecedented, and calls for action on what is known and debate about what is uncertain.

They examine the demographic structure of the Latino population and how nativity, age, income, and education are related to observed patterns of health and mortality. A key issue discussed is how to interpret the superior mortality indices of Latino immigrants and the subsequent declining health status of later generations. Explanations for differences in mortality include selection, reverse selection, death record inconsistencies, inequalities in health status, transnational migration, social marginality, and adaptation to environmental conditions in the United States. The utility of the public health social inequality framework and the status syndrome for explaining Latino disparities is discussed. The authors examine excess mortality from 8 causes: diabetes, stomach cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, liver disease, homicide, and work-related injuries. The impact of intergenerational changes in health behavior within the Latino population and the contributory role of suboptimal health care are interpreted in the context of implications for future research, public health programs, and policies.

To advance-and better integrate-research on political determinants of health inequities, the authors conducted a systematic search of the ISI Web of Knowledge and PubMed databases and identified 45 studies, commencing in 1992, that explicitly and empirically tested, in relation to an a priori political hypothesis, for either 1) changes in the magnitude of health inequities or 2) significant cross-national differences in the magnitude of health inequities. Overall, 84% of the studies focused on the global North, and all clustered around 4 political factors: 1) the transition to a capitalist economy; 2) neoliberal restructuring; 3) welfare states; and 4) political incorporation of subordinated racial/ethnic, indigenous, and gender groups. The evidence suggested that the first 2 factors probably increase health inequities, the third is inconsistently related, and the fourth helps reduce them. In this review, the authors critically summarize these studies' findings, consider methodological limitations, and propose a research agenda-with careful attention to spatiotemporal scale, level, time frame (e.g., life course, historical generation), choice of health outcomes, inclusion of polities, and specification of political mechanisms-to address the enormous gaps in knowledge that were identified.

Comparison of prenatal care coverage in early adolescents, late adolescents, and adult pregnant women in the Peruvian Amazon	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Adolescent pregnancy; Millennium Development Goals; Peru; Prenatal care		Objective: To compare prenatal care coverage between adolescent (early and late) and adult pregnant women in Iquitos, Peru. Methods: A random sample of 4467 birth records was collected. Multivariate analyses were performed to compare prenatal care coverage in all adolescent (10-14years, 15-19years) and adult (>= 20 years) age groups and then for primiparous women only. Results: The mean number of visits was 5.0 for adolescents aged 10-14 years, 6.1 for adolescents aged 15-19 years, and 6.2 for women aged 20 years or older. For primiparous women, the means were 5.1, 6.2, and 6.8, for the respective age groups. Both the proportion attending and the number of prenatal visits were significantly lower in primiparous adolescents aged 10-14 years than in primiparous women aged 20 years or older (aOR 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.62 and aRR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94, respectively). Conclusion: All women attended prenatal care more frequently than the WHO's recommended 4 visits; however, early adolescents attended significantly less often than late adolescents or adult women. Further study of this inequality is warranted to adequately inform local health services. (C) 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although we primarily focus on primary school completion rates, some attention is also given to measures of basic literacy as a more proximate indicator of human capital acquisition. Using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), we present data on cross-country variations in primary school completion rates, including gender and wealth gaps. While these data paint a picture of overall educational progress, particularly for girls, this general picture is juxtaposed against an extremely diverse landscape across Africa with respect to primary school completion as well as retained literacy. Cross-country variation in primary school completion can be partially explained by variations in national per capita income and is highly correlated with cross-country variations in primary completion rates achieved 20 years ago, but we still find surprising variations in educational Outcomes, among the poorest countries. Among the 24 sub-Saharan African countries with a purchasing power parity GNI less than $1000, we find a significant variation in both primary completion rates and achieved literacy, Suggesting that educational progress is possible even in resource challenged environments. At the same time, our findings are sobering; in many countries, international educational goals are unlikely to be reached by 2015 and learning outcomes are frequently abysmal.

J	Gwyther, L; Brennan, F; Harding, R				Gwyther, Liz; Brennan, Frank; Harding, Richard			Advancing Palliative Care as a Human Right	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Palliative care; human rights; equity; public health; strategy	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; BURDEN	The international palliative care community has articulated a simple but challenging proposition that palliative care is con international human right. International human rights covenants and the discipline of palliative care have., as common themes, the inherent dignity of the individual and the principles of universality and nondiscrimination. However, when we consider the evidence for the, effectiveness of palliative care, the lack of palliative care provision for those who may benefit from it is of grave concern. Three disciplines (palliative care, public, health, and human rights) are now interacting with a growing resonance. The maturing of palliative care as a clinical specialty and, academic discipline has coincided with the development of a public health approach to global and community-wide health problems. The care of the dying is a public health issue. Given that death is both inevitable, and universal,, the care of people with life-limiting illness stands equal to all other public health issues. The International Covenant, on Economic, Social, and, Cultural Rights (ICESCR) includes the right to health care and General, Comment 14 (paragraph 34) CESCR stipulates that "States are yonder the obligation to respect the, right, to health by, inter alia, refraining form denying or limiting equal access for all personas,... to preventive, curative and palliative health services. "However; these rights are seen, to be aspirational-rights to be achieved progressively over tinier by each, signatory nation. to the maximum capacity of their available resources. Although a government may use insufficient resources as a justification for inadequacies of its response to palliative care and pain management, General Comment 14 set, out "core, obligations" and "obligations of comparable priority" in. the provision, of health care and placed the burden. on governments to justify "that every effort has nevertheless been male to use all available resources at its disposal in order to satisfy, as a matter of priority, (these) obligations." This article describes recent advocacy activities and, explores practical, strategies for the palliative care community to use within a human rights framework to advance palliative care development worldwide.

Inadequate specific information is available about the prevalence and patterns of health conditions of people with disabilities, effective interventions, and policy-relevant research about what works to improve health and functioning of people with disabilities. In view of the urgency of the issues at stake and scarcity of resources, research contributing to improvement of health of people with disabilities needs to be prioritised. We invited 82 stakeholders to list and score research options, with the priority-setting method of the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative. 83 research questions were assessed for answerability, applicability, sensitivity support within the context, and equity. The leading research priority was identification of barriers that people with disabilities have in accessing health services at different levels, and finding the best possible strategies to integrate their needs into primary health-care systems and ensure local delivery. Results showed that addressing specific impairments is secondary to ensuring that health systems provide adequately for all people with disabilities. Our findings are a call for urgent attention to the issue of access to appropriate health care for people with disabilities, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.

J	Ruger, JP				Ruger, Jennifer Prah			Global Health Justice	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article							HUMAN-RIGHTS; ETHICS	What are the respective roles and responsibilities of global, national, and local communities as well as individuals themselves to address health deprivations and avert health threats? This article offers the beginnings of a theory of global health justice, arguing for universal ethical norms (general duty) with shared global and domestic responsibility (specific duties) for health. It offers a global minimalist view I call 'provincial globalism' as a mean between nationalism and cosmopolitanism, in which a provincial consensus must accompany a global consensus on health morality. This minimalist account asserts global and national duties to promote human flourishing and, more specifically, individuals' central health capabilities. In this view, justice requires prioritizing responsibilities through shared health governance to reduce shortfall inequalities in central health capabilities-a general duty to reduce premature mortality and escapable morbidity. It examines the difficulties presented by the philosophical principles of connectedness, causality, remediation, partiality, and capacity in the allocation of responsibility for global health. It offers a theory of responsibility allocation based on a functional, health agency centered and homeostatic balanced understanding of the analytical components required to solve global health problems and parcels out roles and responsibilities at the global, national, local, and individual levels accordingly. Allocations of responsibility rest on the effectiveness and special obligations of different actors, respecting self-determination by groups and individuals and seeking voluntary commitments. This view understands that the remedy for global health problems must be sustainable to take nations and the global health community to a new global health equilibrium that remedies current problems and prepares for new health threats to come.

I begin by considering the relevance of the mouth and oral health to social interactions and physical health, and outline existing inequalities in oral health and healthcare experiences. The paper examines critically some of the existing published research in the field - considering both what might be described as sociology of oral health and healthcare and sociology in oral healthcare - and demonstrates the dearth of sociological research related to this subject compared to other areas of interest within the field of sociology of health and illness. I conclude by suggesting some ways in which this area could be expanded and developed further. I suggest that sociological analyses of how individuals experience, understand and manage their mouth and oral health, can add to and enhance the broader field of the sociology of health and illness. Further, examining experiences and provision of oral healthcare may provide sociology with a new opportunity to explore the neglected field of private healthcare, but also to engage with health policy makers who seek to address oral healthcare needs.

This paper examines the impact of the US welfare reform family-cap policy on the childbearing decisions of poor and low-income women by posing two complementary questions, both placed within a broader historical context. Specifically, it raises an empirical question pertaining to the family cap's effectiveness and a social justice question pertaining to the policy's ethical and legal justification in terms of human and reproductive rights. Methods. To address the first question, a thorough review of past and current research pertaining to the family cap at both the state and national levels is provided. The second question is addressed with an overview of international human and reproductive rights documents of relevance to the family-cap policy, as well as an analysis of the covenants' numerous components with which the family cap is in conflict. Finally, this paper situates the family cap in its historical context by investigating previous governmental attempts to control and regulate the reproductive health and rights of poor women and women of color in the United States. Main Findings. The majority of empirical analyses of the family cap have found that the policy has not had an impact on poor women's reproductive health behaviors. In addition, the exclusive application of this policy to poor women receiving cash assistance is demonstrated to be in violation of eight international human and reproductive rights documents, several of which the US is a signatory. Conclusion. These two findings make a strong case that policy makers and social and health researchers alike critically reexamine whether a policy that has not achieved its ostensible goal and is applied in a disparate manner-primarily to poor women and families and women of color-should continue to be implemented by the states.

This paper highlights a problematic aspect of that plan: the reliance on clinic-rather than home-based testing. First, drawing on DHS data from across Africa, we demonstrate the substantial differences in socio-demographic and economic profiles between those who report having ever had an HIV test, and those who report never having had one. Then, using data from a random household survey in rural Malawi, we show that substituting home-based for clinic-based testing may eliminate this source of inequality between those tested and those not tested. This result, which is stable across modeling frameworks, has important implications for accurately and equitably addressing the counseling and treatment programs that comprise the international health strategy against AIDS, and that promise to shape the future trajectory of the epidemic in Africa and beyond.

J	Duclos, P; Okwo-Bele, JM; Gacic-Dobo, M; Cherian, T				Duclos, Philippe; Okwo-Bele, Jean-Marie; Gacic-Dobo, Marta; Cherian, Thomas			Global immunization: status, progress, challenges and future	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							BURKINA-FASO; MEASLES VACCINATION; CHILDHOOD VACCINATION; EXPANDED PROGRAM; COVERAGE; DETERMINANTS; PAKISTAN; DISTRICTS; STRATEGY; VISION	Vaccines have made a major contribution to public health, including the eradication of one deadly disease, small pox, and the near eradication of another, poliomyelitis. Through the introduction of new vaccines, such as those against rotavirus and pneumococcal diseases, and with further improvements in coverage, vaccination can significantly contribute to the achievement of the health-related United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS) was developed by WHO and UNICEF as a framework for strengthening national immunization programmes and protect as many people as possible against more diseases by expanding the reach of immunization, including new vaccines, to every eligible person. This paper briefly reviews global progress and challenges with respect to public vaccination programmes. The most striking recent achievement has been that of reduction of global measles mortality from an estimated 750,000 deaths in 2000 down to 197,000 in 2007. Global vaccination coverage trends continued to be positive. In 2007 most regions reached more than 80% of their target populations with three doses of DPT containing vaccines. However, the coverage remains well short of the 2010 goal on 90% coverage, particularly in the WHO region of Africa (estimated coverage 74%), and South-East Asia, (estimated coverage 69%). Elements that have contributed to the gain in immunization coverage include national multi-year planning, district-level planning and monitoring, re-establishment of outreach services and the establishment of national budget lines for immunization services strengthening. Remaining challenges include the need to: develop and implement strategies for reaching the difficult to reach; support evidence-based decisions to prioritize new vaccines for introduction; strengthening immunization systems to deliver new vaccines; expand vaccination to include older age groups; scale up vaccine preventable disease surveillance; improve quality of immunization coverage monitoring and use the data to improve programme performance; and explore financing options for reaching the GIVS goals, particularly in lower-middle income countries. Although introduction of new vaccines is important, this should not be at the expense of sustaining existing immunization activities. Instead the introduction of new vaccine introduction should be viewed as an opportunity to strengthen immunization systems, increase vaccine coverage and reduce inequities of access to immunization services.

World Hlth Org-Global Forum Hlth R	Mental health research priorities in low- and middle-income countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							GENERAL MEDICAL JOURNALS; SETTING PRIORITIES; RESEARCH INVESTMENTS; RESPONSE RATES; SYSTEMS; DISORDERS; BURDEN; POLICY; CARE	Background Studies suggest a paucity of and lack of prioritisation in mental health research from low- and middle-income (LAMI) countries. Aims To investigate research priorities in mental health among researchers and other stakeholders in LAMI countries. Method We used a two-stage design that included identification, through literature searches and snowball technique, of researchers and stakeholders in 114 countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean; and a mail survey on priorities in research. Results The study identified broad agreement between researchers and stakeholders and across regions regarding research priorities. Epidemiology (burden and risk factors), health systems and social science ranked highest for type of research. Depression/anxiety, substance use disorders and psychoses; and children and adolescents, women, and people exposed to violence/trauma were prioritised among the disorders and population groups respectively. important criteria for prioritising research were burden of disease, social justice, and availability of funds. Stakeholder groups differed in the importance they gave to the personal interest of researchers as a criterion for prioritising research. Researchers' and stakeholders' priorities were consistent with burden of disease estimates, however suicide was underprioritised compared with its burden. Researchers' and stakeholders' priorities were also largely congruent with the researchers' projects. Conclusions The results of this first ever conducted survey of researchers and stakeholders regarding research priorities in mental health suggest that it should be possible to develop consensus at regional and international levels regarding the research agenda that is necessary to support health system objectives in LAMI countries.

J	Wraith, C; Stephenson, N				Wraith, Caroline; Stephenson, Niamh			Risk, insurance, preparedness and the disappearance of the population: The case of pandemic influenza	HEALTH SOCIOLOGY REVIEW			English	Article						Risk preparedness; sociology pandemic; influenza public; health; security	SCIENCE	The Australian response to the threat of pandemic influenza is part of a broader shift in public health and governance This shift in approach to risk from insurance to preparedness - has been triggered by the emergence Of incalculable, global, catastrophic risks Familiar, insurance-driven approaches to governing risk work by intervening at the level of the population. However, incalculable risks of the scale posed by pandemic influenza exceed the scope of insurance Now preparedness driven approaches are coming to the fore in public health. Preparedness focuses on protecting infrastructures and on guaranteeing the continuity of the political and economic order, and it entails discontinuous, temporal and localised expert responses. Importantly, this approach suggests that there is no need to look at the socio-historical contexts of disease. the population is of little direct concern. This, we suggest, raises doubts about how public health strategies which unfold in accordance with preparedness will recognise and tackle inequities. Finally. we consider the imperative to 'secure the nation' that preparedness brings to public health.

To better understand this response. tills article explores the portrayal of the pandemic in the Australian print media using critical discourse analysis to unpack the discourses surrounding the construction of the pandemic In particular, it examines how issues of power, ideology, causation and responsibility are expressed and utilised to validate certain stances and responses The findings demonstrate that the media presents a particular perspective on the pandemic that favours the agendas of industrialised nations Linguistic devices uncovered racist, medical and development discourses that give voice to industrialised nations and silence those from sub-Saharan Africa, limiting discussion on alternative responses. These findings highlight the utility of critical discourse analysis in understanding power structures that construct and influence responses to public health issues.

J	Fujiwara, T; Kawachi, I				Fujiwara, Takeo; Kawachi, Ichiro			Is education causally related to better health? A twin fixed-effect study in the USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Education; schooling; health status; health behaviours; twin study	SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; RISK-FACTORS; SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; CHILDHOOD IQ; MORTALITY; LEVEL; WOMEN; POPULATION	Background more years of schooling is generally associated with better health. However, this association may be confounded by unobserved common prior causes such as inherited ability, personality such as patience, or early family circumstances. The twin fixed-effect approach can potentially address this problem by cancelling these factors between twin pairs. The purpose of this study is to identify the causal effects of education on health and health behaviours using a twin fixed-effect approach. Methods We used twin data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, 1995-1996. The study population included 302 male [55.6% monozygotic (MZ) and 44.4% dizygotic (DZ)] and 387 female twin pairs (47.3% MZ and 52.7% DZ). A range of health outcomes [perceived global, physical and mental health, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, number of depressive symptoms] and health behaviours (smoking and physical activity) were examined among twin pairs who were discordant on years of schooling. Results Among MZ twins, more years of education was associated with better perceived global health. For all other health outcomes/behaviours, the point estimates of the effect of education in the fixed-effect analyses suggested a weak protective association. Among DZ male twins, each additional year of schooling lowered the prevalence of smoking by 32% [odds ratio (OR): 0.68, 95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.48-0.97] in the fixed-effect analysis. Conclusion The widely reported associations between schooling and health outcomes/behaviours may not reflect causal relationships in every instance. Although low statistical power may explain some of the null associations, our twin fixed-effect analyses suggest that at least some cases of the education/health relationship reflect confounding by unobserved third variables.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Review						Birth asphyxia; Community health worker; Community midwife; Hypoxia; Intrapartum; Neonatal mortality; Stillbirth; Traditional birth attendant	NEONATAL HEALTH-PROGRAM; MATERNAL MORTALITY; RURAL BANGLADESH; SYLHET DISTRICT; OBSTETRIC CARE; UTTAR-PRADESH; FIELD TRIAL; SCALING-UP; IMPACT; INTERVENTION	Background: For the world's 60 million non-facility births, addressing who is currently attending these births and what effect they have on birth outcomes is a key starting point toward improving care during childbirth. Objective: We present a systematic review of evidence for the effect of community-based cadres-community-based skilled birth attendants (SBAs), trained traditional birth attendants (TBAs), and community health workers (CHWs)-in improving perinatal and intrapartum-related outcomes. Results: The evidence for providing skilled birth attendance in the community is low quality, consisting of primarily before-and-after and quasi-experimental studies, with a pooled 12% reduction in all cause perinatal mortality (PMR) and a 22%-47% reduction in intrapartum-related neonatal mortality (IPR-NMR). Low/moderate quality evidence Suggests that TBA training may improve linkages with facilities and improve perinatal outcomes. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of TBA training showed a 30% reduction in PMR, and a meta-analysis demonstrated an 11% reduction in IPR-NMR. There is moderate evidence that CHWs have a positive impact on perinatal-neonatal outcomes. Meta-analysis of CHW packages (2 cluster randomized controlled trials, 2 quasi-experimental studies) showed a 28% reduction in PMR and a 36% reduction in early neonatal mortality rate; one quasi-ex peri mental study showed a 42% reduction in IPR-NMR. Conclusion: Skilled childbirth care is recommended for all pregnant women, and community strategies need to be linked to prompt, high-quality emergency obstetric care. CHWs may play a promising role in providing pregnancy and childbirth care, mobilizing communities, and improving perinatal outcomes in low-income settings. While the role of the TBA is still controversial, strategies emphasizing partnerships with the health system should be further considered. Innovative community-based strategies combined with health systems strengthening may improve childbirth care for the rural poor, help reduce gross inequities in maternal and newborn survival and stillbirth rates, and provide an effective transition to higher coverage for facility births.

This study examined prevalence and social inequality in adolescent overweight in 35 countries, and associations with macroeconomic factors. Design: International cross-sectional survey in national samples of schools. Subjects: A total of 11-, 13- and 15-year-olds from 35 countries in Europe and North America in 2001-2002 (N = 162 305). Measurements: The main outcome measure was overweight based on self-reported height and weight ( body mass index cut-points corresponding to body mass index of 25 kg/m(2) at the age of 18 years). Measures included family and school affluence (within countries), and average country income and economic inequality (between countries). Results: There were large variations in adolescent overweight, from 3.5% in Lithuanian girls to 31.7% in boys from Malta. Prevalence of overweight was higher among children from less affluent families in 21 of 24 Western and 5 of 10 Central European countries. However, children from more affluent families were at higher risk of overweight in Croatia, Estonia and Latvia. In Poland, Lithuania, Macedonia and Finland, girls from less affluent families were more overweight whereas the opposite was found for boys. Average country income was associated with prevalence and inequality in overweight when considering all countries together. However, economic inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient was differentially associated with prevalence and socioeconomic inequality in overweight among the 23-high income and 10-middle income countries, with a positive relationship among the high income countries and a negative association among the middle income countries. Conclusion: The direction and magnitude of social inequality in adolescent overweight shows large international variation, with negative social gradients in most countries, but positive social gradients, especially for boys, in some Central European countries. Macroeconomic factors are associated with the heterogeneity in prevalence and social inequality of adolescent overweight.

The cost-effectiveness of removing television advertising of high-fat and/or high-sugar food and beverages to Australian children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						children; advertising; modelling health benefit; cost-effectiveness	OBESITY; WEIGHT; HEALTH; BANS	Objective: To model the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of banning television ( TV) advertisements in Australia for energy-dense, nutrient-poor food and beverages during children's peak viewing times. Methods: Benefits were modelled as changes in body mass index (BMI) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved. Intervention costs (AUD$) were compared with future health-care cost offsets from reduced prevalence of obesity-related health conditions. Changes in BMI were assumed to be maintained through to adulthood. The comparator was current practice, the reference year was 2001, and the discount rate for costs and benefits was 3%. The impact of the withdrawal of non-core food and beverage advertisements on children's actual food consumption was drawn from the best available evidence ( a randomized controlled trial of advertisement exposure and food consumption). Supporting evidence was found in ecological relationships between TV advertising and childhood obesity, and from the effects of marketing bans on other products. A Working Group of stakeholders provided input into decisions surrounding the modelling assumptions and second-stage filters of 'strength of evidence', 'equity', 'acceptability to stakeholders', 'feasibility of implementation', 'sustainability' and 'side-effects'. Results: The intervention had a gross incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD$ 3.70 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) $2.40, $7.70) per DALY. Total DALYs saved were 37 000 ( 95% UI 16 000, 59 000). When the present value of potential savings in future health-care costs was considered (AUD$ 300m ( 95% UI $130m, $480m), the intervention was 'dominant', because it resulted in both a health gain and a cost offset compared with current practice. Conclusions: Although recognizing the limitations of the available evidence, restricting TV food advertising to children would be one of the most cost-effective population-based interventions available to governments today. Despite its economic credentials from a public health perspective, the initiative is strongly opposed by food and advertising industries and is under review by the current Australian government.

Questionnaires, workplace assessments, and discussion groups were conducted at a regional hospital in South Africa to obtain baseline data and input from the workforce in designing interventions. Findings highlighted weaknesses in knowledge, for example regarding the use of N95 respirators and safe handling of sharps, and suggested the need for improved training. Access to supplies and personal protective equipment was the major reported reason for failure to follow proper procedures; this was confirmed by workplace assessments. Discussion groups highlighted the important role for worker Health and Safety Committees (HSC), including in combating stigma and encouraging reporting. Interest in data to support decision-snaking resulted in development of the Occupational Health and Safety Information System (OHASIS); further training of HSCs is still needed. Multi-stakeholder international collaboration aimed at building HSC capacity is well-received.

Methods: The study used economic data from the 2006 United Nations Development Program Human Development Report and survey data from the 2005/2006 Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) study which included 66,9 10 11-year-olds in 37 countries. Ecological correlations tested associations between income inequality and bullying among countries. Multilevel linear and ordinal regression analyses tested the effects of income inequality on perceived social support and bullying others at school. Results; Income inequality was associated with rates of bullying among the 37 countries (r = .62). Multilevel analyses indicated that each standard deviation increase in income inequality corresponded with more frequent bullying by males (odds ratio = 1.17) and females (odds ratio = 1.24), less family support and school support but more peer support. Social support from families and schools was associated with less bullying after differences in wealth were taken into account; however, social support did not account for the association between income inequality and bullying. Conclusions: Countries with high income inequality have more school bullying among preadolescents than countries with low income inequality. Further study is needed to understand the mechanisms that account for this association. Findings suggest that adolescents in areas of wide income inequality-not only those in deprived schools and neighborhoods-should be a focus of antibullying campaigns.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that UK South Asians are at three times increased risk of hospitalisation for asthma when compared to white Europeans. US asthma trials are far more likely to report enrolling minority ethnic people into studies than those conducted in Europe. We investigated approaches to bolster recruitment of South Asians into UK asthma studies through qualitative research with US and UK researchers, and UK community leaders. Methods and Findings: Interviews were conducted with 36 researchers (19 UK and 17 US) from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and ten community leaders from a range of ethnic, religious, and linguistic backgrounds, followed by self-completion questionnaires. Interviews were digitally recorded, translated where necessary, and transcribed. The Framework approach was used for analysis. Barriers to ethnic minority participation revolved around five key themes: (i) researchers' own attitudes, which ranged from empathy to antipathy to (in a minority of cases) misgivings about the scientific importance of the question under study; (ii) stereotypes and prejudices about the difficulties in engaging with minority ethnic populations; (iii) the logistical challenges posed by language, cultural differences, and research costs set against the need to demonstrate value for money; (iv) the unique contexts of the two countries; and (v) poorly developed understanding amongst some minority ethnic leaders of what research entails and aims to achieve. US researchers were considerably more positive than their UK counterparts about the importance and logistics of including ethnic minorities, which appeared to a large extent to reflect the longer-term impact of the National Institutes of Health's requirement to include minority ethnic people. Conclusions: Most researchers and community leaders view the broadening of participation in research as important and are reasonably optimistic about the feasibility of recruiting South Asians into asthma studies provided that the barriers can be overcome. Suggested strategies for improving recruitment in the UK included a considerably improved support structure to provide academics with essential contextual information (e. g., languages of particular importance and contact with local gatekeepers), and the need to ensure that care is taken to engage with the minority ethnic communities in ways that are both culturally appropriate and sustainable; ensuring reciprocal benefits was seen as one key way of avoiding gatekeeper fatigue. Although voluntary measures to encourage researchers may have some impact, greater impact might be achieved if UK funding bodies followed the lead of the US National Institutes of Health requiring recruitment of ethnic minorities. Such a move is, however, likely in the short-to medium-term, to prove unpopular with many UK academics because of the added "hassle" factor in engaging with more diverse populations than many have hitherto been accustomed to.

SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						advocacy; consumer-driven health care; health savings accounts; social justice; social work ethics		Health planning in the United States is rapidly approaching a fork in the policy road, with one direction leading the nation toward a universal plan with strong government involvement and the other direction strengthening existing market-based reforms and preserving a commercial health insurance industry "Consumer-driven health care," a slogan that captures a range of market-based approaches to preserving patient choice and increasing cost savings, is most commonly implemented in the form of individual health savings accounts. These accounts are offered to employees as a means of increasing the cost sharing of personal health care expenses. The author provides an overview of health insurance history and discusses some implications of abandoning earlier practices of risk pooling health care expenses a cross a wider community. Access and affordability issues connected with the adoption of a consumer-driven health care system in the United States are addressed. Parallels are drawn between the expansion of community-based insurance in the United States following World War II and social work's historic commitment to social justice and economic inclusion. Suggestions are made for social workers' involvement in health policy discourse and activism during this critical time of national reflection on universal versus market-based reforms for the U.S. health care system.

The overall injury death rate of 157.8 per 100 000 population is nearly twice the global average, and the-rate of homicide of women by intimate partners is six times the global average. With a focus on homicide, and violence against women and children, we review the magnitude, contexts of occurrence, and patterns of violence, and refer to traffic-related and other unintentional injuries. The social dynamics that support violence are widespread poverty, unemployment, and income inequality; patriarchal notions of masculinity that valourise toughness, risk-taking, and defence of honour; exposure to abuse in childhood and weak parenting; access to firearms; widespread alcohol misuse; and weaknesses in the mechanisms of law enforcement. Although there have been advances in development of services for victims of violence, innovation from non-governmental organisations, and evidence from research, there has been a conspicuous absence of government stewardship and leadership. Successful prevention of violence and injury is contingent on identification by the government of violence as a strategic priority and development of an intersectoral plan based on empirically driven programmes and policies.

During mid-to-late adolescence, youth often become more critical about the place they live. Their attachment to home and even community may decrease as they explore and develop new attachments to other specific places. The aim of this study is to understand how 15-year-old students from 13 countries perceive their local neighborhood area (place attachment, social capital and safety), and how these different community cognitions are interrelated. We hypothesize that their place attachment predicts safety, and that the relationship is mediated in part by social capital. Result show that, despite cross-cultural differences in neighborhood perceptions, the proposed theoretical model fits robustly across all 13 countries.

BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN			English	Article						global health; international health; development; poverty; global; development; developing countries	LOW-INCOME; DISEASE; COUNTRIES; POVERTY	The subject of 'global health' can be considered from multiple points of view. While epidemiologists might describe global health problems in categories of pathology groups, social scientists might consider the problem from the stand point of institutional and infrastructural strengths and failings. An over-arching theme, however, is that the distribution of the burden of ill health is disproportionately carried by the poor. This paper aims to defend the idea that inequality should be considered the main priority in global ill health. Review of the literature, personal communications and the WHO commission on the Social Determinants of Health. The extent and urgency of global health problems. The cause of ill health and the appropriate intervention. We all need a deeper appreciation of the plight of the poor and the extent to which suffering can be mitigated by striving for a more equitable future. Research into the broader global forces that impact on economic disparity (for the better and the worse) and the extent to which they effect measureable health outcomes is an extremely important area for research in this day and age.

J	Taylor, S				Taylor, Sebastian			Wealth, health and equity: convergence to divergence in late 20th century globalization	BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN			English	Article						growth; wealth; health; health equity; social determinants; globalization	PUBLIC-HEALTH; MORTALITY; CARE	Debate over relationships between economic growth, wealth, health and health inequity is long-standing and ongoing. The main message of this paper is that economic growth, while necessary, is not a sufficient condition in itself for achieving equitable health. This review surveys and draws on research into principal factors commonly linked with improving health-income, health care, individual behavior-suggesting, using work from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health, that these are better understood in a broader social determinants of health framework. The paper acknowledges that post-war globalization has seen significant growth, poverty reduction and greater economic resources at individual and household levels all of which can contribute to better health. But it also highlights renewing inequity in global health during the period. It argues that over-reliance on market-driven growth, which fails to address deep-rooted social inequalities in economic resources key to accessing social determinants of health, and in the key determinants of health themselves have contributed to increasing inequity in health outcomes. Commitment to market-driven growth remains evident in national policy-making worldwide. With increasing health inequity, and calamitous global economic events in 2008-09, the centrality of this commitment needs urgently to be reviewed.

By 2030, 8 of 10 leading causes of death will be linked to these conditions. The burden of NCDs poses serious implications for social and economic development worldwide but particularly for LAMICs. WHO and member states have developed a clear vision represented by the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases and an implementation plan to tackle this epidemic, incorporating lessons learned from international experience and the work of WHO in member states. The 2008 NCD Action Plan, which advocates an integrated approach to NCD prevention and control, with emphasis on the role of primary health care, is based on current scientific knowledge, available evidence and a review of international experience. It comprises a set of actions to tackle the growing public-health burden imposed by NCDs. For the plan to be implemented successfully, high-level political commitment and the concerted involvement of governments, communities and health-care providers are required; in addition, public-health policies will need to be reoriented and allocation of resources improved.

We lack a coherent understanding of Global Health but its reach is beyond that of governments and entails concepts of justice and humanity as well as biomedicine and all the attendant semi-congruent disciplines. The development of Global Health will redefine the roles of all the stakeholders in the international health community be they individuals, institutions, agencies or medical journals. At present the gestation of Global Health involves the chaotic tumbling, rumbling and knocking together of ideas and aspirations. The hope must be that the outcome will be the highest attainable standard of health for all if not the perfectibility of humankind.

Caribbean nurses migrating to the UK: a gender-focused literature review	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Review						Caribbean; Developing Countries; Gender; Immigration; International Issues; Nurses; Recruitment; United Kingdom		Background: International nurse recruitment is an integral part of government health care strategy in many countries. However, the gendered implications of nurse migration have been little explored despite the fact that the nursing workforce is predominantly made up of women. Aim: Based on the migration of nurses from the English-speaking Caribbean region to the UK, this paper explores the significance of gender at both the macro and micro levels. Methods: Four strands of inquiry were explored: nurse migration, impact on development, work experiences and family life. Key terms were used to search the electronic databases SSCI, EBSCO and JSTOR. An interpretative framework based on the feminist theory of intersectionality was used to systematically review the 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Findings: Gender issues are significant across all aspects of the migratory process. Migrant nurses contribute to social progress through remittances and knowledge gained abroad although overall, nurse migration negatively impacts development and there are hidden implications for women. For some Caribbean nurses, migration reflects increased economic freedom; however, for others, gender inequality lies at the centre of the decision to relocate. Gender inequality also permeates the lives of many migrant nurses even in countries where economic and work conditions are improved. Conclusions: The ramifications of nurse migration cannot be fully understood without attention to gender inequalities and the specific socio-economic contexts in which they exist. There is need for a gender-centred approach to international nursing recruitment policy that takes account not only of the impact on developing countries, but also of the well-being of migrant nurses themselves.

Lessons from eleven primary health care nursing innovations in New Zealand	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						Advancing Nursing Practice; Change; Innovation; New Zealand; Policy; Primary Health Care Nursing; Leadership; Service Development	TEAM	Introduction: In New Zealand in 2003, 11 primary health care (PHC) nursing innovation projects and an evaluation of the initiative were funded by the Ministry of Health to develop and explore the ways new models of nursing practice could help address health inequalities and contribute to PHC. Design and Methods: A research-and-development approach was used in the evaluation. Data were gathered from interviews with national stakeholders, workshops with personnel from all projects, visits to each project site and case studies of four projects. Analysis involved assessing each project individually as well as the projects as a whole. Context: The initiative was one of many international and local PHC developments in this period designed to reduce health inequalities and improve patient care and health outcomes. Findings: Each project was developed from a different starting point; was located in different parts of the health system; and had different levels of funding. Some were principally focused on leading nursing development; others focused on developing nursing practice. Each involved influencing or providing nursing services, nurse education, leadership and service integration. Most projects progressed well, but some had limited success. Lessons: Lessons are on many levels, and include those related to: developing successful innovation; the importance of nursing leadership; developing the nursing workforce; and advancing nursing practice. Conclusion: The funding of the innovative projects enabled nurses to pioneer developments. Such funding is important, as it paves the way for change and provides an opportunity for reflection and new learnings.

JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						community nursing; critical social theory; health inequalities; political advocacy; politics; social justice; sociological theory	CRITICAL SOCIAL-THEORY; EMPOWERMENT; COMMUNITY; JUSTICE; NURSES; FRAMEWORK; EDUCATION; ADVOCACY; HOME	Title. Being and doing politics: an outdated model or 21st century reality?. Aim. This paper presents a discussion of how critical social theory can be used as a tool for research, reflection and exploration of the political role of the nurse. Background. Sociological theory can be used to examine ideologies within nursing systems in order to contribute to the future development of the profession. The importance of critical social theory has been identified in the literature as being directly relevant to holism which is central to the nature of nursing. Data sources. Texts published in English were identified from 1990 to 2008 using the keywords critical social theory, community nursing, political advocacy, social justice, sociological theory, health inequalities, health democracy, equity and inequality. Discussion. Critical social theory can be used as a tool to highlight ethical ways to practise nursing. One reason for examination of the community nurse's political role is a shift in focus from the individual as patient to communities experiencing health inequalities. Nursing needs to decide whether the profession will work at the political level, and where advocacy and citizenship are located within a community role. Conclusion. Nurse educators must prepare nurses for political participation, and nurse managers need to focus on national and local contexts in order to encourage policy analysis and community engagement within nursing practice. An understanding of critical social theory can aid decision-making in relation to global and local policy, enable the nursing profession to respond to social injustice, and permit nurses to work with communities in the pursuit of community health.

As in developed countries, older women in India report poorer self-reported health and experience greater immobility compared with men. Stepwise logistic regression analysis shows that the gender differential in health is linked to various socioeconomic and demographic variables and that the gender gap could be narrowed with appropriate policy intervention. Specifically, paying special attention towards improving the socioeconomic status of widowed/separated women could attenuate a substantial portion of the observed gender gap in the health of the old-age population.

Caregiving related to gender role socialization, burden, and economic and health consequences has been discussed in the literature. Together this body of work demonstrates some positive but mainly negative consequences to the health and economic circumstances of women. Overall achievement of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals has important implications for informal caregivers globally, because achievement of these goals is essential to reducing the undue burden, the lost opportunities, and the injustice of health care systems that take advantage of women's volunteer caregiving.

Data were collected from 29 nurse experts by semi-structured individual interviews or focus groups in Beijing and Shanghai, China. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Seven themes were identified: altruism, caring, trustworthiness, dignity, responsibility for the development of the profession, autonomy, and justice. On the whole, these values were in accordance with the codes of the International Council of Nurses and the Chinese Nursing Association. Additionally, culture and socioeconomic trends were found to have an influence on nurses' understanding and explanation of professional values. The findings of this study provided insight into Chinese nurses' professional values and might contribute to the future development of a culturally sensitive scale to measure nursing values in China.

J	Almond, P				Almond, Palo			Postnatal depression : A global public health perspective	PERSPECTIVES IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						epidemiology; literature review; postnatal depression; global public health; inequalities	POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; MATERNAL DEPRESSION; RISK-FACTORS; SOCIAL SUPPORT; MOTHERS; WOMEN; PREVALENCE; PREGNANCY; COMMUNITY; INTERVENTION	The aim of this paper is to discuss whether or not postnatal depression is a global public health concern Public health is the study of the morbidity mortality and the cause and course of disease, at a population rather than an individual level. Public health is also concerned with examining factors that cause health inequalities. Postnatal depression is a mental and emotional condition that can affect women during the first postnatal year. Since the effects of postnatal depression are known to go beyond the mother in that it also affects the partner and the child, it can be deemed a public health problem. Additionally, severe postnatal depression can lead to infanticide as well as maternal death, often by suicide. Furthermore, evidence demonstrates that all countries are faced with the challenge of postnatal depression, but low- to middle-income countries face the greatest burden. The literature revealed various treatment options for this complex condition. However, it also uncovered that not all women are assessed for postnatal depression, nor do all women receive treatment. The emerging picture is that postnatal depression is indeed a public health problem, particularly as the incidence is much higher than the quoted rate of 10%-15%. This paper recommends direction for public health-orientated perinatal mental health research and suggests that service providers should consider the routine assessment of all postnatal women.

J	Broom, A; Doron, A; Tovey, P				Broom, Alex; Doron, Assa; Tovey, Philip			The inequalities of medical pluralism: Hierarchies of health, the politics of tradition and the economies of care in Indian oncology	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						India; Cancer; Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM); Oncology	COMPLEMENTARY; ANTHROPOLOGY; LIFE	India has an eclectic health system that incorporates biomedical as well as traditional, complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM). Our understanding of the co-existence of these therapeutic modalities in this diverse, postcolonial and developing nation is extremely limited, and in the context of cancer care. to our knowledge no sociological work has been carried out. Contemporary Indian oncology represents a fascinating site for examining the interplay and articulation of forms of tradition/modernity, economic progress/structural constraint and individual beliefs/cultural norms. in a context of an increase in the prevalence and impact of cancer in an ageing Indian population, this paper reports on a qualitative investigation of a group of oncology clinicians' accounts of 'pluralism' in India. The results illustrate the embeddedness of patient disease and therapeutic trajectories in vast social inequalities and, indeed, the intermingling of therapeutic pluralism and the politics of social value. We conclude that notions of pluralism, so often espoused by global health organisations, may conceal important forms of social inequality and cultural divides, and that sociologists should play a critical role in highlighting these issues.

Biological mechanisms of disease and death in Moscow: rationale and design of the survey on Stress Aging and Health in Russia (SAHR)	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review							CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; HOME BLOOD-PRESSURE; RATE-VARIABILITY; RISK-FACTORS; CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY; CIRCADIAN VARIATION; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; PREMATURE MORTALITY; PERCEIVED CONTROL; ALLOSTATIC LOAD	Background: Prior research has revealed large differences in health and mortality across countries, socioeconomic groups, and individuals. Russia experiences one of the world's highest levels of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, great mortality differences within the population, and a heavy burden of ill health. Psychological stress has been suggested as a likely explanation of health loss and premature death in Russia and Eastern Europe. However, physiological mechanisms connecting stress with health in Russia remain unclear since existing epidemiological data are scarce and limited to conventional risk factors. Method and Design: The survey on Stress Aging and Health in Russia (SAHR) is addressing this knowledge gap by collecting an unusually rich database that includes a wide range of reported information, physical and cognitive health outcomes, and biomarkers in a sample of Muscovite men and women aged 55 and older. The total planned sample size is 2,000 individuals. The sample was randomly selected from epidemiological cohorts formed in Moscow between the mid-1970s and the 1990s and from medical population registers. The baseline data collection was carried out from December 2006 to June 2009. Interviews and medical tests were administered at hospital or at home according to standardized protocol. Questionnaire information includes health, socio-demographic characteristics, economic well-being, cognitive functioning, and batteries on stress and depression. Biomarkers include anthropometry, grip strength, resting ECG, conventional cardiovascular factors of risk such as lipid profile and blood pressure, and other biochemical parameters such as those related to inflammation, glucose and insulin resistance, coagulation, fibrinolysis, and stress hormones. In addition to these measurements, SAHR includes dynamic biomarkers provided by 24-hour ECG (Holter) monitoring. This method continuously registers the beat-to-beat heart rate in naturalistic conditions without restrictions on normal daily activities. It provides information about heart functioning, including heart rate variability and ischemic and arrhythmic events. Re-examination of the study subjects will be conducted in 2009-2011 and will focus on health, functional status, economic conditions, behaviors, and attitudes towards aging. The subjects are also followed up for mortality and non-fatal health events. Discussion: The SAHR will produce a valuable set of established and novel biomarkers combined with self-reported data for the international research community and will provide important insights into factors and biological mechanisms of mortality and health losses in Russia.

International organizations such as the Global Health Workforce Alliance have been established to address this crisis. A technical working group within the Global Health Workforce Alliance developed recommendations for scaling up education and training of health workers. The paper will illustrate how decision-makers can use evidence and tools from an equity-oriented toolkit to scale up training and education of health workers, following five recommendations of the technical working group. The Equity-Oriented Toolkit, developed by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Knowledge Translation and Health Technology Assessment in Health Equity, has four major steps: (1) burden of illness; (2) community effectiveness; (3) economic evaluation; and (4) knowledge translation/implementation. Relevant tools from each of these steps will be matched with the appropriate recommendation from the technical working group.

J	Weston, D				Weston, Del			Policy on global warming: fiddling while the globe burns?	AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						global warming; global economic system; poverty; inequality; carbon trading		Objective: To assess the extent that the health consequences of global warming and the responses to it take due account of its impact on poverty and inequality. Method: Reviewing the relevant literature on global warming, proposed solutions and the impact. Results: To date, too little attention has been paid to the health consequences arising from the increased poverty and inequality that global warming will bring. When these are combined with issues arising from the economic melt-down, food shortages, peak oil, etc. we are heading for a global public health crisis of immeasurable magnitude. Conclusion: Solutions lie in rethinking the global economic system that we have relied upon over the past several decades and the global institutions that have led and fed off that global system-the IMF, the World Bank and so on. Implications: Public health practitioners need to look and act globally more often. They need to better recognise the links between global warming and the global financial crisis. How the latter is dealt with will determine whether the former can be resolved. It is in this global political economy arena that future action in public health lies.

Recent findings Most young people begin sexual activity in their teenage years. Extensive research has been conducted to elucidate risk and protective factors for sexual activity in adolescence and to evaluate the success of different sex education programs in influencing these factors. Some risk and protective factors were similar globally, whereas others differed by sex and community. Research findings suggest that comprehensive sex education, which includes skills-based interventions, is effective in changing youth behavior. In addition, research points towards the importance of addressing larger structural and contextual issues such as gender equality, poverty, and education in improving the sexual health of adolescents. Summary Adolescents begin their sexual lives in their teen years; therefore, clinicians need to focus on positive ways to help teenagers develop healthy relationships while providing guidance around reducing risky sexual behaviors.

J	Takahashi, S				Takahashi, Saul			Drug Control, Human Rights, and the Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health: By No Means Straightforward Issues	HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY			English	Article								There has been increasing attention to the importance of respecting the human rights of addicts with regard to illicit drug trafficking and abuse. The debate is multifaceted, encompassing issues involving drug control as it relates to criminal justice, the death penalty, mandated treatment, and, most prominently, the right to the highest attainable standard of health. This article addresses each of these issues, focusing on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, including the ongoing international debate surrounding controversial "harm reduction" measures. The applicability of this right to drug control is not as straightforward as is often presented, and some of the arguments put forward come dangerously close to stating that there is a "right to abuse drugs," which the author disputes.											16	12	13	0	0	JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS	BALTIMORE	JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA	0275-0392			HUM RIGHTS QUART	Hum.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						International Conference on Population and Development; Global health; Global health funding; Maternal health; Sexual and reproductive health		This article surveys the current situation and prospects for attaining the goals set by the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in 1994, and the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), set in 2000. Encouraging changes in the policy environment are highlighted, but the available resources do not yet match needs. Global maternal mortality figures, at over 500 000 a year, have not changed since 1990, and morbidity is about 20 million. Some countries have made progress with low-cost, high-yield interventions such as family planning, skilled birth attendants, access to emergency obstetric and neonatal care, management of sexually transmitted infections, and HIV prevention. However, progress in many low-income countries has been slow, and few are on track to meet the goals. There are wide inequities in care among and within countries. Suggestions for priority attention are offered, such as a "continuum of care" approach, integrated services, and comprehensive policies on human resources for health.

J	Milliez, J				Milliez, Jacques			Rights to safe motherhood and newborn health: Ethical issues	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Ethics; Newborn health; Safe motherhood; Women's rights	MATERNAL MORTALITY; CARE	Worldwide, one woman dies every minute as a result of being pregnant. This statistic highlights the denial of women's rights to safe motherhood in many parts of the world, particularly in low-resource countries where 98% all maternal deaths occur. The majority of pregnant women die because they deliver unattended by a properly trained birth professional. According to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, every woman has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of herself and her family, including medical care. The principle of moral philosophy supporting women's rights to safe motherhood may be difficult to implement. Philanthropy is diverted by other competing needs, such as HIV prevention and treatment, or provision of urgent food supplies. Equity is denied because women's health is too often set as a low priority. Utilitarianism advocates that safe motherhood is an investment of societal shared interest.

However, every year 536 000 pregnant women are dying. There is no ambiguity about why most of these women are dying. These tragedies are avoidable if women have timely access to quality essential obstetric and emergency care. Rural and poor women are mostly excluded from accessing skilled and emergency care. Quality facility-based care is the best option to reduce maternal mortality. Scaling up essential interventions and services-particularly for those who are excluded-is a substantial and challenging undertaking. We need to challenge our policy makers and program managers to refocus program content; to shift focus from development of new technologies toward development of viable organizational strategies to provide access to essential and emergency obstetric care 24 hours a day 7 days a week, and account for every birth and every death.

The operationalization of the right to contraception, for universal access to a wide range of effective methods, necessitates very different but complementary interventions. A rights-based approach should aim to respect, protect, and fulfill rights. The wishes of individuals concerning childbearing necessitate informed choice, access to services, and lack of prejudice. Equity should be addressed through the strengthening of health systems, especially primary health care, with emphasis on the needs of underserved populations. Official pronouncements on population issues necessitate commitments. A philosophy of rights is particularly useful for service implementation, including the introduction of new contraceptive methods, by addressing the responsibilities of duty bearers and the claims of right holders. With the rights to and overwhelming health benefits of contraception, it is imperative to reverse the wrongs of limited reproductive health services.

Social inequalities in the use of health care services after 8 years of health care reforms - a comparative study of the Baltic countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health system reforms; Inequalities; Access to health care; Baltic States; Socioeconomic factors; International comparison	ESTONIA; LITHUANIA; MORTALITY; EDUCATION; FINLAND; LATVIA; EUROPE	In nineties, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have implemented a wide range of changes to health systems. The objective of this paper was to assess social inequalities in utilisation of, and access to, health care services in the late nineties. The comparative NORBALT Survey conducted in 1999 is used. Direct standardization and logistic regression was applied to analyse primary, out-patient and hospital care utilisation, and self reported financial barriers, by socio-demographic and geographical variables. In all three countries social inequalities in utilization were large for out-patient specialist care, smaller or absent with regards to primary care or to hospitalisations. Inequalities were large and consistent in relationship to household income, less so in relationship to educational level. Inequalities in utilization of care were larger in Latvia as well in the self reported barriers to health care in absolute and relative terms were larger. After 8 years of reforms, important pro-rich inequalities in the use of health services existed. In Latvia, these inequalities were largest, possibly due to higher ratio of cost sharing as compared to Estonia and Lithuania.

JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLITICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article							PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; WORLD CITIES; NEW-YORK; CARE; INEQUITIES; DELIVERY; COUNTRIES; FINANCE	The question posed in this article is whether single-payer health care systems are more likely to provide equal treatment for equal need (horizontal equity) than are multipayer systems. To address this question, we compare access to primary and specialty health care services across selected neighborhoods, grouped by average household income, in a single-payer system (the English NHS), a multiple-payer system with universal coverage (French National Health Insurance), and the U. S. multiple-payer system characterized by large gaps in health insurance coverage. We find that Paris residents, including those with low incomes, have better access to health care than their counterparts in Inner London and Manhattan. This finding casts doubt on the notion that the number of payers influences the capacity of a health care system to provide equitable access to its residents. The lesson is to worry less about the number of payers and more about the system's ability to assure access to primary and specialty care services.

J	Johnston, HB				Johnston, Heidi Bart			Relationships of Exclusion and Cohesion with Health: The Case of Bangladesh	JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION			English	Article						Health equity; Social determinants of health; Social exclusion; Bangladesh	SOCIAL EXCLUSION; RURAL BANGLADESH; CREDIT PROGRAMS; URBAN SLUM; POOR; PARTICIPATION; INCOME; CHILD; CARE	The concept of social exclusion, applied widely in the European Union, has in recent years been gaining use in Bangladesh, mostly by international development agencies. Does this discourse of deprivation, developed in the welfare states of northern Europe, have salience in its application to deprivation in countries like Bangladesh where, for example, 31% of the rural population lives in chronic poverty? The concept of social exclusion has three principal components: a dynamic and relational perspective which requires the identification of who or what causes exclusion; an explicit recognition of multiple dimensions of deprivation; and a longitudinal perspective, recognizing that individuals and groups are dynamic intra- and intergenerationally. The Social Exclusion Knowledge Network of the World Health Organization Commission on Social Determinants of Health expanded the concept to include health status as a contributor to and an outcome of exclusion and to show that actors beyond the state or public sector can critically impact exclusionary processes. In the Bangladesh application, the relevance of the modified model was explored to find that while there are negative associations between social exclusion and health status, much stronger documentation is needed of the relationship. The modification of including multiple sectors, such as private enterprise and civil society, in addition to the state, as having potential to impact exclusionary processes is fundamental to the application of the social exclusion model in Bangladesh.

Can Social Inclusion Policies Reduce Health Inequalities in Sub-Saharan Africa?-A Rapid Policy Appraisal	JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION			English	Article						Health inequalities; Social Exclusion Knowledge Network; Social inclusion; Sub-Saharan Africa		The global resurgence of interest in the social determinants of health provides an opportunity for determined action on unacceptable and unjust health inequalities that exist within and between countries. This paper reviews three categories of social inclusion policies: cash-transfers; free social services; and specific institutional arrangements for programme integration in six selected countries-Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe. The policies were appraised as part of the Social Exclusion Knowledge Network (SEKN set up under the auspices of the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health. The paper highlights the development landscape in sub-Saharan Africa and presents available indicators of the scale of inequity in the six countries. A summary of the policies appraised is presented, including whether or what the impact of these policies has been on health inequalities. Crosscutting benefits include poverty alleviation, notably among vulnerable children and youths, improved economic opportunities for disadvantaged households, reduction in access barriers to social services, and improved nutrition intake. The impact of these benefits, and hence the policies, on health status can only be inferred. Among the policies reviewed, weaknesses or constraints were in design and implementation. The policy design weaknesses include targeting criteria, their enforcement and latent costs, inadequate participation of the community and failure to take the cultural context into account. A major weakness of most policies was the lack of a monitoring and evaluation system, with clear indicators that incorporate system responsiveness. The policy implementation weaknesses include uneven regional implementation with rural areas worst affected; inadequate or poor administrative and implementation capacity; insufficient resources; problems of fraud and corruption; and lack of involvement of civil servants, exacerbating implementation capacity problems. The key messages to sub-Saharan African governments include: health inequalities must be measured; social policies must be carefully designed and effectively implemented addressing the constraints identified; monitoring and evaluation systems need improvement; and participation of the community needs to be encouraged through conducive and enabling environments. There is a need for a strong movement by civil society to address health inequalities and to hold governments accountable for improved health and reduced health inequalities.

J	Harmon, SHE				Harmon, Shawn H. E.			International public health law: not so much WHO as why, and not enough WHO and why not?	MEDICINE HEALTH CARE AND PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						International public health; World Health Organization; Regulation; Law-making; Ethics; Values; Norms	FRAMEWORK CONVENTION; SURVIVAL NEEDS; ORGANIZATION; GOVERNANCE; JUSTICE; ETHICS; PEOPLE	To state the obvious, "health matters'', but health (or its equitable enjoyment) is neither simple nor easy. Public health in particular, which encompasses a broad collection of complex and multidisciplinary activities which are critical to the wellbeing and security of individuals, populations and nations, is a difficult milieu to master effectively. In fact, despite the vital importance of public health, there is a relative dearth of ethico-legal norms tailored for, and directed at, the public health sector, particularly at the international level. This is a state of affairs which is no longer tenable in the global environment. This article argues that public health promotion is a moral duty, and that international actors are key stake-holders upon whom this duty falls. In particular, the World Health Organization bears a heavy responsibility in this regard. The article claims that better health can and must be better promoted through a more robust interpretation of the WHO's role, arguing that neither the WHO nor international law have yet played their necessary part in promoting health for all.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Based on demographic, epidemiological and burden of disease data, seven diseases were selected by the Ministry of Health as targets of the initiative. Publications on these diseases by Brazilian researchers were retrieved from international databases, analyzed and processed with text-mining tools in order to standardize author- and institution's names and addresses. Co-authorship networks based on these publications were assembled, visualized and analyzed with social network analysis software packages. Network visualization and analysis generated new information, allowing better design and strategic planning of the Program, enabling decision makers to characterize network components by area of work, identify institutions as well as authors playing major roles as central hubs or located at critical network cut-points and readily detect authors or institutions participating in large international scientific collaborating networks. Conclusions/Significance: Traditional criteria used to monitor and evaluate research proposals or R&D Programs, such as researchers' productivity and impact factor of scientific publications, are of limited value when addressing research areas of low productivity or involving institutions from endemic regions where human resources are limited. Network analysis was found to generate new and valuable information relevant to the strategic planning, implementation and monitoring of the Program. It afforded a more proactive role of the funding agencies in relation to public health and equity goals, to scientific capacity building objectives and a more consistent engagement of institutions and authors from endemic regions based on innovative criteria and parameters anchored on objective scientific data.

Our method compares successful and unsuccessful applicants in a lottery used by Pakistan to allocate Hajj visas. Pilgrim accounts stress that the Hajj leads to a feeling of unity with fellow Muslims, but outsiders have sometimes feared that this could be accompanied by antipathy toward non-Muslims. We find that participation in the Hajj increases observance of global Islamic practices, such as prayer and fasting, while decreasing participation in localized practices and beliefs, such as the use of amulets and dowry. It increases belief in equality and harmony among ethnic groups and Islamic sects and leads to more favorable attitudes toward women, including greater acceptance of female education and employment. Increased unity within the Islamic world is not accompanied by antipathy toward non-Muslims. Instead, Hajjis show increased belief in peace, and in equality and harmony among adherents of different religions. The evidence suggests that these changes are likely due to exposure to and interaction with Hajjis from around the world, rather than to a changed social role of pilgrims upon return.

In the immediate post-independence period, democratic and egalitarian policy in some countries pointed to the expansion of health services to under-served areas. However, the idealism associated with independence waned and more pronounced tensions emerged. Plans for expanded primary health care systems were sacrificed in favour of hospital services for a privileged elite. Over the same period, a group of international agencies have been associated with the promotion of more egalitarian and primary health care-focused strategies. But there has been a failure to engage at the political level and a willingness to accept instead token assent to the strategy. The consequence for hospitals has been an impasse. Hospitals do not meet elite expectations but neither do resources reach the larger population.

J	Smith, S; Normand, C				Smith, Samantha; Normand, Charles			Analysing equity in health care financing: A flow of funds approach	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Ireland; Equity; Health care financing; Resource flows	ASIA	There are concerns that existing methods for analysing equity in Irish health care financing, based on progressivity index measures, are not adequately capturing patterns of inequity that occur in practice. This paper follows a new direction in the literature whereby equity in health care financing and delivery are analysed together. A flow of funds for Irish health care resources is developed and applied to data for 2004. The framework traces the flow of public and private health resources from individuals to financial intermediaries, from there to health care providers and functions, and from there to individuals. Individuals are categorised by health care entitlement status. Findings indicate that broad progressive patterns in aggregate resource flows hide less equitable patterns that require further attention and there are complex interactions between public and private resources. The flow of funds approach complements existing analytic methods and generates policy lessons for Irish and international policy makers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Arps, S				Arps, Shahna			Threats to safe motherhood in Honduran Miskito communities: Local perceptions of factors that contribute to maternal mortality	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Honduras; Miskito; Maternal mortality; Maternal health; Mothers; Women; Childbirth; Pregnancy	DEAD MOTHERS; MOZAMBIQUE; CARE; CONTEXT; RISK	Despite global initiatives to lower rates of maternal death, barriers to safe motherhood persist, particularly in socially and economically marginalized communities. This article describes the risks that women in Honduran Miskito villages encounter during pregnancy and childbirth. Ethnographic data are used to examine emic understandings of the underlying causes of maternal death. Participant observation, four community discussions, individual interviews with 218 women and five midwives, and a maternal mortality survey were conducted during November 2004 through November 2005. Case studies are drawn from the 55 death histories collected during the survey to illustrate the factors that contribute to maternal mortality. Community members identified poverty, gender inequality, witchcraft, and sorcery as major threats to safe motherhood. All of these factors influence women's health-related behaviors; and therefore, each issue deserves attention from public health officials. Designing appropriate interventions to improve maternal health depends on understanding the forces that increase women's vulnerability during pregnancy and childbirth. Local perspectives of risk, even when they diverge from biomedical understandings, point to specific needs, issues to address, and avenues for effective intervention. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to ensure the protection of those most vulnerable, bioethics must experience a similar expansion and progression worldwide. Inequalities in healthcare remain an influential issue to redress on a global scale, and may provide an opportunity to induce a paradigm shift in the worldwide approach to medical research. In particular, clinical trials performed in a nation different to that of the sponsoring institution must appreciate any underlying ethical conflict and ensure that the volunteers involved are treated with the best attainable and sustainable standards.

A review of injury epidemiology in the UK and Europe: some methodological considerations in constructing rates	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review							CHILDHOOD INJURIES; UNINTENTIONAL INJURY; MAJOR TRAUMA; SEVERITY SCORE; MULTIPLE INJURIES; GENERAL-PRACTICE; ADMISSION RATES; TRAVEL PATTERNS; GLOBAL BURDEN; DEATH RATES	Background: Serious injuries have been stated as a public health priority in the UK. However, there appears to be a lack of information on population-based rates of serious injury (as defined by a recognised taxonomy of injury severity) at national level from either official statistics or research papers. We aim to address this through a search and review of literature primarily focused within the UK and Europe. Methods: The review summarizes research papers on the subject of population based injury epidemiology published from 1970 to 2008. We examined critically methodological approaches in measuring injury incident rates including data sources, description of the injury pyramid, matching numerator and denominator populations as well as the relationship between injury and socioeconomic status. Results: National representative rates come from research papers using official statistics sources, often focusing on mortality data alone. Few studies present data from the perspective of an injury pyramid or using a standardized measure of injury severity, i.e. Injury Severity Score (ISS). The population movement that may result in a possible numerator-denominator mismatch has been acknowledged in five research studies and in official statistics. The epidemiological profile shows over the past decades in UK and Europe a decrease in injury death rates. No major trauma population based rates are available within well defined populations across UK over recent time periods. Both fatal and non-fatal injury rates occurred more frequently in males than females with higher rates in males up to 65 years, then in females over 65 years. Road traffic crashes and falls are predominant injury mechanisms. Whereas a straightforward inverse association between injury death rates and socio-economic status has been observed, the evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in non-fatal injuries rates has not been wholly consistent. Conclusion: New methodological approaches should be developed to deal with the study design inconsistencies and the knowledge gaps identified across this review. Trauma registries contain injury data from hospitals within larger regions and code injury by Abbreviated Injury Scale enabling information on severity; these may be reliable data sources to improve understanding of injury epidemiology.

J	Wang, ZJ				Wang, Zijun			Stock returns and the short-run predictability of health expenditure: Some empirical evidence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING			English	Article						Health expenditure predictability; Stock returns; Structural breaks; Forecast comparisons	CARE EXPENDITURE; TESTS; OUTPUT	The rising cost of health care, compounded with an aging population, has been the subject of constant discussion in the popular media. Accurate forecasts of health care expenditure are therefore important for both policy makers and industrial practitioners. Extending a branch of the macroeconomics literature that examines the role of asset prices as useful predictors of major macro variables (such as consumption, output growth and inflation), this study investigates whether the current equity market captures useful information on the growth of future health care expenditure. We focus on short-run (one-year) predictability. The preliminary evidence based on US data shows that industry-specific stock returns have some predictive power for personal health care expenditure and its major components (hospital care, durable medical equipment and prescription drugs). Nevertheless, the significance of the improvement in forecasting accuracy depends on the estimation scheme and whether parameter inconstancy is accounted for.

We re-framed Code articles in terms of farmers' rights and drew on survey data, farmer focus group results, and direct observations of agrochemical stores in Ecuador and Peru to construct indicators reflecting respect for such rights. Use of highly (Ia and Ib) and moderately (II) hazardous pesticides was common. Worse indicators were observed in places with lower education, greater poverty, and more use of indigenous languages. Limited government enforcement capacity, social irresponsibility of the pesticide industry, and lack of farmers' knowledge of the Code were all factors impeding respect for farmers' rights. Addressing the power imbalance among social actors requires informed farmer and farmworker participation in monitoring adherence and active involvement of non-governmental organizations and municipal governments.

It was hypothesised that policies which target the poor are associated with greater income inequality in oral health quality of life than those that provide earnings-related benefits to all citizens. Methods: Data were from nationally representative surveys in the UK (n=4064), Finland (n=5078), Germany (n=1454) and Australia (n=2292) conducted from 1998 to 2002. The typology of Korpi and Palme classifies these countries into four different welfare states. In each survey, subjects completed the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire, which evaluates the adverse consequence of dental conditions on quality of life. For each country, survey estimation commands were used to create linear regression models that estimated the slope of the gradient between four quartiles of income and OHIP-14 severity scores. Parameter estimates for income gradients were contrasted across countries using Wald chi(2) tests specifying a critical p value of 0.008, equivalent to a Bonferroni correction of p<0.05 for the six pairwise tests. Results: Statistically significant income gradients in OHIP-14 severity scores were found in all countries except Germany. A global test confirmed significant cross-national differences in the magnitude of income gradients. In Australia, where a flat rate of benefits targeted the poor, the mean OHIP-14 severity score reduced by 1.7 units (95% CI 22.15 to 21.34) with each increasing quartile of household income, a significantly steeper gradient than in other countries. Conclusion: The coverage and generosity of welfare state benefits appear to influence levels of inequality in population oral health quality of life.	[Sanders, A. E.; Slade, G.

J	Montagu, D; Graff, M				Montagu, Dominic; Graff, Maura			Equity and financing for sexual and reproductive health service delivery: current innovations	JOURNAL OF FAMILY PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE			English	Article						developing countries; equity; finance; service delivery; sexual and reproductive health	IMPACT	National and international decisions on financing for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services have profound effects on the type, unit costs and distribution of SRH commodities and services produced, and on their availability and consumption. Much international and national funding is politically driven and is doing little for equity and quality improvement. Financing remains a significant challenge in most developing countries and demands creative responses. While no "one-size-fits-all" solution exists, there are numerous ongoing examples of successful innovations, many of which are focusing on resource pooling and on purchasing or subsidising SRH services. In this article we have used interviews, grey literature and presentations made at a range of recent public fora to identify new and innovative ways of financing SRH services so as to increase equity in developing countries. Because SRH services are often of low value as a personal good but high value as a public good, we summarise the issues from a societal perspective, highlighting the importance of financing and policy decisions for SRH services. We provide a structured overview of what novel approaches to financing appear to have positive effects in a range of developing countries. Targeting, government payment mechanisms, subsidy delivery and co-financing for sustainability are highlighted as showing particular promise. Examples are used throughout the article to illustrate innovative strategies.

J	Maclachlan, M				Maclachlan, Malcolm			Health in the Inter-land	JOURNAL OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							PSYCHOLOGY	Estacio presents the exploitation of migrant workers, particularly those from low income countries, as a challenge for critical health psychology. This resonates with calls for an understanding of health that reflects its social determinants, the influence of power relationships and the need for social justice to promote people's welfare and rights. Recent developments in international health policy now call for an approach to health that is inter-disciplinary inter-sectoral and inter-ministerial. This presents critical health psychology with an opportunity and an obligation to address health in this complex 'inter-land' The concept of 'research for health', the recommendations of the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health and the Bamako Call for Action on Research for Health, are outlined in relation to this challenge.

In this commentary I develop Estacio's discussion of the importance of racism in regard to health inequalities. Using her structure, I briefly suggest additional ways in which critical health psychologists may approach these issues by drawing on work from psychology and other disciplines to develop just approaches to health research and practice.

Currently over 6000 people access specialist, Palliative care services annually, a figure that is projected to rise to 12,500 by 2016. In 2006, the Irish Hospice Foundation entered a joint advocacy alliance with the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Association for Palliative Care. By speaking with one voice and using quality data, these three national voluntary groups were able to influence government and social partners to address clearly identified regional inequities in the provision of palliative care services. Over the past, three years, there has been significant Public investment in palliative care services, culminating in the recent publication by the national health agency of a five-year plan for a comprehensive national palliative care service. However, the sudden economic downturn in 2008 and the severe deterioration of public finances threaten the implementation of the plan. New services can only be developed if there is strong evidence to illustrate that. they are cost-effective in delivering patient care. Having reviewed the international evidence, the joint advocacy group has used this economic evidence to strengthen the case that the development of palliative care services can actually save money in health budgets. The campaign. mounted by the joint advocacy group was greatly facilitated by the existence of good data and an agreed evidence-based policy on what constitutes a comprehensive service.

J	Dariel, OPD				Dariel, Odessa Petit Dit			Nursing education: In pursuit of cosmopolitanism	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Cultural competence; Nursing education; Curricula; Humanism	CULTURAL COMPETENCE; DIVERSITY	Changing demographics, globalization, and an increasingly complex health care system demands progressive approaches to reaching our goals of competent transcultural care. Despite original contributions made by pioneers in cultural appreciation, nursing curricula are still falling short in addressing these issues in both education and practice. Many nurses enter their fields with little knowledge of the societal injustices and educational inequities that haunt the populations they care for. A cosmopolitan approach to nursing education is proposed to assist students in recognizing the complexity and uniqueness of individual experiences, rather than merely attempting to place them into categories based on gender, culture, race, or age. Being a global citizen and a cosmopolitan nurse requires participation in, and valuing of, the common good of society as a whole. Practicing the profession outside of comfort zones can lead to an appreciation for how all our choices are part of a complex global network. Nursing education should be responsible for developing in students the deepest knowledge base as well as the highest degree of critical independence. Cosmopolitan nurses could be the model for 21st century practitioners and future nurse leaders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Racine, L				Racine, Louise			Applying Antonio Gramsci's philosophy to postcolonial feminist social and political activism in nursing	NURSING PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						nursing philosophy; nursing research; philosophy of nursing; the marginalized culture; non-Western populations	CULTURAL SAFETY; HEALTH; JUSTICE	Through its social and political activism goals, postcolonial feminist theoretical approaches not only focus on individual issues that affect health but encompass the examination of the complex interplay between neocolonialism, neoliberalism, and globalization, in mediating the health of non-Western immigrants and refugees. Postcolonial feminism holds the promise to influence nursing research and practice in the 21st century where health remains a goal to achieve and a commitment for humanity. This is especially relevant for nurses, who act as global citizens and as voices for the voiceless. The commitment of nursing to social justice must be further strengthened by relying on postcolonial theories to address issues of health inequities that arise from marginalization and racialization. In using postcolonial feminist theories, nurse researchers locate the inquiry process within a Gramscian philosophy of praxis that represents knowledge in action.

J	Miklós, A				Miklos, Andras			Public Health and the Rights of States	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article								When exercising their public health powers, states claim various rights against their subjects and aliens. The paper considers whether public health considerations can help justify some of these rights, and explores some constraints on the justificatory force of public health considerations. I outline two arguments about the moral grounds for states' rights with regard to public health. The principle of fairness emphasizes that those who benefit from public health measures ought to contribute their fair share in upholding them. Alternatively, states' rights might be justified by a natural duty of justice to uphold and not to obstruct institutions implementing public health policies. I indicate some reasons for preferring the latter justification. I further argue that the assignment of some rights to states via public health-based justification is undermined on several counts. Domestic political institutions cannot effectively perform some of their functions in protecting public health. Furthermore, transborder public health threats pose collective action problems at the global level. Finally, concerns about human rights work against the assignment of some rights to states. I conclude by arguing that these concerns call for global coordination, and that some rights claimed by states ought instead to be assigned to global institutions.

From there, I will describe a conception of transnational justice that seems especially promising and explore selected policy options.

J	Selgelid, MJ				Selgelid, Michael J.			A Moderate Pluralist Approach to Public Health Policy and Ethics	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article								This article advocates the development of a moderate pluralist theory of political philosophy that recognizes that utility, liberty and equality are legitimate, independent social values and that none should have absolute priority over the others. Inter alia, such a theory would provide a principled means for striking a balance, or making trade-offs, between these values in cases of conflict. Recent developments in public health ethics have made progress in thinking about how to make trade-offs between liberty and utility in particular. While public health ethicists often claim that the least restrictive alternative should be used to achieve the public health goal in question, I argue that a plausible but under-recognized idea is that the least restrictive alternative might sometimes involve improvement of global health via redistributive taxation-i. e., rather than coercive social distancing measures. I conclude by demonstrating that the proportionality principle leaves open the question of when exactly utility outweighs liberty or vice versa-and I argue that, rather than speaking about the morality of liberty-infringing public health interventions in categorical/binary terms, it would be more fruitful and realistic to think and speak about the degree to which a liberty-infringing public health intervention is morally appropriate.

J	Jürges, H				Juerges, Hendrik			HEALTHY MINDS IN HEALTHY BODIES: AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF EDUCATION-RELATED INEQUALITY IN PHYSICAL HEALTH AMONG OLDER ADULTS	SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article							SELF-ASSESSED HEALTH; EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; INCOME; MORTALITY; WEALTH	We study education-related inequality in the physical health of older adults across 11 European countries and the United States. Combining the data from Health and Retirement Study 2002, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing 2002 and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe 2004, our results suggest that education is strongly correlated with health both across and within countries. Education-related inequality in health is larger in Mediterranean and Anglo-Saxon countries than in western European countries. We find no evidence of a trade-off between health levels and equity in health. Education-related inequality in health is hardly driven by income or wealth effects (except in the United States), and differences in health behaviours (smoking) by education level contribute little to health differences across education groups.

Functions of health fatalism: fatalistic talk as face saving, uncertainty management, stress relief and sense making	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS			English	Article						fatalism; functionalist theory; content analysis; health disparities	BREAST-CANCER; LAY UNDERSTANDINGS; INEQUALITIES; PERCEPTIONS; PREVENTION; GENETICS; WOMEN; RISK; DISPARITIES; REDUCTION	Much research on fatalism assumes that fatalistic statements represent a global outlook that conflicts with belief in the efficacy of health behaviours. Other scholars have suggested a more contextual approach, suggesting that fatalism fulfils personal and social functions. This study analyses 96 in-depth lay interviews in the US, most with low-income members of the general public, about four diseases: heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes and depression. Within these interviews, fatalistic statements always occurred alongside statements endorsing the utility of behaviours for protecting health. This usage pattern suggests that these statements may have useful functions, rather than being simply a repudiation of the utility of health choices. We examine four functions that are suggested by previous researchers or by the participants' comments: stress relief, uncertainty management, sense making and (less strongly) face saving. As these themes indicate, individuals often make fatalistic statements to express an understanding of locally or broadly limiting factors for health efficacy, including genes, spiritual agents, prior behaviours, personality, and other factors.

The complexities of measuring access to parks and physical activity sites in New York City: a quantitative and qualitative approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; HEALTH; AVAILABILITY; WALKING; ACCESSIBILITY; DISPARITIES; RESOURCES	Background: Proximity to parks and physical activity sites has been linked to an increase in active behaviors, and positive impacts on health outcomes such as lower rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Since populations with a low socio-economic status as well as racial and ethnic minorities tend to experience worse health outcomes in the USA, access to parks and physical activity sites may be an environmental justice issue. Geographic Information systems were used to conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses of park accessibility in New York City, which included kernel density estimation, ordinary least squares (global) regression, geographically weighted (local) regression, and longitudinal case studies, consisting of field work and archival research. Accessibility was measured by both density of park acreage and density of physical activity sites. Independent variables included percent non-Hispanic black, percent Hispanic, percent below poverty, percent of adults without high school diploma, percent with limited English-speaking ability, and population density. Results: The ordinary least squares linear regression found weak relationships in both the park acreage density and the physical activity site density models (R-a(2) = .11 and .23, respectively; AIC = 7162 and 3529, respectively). Geographically weighted regression, however, suggested spatial non-stationarity in both models, indicating disparities in accessibility that vary over space with respect to magnitude and directionality of the relationships (AIC = 2014 and -1241, respectively). The qualitative analysis supported the findings of the local regression, confirming that although there is a geographically inequitable distribution of park space and physical activity sites, it is not globally predicted by race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status. Conclusion: The combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated the complexity of the issues around racial and ethnic disparities in park access. They revealed trends that may not have been otherwise detectable, such as the spatially inconsistent relationship between physical activity site density and sociodemographics. In order to establish a more stable global model, a number of additional factors, variables, and methods might be used to quantify park accessibility, such as network analysis of proximity, perception of accessibility and usability, and additional park quality characteristics. Accurate measurement of park accessibility can therefore be important in showing the links between opportunities for active behavior and beneficial health outcomes.

Some critics have claimed that these initiatives burden health systems that are already fragile in countries with few resources, whereas others have asserted that weak health systems prevent progress in meeting disease-specific targets. So far, most of the evidence for this debate has been provided by speculation and anecdotes. We use a review and analysis of existing data, and 15 new studies that were submitted to WHO for the purpose of writing this Report to describe the complex nature of the interplay between country health systems and GHIs. We suggest that this Report provides the most detailed compilation of published and emerging evidence so far, and provides a basis for identification of the ways in which GHIs and health systems can interact to mutually reinforce their effects. On the basis of the findings, we make some general recommendations and identify a series of action points for international partners, governments, and other stakeholders that will help ensure that investments in GHIs and country health systems can fulfil their potential to produce comprehensive and lasting results in disease-specific work, and advance the general public health agenda. The target date for achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals is drawing close, and the economic downturn threatens to undermine the improvements in health outcomes that have been achieved in the past few years. If adjustments to the interactions between GHIs and country health systems will improve efficiency, equity value for money, and outcomes in global public health, then these opportunities should not be missed.

Using extended concentration and achievement indices to study socioeconomic inequality in chronic childhood malnutrition: the case of Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; RISK-FACTORS; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; INFANT-MORTALITY; TREATED NETS; HEALTH; OBESITY; MATTER; UNDERNUTRITION; DETERMINANTS	Objectives: To assess and quantify the magnitude of inequalities in under-five child malnutrition, particularly those ascribable to socio-economic status Methods: Data on 4187 under-five children were derived from the Nigeria 2003 Demographic and Health Survey. Household asset index was used as the main indicator of socio-economic status. Socio-economic inequality in chronic childhood malnutrition was measured using the "extended" illness concentration and achievement indices. Results: There are considerable pro-rich inequalities in the distribution of stunting. South-east and south-west regions had low average levels of childhood malnutrition, but the inequalities between the poor and the better-off were very large. By contrast, North-east and North-west had fairly small gaps between the poor and the better-off on childhood malnutrition, but the average values of the childhood malnutrition was extremely high. Conclusion: There are significant differences in under-five child malnutrition that favour the better-off of society as a whole and all geopolitical regions. Like other studies have reported, reliance on global averages alone can be misleading. Thus there is a need for evaluating policies not only in terms of improvements in averages, but also improvements in distribution.

Methods Members of the Lancet Mental Health Group systematically listed and scored research investment options on four broad classes of disorders: schizophrenia and other major psychotic disorders, major depressive disorder and other common mental disorders, alcohol abuse and other substance abuse disorders, and the broad class of child and adolescent mental disorders. Using the priority-setting approach of the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative, the group listed various research questions and evaluated them using the criteria of answerability, effectiveness, deliverability, equity and potential impact on persisting burden of mental health disorders. Scores were then weighted according to the system of values expressed by a larger group of stakeholders. Findings The research questions that scored highest were related to health policy and systems research, where and how to deliver existing cost-effective interventions in a low-resource context, and epidemiological research on the broad categories of child and adolescent mental disorders or those pertaining to alcohol and drug abuse questions. The questions that scored lowest related to the development of new interventions and new drugs or pharmacological agents, vaccines or other technologies. Conclusion In the context of global mental health and with a time frame of the next 10 years, it would be best to fill critical knowledge gaps by investing in research into health policy and systems, epidemiology and improved delivery of cost-effective interventions.

Biofuels and the conundrum of sustainability	CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review							LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ETHANOL-PRODUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FUEL ETHANOL; BIO-ETHANOL; NET ENERGY; CELLULOSIC ETHANOL; LAND; BENEFITS	Sustainable energy is the problem of the 21st century. If biofuels want to be part of the solution they must accept a degree of scrutiny unprecedented in the development of a new industry. That is because sustainability deals explicitly with the role of biofuels in ensuring the well-being of our planet, our economy, and our society both today and in the future. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been the standard framework for assessing sustainability of biofuels. These assessments show that corn ethanol has a marginally lower fossil energy and greenhouse gas footprint compared to petroleum fuel. Sugarcane ethanol and some forms of biodiesel offer substantially lower footprints. New biofuels may offer low footprints. The science of LCA is being stretched to its limits as policy makers consider direct and indirect effects of biofuels on global land and water resources, global ecosystems, air quality, public health, and social justice.

It outlines patterns and trends in inequalities in infant mortality and some other birth outcomes, distinguishing between the use of routine data in some settings and research evidence in others. It suggests that some distinctive approaches about policies to reduce inequalities can be identified in the four countries. A number of emerging issues are also identified. One concerns the focus of interventions. Another relates to the use of targets. The third concern relates to the ways in which health inequalities are measured and monitored. Finally, the paper recommends the need for more research into areas such as the effectiveness of interventions, the nature of the problems facing ethnic minorities and the possible role of different social welfare regimes in achieving desired outcomes.

Ethnic differences in time trends in asthma prevalence in New Zealand: ISAAC Phases I and III	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Article						asthma; ethnicity; prevalence; time trends	CHILDHOOD ISAAC; SYMPTOMS; CHILDREN; ALLERGIES; ADOLESCENTS; INFECTIONS; ADMISSIONS; RATIONALE; SEVERITY	SETTING: The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) Phase III survey, New Zealand. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of asthma symptoms and time trends by ethnicity between ISAAC Phase 1 (1992-1993) and Phase III (2001-2003). DESIGN: Information on asthma symptoms and environmental exposures was collected in children aged 6-7 years (n = 10873) and adolescents aged 1.3-14 years (n 13317). RESULTS: In children, the prevalence of current wheeze was 28.5% in Maori (prevalence odds ratio [POR] = 1.49, 95%CI 1.32-1.68), and 25.2% in Pacific Islanders (POR. 1.28, 95%CI 1.07-1.54) compared with 20.7% in Europeans/Pakeha. In adolescents, 29.9% of Maori (POR = 1.13, 95%CI 1.03-1.23) and 20.80% of Pacific Islanders (POR 0.74, 95%CI 0.62-0.87) experienced current wheeze compared to 28.6% of Europeans/Pakeha. Between Phases I and III, the prevalence of current wheeze increased significantly by 0.49%/year in Pacific Islanders, increased non-significantly by 0.12%/year in Maori, and decreased significantly by 0.25%/year in Europeans/Pakeha children. In adolescents, the prevalence of current wheeze increased by 0.05%/year in Pacific Islanders and decreased by 0.33%/year in Europeans/Pakeha and by 0.07%/year in Maori. CONCLUSION: Ethnic differences in asthma symptom prevalence in New Zealand have increased. The reasons for this are unclear, but may reflect inequalities in access to health services.

Facilitators and barriers to adjustment of international nurses: an integrative review	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Review						Adjustment; Barriers; Facilitators; Integrative Review; International Nurses	IMMIGRANT NURSES; EXPERIENCES; RACISM	There is a scarcity of research focusing on issues encountered by international nurses (INs) in their adjustment to foreign health-care environments. Increasingly, INs are relied upon to address staffing shortages in many Western countries. As such, it is vital to identify what facilitates and what the barriers are to the successful adjustment in order to assist their integration into new workplace environments. This integrative review identifies facilitators and barriers encountered by INs as they adjust to foreign health-care environments. Based on Cooper's Five Stages of Integrative Research Review, a systematic search of eight electronic databases was conducted, combined with hand and ancestral searches. Two authors independently reviewed each qualified study for relevance and significance. Subsequently, facilitators and barriers were identified and categorized into themes and subthemes. Twenty-nine studies conducted in Australia, Canada, Iceland, UK and the USA were included in this review. Findings indicated that positive work ethic, persistence, psychosocial and logistical support, learning to be assertive and continuous learning facilitated the adjustment of INs to their new workplace environments. In contrast, language and communication difficulties, differences in culture-based lifeways, lack of support, inadequate orientation, differences in nursing practice and inequality were barriers. The review findings provide the basis for the development and testing of an evidence-informed programme to facilitate the successful adjustment of INs to their new work environments.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE; PERCEIVED FAIRNESS; JOB-SATISFACTION; PERSONALITY; SELF; PERCEPTIONS; OUTCOMES; ATTITUDES; SELECTION; VICTIMS	We investigated the hypotheses that personal belief in a just world (BJW) would enhance evaluations of working life (e.g., job satisfaction, organizational commitment), increase occupational trust (e.g., entrepreneurial self-efficacy, occupational self-efficacy), and boost mental health (e.g., life satisfaction, self-esteem). To test these hypotheses, we conducted 3 studies with employees and unemployed individuals in different career situations (total N = 593). Regression analyses revealed positive relationships between BJW and mental health, as well as occupational trust in all participant groups. These relationships persisted when controlling for objective success criteria and global personality traits. In addition, BJW was found to be associated with subjective quality of working life in employed individuals. We concluded that justice motive matters in the working context.

To refocus health research to target disease-burden reduction as the goal of research in child health, the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative developed a systematic strategy to rank health research options. This priority-setting exercise included listing of 46 competitive research options in diarrhoeal disease and their critical and quantitative appraisal by 10 experts based on five criteria for research that reflect the ability of the research to be translated into interventions and achieved disease-burden reduction. These criteria included the answerability of the research questions; the efficacy and effectiveness of the intervention resulting from the research; the maximal potential for disease-burden reduction of the interventions derived from the research; the affordability, deliverability, and sustainability of the intervention supported by the research; and the overall effect of the research-derived intervention on equity. Experts scored each research option independently to delineate the best investments for diarrhoeal disease control in the developing world to reduce the burden of disease by 2015. Priority scores obtained for health policy and systems research obtained eight of the top 10 rankings in overall scores, indicating that current investments in health research are significantly different from those estimated to be the most effective in reducing the global burden of diarrhoeal disease by 2015.

Results of panel regression analyses indicate that within less-developed countries, industrial water pollution is positively associated with FDI in the manufacturing sector. However, a stronger presence of environmental international nongovernmental organizations and the existence of environmental ministries both attenuate the environmental harms of secondary sector foreign investment, whereas state strength appears to have no such mitigating influence. These findings lend support to investment dependence theory and world society theory, and illustrate the potential environmental benefits of particular institutional factors. Further analyses suggest that industrial water pollution contributes to child and infant mortality in less-developed countries, which highlights the importance of investigating the structural determinants of industrial-based pollutants.

J	Rossabi, M				Rossabi, Morris			Mongolia: Transmogrification of a Communist Party	PACIFIC AFFAIRS			English	Article								The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), founded in 1924, ruled Mongolia as a one-party communist state until 1990. Following the model of the Soviet Union, it imposed a dictatorial government which engaged in a purge leading to the deaths of about 25,000 people, undermined Buddhism, and collectivized the herds. On the other hand, it fostered industrialization and urbanization, introduced modern educational and medical systems, and provided a social safety net for the population. Yet it kept Mongolia isolated from the rest of the world. The fall of communism transformed the MPRP. To hold power, it aligned itself with international financial organizations, which required acquiescence to a shock therapy of rapid privatization, liberalization of trade, elimination of price subsidies, a balanced budget and minimalist government, resulting in increased corruption, unemployment, and greater income inequality. Poverty soared, health and education suffered, and the social safety net was frayed. Market solutions, which both the international financial organizations and the MPRP championed, did not resolve these problems. To be sure, democracy and civil liberties have made great strides, and elections until the summer of 2008 were fair and free of violence. However, parlous economic conditions do not augur Well for the future. The MPRP has deviated from its social message of economic democracy and equality of economic opportunity, and the 2008-2009 world-wide financial crisis has exacerbated its problems.

J	Duley, L				Duley, Lelia			The Global Impact of Pre-eclampsia and Eclampsia	SEMINARS IN PERINATOLOGY			English	Review						pre-eclampsia; prevention; treatment; maternal mortality; maternal health	RISK-FACTORS; HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS; MAGNESIUM-SULFATE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; MATERNAL MORTALITY; CEREBRAL-PALSY; PRETERM BIRTH; INFANT GROWTH; LATER LIFE	Over half a million women die each year from pregnancy related causes, 99% in low and middle income countries. In many low income countries, complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death amongst women of reproductive years. The Millennium Development Goals have placed maternal health at the core of the struggle against poverty and inequality, as a matter of human rights. Ten percent of women have high blood pressure during pregnancy, and preeclampsia complicates 2% to 8% of pregnancies. Preeclampsia can lead to problems in the liver, kidneys, brain and the clotting system. Risks for the baby include poor growth and prematurity. Although outcome is often good, preeclampsia can be devastating and life threatening. Overall, 10% to 15% of direct maternal deaths are associated with preeclampsia and eclampsia. Where maternal mortality is high, most of deaths are attributable to eclampsia, rather than preeclampsia. Perinatal mortality is high following preeclampsia, and even higher following eclampsia. In low and middle income countries many public hospitals have limited access to neonatal intensive care, and so the mortality and morbidity is likely to be considerably higher than in settings where such facilities are available. The only interventions shown to prevent preeclampsia are antiplatelet agents, primarily low dose aspirin, and calcium supplementation. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Anti hypertensive drugs are mandatory for very high blood pressure. Plasma volume expansion, corticosteroids and antioxidant agents have been suggested for severe preeclampsia, but trials to date have not shown benefit. Optimal timing for delivery of women with severe preeclampsia before 32 to 34 weeks' gestation remains a dilemma. Magnesium sulfate can prevent and control eclamptic seizures. For preeclampsia, it more than halves the risk of eclampsia (number needed to treat 100, 95% confidence interval 50 to 100) and probably reduces the risk of maternal death. A quarter of women have side effects, primarily flushing. With clinical monitoring serious adverse effects are rare. Magnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant of choice for treating eclampsia; more effective than diazepam, phenytoin, or lytic cocktail. Although it is a low cost effective treatment, magnesium sulfate is not available in all low and middle income countries; scaling up its use for eclampsia and severe preeclampsia will contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

Globally, it is estimated that older people (those 60 years or older) constitute more than 11% of the population. As the HIV/AIDS pandemic rages in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), its impact on older people needs closer attention given the increased economic and social roles older people have taken on as a result of increased mortality among adults in the productive age groups. Few studies have looked at older people and their health in SSA or indeed the impact of HIV/AIDS on their health. This study aims to assess the effect of being directly or indirectly affected by HIV/AIDS on the health of older people in two Nairobi slums. Methods: Data were collected from residents of the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance area aged 50 years and above on 1(st) October 2006. Health status was assessed using the short SAGE (Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health) form and two outcome measures self-rated health and a composite health score - were generated. To assess HIV/AIDS affected status, respondents were asked: Have you personally been affected by HIV/AIDS? If yes, a follow up question: "How have you been personally affected by HIV/AIDS?" was asked. Ordinallogistic regression was used in models with self-rated health and linear regression in models with the health score. Results: About 18% of respondents reported being affected by HIV/AIDS in at least one way, although less than 1% reported being infected with HIV. Nearly 60% of respondents reported being in good health, 27% in fair health and 14% in poor health. The overall mean health score was 70.6 (SD: 13.9) with females reporting worse health outcomes than males. Respondents directly or indirectly affected by HIV/AIDS reported worse health outcomes than those not affected: mean health score: 68.5 and 71.1 respectively (t = 3.21, p = 0.0007), and an adjusted odds ratio of reporting poor health of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.12-1.80). Conclusion: Poor health outcomes among older people affected by HIV/AIDS highlight the need for policies that target them in the fight against HIV/AIDS if they are to play their envisaged care giving and other traditional roles.

Social determinants of health and health inequities in Nakuru (Kenya)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article								Background: Dramatic inequalities dominate global health today. The rapid urban growth sustained by Kenya in the last decades has created many difficulties that also led to worsening inequalities in health care. The continuous decline in its Human Development Index since the 1990s highlights the hardship that continues to worsen in the country, against the general trend of Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper examines the health status of residents in a major urban centre in Kenya and reviews the effects of selected social determinants on local health. Methods: Through field surveys, focus group discussions and a literature review, this study canvasses past and current initiatives and recommends priority actions. Results: Areas identified which unevenly affect the health of the most vulnerable segments of the population were: water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, food environments, housing, the organization of health care services and transportation. Conclusion: The use of a participatory method proved to be a useful approach that could benefit other urban centres in their analysis of social determinants of health.

Methods: HBSC is an international study including adolescents from 32 countries in Europe, Israel, and North America. The present study was based on information from 20,399 adolescents from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the United Kingdom. Data were analysed by regression models. Results: The initial analyses showed significant inequality in daily smoking in all countries except for Sweden. When adjusted for the mediating role of academic achievement, estimates were attenuated, but remained significant in three countries. Conclusion: The study found social inequality in daily smoking in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and United Kingdom, as well as inequalities in students' academic achievement and school satisfaction. The analyses also showed that above average academic achievement was associated with lower OR of smoking. Teachers and politicians may find this information useful, and allocate resources to give higher priority to a supportive environment in schools especially for children and adolescents in lower social groups. Subsequently this prioritisation might contribute to reducing smoking in this group.

How Race Becomes Biology: Embodiment of Social Inequality	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Review						race; genetics; human biological variation; health; racism	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; HUMAN GENETIC DIVERSITY; RACIAL RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; AMBULATORY BLOOD-PRESSURE; BLACK-WHITE DIFFERENCES; AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN; PUBLIC-HEALTH; RACIAL/ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION; SOCIOECONOMIC-FACTORS; PERCEIVED RACISM	The current debate over racial inequalities in health is arguably the most important venue for advancing both scientific and public understanding of race, racism, and human biological variation. In the United States and elsewhere, there are well-defined inequalities between racially defined groups for a range of biological outcomes-cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, certain cancers, low birth weight, preterm delivery, and others. Among biomedical researchers, these patterns are often taken as evidence of fundamental genetic differences between alleged races. However, a growing body of evidence establishes the primacy of social inequalities in the origin and persistence of racial health disparities. Here, 1 summarize this evidence and argue that the debate over racial inequalities in health presents an opportunity to refine the critique of race in three ways: 1) to reiterate why the race concept is inconsistent with patterns of global human genetic diversity; 2) to refocus attention on the complex, environmental influences on human biology at multiple levels of analysis and across the lifecourse; and 3) to revise the claim that race is a cultural construct and expand research on the sociocultural reality of race and racism. Drawing on recent developments in neighboring disciplines, I present a model for explaining how racial inequality becomes embodied-literally-in the biological well-being of racialized groups and individuals. This model requires a shift in the way we articulate the critique of race as bad biology. Am J Phys Anthropol 139:47-57, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We examined the socioeconomic distribution of adolescent exposure to bullying internationally and documented the contribution of the macroeconomic environment. Methods. We used an international survey of 162305 students aged 11, 13, and 15 years from nationally representative samples of 5998 schools in 35 countries in Europe and North America for the 2001-2002 school year. The survey used standardized measures of exposure to bullying and socioeconomic affluence. Results. Adolescents from families of low affluence reported higher prevalence of being victims of bullying (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10, 1.16). International differences in prevalence of exposure to bullying were not associated with the economic level of the country (as measured by gross national income) or the school, but wide disparities in affluence at a school and large economic inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) at the national level were associated with an increased prevalence of exposure to bullying. Conclusions. There is socioeconomic inequality in exposure to bullying among adolescents, leaving children of greater socioeconomic disadvantage at higher risk of victimization. Adolescents who attend schools and live in countries where socioeconomic differences are larger are at higher risk of being bullied.

The main review concerned the squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx. Recent findings Overall, the incidence of head and neck cancer is increasing in women, whereas it is decreasing in men. Chewing tobacco is a newly recognized risk factor of great public health concern. Human papillomavirus infection has been found to be a factor of good prognosis for oral cavity and oropharynx squamous cell cancer. The role of tobacco smoking and alcohol in the genesis of this cancer has been reinforced. Summary The presence or absence of human papillomavirus in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is a new parameter for prediction of long-term outcome of cancer of the oral cavity and of the oropharynx. Head and neck cancer among women in developing countries should deserve more attention, as the mortality rates appear to be higher than those of women in developed countries. For never smokers and never drinkers, more research needs to be done to identify their risk factor patterns.

J	Smith, DM; Clarke, GP; Harland, K				Smith, Dianna M.; Clarke, Graham P.; Harland, Kirk			Improving the synthetic data generation process in spatial microsimulation models	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE			English	Article							SIMBRITAIN	Simulation models are increasingly used in applied research to create synthetic micropopulations and predict possible individual-level outcomes of policy intervention. Previous research highlights the relevance of simulation techniques in estimating the potential outcomes of changes in areas such as taxation and child benefit policy, crime, education, or health inequalities. To date, however, there is very little published research on the creation, calibration, and testing of such micropopulations and models, and little on the issue of how well synthetic data can fit locally as opposed to globally in such models. This paper discusses the process of improving the process of synthetic micropopulation generation with the aim of improving and extending existing spatial microsimulation models. Experiments using different variable configurations to constrain the models are undertaken with the emphasis on producing a suite of models to match the different sociodemographic conditions found within a typical city. The results show that creating processes to generate area-specific synthetic populations, which reflect the diverse populations within the study area, provides more accurate population estimates for future policy work than the traditional global model configurations.

Strategies for gender-equitable HIV services in rural India	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Review						HIV; rural India; gender equity; health services; access to care; utilization	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; CARE-SEEKING BEHAVIOR; HEALTH-CARE; TUBERCULOSIS-CONTROL; SOCIOCULTURAL DETERMINANTS; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; PREGNANT-WOMEN; SOUTH-INDIA; PRIVATE; PROVIDERS	The emergence of HIV in rural India has the potential to heighten gender inequity in a context where women already suffer significant health disparities. Recent Indian health policies provide new opportunities to identify and implement gender-equitable rural HIV services. In this review, we adapt Mosley and Chens conceptual framework of health to outline determinants for HIV health services utilization and outcomes. Examining the framework through a gender lens, we conduct a comprehensive literature review for gender-related gaps in HIV clinical services in rural India, focusing on patient access and outcomes, provider practices, and institutional partnerships. Contextualizing findings from rural India in the broader international literature, we describe potential strategies for gender-equitable HIV services in rural India, as responses to the following three questions: (1) What gender-specific patient needs should be addressed for gender-equitable HIV testing and care (2) What do health care providers need to deliver HIV services with gender equity (3) How should institutions enforce and sustain gender-equitable HIV services Data at this early stage indicate substantial gender-related differences in HIV services in rural India, reflecting prevailing gender norms. Strategies including gender-specific HIV testing and care services would directly address current gender-specific patient needs. Rural care providers urgently need training in gender sensitivity and HIV-related communication and clinical skills. To enforce and sustain gender equity, multi-sectoral institutions must establish gender-equitable medical workplaces, interdisciplinary HIV services partnerships, and oversight methods, including analysis of gender-disaggregated data. A gender-equitable approach to rural Indias rapidly evolving HIV services programmes could serve as a foundation for gender equity in the overall health care system.

They increase revenue, access and financial protection, but concerns have been expressed about the equity of such schemes and their ability to reach the poorest. Few programmes routinely evaluate equity impacts, even though this is usually a key objective. This lack of evidence is related to the difficulties in collecting reliable data on utilization and socio-economic status. This paper describes the findings of an evaluation of the equity of Oxfams CHI schemes in rural Armenia. Methods Members of a random sample of 506 households in villages operating insurance schemes in rural Armenia were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Household wealth scores based on ownership of assets were generated using principal components analysis. Logistic and Poisson regression analyses were performed to identify the determinants of health facility utilization, and equity of access across socio-economic strata. Results The schemes have achieved a high level of equity, according to socio-economic status, age and gender. However, although levels of participation compare favourably with international experience, they remain relatively low due to a lack of affordability and a package of primary care that does not include coverage for chronic disease. Conclusion This paper demonstrates that the distribution of benefits among members of this community-financing scheme is equitable, and that such a degree of equity in community insurance can be achieved in such settings, possibly through an emphasis on accountability and local management. Such a scheme presents a workable model for investing in primary health care in resource-poor settings.

The fact that in New York City infant mortality fell from similar to 140 deaths per 1000 live births in 1900 to <60 per 1000 by 1930 indicates what can be achieved through improvements in public health, such as the provision of clean piped water, sewage disposal and fresh refrigeration. For children living in impoverished conditions today, excess mortality is largely due to infectious diseases for which there are effective vaccines. Thus, certain specific vaccines can reduce mortality and morbidity, improve quality of life and contribute to economic development. However, because many vaccines and the means to deliver them are beyond the financial resources of countries with the highest childhood mortality rates, strategies have been devised to provide vaccines to the most needy populations. These strategies include initiatives by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the International Finance Facility for Immunization and the Advanced Market Commitment, which together with various governments, international agencies and charitable foundations are providing funds to make life-saving vaccines available to the world's most needy children.

Ethical issues in funding research and development of drugs for neglected tropical diseases	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							GLOBAL HEALTH; BURDEN	Neglected and tropical diseases, pervasive in developing countries, are important contributors to global health inequalities. They remain largely untreated due to lack of effective and affordable treatments. Resource-poor countries cannot afford to develop the public health interventions needed to control neglected diseases. In addition, neglected diseases do not represent an attractive market for pharmaceutical industry. Although a number of international commitments, stated in the Millennium Development Goals, have been made to avert the risk of communicable diseases, tropical diseases still remain neglected due to delays in international assistance. This delay can be explained by the form international cooperation has generally taken, which is limited to promoting countries' national interests, rather than social justice at a global level. This restricts the international responsibility for global inequalities in health to a humanitarian assistance. We propose an alternative view, arguing that expanding the scope of international cooperation by promoting shared health and economic value at a global level will create new opportunities for innovative, effective and affordable interventions worldwide. It will also promote neglected diseases as a global research priority. We build our argument on a proposal to replace the patenting system that currently regulates pharmaceutical research with a global fund to reward this research based on actual decreases in morbidity and mortality at a global level. We argue that this approach is beneficent because it will decrease global health inequalities and promote social justice worldwide.	[Gericke, C.

J	Chollett, DL				Chollett, Donna L.			From Sugar to Blackberries Restructuring Agro-export Production in Michoacan, Mexico	LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						Mexico; Globalization; Transnational agribusiness; Agro-chemicals; Campesinos		In recent years, economic crisis in the sugar industry and the closure of an important sugar mill in Michoacan, Mexico, have fostered the entry of transnational agribusinesses that contract with local growers for blackberry production. Land concentration is under way as wealthy growers rent ejido (agrarian-reform) land to grow berries and small-scale growers shift to less capitalized berry production or migrate out of the region. An analysis of the impact of this transition, part of the globalization of the agro-food system, on campesinos, workers, and their communities reveals that a general improvement in the economy has been accompanied by increased inequality, concentration of land ownership, and out-migration, a division of labor by gender that is detrimental to women, and damage to human health and the environment due to increased use of pesticides.

The link between depressed livelihoods and unsustainable use of land and natural resources can be seen in Kenyan rangelands. Here, the local community is dependent on land and its resources for livelihoods, but the demand and competition is increasing, endangering both the resources they depend on and threatening environmental health. Amboseli is an Arid and Semi-Arid Land (ASAL) area that experiences ecological constraints, resource limitations, and low economic investment. Local communities in such landscapes are resource-dependent for their daily livelihoods, and have few socio-economic opportunities. Pastoralism, which is the main source of their wealth, continues to decline and exploitation by a few local elites and poor local leadership further depresses livelihoods. Other challenges to these poor rural landscapes are increasing human population which increases demands on natural resources and environment; persistent hunger; low universal primary education; poor gender equality and empowerment of women; environmental degradation; and lack of local and global partnership for development. This paper focuses on the two Millennium Development Goals mentioned above. Linkages, challenges and opportunities in enhancing rural livelihoods while promoting environmental sustainability in rural landscapes of the Amboseli Rural Landscape are discussed.

We sought to determine the influence of neighborhood income on homicides among children living in urban Canada. METHODS. Homicides among children <15 years of age living in any of Canada's census metropolitan areas in 1996, 1997, or 1998 were identified on the basis of vital statistics death registration data, by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Deaths were assigned to census tracts through postal codes, and the tracts were then assigned to neighborhood income quintiles on the basis of the proportions of the population below the Statistics Canada low-income cutoff values. Census population counts and intercensal population interpolations were used to estimate person-years at risk for rate calculations. Interquintile rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Poisson regression was used to model the effects of neighborhood income quintiles on homicide rates, after adjustment for age. RESULTS. During the 3-year study period, there were 87 homicides among children <15 years of age in Canada's census metropolitan areas (0.82 cases per 100 000; not statistically different according to gender). The age-adjusted relative risks for the lowest versus highest neighborhood income quintiles were 2.95 for all children <15 years of age and 3.39 for children <5 years of age. CONCLUSION. Effective child homicide-prevention strategies should be focused on children <5 years of age living in low-income areas.

Substance use and objective and subjective indicators of social class were assessed in house-to-house surveys conducted with 7614 Mexican adolescents in 2004. The sample was designed to be representative of the poorest urban communities in seven Mexican states. The prevalence of current smoking was 16.8%, alcohol consumption was 30.2%, and drug use was 4.6%. Multiple logistic regressions are used to estimate the associations of objective indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) and subjective social status (SSS)-at both community and societal levels-and smoking, alcohol and drug use. Adolescents who perceived themselves as higher in social status in reference to their local community reported more smoking and drinking. Our findings were similar when we used objective measures of SES, such as maternal education and total monthly household expenditures per person. In contrast, adolescents who perceived that they had high social standing in reference to Mexican society as a whole were less likely to report being current smokers and drinkers. We found no significant association between social status and drug use. Research into how adolescents perceive themselves in reference to their peer communities may help strengthen programs and policies aimed at promoting health in vulnerable adolescent populations.

It is argued that the post-1970s dynamic between class and state which underpins this decision-making has been largely ignored by medical sociology in favour of repeated studies of the poor and powerless. Two case studies concerning (1) the pensions crisis, and (2) the global financial crisis, and their ramifications for health inequalities, are considered in some detail. A case is made that medical sociology neglects its critical and public obligations at its own peril.

Despite high mortality rates, high prevalence of various cardiovascular risk factors and well organized public health network, comprehensive system for cardiovascular disease monitoring and interventions does not exist. In this study we analyzed legislation framework and responsibilities of stakeholders relevant for cardiovascular disease surveillance and prevention. According to the international experiences we analyzed characteristics of cardiovascular disease prevention in Croatia and causes of the problems appeared in the preventive programs in Croatia. Analysis showed that primary problem is not inefficiency, but the existence of barriers in preventive activities definition, responsibilities distribution and task implementation. Main cause for such situation is incompatibility of the existing practices in clinical medicine and public health with recommendations from other countries. For the successful prevention of cardiovascular disease in Croatia at least three changes need to be made - define new terms and contents of prevention, define new responsibilities distribution and provide equity in health as basic criterion for successful preventive programs.

To that end, we use Theil's second measure of inequality for decomposing cross-country disparities in per capita health-care expenditure into the contributions of various factors: health-care expenditure expressed as a share of GDP, labour productivity, employment rate, activity rate and the ratio of working-age population to total population. Our results show that cross-country differences in the share of GDP devoted to health-care expenditure and labour productivity are the main determinants of the level of dispersion in per capita health-care expenditure. On the contrary, existing disparities in the remaining explanatory factors considered play a less relevant role in this context. In any event, the analysis performed reveals that the overall inequality in per capita health-care expenditure decreased throughout the Study period. This was due to the process of international convergence observed in most of the factors used to break down the level of per capita health-care expenditure. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Framework for assessing governance of the health system in developing countries: Gateway to good governance	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Governance; Health system; Assessment framework	FUTURE; POLICY	Governance is thought to be a key determinant of economic growth, social advancement and overall development, as well as for the attainment of the MDGs in low- and middle-income countries. Governance of the health system is the least well-understood aspect of health systems. A framework for assessing health system governance (HSG) at national and sub-national levels is presented, which has been applied in countries of the Eastern Mediterranean. In developing the HSG framework key issues considered included the role of the state vs. the market: role of the ministries of health vs. other state ministries; role of actors in governance; static vs. dynamic health systems; and health reform vs. human rights-based approach to health. Four existing frameworks were considered: World Health Organization's (WHO) domains of stewardship: Pan American Health Organization's (PAHO) essential public health functions: World Bank's six basic aspects of governance; and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) principles of good governance. The proposed HSG assessment framework includes the following 10 principles-strategic vision, participation and consensus orientation, rule of law, transparency, responsiveness, equity and inclusiveness, effectiveness and efficiency, accountability, intelligence and information, and ethics. The framework permits 'diagnoses of the ills' in HSG at the policy and operational levels and points to interventions for its improvement. In the case of Pakistan, where the framework was applied, a positive aspect was the growing participation and consensus orientation among stakeholders, while weaknesses were identified in relation to strategic vision, accountability, transparency, effectiveness and efficiency and rule of law. In using the HSG framework it needs to be recognized that the principles are value driven and not normative and are to be seen in the social and political context: and the framework relies on a qualitative approach and does not follow a scoring or ranking system. It does not directly address aid effectiveness but provides insight on the ability to utilize external resources and has the ability to include the effect of global health governance on national HSG as the subject itself gets better crystallized. The improved performance of the ministries of health and state health departments is at the heart of this framework. The framework helps raise the level of awareness among policymakers of the importance of HSG. The road to good governance in health is long and uneven. Assessing HSG is only the first step; the challenge that remains is to carry out effective governance in vastly different institutional contexts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bonafons, C; Jehel, L; Coroller-Béquet, A				Bonafons, Claire; Jehel, Louis; Coroller-Bequet, Alain			Specificity of the links between workplace harassment and PTSD: primary results using court decisions, a pilot study in France	INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Mobbing; Bullying; Harassment; Diagnosis; PTSD		France is one of the first countries to have passed specific legislation concerning "mental harassment" (In French the term used in the legislation is "harcSlement moral" referring to harassment or bullying leading to mental or psychological distress.) in the workplace. However, the definition of mental harassment at work remains fairly vague. It is, indeed, a complex issue, since no objective and precise consensual definition has been given so far. The objective of this study is to clarify the criteria that French judges consider as characteristic of mental harassment, and to check whether the specific links between mental harassment at work and PTSD pointed to in recent international studies have been taken into account. This study proposes the main lines for debate in countries that have not yet adopted legal clauses on mental harassment at work. Our study is based on a sample of 22 people who were legally recognised as having been mentally harassed at work; this sample is taken as representative of all court decisions passed on harassment and published as such on the French Ministry of Justice website. To establish whether they were considering a case of harassment, the judges based their decisions on the nature of the accusations. In all cases (22/22), the charges brought against the defendant had to do with offences against the employee's dignity. Five cases out of 22 dealt with an offence infringing their rights, 10 cases out of 22 related to the employee's future within the company being compromised, while half of the cases (11/22) concerned a deterioration in the person's health. In more than half of the cases, the judges also looked for other factors, such as repetition and duration of the period of harassment. Whenever the judges noted a deterioration in the victim's mental health, they also referred to medical certificates reporting anxio-depressive syndromes or psychological disorders without providing further detail. No PTSD-like symptomatology was mentioned among these cases, although several studies have shown that many victims of mental harassment at work have specific symptoms of PTSD. This study is the first study to be carried out on mental harassment at work and to refer to court decisions since the law was promulgated in France (2002). It appears that, in order to be recognised as a victim of mental harassment at work, numerous proofs of harassment or bullying need to be produced. It must have been repeated and have led to consequences in several domains. Several attestations and documents are required demonstrating clearly that harassment or bullying did indeed occur. Further to this, although to date judges have not considered PTSD to be an element contributing to the presumption of harassment, connections between bullying or harassment and clinical signs of PTSD have been attested by several studies that confirm that bullied victims can suffer from PTSD-like symptoms, although they do not necessarily match the strict DSM-IV criteria (absence of A1 criterion). It would seem advisable to request psychiatric examination in cases of harassment.

A Multilevel Analysis of Individual and Community Effect on Chronic Childhood Malnutrition in Rural Nigeria	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS			English	Article							ECONOMIC-INEQUALITY; RISK-FACTORS; HOUSEHOLD; DETERMINANTS; UNDERNUTRITION; NUTRITION; MORTALITY; CHILDREN; HEALTH; MALI	Background: Protein energy malnutrition is the second most important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in Nigeria after infections. The purpose of this article was to develop and test a model of childhood malnutrition that includes individual-level characteristics along with contextual characteristics defined at the community level. Design: Multilevel logistic regression analysis. Subjects and setting: A total of 4007 children resident in 96 rural villages in Nigeria. Main outcome: Stunting: height-for-age that is less than the international reference value by 2 standard deviations (SDs). Main results: Independent of other factors, children born to underweight mothers were 1.32-times more likely to be stunted [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.32; 95 confidence interval (CI) 1.071.64]. For each additional month of breastfeeding the odds of being stunted increased by 4 (aOR 1.04; 95 CI 1.031.06). Each SD increase in the household wealth index and maternal health-seeking behaviour index decreased the odds of being stunted by 16 (aOR 0.84; 95 CI 0.760.94) and 29 (aOR 0.71; 95 CI 0.60 0.82), respectively. Conclusion: The study has provided evidence that both individual and community characteristics are important predictors of childhood malnutrition in rural Nigeria; and that scholars trying to understand variation in childhood malnutrition should pay attention to the characteristics of both children and place of residence.				uthlekan@cebglobalhealth.org	Uthman, Olalekan/N-5584-2019; Uthman, Olalekan/P-7916-2014	Uthman, Olalekan/0000-0002-8567-3081					30	31	37	0	10	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	0142-6338	1465-3664		J TROP PEDIATRICS	J.

J	Hurst, SA; Mezger, N; Mauron, A				Hurst, Samia A.; Mezger, Nathalie; Mauron, Alex			Allocating Resources in Humanitarian Medicine	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; LEGITIMACY; CONFLICT; DISASTER; JUSTICE; NEEDS; ABC	Fair resource allocation in humanitarian medicine is gaining in importance and complexity, but remains insufficiently explored. It raises specific issues regarding non-ideal fairness, global solidarity, legitimacy in non-governmental institutions and conflicts of interest. All would benefit from further exploration. We propose that some headway could be made by adapting existing frameworks of procedural fairness for use in humanitarian organizations. Despite the difficulties in applying it to humanitarian medicine, it is possible to partly adapt Daniels and Sabin's 'Accountability for reasonableness' to this context. This would require: (1) inclusion of internally explicit decisions and rationales; (2) publicity to donors, local staff, community leaders and governments, as well as frank answers to any beneficiary-or potential beneficiary-who asked for clarification of decisions and their rationale; (3) a consistent reasoning strategy to weigh conflicting views of equity in specific situations; (4) advocacy within the organization as a mechanism for revision and appeals; and (5) internal regulation according to publicly accessible mechanisms. Organizations could generate a common corpus of allocation decisions from which to draw in future similar cases. Importantly, the complexity of these challenges should encourage, rather than hinder, broader discussion on ethical aspects of resource allocation in humanitarian medicine.

A critical review of interventions to redress the inequitable distribution of healthcare professionals to rural and remote areas	RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH			English	Review						equity; health professionals; inequitable distribution; interventions; recruitment; retention; rural doctors	MEDICAL-EDUCATION; MIDLEVEL WORKERS; LOAN REPAYMENT; RETENTION; PHYSICIANS; RECRUITMENT; SCHOLARSHIP; PROGRAMS; OUTCOMES; DOCTORS	Introduction: The shortage of healthcare professionals in rural communities is a global problem that poses a serious challenge to equitable healthcare delivery. Both developed and developing countries report geographically skewed distributions of healthcare professionals, favouring urban and wealthy areas, despite the fact that people in rural communities experience more health related problems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the most important studies addressing the recruitment and retention of doctors to rural and remote areas. Methods: A comprehensive search of the English literature was conducted using the National Library of Medicine's (PubMed) database and the keywords '(rural OR remote) AND (recruitment OR retention)' on 3 July 2008. In total, 1261 references were identified and screened; all primary studies that reported the outcome of an actual intervention and all relevant review articles were selected. Due to the paucity of prospective primary intervention studies, retrospective observational studies and questionnaire-driven surveys were included as well. The search was extended by scrutinizing the references of selected articles to identify additional studies that may have been missed. In total, 110 articles were included. Results: In order to provide a comprehensive overview in a clear and user-friendly fashion, the available evidence was classified into five intervention categories: Selection, Education, Coercion, Incentives and Support - and the strength of the available evidence was rated as convincing, strong, moderate, weak or absent. The main definitions used to define 'rural and/or remote' in the articles reviewed are summarized, before the evidence in support of each of the five intervention categories is reflected in detail. Conclusion: We argue for the formulation of universal definitions to assist study comparison and future collaborative research. Although coercive strategies address short-term recruitment needs, little evidence supports their long-term positive impact. Current evidence only supports the implementation of well-defined selection and education policies, although incentive and support schemes may have value. There remains an urgent need to evaluate the impact of untested interventions in a scientifically rigorous fashion in order to identify winning strategies for guiding future practice and policy.

Writing social determinants into and out of cancer control: An assessment of policy practice	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Social determinants of health; Cancer policy; Equity; Health policy		A large literature concurs that social determinants of health (SDH) are demonstrable, important, and insufficiently attended to in policy and practice. A resulting priority for research should be to determine how the social determinants of health can best be addressed. In this paper we support the more effective transfer of social determinants research into policy by: (1) describing a qualitative analysis of thirty-two cancer control policy documents from six English-speaking OECD countries and two transnational organizations, demonstrating great variability in the treatment of social determinants in these policies; (2) critiquing these various policy practices in relation to their likely impact on social determinants of health; and (3) advancing a too[ that policy writers can use to assess the way in which social determinants of health have been addressed in their work. In the sample of policy documents, the distinction between structural and intermediate determinants, population-based and targeted interventions, and their respective relationships to equity were not always clear. The authors identified four approaches to social determinants (acknowledging SDH, auditing SDH, stating aims regarding SDH and setting out actions on SDH), and five ways of writing about the relationship between social determinants and cancer risk. These five discourses implied, respectively: that group membership was intrinsically risky; that not enough was known about SDH: that risk arose from choices made by individuals; that groups were constrained by circumstance; or that structural change was necessary. Socio-cultural factors were generally presented negatively, though New Zealand policies modeled a possible alternative. Based on their empirical work, the authors propose a matrix and a set of questions to guide the development and assessment of health policy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Castañeda, H				Castaneda, Heide			Illegality as risk factor: A survey of unauthorized migrant patients in a Berlin clinic	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Germany; Unauthorized migrants; Undocumented migrants; Illegal migrants; Illegality; Health inequalities; Access to care	HEALTH-CARE; IMMIGRANTS	Unauthorized migrants face health disadvantages in many receiving nations. However, few studies have explored precisely how the condition of "illegality" influences illness experiences, medical treatment, and convalescence. This article presents a case study from Germany (2004-2006 and 2008), where unauthorized migrants face limited access to health care and the threat of deportation results in avoidance of services and treatment delays. This is confounded by unique laws which essentially criminalize health care workers for aiding migrants. This article provides a snapshot of 183 patients who attended a Berlin clinic that functions as the single largest source of medical assistance for unauthorized persons in Germany. The demographic information sketches a picture of labor migrants with a mean age of approximately 29 years. More women than men presented at this clinic, a result of its ability to successfully arrange prenatal care and delivery as well as a reflection of local labor markets. The diversity of countries of origin (n = 55) is surprising, underscoring the utility of using illegal status as a unifying variable to highlight migrants' shared position in the global economy and the resulting barriers to basic medical services. Patients presented with a range of illnesses typical for their age group. However, the effects of illegal status resulted in four areas of disparities: 1) limits to the overall quality and quantity of care for mothers and infants: 2) delayed presentation and difficulties accessing a regular supply of medication for patients with chronic illnesses; 3) difficulties in accessing immediate medical attention for unpredictable injuries and other acute health concerns;, and 4) a lack of mental health care options for generalized stress and anxiety affecting health. In Germany, an incoherent policy environment contributes to inadequate services and treatment delays. Solutions must address these legal ambiguities, which represent a primary barrier to equity in a nation with otherwise universal health coverage. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study we examine whether, Best Start, an Australian area-based initiative to improve child health was effective in improving access to Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services. Methods: The study compares access to information, parental confidence and annual 3.5 year Ages and Stages visiting rates before (2001/02) and after (2004/05) the introduction of Best Start. Access to information and parental confidence were measured in surveys of parents with 3 year old children. There were 1666 surveys in the first wave and 1838 surveys in the second wave. The analysis of visiting rates for the 3.5 year Ages and Stages visit included all eligible Victorian children. Best Start sites included 1,739 eligible children in 2001/02 and 1437 eligible children in 2004/05. The comparable figures in the rest of the state were and 45, 497 and 45, 953 respectively. Results: There was a significant increase in attendance at the 3.5 year Ages and Stages visit in 2004/05 compared to 2001/02 in all areas. However the increase in attendance was significantly greater at Best Start sites than the rest of the state. Access to information and parental confidence improved over the course of the intervention in Best Start sites with MCH projects compared to other Best Start sites. Conclusion: These results suggest that community-based initiatives in disadvantaged areas may improve parents' access to child health information, improve their confidence and increase MCH service use. These outcomes suggest such programmes could potentially contribute to strategies to reduce child health inequalities.

Association between forgone care and household income among the elderly in five Western European countries - analyses based on survey data from the SHARE-study	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; ADOLESCENTS; LAW; SERVICES; QUALITY; FINANCE; EQUITY	Background: Studies on the association between access to health care and household income have rarely included an assessment of 'forgone care', but this indicator could add to our understanding of the inverse care law. We hypothesize that reporting forgone care is more prevalent in low income groups. Methods: The study is based on the 'Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)', focusing on the non-institutionalized population aged 50 years or older. Data are included from France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Sweden. The dependent variable is assessed by the following question: During the last twelve months, did you forgo any types of care because of the costs you would have to pay, or because this care was not available or not easily accessible? The main independent variable is household income, adjusted for household size and split into quintiles, calculating the quintile limits for each country separately. Information on age, sex, self assessed health and chronic disease is included as well. Logistic regression models were used for the multivariate analyses. Results: The overall level of forgone care differs considerably between the five countries (e. g. about 10 percent in Greece and 6 percent in Sweden). Low income groups report forgone care more often than high income groups. This association can also be found in analyses restricted to the subsample of persons with chronic disease. Associations between forgone care and income are particularly strong in Germany and Greece. Taking the example of Germany, forgone care in the lowest income quintile is 1.98 times (95% CI: 1.08-3.63) as high as in the highest income quintile. Conclusion: Forgone care should be reduced even if it is not justified by an 'objective' need for health care, as it could be an independent stressor in its own right, and as patient satisfaction is a strong predictor of compliance. These efforts should focus on population groups with particularly high prevalence of forgone care, for example on patients with poor self assessed health, on women, and on low income groups. The inter-country differences point to the need to specify different policy recommendations for different countries.

Physicians today must understand the global burden and epidemiology of diseases, the disparities and inequities in global health systems, and the importance of cross-cultural sensitivity. To meet these needs, resident physicians across all specialties have expressed growing interest in global health training and international clinical rotations. More residents are acquiring international experience, despite inadequate guidance and support from most accreditation organizations and residency programs. Surveys of global health training, including international clinical rotations, highlight the benefits of global health training as well as the need for a more coordinated approach. In particular, international rotations broaden a resident's medical knowledge, reinforce physical examination skills, and encourage practicing medicine among underserved and multicultural populations. As residents recognize these personal and professional benefits, a strong majority of them seek to gain international clinical experience. In conclusion, with feasible and appropriate administrative steps, all residents can receive global health training and be afforded the accreditation and programmatic support to participate in safe international rotations. The next steps should address accreditation for international rotations and allowance for training away from continuity clinics by residency accreditation bodies, and stipend and travel support for six or more weeks of call-free elective time from residency programs.

J	Gelli, A; Al-Shaiba, N; Espejo, F				Gelli, Aulo; Al-Shaiba, Najeeb; Espejo, Francisco			The costs and cost-efficiency of providing food through schools in areas of high food insecurity	FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN			English	Article						Costs; evaluation; food aid; school feeding		Background. The provision of food in and through schools has been used to support the education, health, and nutrition Of school-aged children. The monitoring Of financial inputs into school health and nutrition programs is critical for a number of reasons, including accountability, transparency, and equity. Furthermore, there is a gap in the evidence on the costs, cost-efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of providing food through schools, particularly in areas of high food insecurity. Objective. To estimate the programmatic costs and cost-efficiency associated with providing food through schools in food-insecure, developing-country contexts, by analyzing global project data from the World Food Programme (WFP). Methods. Project data, including expenditures and number of schoolchildren covered, were collected through project reports and validated through WFP Country Office records. Yearly project costs per schoolchild were standardized over a set number of feeding days and the amount of energy provided by the average ration. Output metrics, such as tonnage, calories, and micronutrient content, were used to assess the cost-efficiency of the different delivery mechanisms. Results. The average yearly expenditure per child, standardized over a 200-day on-site feeding period and an average ration, excluding school-level costs, was US$21.59. The costs varied substantially according to choice of food modality, with fortified biscuits providing the least costly option of about US$11 per year and take-home rations providing the most expensive option at approximately US$52 per year. Comparisons across the different food modalities suggested that fortified biscuits provide the most cost-efficient option in terms of micronutrient delivery (particularly vitamin A and iodine), whereas on-site meals appear to be more efficient in terms of calories delivered. Transportation and logistics costs were the main drivers for the high costs. Conclusions. The choice of program objectives will to a large degree dictate the food modality (biscuits, cooked meals, or take-home rations) and associated implementation costs. Fortified biscuits can provide substantial nutritional inputs at a fraction of the cost of school meals, making them an appealing option for service delivery in food-insecure contexts. Both costs and effects should be considered carefully when designing the appropriate school-based intervention. The costs estimates in this analysis do not include all school-level costs and are therefore lower-bound estimates of full implementation costs.

J	Jones, GA; Chant, S				Jones, Gareth A.; Chant, Sylvia			Globalising initiatives for gender equality and poverty reduction: Exploring 'failure' with reference to education and work among urban youth in The Gambia and Ghana	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Youth; Gender and development; Education; Employment; MDGs; Urban	CHILD LABOR	This paper focuses on what observers have perceived to be a failure of development leading to a 'crisis of youth' as increasing numbers of young people find it more difficult to gain education, access to health, a job and meet standard of living aspirations. For some, a possible escape is offered by migration to Europe, the United States or Australia, often illegally. For those remaining behind, however, international development agencies offer a 'globalisarion Of Solutions' to employment, gender inequality and poverty through the millennium development goals and the programmes to attain them. In this paper we do not take the failures of development at face value but look at local contexts to present a more complex picture of the relation between education. work and social life. Based on fieldwork conducted in urban areas of The Gambia and Ghana, we argue that rather than education as a catch-all solution we need to give more attention to the costs incurred by and for Young people in pursuing education and training. to the operation of and actual opportunities in tabour markets, and to patterns of gender socialisation which give women limited scope to exercise agency. This paper explores key gender dimensions of work and education among low-income urban youth noting that despite on-going efforts to increase Young women's enrolment in schools and access to employment, gender inequalities have been far from eradicated. Our field interviews reveal how social expectations that women should perform the bulk of reproductive tabour in their youth as well as in adulthood and constraints placed on young women's personal freedom in respect of their social relationships reduce time dedicated to education and establish fewer contacts relevant to securing paid employment. The result is for men to end Lip with more educational qualifications, more skills, and higher-paying jobs, even if unemployment among young people in general remains a major problem.

This paper employs regression-based generalizations of the difference-in-differences method on panel data from 28 countries for the period 1990-2004.

JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						social protection; cash transfers; South Africa; costs of illness; impoverishment	HEALTH-SERVICES; CASH TRANSFERS; POVERTY; CARE; EQUITY	Illness is a major risk to people's livelihoods in resource-poor settings, particularly where there are rising levels of chronic illness. Measures that improve access to treatment are increasingly seen as a vital form of social protection for vulnerable households, and central to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. International attention is also focussed on cash transfers as a strand of social protection, and on the potential complementarities between free health care and cash transfers in assisting Vulnerable people to cope with illness-related shocks. South Africa provides an interesting setting to examine how households are accessing social protection measures because the government has removed some user fees, implemented hospital-level exemptions and extended cash transfers including the non-contributory pension and child Support grant. This paper presents findings from household research in rural South Africa. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to assess the links between illness-related costs and impoverishment over time, the protection effects of free health services, cash transfers and social networks, and the factors influencing access to these three forms of social protection. Different degrees of success in drawing on these resources affected capacity to cope with illnesses and made a considerable difference to whether households sustained their livelihoods, struggled or declined. Cash transfers combined well with free health care to build resilience among some households. However, households without access to at least two strands of the social protection net were impoverished by the direct and indirect costs of long-term illnesses. The implications for policies on improving the uptake and coverage of social protection measures are discussed. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Verma, G				Verma, G.			Analysis of the mass media coverage of the Gates Foundation Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							NEGLECTED DISEASES	The Grand Challenges were launched in 2003 by the Gates Foundation and other collaborators to address the health needs of developing countries. This paper outlines the current problem with health research and development in the context of inequality as conveyed by the 90/10 divide. The paper then looks at the focus and nature of press reporting of global health issues by analysing how press articles have portrayed the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative. Analysis of the mass media illustrates that the focus of reporting on the Grand Challenges tends to be on utilitarian themes, leaving issues related to justice and equity comparatively under-reported.

Growth performance has been disappointing during most of the past 25 years, although there are today some encouraging new trends. Income distribution that was quite equal in 1985 has seen some deterioration since 1990. Agriculture has been one of the failures, and the question is raised whether current reforms are sufficient to redress this situation. The success stories of the revolution are education, health, and international solidarity.

Design: Cross-sectional data on hospital infections were collected between March and June 2004. These data were linked with ward-level responses to a personnel survey collected during the same time period. Setting: Medical records of patients in 60 non-psychiatric bed wards in 6 Finnish hospitals. Participants: One thousand ninety-two patients and 1159 staff survey responses. Measurements: Prevalence surveillance was performed by 4 infection control nurses, using standard criteria. Data on several potential risk factors for infection were collected: sex, age, patient type (surgical vs. other), hospital type (university vs. regional hospital), unit type, number of patients in the ward, exposure to invasive devices, International Classification of Diseases version 10 diagnosis, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and use of corticosteroids. Staff working conditions were measured by survey scales. Results: Ninety-nine cases (9.1%) of hospital-associated infection were found. Multilevel logistic regression analyses, adjusted for hospital factors and patient-related risk factors, showed that long work hours among staff were associated with increased risk of infection [odds ratio (OR) 2.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-7.04]. Other staff-related correlates of infection were high work stress, as indicated by high imbalance between efforts and rewards (OR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.38-4.42). low trust between work unit members (OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.27-4.43), injustice in the distribution of work (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.04-3.16), and poor collaboration between ward supervisors (OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.384.38). Conclusions: Long work hours, high work stress, and poor collaboration among the ward staff are associated with hospital-associated infection among patients.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN WOMEN'S SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE	NIGERIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Review						ethical issues; women's sexual and reproductive health care; medical practitioners		Background: The concept of reproductive health, which adopts a holistic approach to the management of reproductive disorders, was developed in 1994 at the International Conference on Population and Development. This together with the adoption of a right-based approach to the relationship between reproductive health and population and development and the emergence of the concept of sexual and reproductive right marked a turning point in contemporary global health care initiative. Sexual and reproductive healthcare raises, ethical questions that fall within the purview of bio-ethics. Objective: To review ethical issues related to women's sexual and reproductive healthcare. Methodology: A critical review of available literature on the subject matter was conducted. Findings: Four key principles form the basis of Bioethical analysis - respect for person, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice, applicable at four different levels microethical, macroethical, mesoethical, and megaethical levels each of which can be employed in the ethical analysis of sexual and reproductive health care. Medical practitioners caring for women, for the fact that they work in areas of a woman's body that are of particular psychosocial sensitivity, are expected to adhere to strict ethical principles in their practice. The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) in collaboration with the Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SOGON) has developed a human right based code of ethics related to sexual and reproductive health care to guide medical practitioners caring for women in their daily practice. Conclusion: An understanding and proper application of the ethical principles is expected to enable these medical practitioners to actualize the ultimate and desired goal of uplifting the sexual and reproductive healthcare and right of women.

J	Barnett, R; Pearce, J; Moon, G				Barnett, Ross; Pearce, Jamie; Moon, Graham			Community inequality and smoking cessation in New Zealand, 1981-2006	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						New Zealand; Maori; Health inequalities; Smoking cessation; Ethnic inequality; Socio-economic status (SES); Communities	INCOME INEQUALITY; NEIGHBORHOOD ENVIRONMENT; RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; POPULATION HEALTH; SOCIAL-INEQUALITY; TOBACCO CONTROL; AREA; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATIONS	The overall prevalence of smoking in New Zealand reduced from 32% in 1981 to 23.5% in 2006 but rates of smoking cessation have not been consistent among all social, demographic and ethnic groups. The period 1981-2006 also saw macroeconomic changes in New Zealand that resulted in profound increases in social and economic inequalities. Within this socio-political context we address two questions. First, has there been a social polarisation in smoking prevalence and cessation in New Zealand between 1981 and 2006? Second, to what extent can ethnic variation in rates of quitting be explained by community inequality, independently of socio-economic status? We find that smoking behaviour in New Zealand has become socially and ethnically more polarised over the past two decades, with greater levels of smoking cessation among higher socio-economic groups, and among New Zealanders of European origin. Variations in quit rates between Maori and European New Zealanders cannot be fully accounted for by ethnic differences in socio-economic status. Community inequality exerted a significant influence on Maori (but not European) smoking quit rates. The association with community inequality was particularly profound among women, and for particular age groups living in urban areas. These findings extend the international evidence for a relationship between social inequality and health, and in particular smoking behaviour. The research also confirms the importance of considering the role of contextual factors when attempting to elucidate the mechanisms linking socio-economic factors to health outcomes. Our findings emphasise that, if future smoking cessation strategies are to be successful, attention has to shift from policies that focus solely on engineering individual behavioural change, to an inclusion of the role of environmental stressors such as community inequality.

J	Hanley, GE; Morgan, S				Hanley, Gillian E.; Morgan, Steve			Chronic catastrophes: Exploring the concentration and sustained nature of ambulatory prescription drug expenditures in the population of British Columbia, Canada	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						High-cost pharmaceutical use; Pharmaceutical policy; Canada; British Columbia; Prescription drugs; Cost inequalities	MEDICAL-CARE PLAN; HEALTH-CARE; INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; PHYSICIANS; UTILIZERS; SERVICES; FINANCE; EQUITY	Previous research has shown that a small proportion of the population accounts for a substantial proportion of spending on physician and hospital services. Much less is known about the high-cost users of ambulatory prescription medicines. We investigate the concentration and sustained nature of ambulatory prescription drug expenditures among residents of British Columbia, Canada in 2001 and 2004. Linking person-specific administrative data from several sources, we examine the demographics, socio-economic status, and health status of high-cost ambulatory pharmaceutical users and the extent that high-cost pharmaceutical use was sustained, at the individual level, from 2001 to 2004. The top 5% of users were responsible for 48% of ambulatory prescription expenditures in the province. A significant burden of morbidity, as well as sustained high expenditures, characterized these users. They were older, more likely to be female, more likely to be of low income, and more likely to be hospitalized and die within the year of study than other pharmaceutical users and non-users. Our results suggest that careful consideration should be given to the long-term financial burdens and access barriers created by pharmaceutical insurance policies that rely heavily on private payments by individuals. Our focus is on costs associated with ambulatory prescription drug use, however, had we included information on the cost of prescription drugs used in hospitals, we would likely have detected an even stronger relationship between high-cost pharmaceutical use and poor health status.

A syndemic approach to prevention, meanwhile, focuses on connections among health-related problems, considers those connections when developing health policies, and aligns with forces for social change. in this short report, we expand the syndemic concept to acknowledge the extent to which animal health connects with human health and, with reference to existing publications. we demonstrate the pertinence of this expanded definition for a syndemic approach to prevention. Our demonstration assumes practical importance in relation to the concept of 'one health', which many prominent veterinary and human health scientists have recently endorsed as a sound basis for redressing human diseases, animal diseases, and environmental degradation worldwide. While social scientists have mostly ignored animal health, few 'one health' proponents have emphasized social conditions or involved social scientists. By explicitly accommodating animal-human connections in our expanded conceptualization of a syndemic, we hope to help create a space in which human health, veterinary, and social scientists may learn from one another, collaborate in research, and cooperate to clear the way for innovations in prevention.

I contended that experimental biologists, who might have reduced agency because of their professional workload or lack of individual resources, can still unite into collective forces with other scientists as well as human rights organizations, medical doctors, and political and civic leaders to foster progressive change in our world. In this article, I present some recent findings from research on three emerging viruses-HIV, dengue, and rotavirus-to explore the factors that lead to the geographical expansion of these viruses and the increase in frequency of the infectious diseases they cause. I show how these viruses are generating problems for geopolitical stability, human rights, and equity health care for developing nations that are already experiencing a growing poverty crisis. I suggest some avenues of future research for the scientific community for the movement toward resolution of these problems and indicate where the science-religion field can be of additional aid.

Here, we outline a conceptual framework of links between trade liberalisation and health outcomes, and review existing evidence for these by focusing on four key factors: income, inequality economic insecurity, and unhealthy diets. Even though trade liberalisation seems to have positive effects on economic growth, it is not sufficient to boost growth. in several countries, trade reforms have not translated into enhanced economic expansion because complementary policies are needed. Trade liberalisation and openness are associated with greater wage inequality and raised economic insecurity. Trade liberalisation has facilitated availability of highly processed, calorie-rich, nutrient-poor food in developing countries, but further research is needed to better understand the effects of trade on unhealthy diets. Policyrnakers and health professionals need to be aware that the global economy affects the health of populations and understand how risks associated with trade liberalisation can be mitigated.

Methods It took place in France from 1999 to 2003. The sample consisted of about 36,000 people aged 18 years and older. Data were collected face-to-face using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results Anxiety disorders were most common (17% in men and 26% in women), while prevalence estimates for mood disorders were 10% in men and 14% in women. Prevalence of troubles were consistently higher among those in the lowest occupational categories. Among those reporting mental disorders, about 50% said that their work was affected. The repercussions on job varied by occupational category and differently for men and women. Conclusion This study shows the social and occupational inequalities in the prevalence of mental disorders and their important work consequences in the French working population. Am. J. Ind.

GLOBALIZATION, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH	BIOETHICS			English	Article						globalization; social determinants; health; human rights		Globalization, a process characterized by the growing interdependence of the world's people, impacts health systems and the social determinants of health in ways that are detrimental to health equity. In a world in which there are few countervailing normative and policy approaches to the dominant neoliberal regime underpinning globalization, the human rights paradigm constitutes a widely shared foundation for challenging globalization's effects. The substantive rights enumerated in human rights instruments include the right to the highest attainable level of physical and mental health and others that are relevant to the determinants of health. The rights stipulated in these documents impose extensive legal obligations on states that have ratified these documents and confer health entitlements on their residents. Human rights norms have also inspired civil society efforts to improve access to essential medicines and medical services, particularly for HIV/AIDS. Nevertheless, many factors reduce the potential counterweight human rights might exert, including and specifically the nature of the human rights approach, weak political commitments to promoting and protecting health rights on the part of some states and their lack of institutional and economic resources to do so. Global economic markets and the relative power of global economic institutions are also shrinking national policy space. This article reviews the potential contributions and limitations of human rights to achieving greater equity in shaping the social determinants of health.

J	Fox, AM; Meier, BM				Fox, Ashley M.; Meier, Benjamin Mason			HEALTH AS FREEDOM: ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF GLOBAL HEALTH INEQUITIES THROUGH THE HUMAN RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT	BIOETHICS			English	Article						human rights; right to development; social determinants of health; right to health; neoliberal development policy; globalization		In spite of vast global improvements in living standards, health, and well-being, the persistence of absolute poverty and its attendant maladies remains an unsettling fact of life for billions around the world and constitutes the primary cause for the failure of developing states to improve the health of their peoples. While economic development in developing countries is necessary to provide for underlying determinants of health - most prominently, poverty reduction and the building of comprehensive primary health systems - inequalities in power within the international economic order and the spread of neoliberal development policy limit the ability of developing states to develop economically and realize public goods for health. With neoliberal development policies impacting entire societies, the collective right to development, as compared with an individual rights-based approach to development, offers a framework by which to restructure this system to realize social determinants of health. The right to development, working through a vector of rights, can address social determinants of health, obligating states and the international community to support public health systems while reducing inequities in health through poverty-reducing economic growth. At an international level, where the ability of states to develop economically and to realize public goods through public health systems is constrained by international financial institutions, the implementation of the right to development enables a restructuring of international institutions and foreign-aid programs, allowing states to enter development debates with a right to cooperation from other states, not simply a cry for charity.

Systematic analysis of research underfunding in maternal and perinatal health	BJOG-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY			English	Review						Disease burden; maternal-fetal medicine; obstetrics; R&D funding; research grants	ACADEMIC MEDICINE	Little published evidence supports the widely held contention that research in pregnancy is underfunded compared with other disease areas. To assess absolute and relative government and charitable funding for maternal and perinatal research in the UK and internationally. Major research funding bodies and alliances were identified from an Internet search and discussions with opinion leaders/senior investigators. Websites and annual reports were reviewed for details of strategy, research spend, grants awarded, and allocation to maternal and/or perinatal disease using generic and disease-specific search terms. Within the imprecision in the data sets, <= 1% of health research spend in the UK was on maternal/perinatal health. Other countries fared better with 1-4% investment, although nonexclusive categorisation may render this an overestimate. In low-resource settings, government funders focused on infectious disease but not maternal and perinatal health despite high relative disease burden, while global philanthropy concentrated on service provision rather than research. Although research expenditure has been deemed as appropriate for 'reproductive health' disease burden in the UK, there are no data on the equity of maternal/perinatal research spend against disease burden, which globally may justify a manyfold increase. This systematic review of research expenditure and priorities from national and international funding bodies suggests relative underinvestment in maternal/perinatal health. Contributing factors include the low political priority given to women's health, the challenging nature of clinical research in pregnancy, and research capacity dearth as a consequence of chronic underinvestment.

Methods Literature overview. Results In economically developed countries, official healthy eating advice is to eat more fish, particularly that rich in omega-3 oils. In many less economically developed countries, fish is a key human health asset, contributing >20% of animal protein intake for 2.6 billion people. Marine ecologists predict on current trends that fish stocks are set to collapse in 40 years, and propose increased restrictions on fishing, including no-take zones, in order to restore marine ecosystem health. Production of fishmeal for aquaculture and other non-food uses (22 MT in 2003) appears to be unsustainable. Differences in fish consumption probably contribute to within-country and international health inequalities. Such inequalities are likely to increase if fish stocks continue to decline, while increasing demand for fish will accelerate declines in fish stocks and the health of marine ecosystems. Conclusions Urgent national and international action is necessary to address the tensions arising from increasing human demand for fish and seafood, and rapidly declining marine ecosystem health.

Participants were interviewed at intake and followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months using the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Tool and the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) instruments. Results showed long-term improvement in substance use and related problems, decreased criminal justice involvement, and improved mental health and social functioning, while showing positive trends in education and employment. However, unexpected findings were revealed in family functioning. Although promising, further research is needed to substantiate the program's effectiveness and possibility of being considered an "evidence-based program."

Review of salient literature, clinical and personal experiences, conference presentations and discussions, and post-conference comments from outside experts. PROs (information from patients about a health condition and its management) have been assessed through self-reports for at least four decades. Traditional applications are in clinical and health services research. Uses in clinical practice, although increasing, are less common and more challenging. PROs can enhance the understanding of patients' experiences and responses to therapy and inform clinical practice. We pose and discuss four main questions: (1) Will clinicians accept PRO measures? (2) Will clinicians use PRO measures? (3) Will measuring PROs actually improve those outcomes? (4) Will PROs be perceived as having other, less salutary purposes? A patient-centered perspective on PRO measurement presents issues about the extent to which PROs can accurately capture patient experiences and assess psychosocial and environmental factors that influence communication with clinicians and eventual outcomes. We end with comments about the intersection of PROs and bioethics, noting contributions that PROs may make to beneficence, patient autonomy, and distributive justice.

Several epidemiological studies have described the pregnancy outcome of immigrant women in European receiving countries, with conflicting results. The present systematic review makes a quantitative synthesis of available evidence on the association between pregnancy outcomes and integration policies. We reviewed all epidemiological studies comparing the pregnancy outcome of native versus immigrant women in European countries from 1966 to 2004 and retained 65 for analysis, from 12 host countries. Overall, as compared to native women, immigrant women showed a clear disadvantage for all the outcomes considered: 43% higher risk of low birth weight, 24% of pre-term delivery, 50% of perinatal mortality, and 61% of congenital malformations. The risks were clearly and significantly reduced in countries with a strong integration policy. This trend was maintained even after adjustment for age at delivery and parity. On the basis of an analysis of naturalisation rates, five countries in our sample could be categorised as having a strong policies promoting the integration of immigrant communities. The mechanisms through which integration policies may be protective include the increased participation of immigrant communities in the life of the receiving society, and the decreased stress and discrimination they may face. The results of this study highlight a serious problem of equity in perinatal health across European countries. Immigrant women clearly need targeted attention to improve the health of their newborn, but a deep societal change is also necessary to integrate and respect immigrant communities in receiving societies.

Public-health approaches emphasise monitoring, prevention, cost-effectiveness, and population strategies; protective approaches concentrate on the legal and professional response to cases of maltreatment. Both approaches have been associated with improvement in outcomes for children, yet maltreatment remains a major global problem. We describe how children's rights provide a different perspective on child maltreatment, and contribute to both public-health and protective responses. Children's rights as laid out in the UN convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC) provide a framework for understanding child maltreatment as part of a range of violence, harm, and exploitation of children at the individual, institutional, and societal levels. Rights of participation and provision are as important as rights of protection. The principles embodied in the UNCRC are concordant with those of medical ethics. The greatest strength of an approach based on the UNCRC is that it provides a legal instrument for implementing policy, accountability, and social justice, all of which enhance public-health responses. incorporation of the principles of the UNCRC into laws, research, public-health policy, and professional training and practice will result in further progress in the area of child maltreatment.

There is great linguistic diversity in the major cities in the UK with more than 300 languages, excluding dialects, spoken by children in London alone. However, there is dearth of data on the number of non-English speakers for planning effective interpreting services. The aim was to estimate the number of people requiring language support amongst the minority ethnic communities in England. Methods: Secondary analysis of national representative sample of subjects recruited to the Health Surveys for England 1999 and 2004. Results: 298,432 individuals from the four main minority ethnic communities (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Chinese) who may be unable to communicate effectively with a health professional. This represents 2,520,885 general practice consultations per year where interpreting services might be required. Conclusion: Effective interpreting services are required to improve access and health outcomes of non-English speakers and thereby facilitate a reduction in health inequalities.

The obligations on government that flow from health equity as a human right are then examined. These include the obligation to act in pursuit of health equity as a policy objective, and the obligation to enact measures to ensure health equity as a policy outcome. These obligations are considered in relation to a promising remedial measure for social disparities in cervical cancer: HPV vaccines.

Start-up funding sources and biotechnology firm growth	APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS			English	Article								Biotechnology is one of the world's fastest growing industries, expanding almost four times faster than the G-7 average for all sectors with global demand of US$50 billion in 2005. Biotechnology offers significant economic benefits, particularly in exports and job creation, as well as important health, safety and environmental benefits. Although it has the potential to be an important engine of economic development in the twenty-first century, its research-intensity and the associated long lead times have intensified the equity gap faced by all rapidly growing firms. As a result, there are concerns about start-up financing on growth and performance. Our results show that angel, venture and conventional capital have contributed significantly to RD capital formation and sales growth. Conversely, the contribution of funding from government, IPO and alliance capital sources are unimportant for our sample of biotechnology firms. These are counter intuitive results for conventional capital's importance for firm growth rates. It was expected that venture capital would be most important; however, it may be that older firms with more mature products or products ready for market are chosen as bank customers. In that case, perhaps it makes sense that bank capital is correlated with higher growth rates.

ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Review						human security; CCH-FBS; FBDGs; MDGs; Asia Pacific Region; epigenetics	NUTRITION; MALARIA; IRON; SUPPLEMENTATION; ENVIRONMENT; INSECURITY; REGION; POLICY; ASIA	Health is intrinsic to human security (HumS) although it is somewhat anthropocentric and about our own psychosocial and biomedical status more than various external threats. The 1994 United Nations Development Program definition of HumS includes economic, food, environmental, personal, community and political security with freedom from fear and want. Environmental factors are critical for health security (HealS), especially with widespread socio-economic difficulty, and health systems less affordable or accessible. The nexus between nutritionally-related disorders and infectious disease is the most pervasive world health problem. Most if not all of the Millennium Development Goals are food-linked. Maternal nutrition has life-long health effects on the yet-to-be born child. The mix of essential nutrient deprivation and energy imbalance is rife across many societies. Food systems require deeper understanding and governance to overcome these food-related health risks which are matters of food security (FoodS). Nutritionally-related Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) are improving markedly in many parts of the world, along with poverty and hunger reduction and health system advances. But recent economic, energy, food, water, climate change and health crises along with conflict are limiting. It is time for international and regional understanding of how households and communities can collectively manage these threats in affordable and sustainable ways. There is untapped problem-solving capacity at the internationalisable local level if supported by combined food - health systems expertise, innovation, infrastructure and governance. Principles of equity and ethics must apply. The Food in Health Security (FIHS) roundtable aims to develop a Network to facilitate this process.

Good nutrition is central to good health. Globally, health has improved for many but not for everyone equally. That food and nutrition-related health is unequally distributed is a marker of societal failure. For some individuals, communities and even nations, it is a matter of not having enough food, of being unable to afford food and there being little nutritious food readily available. For others there is an over abundance of food but its nutritional quality is compromised, access to healthy food is poor and cost of food is high relative to other commodities. Human development and poverty reduction in the Asia Pacific region cannot be achieved without improving nutrition in an equitable way. There is no biological reason for the scale of difference in health, including diet-related health that is observed in the Asia Pacific region. That it exists is unethical and inequitable. Asymmetric economic growth, unequal improvements in daily living conditions, unequal distribution of technical developments and suppression of human rights have seen health inequities perpetuate and worsen, particularly over the last three decades. Addressing diet-related health inequities requires attention to the underlying structural drivers and inequities in conditions of daily living that disempower individuals, social groups and even nations from the pursuit of good nutrition and health. These are matters of economic and social policy at the global, regional and national level.

In addition to overuse or the illegal use of pesticide, meat leanness promoters, animal drugs and melamine in the food supply; as well as foodborne illness draws the greatest public concern due to incidents that occur every year in Taiwan. The present report demonstrates the implementation of a food safety control system in Taiwan. In order to control foodborne outbreaks effectively, the central government of the Department of Health of Taiwan launched the food safety control system which includes both the good hygienic practice (GHP) and the HACCP plan, in the last decade. From 1998 to the present, 302 food affiliations that implemented the system have been validated and accredited by a well-established audit system. The implementation of a food safety control system in compliance with international standards is of crucial importance to ensure complete safety and the high quality of foods, not only for domestic markets, but also for international trade.

Malnutrition is expected to reach an all time high. Evidences have suggested that animal based diet has put immense pressure on the already fragile food system, contributing to problems in terms of global food security, health security, and environmental sustainability. Plant based dietary approaches may therefore, target some of these problems from the roots, and may be a solution to improving ethical issues and equity in the current food system. This paper examines how meat production and consumption contributed to the current crises in the food system through the lens of ethics - the moral compass - to find directions on how the present generation should cat, and how the food system could be maintained for a better future.

The interaction between food supply and other important factors making up the system can shed light on individual and population health. A critical analysis of the health system must also include consideration of disparity in food security since it represents one of the most dramatic indicators of economic and health inequality. A large fraction of the world's population -- particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and in South East Asia -- is chronically hungry. Distributing food commodities alone does not appear to significantly reduce global food insecurity. In addition, promoting agricultural development, economic growth, and education assistance is needed in order to mitigate the underlying causes of chronic hunger, and in turn improve health and well being.

A coalition of parties in the Asia Pacific Region who work in the food and health systems met in August, 2009 in Taiwan and instigated a Food in Health Security (FIHS) Network which might join with other like-minded networks in and beyond the region. Sustainable health has many dimensions, among which food and nutrition is often neglected; there is a wide spectrum of nutritionally-related disorders. Malnutrition remains the global concern for agricultural research and development scientists and linkage with the health sector is key to progress. The disconnect between agricultural and health sectors negatively impacts consumer nutrition and health. Ethical and equity affect food and health systems. Food and health security is attainable only when the underlying social inequities are addressed; it is an ethical issue as reflected in the UN Universal declaration of Human Rights which includes the right to food for health and wellbeing. Food and health security are part of the larger security agenda and merit corresponding attention. Policy recommendations with immediacy are greater investment in combined food and health research; an Asia Pacific security agenda which emphasizes planetary, human, health and food security as relevant to traditional defence security; and community and household security measures which include maternal literacy, communication technology and entrepreneurial opportunity.

Using the Hispanic naming convention, we construct within-village extended family networks in 504 poor rural villages. Family networks are larger (both in the number of members and as a share of the village population) and out-migration is lower the poorer and the less unequal the village of residence. Our results are consistent with the extended family being a source of informal insurance to its members.

J	Wielgosz, RI; Kaarls, R				Wielgosz, Robert I.; Kaarls, Robert			International Activities in Metrology in Chemistry	CHIMIA			English	Article						BIPM; Calibration; Metrology; Traceability; Uncertainty		In today's economy goods and information are being exchanged globally, international travel is commonplace as is the cross-boarder transport of livestock and agricultural products, and this trend is set to continue. Just as important are issues that impinge on our quality of life, such as health care, the environment and food quality. A strong international measurement and standards infrastructure is critical to assure equity in trade and a high quality of life, by ensuring that products and services meet their specifications. In the field of chemical measurements, certified reference materials (CRMs), measurement standards and reference measurement results provide stated references upon which analytical laboratories can anchor their measurement results. The traceability of measurement results to internationally accepted stated references, together with their stated measurement uncertainties, as described in ISO/IEC 17025, provides the basis for their comparability and global acceptance. Recent global activities which are succeeding in developing a system for the international acceptance of chemical measurements are described, notably: activities of the National Metrology Institutes and the BIPM; the Mutual Recognition Arrangement of the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM MRA) for National Calibration Certificates and Measurement Capabilities; the Inter-Laboratory Comparisons organised through the working groups of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance - Metrology in Chemistry (CCQM), and the activities of the Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM).

J	Lagarde, M; Haines, A; Palmer, N				Lagarde, Mylene; Haines, Andy; Palmer, Natasha			The impact of conditional cash transfers on health outcomes and use of health services in low and middle income countries	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							CHILD HEALTH; PROGRAM; INTERVENTIONS; GROWTH	Background Conditional cash transfers (CCT) provide monetary transfers to households on the condition that they comply with some pre-defined requirements. CCT programmes have been justified on the grounds that demand-side subsidies are necessary to address inequities in access to health and social services for poor people. In the past decade they have become increasingly popular, particularly in middle income countries in Latin America. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of CCT in improving access to care and health outcomes, in particular for poorer populations in low and middle income countries. Search strategy We searched a wide range of international databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE, in addition to development studies and economic databases. We also searched the websites and online resources of numerous international agencies, organisations and universities to find relevant grey literature. The original searches were conducted between November 2005 and April 2006. An updated search in MEDLINE was carried out in May 2009. Selection criteria CCT were defined asmonetary transfers made to households on the condition that they comply with some pre-determined requirements in relation to health care. Studies had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: health care utilisation, health expenditure, health outcomes or equity outcomes. Eligible study designs were: randomised controlled trial, interrupted time series analysis, or controlled before-after study of the impact of health financing policies following criteria used by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. Data collection and analysis We performed qualitative analysis of the evidence. Main result We included ten papers reporting results from six intervention studies. Overall, design quality and analysis limited the risks of bias. Several CCT programmes provided strong evidence of a positive impact on the use of health services, nutritional status and health outcomes, respectively assessed by anthropometric measurements and self-reported episodes of illness. It is hard to attribute these positive effects to the cash incentives specifically because other components may also contribute. Several studies provide evidence of positive impacts on the uptake of preventive services by children and pregnant women. We found no evidence about effects on health care expenditure. Authors' conclusions Conditional cash transfer programmes have been the subject of some well-designed evaluations, which strongly suggest that they could be an effective approach to improving access to preventive services. Their replicability under different conditions - particularly in more deprived settings - is still unclear because they depend on effective primary health care and mechanisms to disburse payments. Further rigorous evaluative research is needed, particularly where CCTs are being introduced in low income countries, for example in Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia.

J	Lagarde, M; Palmer, N				Lagarde, Mylene; Palmer, Natasha			The impact of contracting out on health outcomes and use of health services in low and middle-income countries	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							PERFORMANCE; CARE	Background Recent literature on the lack of efficiency and acceptability of publicly provided health services has led to an interest in the use of partnerships with the private sector to deliver public services. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of contracting out healthcare services in improving access to care in low and middle-income countries and, where possible, health outcomes. Search strategy We searched a wide range of international databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE, in addition to development studies and economic databases. We also searched the websites and online resources of numerous international agencies, organisations and universities to find relevant grey literature. The original searches were conducted between November 2005 and April 2006. An updated search in MEDLINE was carried out in May 2009. Selection criteria Contracting out health services is defined as the provision of healthcare services on behalf of the government by non-state providers. Studies had to include an objective measure of at least one of the following outcomes: health care utilisation, health expenditure, health outcomes or equity outcomes. Studies also needed to use one of the following study designs: randomised controlled trial, non-randomised controlled trial, interrupted time series analysis or controlled before and after study. Data collection and analysis We made an attempt to present results from the different studies in a systematic way, however due to the diversity of sources, contexts and methods used, we undertook a narrative synthesis. Main results Three studies met our inclusion criteria (one after re-analysis of data). These studies suggest that contracting out services to non-state providers can increase access and utilisation of health services. One study found a reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures and improvement in some health outcomes. However, methodological weaknesses and particularities of the reported programme settings limit the strength and generalisability of their conclusions. Authors' conclusions Three studies suggest that contracting out may be an appropriate response to scale up service delivery in particular settings, such as post-conflict or fragile states. Evidence was not presented on whether this approach was more effective than making a similar investment in the public sector, as there was not an exact control available in any of the settings. In addition, the introduction of non-state providers into some settings and not others also brings many potentially confounding variables, such as the presence of additional management expertise or expatriate doctors, which may improve drug supply or increase utilisation.

J	Johnstone, MJ; Kanitsaki, O				Johnstone, Megan-Jane; Kanitsaki, Olga			The spectrum of 'new racism' and discrimination in hospital contexts: A reappraisal	COLLEGIAN			English	Article						Cultural racism; Racialised care; Ethnicity; Nursing; Health care	SOCIAL-JUSTICE; HEALTH-CARE; RACE	In keeping with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, all people have the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Despite the universal right to health, people of minority racial and ethnic backgrounds experience commonplace and significant unjust inequalities in their health and health care. A key reason for this rests on what might be described as 'the illusion of non-racism in health care' - an illusion that rests on the frequently articulated belief that 'racism is not an issue any more'. Although there has been increasing recognition in recent years that race and racism have a particular, consistent and complex independent negative effect on the health and health care of racial and ethnic minority groups, racism per se stilt tends to be under-recognised and poorly addressed in health and nursing care domains. In this paper, it is suggested that a key reason racism in health care has been largely ignored is because of its 'changing face', making new and different forms of it difficult to recognise and manage. A key premise on which this paper rests - and also its ultimate conclusion - is that the problem of racism (to be distinguished from 'culturally insensitive' and 'culturally incongruent' care) needs to be unmasked and managed so that those most at risk of being discriminated against on racialised grounds can rest assured that when in need, they will receive the equitable, safe and quality care they are entitled to receive.

Recognising the inadequacies of landfill, waste management authorities proposed incineration, but large-scale incineration provoked more public concern and protest. Concerns about toxicity of incinerator emissions led to tighter regulation, but as evidence of the impacts of air pollution upon human health has hardened, opposition to incineration has persisted. The inequitable distribution of exposure to waste-related risks has generalised demands for environmental justice. There is variation in the extent to which anti-incinerator campaigns are networked among themselves and with environmental NGOs, but such networking has increased and is now transnational. New technologies mitigate some of the hazards of modern waste management but are unlikely to eliminate public protest over the siting of waste infrastructure.

J	Stronks, K; Kulu-Glasgow, I; Agyemang, C				Stronks, Karien; Kulu-Glasgow, Isik; Agyemang, Charles			The utility of 'country of birth' for the classification of ethnic groups in health research: the Dutch experience	ETHNICITY & HEALTH			English	Article						ethnic inequalities in health; country of birth; classification	PREVALENCE; IDENTITY; DISEASE; TURKISH; RACE	The relationship between ethnicity and health is attracting increasing attention in international health research. Different measures are used to operationalise the concept of ethnicity. Presently, self-definition of ethnicity seems to gain favour. In contrast, in the Netherlands, the use of country of birth criteria have been widely accepted as a basis for the identification of ethnic groups. In this paper, we will discuss its advantages as well as its limitations and the solutions to these limitations from the Dutch perspective with a special focus on survey studies. The country of birth indicator has the advantage of being objective and stable, allowing for comparisons over time and between studies. Inclusion of parental country of birth provides an additional advantage for identifying the second- generation ethnic groups. The main criticisms of this indicator seem to refer to its validity. The basis for this criticism is, firstly, the argument that people who are born in the same country might have a different ethnic background. In the Dutch context, this limitation can be addressed by the employment of additional indicators such as geographical origin, language, and self-identified ethnic group. Secondly, the country of birth classification has been criticised for not covering all dimensions of ethnicity, such as culture and ethnic identity. We demonstrate in this paper how this criticism can be addressed by the use of additional indicators. In conclusion, in the Dutch context, country of birth can be considered a useful indicator for ethnicity if complemented with additional indicators to, first, compensate for the drawbacks in certain conditions, and second, shed light on the mechanisms underlying the association between ethnicity and health.

J	Marsili, D; Fazzo, L; Comba, P				Marsili, Daniela; Fazzo, Lucia; Comba, Pietro			Health risks from hazardous waste disposal: the need for international scientific cooperation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						hazardous waste; health impact; environmental justice; international cooperation	CONGENITAL-ANOMALIES; LANDFILL SITES; GEOGRAPHIC DENSITY; MORTALITY	Adverse health effects due to waste management practices, and in particular of hazardous waste, potentially represent a public health issue in many less-developed regions and developing countries, because of growing waste production, inadequate waste management practices, lack of appropriate legislation and control systems, as well as of growing illegal hazardous waste transboundary movements driven by the most industrialized countries. According to the Report of the WHO Workshop held in Rome in 2007 " ... the scientific literature on the health effects of landfills provides some indication of the association between residing near a landfill site and adverse health effects. The evidence, somewhat stronger for reproductive outcomes than for cancer, is not sufficient to establish the causality of the association. However a public health response is warranted". Moreover, there is evidence and the global awareness of growing transboundary movements of hazardous waste from the most industrialized countries to less developed regions and developing countries. Export and import of hazardous wastes, as well as their regional final destination within a country, are driven by economic, political, environmental and technological factors such as differences in prices for treatments and disposal, different taxation levels for wastes, insufficient waste treatment capacity and technology, among several others. In this paper we aim to emphasize the need for developing international scientific cooperation activities in this field in the near future with the perspective to create an appropriate framework to promote studies, transfer of knowledge and technology as well as to widespread awareness on health risks from hazardous waste disposals.

The aim of the study was to examine the own and independent associations of job strain, organizational justice, workplace bullying, and work-home interface with pain. Data were collected through a postal survey to all 40, 45, 50, 55. and 60-year-old employees of the City of Helsinki in 2001 and 2002 (response rate 66%, N = 5819, 80% women). Pain was measured with a three category outcome: no pain, acute pain or chronic pain. Adjustment was made for age, education, physical working conditions, BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Among women, all psychosocial variables were associated with both acute and chronic pain when adjusted for confounders only. When psychosocial factors were additionally adjusted for each other, high job strain and both dimensions of work-home interface remained associated with both types of pain and repeatedly occurring bullying at workplace showed association with acute pain. Among men, when adjusted for confounders only. all psychosocial variables were associated with acute and chronic pain, except for family-to-work conflicts among those with acute pain. When adjusted mutually for all psychosocial variables, only bullying was associated with acute pain. job strain and organizational justice showed associations with chronic pain. Future studies would benefit from a broad psychosocial framework. Investments to healthier psychosocial working environments are needed to tackle pain related problems among employees.

J	Berik, G; Rodgers, YV; Seguino, S				Berik, Guenseli; Rodgers, Yana van der Meulen; Seguino, Stephanie			FEMINIST ECONOMICS OF INEQUALITY, DEVELOPMENT, AND GROWTH	FEMINIST ECONOMICS			English	Article						Development; growth; inequality; gender; macroeconomic policy; feminist economics	GENDER INEQUALITY; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; MONETARY-POLICY; SECULAR CHANGES; CHILD HEALTH; EMPLOYMENT; LABOR; EDUCATION; GLOBALIZATION; FEMINIZATION	This study examines connections between intergroup inequality and macroeconomic outcomes, considering various channels through which gender, growth, and development interact. It upholds the salience not only of equality in opportunities but also equality in outcomes. The contribution argues that inequalities based on gender, race, ethnicity, and class undermine the ability to provision and expand capabilities, and it examines the macroeconomic policies that are likely to promote broadly shared development. It explores how the macroeconomy acts as a structure of constraint in achieving gender equality and in turn how gender relations in areas like education and wage gaps can have macro-level impacts. Further, it underscores that the interaction of the macroeconomy and gender relations depends on the structure of the economy, the nature of job segregation, the particular measure of gender inequality, and a country's international relations. Finally, it outlines policies for promoting gender equality as both an intrinsic goal and a step toward improving well-being.

The Institute of Medicine's report on global health	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						global health; United States; translation; low and middle-income countries; Institute of Medicine		In the wake of dynamic economic and political transitions worldwide, the Institute of Medicine recently released its report advocating investments in global health from the United States ( US). The expert panel reinforces the 'transnational and interdisciplinary' nature of global health research and practice as an endeavor 'to improve health and achieve greater equity for all people worldwide.' This report was judiciously timed given the growing recognition of global health, and is also acknowledged for incorporating themes that are particularly pertinent to the twenty-first century. New paradigms are introduced, denouncing the dichotomous distinction between rich and poor countries with the rapidly transitioning countries emerging as global powers, and affirming the need for models of respectful partnership and wider translation of science into practice. Cultivating sustainable partnerships and investing in the understanding and combat of diseases worldwide will become increasingly important for the US to maintain its global competitiveness, and may offer lessons in innovation, efficiency, and organization of institutions and human resources.

Child injury in a changing world	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						globalisation; urbanisation; motorisation; environmental change; health inequalities	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HUMAN HEALTH; GLOBALIZATION; INVESTMENT; PREVENTION; POVERTY; IMPACTS; JUSTICE; KARACHI	The importance of child injuries has now been recognised as a significant public health problem internationally. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have recently published the first world report on child injury prevention. As infectious diseases decline, the relative importance of injury has increased, but the pace of change of global processes means that absolute increases in injury may occur over the next 20-30 years. This paper examines child injury in a changing world by outlining the ways in which the forces of globalisation, urbanisation, motorisation and environmental change could have an impact on injury epidemiology and policy. We consider how those in public health and those in the injury field should respond to the changing world of injury. Child injury prevention needs to be incorporated into planning for the rapidly changing urban environments of low-income countries and strategies devised for the large numbers of people displaced by environmental change.

J	Magar, V; Storer, G				Magar, V.; Storer, G.			Sexing development and relocating gender: An organisational case study	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						sexuality; gender; reproductive health; HIV/AIDS; organisational development		While gender has become increasingly mainstreamed(1) in international development, it has lost its sharpness as an analytical tool and operational means to women's liberation. Sexuality, while it intersects with gender as a social construct, has been largely ignored within development contexts. This paper draws on findings that emerged from the gains and struggles experienced by project staff in a large international development agency engaging communities on issues related to sexual and women's rights. In so doing, it illustrates how a sexuality lens can move beyond gender equity and sexual health programmes focused on women's vulnerability (largely framed around protecting women and promoting access to services and contraceptive or condom use) to richer understandings of the range of social and cultural factors shaping sexual meanings and gender roles. Reshaping understandings of gender and sexuality requires a change from the conventional development discourse based on biomedical and moral-based sensibilities that associates sex with risk and danger, towards one that also recognises pleasure and agency. Sexuality is a vital aspect of development and sexual rights are a precondition not only for HIV/AIDS prevention, reproductive health or rights, but also for gender equality and social inclusion more widely. While personal and organisational transformation is fundamental, broader social, cultural and political forces, from community groups to governments and donors at large, must lie at the heart of change.

J	Smith, MB; Signal, L				Smith, Moira B.; Signal, Louise			Global influences on milk purchasing in New Zealand - implications for health and inequalities	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article							BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DAIRY CONSUMPTION; NUTRIENT INTAKE; FOOD; NUTRITION; DIET; GLOBALIZATION; OBESITY; CHILDREN	Background: Economic changes and policy reforms, consistent with economic globalization, in New Zealand in the mid-1980s, combined with the recent global demand for dairy products, particularly from countries undergoing a 'nutrition transition', have created an environment where a proportion of the New Zealand population is now experiencing financial difficulty purchasing milk. This situation has the potential to adversely affect health. Discussion: Similar to other developed nations, widening income disparities and health inequalities have resulted from economic globalization in New Zealand; with regard to nutrition, a proportion of the population now faces food poverty. Further, rates of overweight/obesity and chronic diseases have increased in recent decades, primarily affecting indigenous people and lower socioeconomic groups. Economic globalization in New Zealand has changed the domestic milk supply with regard to the consumer and may shed light on the link between globalization, nutrition and health outcomes. This paper describes the economic changes in New Zealand, specifically in the dairy market and discusses how these changes have the potential to create inequalities and adverse health outcomes. The implications for the success of current policy addressing chronic health outcomes is discussed, alternative policy options such as subsidies, price controls or alteration of taxation of recommended foods relative to 'unhealthy' foods are presented and the need for further research is considered. Summary: Changes in economic ideology in New Zealand have altered the focus of policy development, from social to commercial. To achieve equity in health and improve access to social determinants of health, such as healthy nutrition, policy-makers must give consideration to health outcomes when developing and implementing economic policy, both national and global.

J	Brzezinski, Z				Brzezinski, Zbigniew			Major foreign policy challenges for the next US President	INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article								President Obama has been elected to office in the United States during a crisis of confidence in America's capacity to exercise effective leadership in world afairs. National self-indulgence, greedy financial irresponsibility and an unnecessary war have discredited that leadership, a situation that has been compounded by the current global economic crisis. Added to these self-inflicted wounds, this article suggests, are two transformational developments on the world political scene. First, the 'global political awakening' to issues such as climate change, health and social inequality; and second, a shift in the distribution of global power from the West to the East. However, although this shift is occurring, it is a slow process and in the foreseeable future there is no state, or combination of states, that can replace the role America plays on the international scene. What is also clear is that without an American recovery, there will be no global recovery. The American recovery will be a monumental task. But four small, telling words-unify, enlarge, engage and pacify-summarize the essence of the needed response. There needs to be an effort to re-establish a sense of unity between America and Europe; an enlarged coalition of principal players is necessary to promote more effective global management; dialogue engaging a wider circle of partners key to global geopolitical stability should be promoted and maintained; and a deliberate effort not to get bogged down politically and militarily in the Middle East is essential.

J	Burström, B				Burstrom, Bo			MARKET-ORIENTED, DEMAND-DRIVEN HEALTH CARE REFORMS AND EQUITY IN HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION IN SWEDEN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							MEDICAL-CARE; ACCESS; INEQUALITIES; CHOICE; SERVICES; BRITAIN; INCOME	In international comparisons, the Swedish health care system has been seen to perform well. In recent years, market-oriented, demand-driven health care reforms aimed at free choice of provider by patients and free establishment of doctors are increasingly promoted in Sweden. The stated objective is to improve access and efficiency in health services and to provide more and/or better services for the money. Swedish health policy aims to provide equal access to care, based on equal need. However, the social and economic gradient in disease and ill health does not translate into the same social and economic gradient in demand for health services. A market-oriented, demand-driven health care system runs the risk of defeating the health policy aims and of further increasing gaps between social groups in access and utilization of health care services, to the detriment of those with greater needs, unless it is coupled with need-based allocation of resources and empowerment of these groups.

Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) on infant mortality rates. In an ecological retrospective cohort study of 161 countries, from 1978 to 2002, the authors analyzed changes in government consumption (GC) as determining exposure to achievement of MDG4. Descriptive methods and a multiple logistic regression were applied to adjust for changes in gross domestic product, level of democracy, and income inequality. Excess infant mortality in the exposed countries, attributable to reductions in GC, was estimated. Fifty countries were found to have reduced GC, and I I I had increased GC. The gap in infant mortality rate between these groups of countries doubled in the study period. Non-achievement of MDG4 was associated with reductions in GC and increases in income inequality. The excess infant mortality attributable to GC reductions in the exposed countries from 1990 to 2002 was 4,473,348 deaths. The probability of achieving MDG4 seems to be seriously compromised for many countries because of reduced public sector expenditure during the last 25 years of the 20th century, in response to World Bank/International Monetary Fund Washington Consensus policies. This seeming contradiction between the goals of different U.N. branches may be undermining achievement of MDG4 and should be taken into account when developing future global governance policy.

J	Navarro, V				Navarro, Vicente			WHAT WE MEAN BY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								This article analyzes the changes in health conditions and quality of life in the populations of developed and developing countries over the past 30 years, resulting from neoliberal policies developed by many governments and promoted by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, and other international agencies. It challenges interpretations by the analysts of "globalization," including the common assumption that states are disappearing. The author shows that what has been happening is not a reduction of state interventions but a change in the nature and character of those interventions, resulting from major changes in class (and race and gender) power relations in each country, with establishment of an alliance between the dominant classes of developed and developing countries-a class alliance responsible for the promotion of its ideology, neoliberalism. This is the cause of the enormous health inequalities in the world today. The article concludes with a critical analysis of the WHO report on social determinants of health, applauding its analysis and many of its recommendations, but faulting it for ignoring the power relations that shape these social determinants. It is not inequalities that kill people, as the report states; it is those who are responsible for these inequalities that kill people.

J	Katz, AR				Katz, Alison Rosamund			PROSPECTS FOR A GENUINE REVIVAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE-THROUGH THE VISIBLE HAND OF SOCIAL JUSTICE RATHER THAN THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET: PART I	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								In a two-part article (the first part in this Journal issue), the author explores the prospects for a genuine revival of the social justice project of "Health for All by the Year 2000," launched by the WHO and UNICEF in 1978 at Alma-Ata in the former Soviet Union, with reference (in Part I) to the World Health Report 2008, Primary Health Care: Now More than Ever, and the report of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, also published in 2008; and (in Part 11) to Global Health Watch 2: An Alternative World Health Report and the perspectives of anti-capitalist, real socialist, environmental, and people's movements for economic and social justice. The reports are reviewed in terms of the original values and principles of Alma-Ata (social justice and human rights) and the structural foundations of the primary health care (PHC) project (a new international economic order and emancipatory development of decolonized countries). A genuine revival of the PHC project and of Health for All, which is its implicit objective, will not be possible unless the multiple crises that we are confronting today-in energy, water, food, finance, the environment, science, information, and democracy-are recognized as capitalist crises and addressed in these terms. In short, the invisible hand of the market must be replaced by the visible hand of social justice.

Methods: The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) international study from 2005/06 provided data on 204,534 11-, 13- and 15-year old students from nationally random samples of schools in 37 countries in Europe and North America. The outcome measure was prevalence of at least two daily health complaints, measured by the HBSC Symptom Check List. We included three independent variables at the individual level (sex, age group, family affluence measured by the Family Affluence Scale FAS) and two macro level measures on the country's economic situation: wealth measured by Gross National Product (GNP) and distribution of income measured by the Gini coefficient. Results: There was a significant socio-economic variation in health complaints in 31 of the 37 countries. The overall OR (95% CI) for 2+ daily health complaints for all countries was 1.31 (1.27-1.36) in the medium versus high FAS group and 2.07 (2.00-2.14) in the low versus high FAS group. This socio-economic gradient in health complaints attenuated somewhat in the multilevel models which included macro level data. There was no association between GNP and health complaints. The OR for high symptom load was 1.35 (1.08-1.69) per 10% increase in Gini coefficient. The socio-economic gradient in health complaints at the individual level was somewhat attenuated in the multilevel models which included macro level data. Conclusions: There was a significant association between low FAS and high level of health complaints in 30 of 37 countries. Health complaints increased significantly by increasing income inequality in the country.

HBSC has increased understanding of the determinants of young people's health, particularly in relation to the social contexts in which they live, learn and play. The study now spans 43 countries and regions in Europe and North America. HBSC provides intelligence for the development and evaluation of public health policy and practice at national, sub-national and international levels. However, the mere existence of evidence does not automatically change policy nor necessarily improve the lives of young people. Effective mechanisms to ensure use of evidence in policy-making and practice are needed. The WHO/HBSC Forum series is a platform designed to facilitate the translation of evidence into action. Forum processes convene researchers, policy-makers and practitioners from across Europe to analyse data, review policies and interventions, and identify lessons learned to improve the health of adolescents through actions that address the social contexts that influence their health. Each Forum process consists of case studies produced by interdisciplinary teams in countries and regions, cross-country evidence reviews, a European consultation, an outcomes statement within a final publication, and a Web-based knowledge platform. in addition to emphasizing the translation of research into action, the Forum series focuses on increasing know-how to scale up intersectoral policies and interventions; reduce health inequities; and involve young people in the design, implementation and evaluation of policies and interventions. Interviews with selected participants in the 2007 Forum process revealed that national-level impacts of involvement were: - brokering new or strengthening existing working relationships among members of case study drafting teams and national delegations to events; - feeding into the formulation of national policy or practice design; and - enabling the comparison of information systems, policies, interventions, and working methods with other countries and against the evidence base, thus providing encouragement for new and/or validation of existing activities. The WHO/HBSC Forum series is an evolving platform. The methodology for each Forum process incorporates lessons learnt through past Fora - within resource constraints - and is based on the principles of efficiency and effectiveness. Areas requiring further development, identified through the aforementioned interviews and based on the reflections of co-organizers, include identification of means to ensure systematic, appropriate and meaningful youth involvement; maximization of the usefulness of the European consultation; and definition of a budget line and framework for evaluation of the process' impact at country level.

Iran Millennium Development Goal's in a Glance	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Millennium; Health; Iran		The Millennium Development Goal's (MDG's) represent a global partnership that has grown from the comments and targets established at the world summits of the 1990's. Responding to the world's main development challenges and to the calls of civil society, the MDG's promote poverty, reduction, education, maternal health, gender equality, and aims at combating child mortality, AIDs and other diseases, environmental sustainability and global partnership. Set for the year 2015, the MDG's are an agreed set of goals that can be achieved if all actors work together and do their part. Poor countries have pledged to govern better, and to invest in their people through health care and education. Rich countries have pledged to support poor countries through aid, debt relief and fairer trade. MDG's at the Ministry of Health and Medical Education ill Iran aims to, reduce the under-five mortality rate to two thirds between 1990 and 2015, improve maternal health by reducing to three quarters the mortality ratio and achieve universal access to reproductive health, to combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and TB, and to have them halted by 2015, to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and to achieve by 2010 a universal access to treatment to all those who need it and by 2015 begin to reverse the incidence of malaria and TB.				gr_heidari@yahoo.com	Heidari, Rosemarie/O-5718-2017; heidary, gholamreza/AAO-2576-2021	Heidari, Rosemarie Noot/0000-0001-5307-7501; Heidari, Gholamreza/0000-0002-4042-8189					3	10	10	0	2	TEHRAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES	TEHRAN	P O BOX 14155-6451, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN	0304-4556			IRAN J PUBLIC HEALTH	Iran J.

Conceptualising Dimensions of Quality of Life in Poverty	JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY & APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						quality of life; poverty; health; WHOQOL	WHOQOL-BREF	Are existing health-related quality of life (QoL) measures adequate for use in poverty? Focus groups of development researcher-practitioners were convened to discuss QoL in the low-middle-income countries of Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Peru and Thailand. Newly elicited themes were mapped onto the QoL concept consisting of 25 original facets from the WHOQOL-100, plus 24 additional facets derived from five subsequent WHOQOL modules (49 facets) organized in seven domains. Qualitative themes and importance ratings were used to identify seven novel themes that relate to poverty in these Countries. Most are not included in QoL instruments: physical fitness & survival, social status, community relations, family life, work opportunity and environment, fairness and equality, and perception of political institutions. Community relations extended the social domain, and a political rights and freedoms domain was consolidated as a seventh domain. This cross-national study provides a new conceptual foundation for the international assessment of QoL in poverty. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Self-reported quality of life and social support, chart diagnosis, and administrative housing, services and criminal justice data were collected for 589 Bronx Mental Health Court participants for 12 months following diversion. Individuals who were homeless (n = 89) versus housed (n = 500) during the 12 months prior to diversion were compared to determine predictors of court graduation and rearrest. Homeless status did not predict graduation or re-arrest, and quality of life, social support, functioning and housing type were not predictive of re-arrest. Housing instability negatively affected outcomes for both homeless and non-homeless individuals. An increase in functioning and a slight improvement in social support were predictive of successful graduation for homeless individuals, whereas a large increase in social support and lower functioning had a negative impact. In contrast, positive life satisfaction was predictive of successful graduation in non-homeless participants. Those who did not complete mental health court, whether homeless or not, were more likely to be re-arrested, particularly for felony and drug-related offenses than those who graduated. Mental health court was generally beneficial to mental health court participants. However, for those previously homeless, functioning and social support may play a unique and interconnected role in court graduations, whereas general life satisfaction may be a better indicator for program completion for non-homeless individuals.

J	Moon, C				Moon, Claire			Healing Past Violence: Traumatic Assumptions and Therapeutic Interventions in War and Reconciliation	JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							SOUTH-AFRICA; JUSTICE; FORGIVENESS; CONFLICT; PEACE	Since South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), a therapeutic moral order has become one of the dominant frameworks within which states attempt to deal with a legacy of violent conflict. As a consequence, the grammar of trauma, suffering, repression, denial, closure, truth-revelation, and catharsis has become almost axiomatic to postconflict state-building. The rise of the postconflict therapeutic framework is tied, ineluctably, to the global proliferation of amnesty agreements. This article examines the emergence and application of two therapeutic truisms that have gained political credence in postconflict contexts since the work of the TRC. The first of these is that war-torn societies are traumatized and require therapeutic management if conflict is to be ameliorated. The second, and related truism, is that one of the tasks of the postconflict state is to attend to the psychiatric health of its citizens and the nation as a whole. The article shows how, and to what effect, these truisms coalesce powerfully at the site of postconflict national reconciliation processes. It argues that the discourse of therapy provides a radically new mode of state legitimation. It is the language through which new state institutions, primarily truth commissions, attempt to acknowledge suffering, ameliorate trauma and simultaneously found political legitimacy. The article concludes by suggesting that, on a therapeutic understanding, postconflict processes of dealing with past violence justify nascent political orders on new grounds: not just because they can forcibly suppress conflict, or deliver justice and protect rights, but because they can cure people of the pathologies that are a potential cause of resurgent violence.

Learning from the Past and Looking to the Future	JOURNAL OF NUTRIGENETICS AND NUTRIGENOMICS			English	Article						Asilomar process; Ethical responsibilities; Genetic determinism; Genetic screening; Pharmacogenomics; Recombinant-DNA research; Scientific regulation; SNP profiles		Background/Aims: Leaders in the fields of nutrigenomics/genetics can benefit from studying the ethical and social issues raised by comparable biomedical developments in the recent past and their consequences for science and society. Methods: Experience with recombinant DNA research, beginning in the early 1970s, and its commercial application, and with pharamacogenetics/genomics, beginning two decades later, is analyzed. Results: Particular lessons are drawn from both experiences. As to the first, the conclusions are to encourage open discussion among scientists of the possible negative or risky consequences of their research; not to conduct such discussions behind closed doors, so as to involve rather than to surprise the public; and to keep in mind the international characteristics of science but the domestic nature of the manner in which it is regulated. As to the second, the lessons are to beware of hype, avoid genetic determinism, take account of the problems raised by similarities to traditional genetic screening/testing, overcome the medical system's lack of preparation to use the new information, and recognize that differences in access may exacerbate inequities in health and health care. Conclusion: Awareness of these problems, which are likely to recur, can at least prepare those working in the field. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

In fact medical education is being driven into isolated communities by factors including workforce undersupply, education pedagogy, medical practice and research needs. Rural and remote medical education (RRME) happens in rural hospitals and rural general practices, singly or in combination, generally for periods of 4 to 40 weeks. An effective RRME programme matches the context of the local health service and community. Its implementation reflects the local capacity for providing learning opportunities, facilitates collaboration of all participants and capitalises on local creativity in teaching. Implementation barriers stem from change management, professional culture and resource allocation. Blending learning approaches as much as technology and local culture allow is central to achieving student learning outcomes and professional development of local medical teachers. RRME harnesses the rich learning environment of communities such that students rapidly achieve competence and confidence in a primary care/generalist setting. Longer programmes with an integrated (generalist) approach based in the immersion learning paradigm appear successful in returning graduates to rural practice and a career track with a quality lifestyle.

Over time, our understanding of both the problem and its causal connections has changed considerably. This is reflected within an increasingly explicit articulation of the issues and a progressively more sophisticated and determined cross-sectoral approach to tackling health inequalities. This paper reflects on the progress we have made in England in addressing this challenge, suggesting that we need to engage more proactively with our population and with our international partners, taking a systematic partnership approach to inform policy, practice and delivery on the ground.

Cost Effectiveness in Low- and Middle-Income Countries A Review of the Debates Surrounding Decision Rules	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Review							WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; HEALTH-CARE; STATISTICAL LIFE; MALARIA CONTROL; GLOBAL BURDEN; INTERVENTIONS; STRATEGIES; EQUITY; ECONOMICS	Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is increasingly important in public health decision making, including in low- and middle-income countries. The decision makers' valuation of a unit of health gain, or ceiling ratio (lambda), is important in CEA as the relative value against which acceptability is defined, although values are usually chosen arbitrarily in practice. Reference case estimates for lambda are useful to promote consistency, facilitate new developments in decision analysis, compare estimates against benefit-cost ratios from other economic sectors, and explicitly inform decisions about equity in global health budgets. The aim of this article is to discuss values for lambda used in practice, including derivation based on affordability expectations (such as $US150 perdisability-adjusted life-year [DALY]), some multiple of gross national income or gross domestic product, and preference-elicitation methods, and explore the implications associated with each approach. The background to the debate is introduced, the theoretical bases of current values are reviewed, and examples are given of their application in practice. Advantages and disadvantages of each method for defining lambda are outlined, followed by an exploration of methodological and policy implications.

J	Ridde, V				Ridde, Valery			POLICY IMPLEMENTATION IN AN AFRICAN STATE: AN EXTENSION OF KINGDON'S MULTIPLE-STREAMS APPROACH	PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION			English	Article							PROBLEM DEFINITION; HEALTH-POLICY; EQUITY; MODEL; GAP	Kingdon's multiple-streams framework, which emerged in the mid-1980s, today forms one of the indispensable analytical frameworks for understanding public policy agenda-setting. However, it is only in the context of wealthy countries that this approach has been validated for setting the agenda of national and international policies. This article reports the results of empirical research in an African state studying the transferability of a threefold theoretical innovation. The question under consideration is whether the multiple-streams framework is useful for examining public policy implementation at the local level and in the context of a low income country. The research findings confirm the premise that the multiple-streams framework can be extended and can lead to the formulation of several theoretical propositions.

In the first section, social and cultural factors that may place women of color at risk for drug use and exposure to HIV are identified. In the second section, lessons learned while developing HIV prevention research protocols for women of color in South Africa are presented and discussed. Experience suggests that to effectively address women's risks of drug use and AIDS requires specific theoretical models and methodological approaches that acknowledge the critical interface that may exist among social inequality, drug use, and AIDS risk for women worldwide. Successful HIV prevention and intervention programs for women of color worldwide also require international research partnerships that are based on mutual respect between partners and attention to the needs and priorities of the target populations.

J	Liljegren, M; Ekberg, K				Liljegren, Mats; Ekberg, Kerstin			The associations between perceived distributive, procedural, and interactional organizational justice, self-rated health and burnout	WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT & REHABILITATION			English	Article						Organizational justice; self-rated health; burnout	EFFORT-REWARD IMBALANCE; FAIRNESS PERCEPTIONS; RELATIONAL INJUSTICE; PREDICTORS; WORK; BEHAVIORS; EMPLOYEES; SWEDISH; ABSENCE; SF-36	Aim: The aim of the present study was to examine the cross-sectional and 2-year longitudinal associations between perceived organizational justice, self-rated health and burnout. Metods: The study used questionnaire data from 428 Swedish employment officers and the data was analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling, SEM. Two different models were tested: a global organizational justice model (with and without correlated measurement errors) and a differentiated (distributive, procedural and interactional organizational justice) justice model (with and without correlated measurement errors). Results: The global justice model with autocorrelations had the most satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices. Global justice showed statistically significant (p < 0.01) cross-sectional (0.80 <= mle <= 0.84) and longitudinal positive associations (0.76 <= mle <= 0.82) between organizational justice and self-rated health, and significant (p < 0.01) negative associations between organizational justice and burnout (cross-sectional: mle = -0.85, longitudinal -0.83 >= mle >= -0.84). Conclusion: The global justice construct showed better goodness-of-fit indices than the threefold justice construct but a differentiated organizational justice concept could give valuable information about health related risk factors: if they are structural (distributive justice), procedural (procedural justice) or inter-personal (interactional justice). The two approaches to study organizational justice should therefore be regarded as complementary rather than exclusive.

However, with the triumph of eugenic ideas and the imposition of a "racial hygiene" policy by the Nazi regime, various organs of the German health system saw themselves involved in a perverse system of social control, in which the illicit use of psychopharmacological tools became customary. In the present work, we review, from the historical perspective, the factors that helped to bring about this situation and we analyze the abuses (known and documented) committed through the specific use of psychotropic drugs during the Nazi period. Among such abuses we can identify the following illegitimate activities: the use of psychoactive drugs, mainly sedatives from the barbiturates family, in the different euthanasia programmes implemented by the Nazi authorities, in police activity and various types of repression, and for purely criminal and extermination purposes within the so-called "Final Solution"; psychopharmacological research on the mentally ill, without the slightest ethical requirements or legal justification; and the use of psychotropic agents in research on healthy subjects, recruited from concentration camps. Finally, we refer to the role of poisonous nerve agents (tabun, sarin and soman) as instruments of chemical warfare and their development by the German authorities. Many of these activities, though possibly only a small portion of the total - given the destruction of a great deal of documentation just before the end of World War II - came to light through the famous Nuremberg Trials, as well as through other trials in which specific persons were brought to justice unilaterally by individual Allied nations or by the authorities of the new German government after the War.

This right is central to the creation of equitable health systems. We identify some of the right-to-health features of health systems, such as a comprehensive national health plan, and propose 72 indicators that reflect some of these features. We collect globally processed data on these indicators for 194 countries and national data for Ecuador, Mozambique, Peru, Romania, and Sweden. Globally processed data were not available for 18 indicators for any country, suggesting that organisations that obtain such data give insufficient attention to the right-to-health features of health systems. Where they are available, the indicators show where health systems need to be improved to better realise the right to health. We provide recommendations for governments, international bodies, civil-society organisations, and other institutions and suggest that these indicators and data, although not perfect, provide a basis for the monitoring of health systems and the progressive realisation of the right to health. Right-to-health features are not just good management, justice, or humanitarianism, they are obligations under human-rights law.

In these regions, CVD occurs at a much younger age than in high-income countries, thereby contributing disproportionately to lost potential years of healthy life as well as lost economic productivity. Many effective interventions for CVD prevention and management are now affordable for all but the very poorest countries, but large treatment gaps still exist because of poor prescribing practices, limited availability of medicines, and lack of appropriately skilled health care providers. Despite the increasing awareness of the growing epidemic of CVD in LMIC, this public health priority has received little attention from those who determine the international health agenda. Although the burden of CVD is already enormous in developing countries, there exists a window of opportunity to prevent the epidemic reaching its full potential magnitude. This requires the rapid deployment of strategies already proven to be effective in high-income countries. Such strategies need to be tailored for LMIC for them to be affordable, effective, and accessible to disadvantaged groups and the burgeoning middle classes. Ideally, the control of CVD in these countries would involve a dual approach in which evidence-based clinical strategies for CVD prevention and treatment are complemented by evidence-based population level strategies. We propose that upgrading primary health care services is a central requirement for the control of the CVD epidemics facing the developing world.

The debate ultimately led to the rewriting of international ethics guidelines, in at least one case specifically to prohibit use of a placebo group (the most controversial aspect of the research) when known effective treatment is available. I draw upon clinical experience in Malawi and theoretical perspectives from anthropology to reframe the controversy. The dominant bioethical position constructed research and therapy as ethically distinct. This distinction ensured that inequalities of power and resources were perpetuated, not remedied, by the AZT debates.

In the face of escalating infection rates among women, and particularly young women, many have pointed to the potential importance of economic empowerment strategies for 14 prevention responses. Global evidence suggests that the relationship between poverty and HIV risk is complex, and that poverty on its own cannot be viewed simplistically as a driver of the HIV epidemic. Rather, its role appears to be multidimensional and to interact with a range of other factors, including mobility, social and economic inequalities and social capital, which converge in a particularly potent way for young women living in southern Africa. To date, there have been few interventions that have explicitly attempted to combine economic empowerment with the goal of HIV prevention, and even fewer that have been rigorously evaluated. This paper explores how programmes such as microfinance, livelihood training and efforts to safeguard women's food security and access to property have begun to incorporate an HIV prevention focus. Although such circumscribed interventions, by themselves, are unlikely to lead to significant impacts oil a national or regional scale, they are useful for testing cross-sectoral partnership models, generating practical lessons and providing a metaphor for what might be possible in promoting women's economic empowerment more broadly. Despite numerous calls to 'mainstream AIDS' in economic development, cross-sectoral responses have not been widely taken up by government or other stakeholders. We suggest potential reasons for limited progress to date and conclude by presenting programme and policy recommendations for further exploring and harnessing linkages between economic empowerment and HIV prevention in Southern Africa.

These deaths are mostly in low-income countries, but neonatal mortality and morbidity are also a priority burden in high-income countries. Epidemiological evidence suggests newborn research would prioritise the poorest families: birth and the first days of life; major causes particularly infections, preterm birth and asphyxia: and include preventive strategies as well as improved care. However research investment is not commensurate to burden, and there is a mismatch with current research priorities. South Asia and sub Saharan Africa. with 75% of the burden, expend around US$20 million per year on newborn research, a fraction of what is spent on a smaller proportion of health problem in rich countries. We propose a research pipeline of description, discovery, development of solutions and delivery of research with scale-up to reach the poorest families. Listing research options and applying quantitative scoring enables systematic, transparent research prioritisation. As well as a research pipeline, a "people pipeline" is required to generate research capacity in low-income countries. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Brereton, F; Clinch, JP; Ferreira, S				Brereton, Finbarr; Clinch, J. Peter; Ferreira, Susana			Employment and Life-Satisfaction: Insights from Ireland	ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW			English	Article							MENTAL-HEALTH; RELATIVE INCOME; HAPPINESS; UNEMPLOYMENT; PANEL; UNHAPPINESS; INEQUALITY; MONEY	Mainstream neoclassical economics takes it as given that the consumption of goods and services (output) is positively related to well-being. Work (labour-input) is assumed to be negatively related to well-being at the margin and so is only undertaken in exchange for payment. This view has been challenged for decades in the psychology and sociology literature and results suggests that employment status (especially unemployment) has profound effects on well-being, even at the margin. It is surprising then that several labour force status categories have been under researched in the literature to date. In this paper, using a sample of Irish adults carried out in 2001, we extend the current literature to examine the impacts of additional labour force status categories on life-satisfaction based on International Labour Organisation (ILO) classifications. These include part-time employment, disconnection from the labour force and being disabled, unable to work. Additionally, we expand the analysis of unemployment in the happiness literature and examine if the effects of unemployment and part-time employment on life satisfaction are conditioned by gender. Insights show that being part-time employed has a significant negative effect on life satisfaction, particularly for males. Being unemployed is found to have a significant negative effect on well-being, independent of gender and income, but no such effect is found for the local unemployment rate.

J	Jürges, H; Avendano, M; Mackenbach, JP				Juerges, Hendrik; Avendano, Mauricio; Mackenbach, Johan P.			Are different measures of self-rated health comparable? An assessment in five European countries	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Self-rated health; World health; International comparisons; Research design; Europe	PERCEIVED HEALTH; MORTALITY; INCOME; INEQUALITIES; SHAPE	Objective: Self-rated health (SRH) is widely used to compare population health across countries, but comparability is often hampered by the use of different versions of this item. This study compares the WHO recommended version (ranging from 'very good' to 'very bad') with the US version (ranging from 'excellent' to 'poor') in European countries. Methods: Data came from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). Both the WHO and US versions of SRH were measured in representative samples of Europeans aged 50+ (n = 11,643) in five countries. Concordance between the two SRH versions and differences in their associations with demographics, chronic diseases, functioning and depression were assessed using ordered probit regression. Results: The US version has a more symmetric distribution and larger variance than the WHO version. Although the WHO version discriminates better at the positive end, the US version shows better discrimination at the positive end of the scale. Sixty-nine percent of respondents provided literally concordant answers, while only about one-third provided relatively concordant answers. Overall, however, less than 10% of respondents were discordant in either sense. The two versions were strongly correlated (polychoric correlation = 0.88), had similar associations with demographics and health indicators, and showed a similar pattern of international variation. Conclusion: Health levels based on different measurements of SRH are not directly comparable and require rescaling of items. However, both versions represent parallel assessments of the same latent health variable. We did not find evidence that the WHO version is preferable to the US version as standard measure of SRH in European countries.

J	Hanley, GE; Morgan, S; Hurley, J; Van Doorslaer, E				Hanley, Gillian E.; Morgan, Steve; Hurley, Jeremiah; Van Doorslaer, Eddy			DISTRIBUTIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSITION FROM AGE-BASED TO INCOME-BASED PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA	HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						health-care financing; progressivity; pharmaceuticals	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; HEALTH-CARE; FINANCE; EQUITY	In May, 2003, British Columbia transitioned from all age-based public drug program, with public subsidy primarily based on age, to age-irrelevant income-based drug program, in which public subsidy is based primarily on household income. As one of the specific aims of the policy change was to improve fairness by increasing the extent to which payment for drugs is based oil ability to pay, we measure the progressivity of pharmaceutical financing before and after the policy change in BC using Kakwani indices. Our results suggest that pharmaceutical financing became less regressive after the policy change. However, this decrease in regressivity arose primarily because high-income seniors were making greater direct contributions to pharmaceutical financing and not because low-income households were making smaller direct Contributions. Our results also Suggest that if the public financing of pharmaceuticals were maintained or increased, a change from age-based to income-based eligibility call unambiguously improve equity ill finance. As Populations in developed countries age, governments will increasingly consider reforms to publicly financed health-care programs with age-based eligibility. In assessing policy options, financial equity is likely to be a key consideration. These results Suggest that income-based pharmacare can improve financial equity especially when implemented with a commitment to maintain or increase public funding for prescription drugs.

J	Raphael, D; Curry-Stevens, A; Bryant, T				Raphael, Dennis; Curry-Stevens, Ann; Bryant, Toba			Barriers to addressing the social determinants of health: Insights from the Canadian experience	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Social determinants of health; Public policy; Politics and ideology	PUBLIC-HEALTH; POPULATION HEALTH; INCOME INEQUALITY; POLICY; POLITICS	Despite Canada's reputation as a leader in health promotion and population health, implementation of public policies in support of the social determinants of health has been woefully inadequate. The continuing presence of income, housing, and food insecurity has led to Canada being the subject of a series of rebukes from the United Nations for failing to address child and family poverty, discrimination against women and Aboriginal groups, and most recently the crisis of homelessness and housing insecurity. In this article we consider some of the reasons why this might be the case. These include the epistemological dominance of positivist approaches to the health sciences, the ideology of individualism prevalent in North America, and the increasing influence on public policy of the marketplace. Various models of public policy provide pathways by which these barriers can be surmounted. Considering that the International Commission on the Social Determinants of Health will soon be releasing its findings and recommendations. such an analysis seems especially timely for understanding both the Canadian scene and developments in other nations.

The paper takes on an issue that is generally overlooked in the development debate and is not much addressed in the current international development standard, the Millennium Development Goals, and yet is one that places serious constraints on the ability of underdeveloped nations to achieve improvement. The relationship between psychotropic or "mind/mood altering" drugs and sustainable development is rooted in the contribution that the legal and illegal drug trade makes to a set of barriers to development, including: (1) interpersonal crime and community violence; (2) the corruption of public servants and the disintegration of social institutions; (3) the emergence of new or enhanced health problems; (4) the lowering of worker productivity; (5) the ensnarement of youth in drug distribution and away from productive education or employment; (6) the skewing of economies to drug production and money laundering. The paper emphasizes the need for new approaches for diminishing the burden placed by drugs on development. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Exploring policy-makers' perspectives on disinvestment from ineffective healthcare practices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article						disinvestment; policy; stakeholder engagement; health technology assessment; obsolescence; cost-effectiveness	OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; UPPER AIRWAY SURGERY; TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENTS; MAJOR ROLE	Objectives: Many existing healthcare interventions diffused before modern evidence-based standards of clinical- and cost-effectiveness. Disinvestment from ineffective or inappropriately applied practices is growing as a priority for international health policy, both for improved quality of care and sustainability of resource allocation. Australian policy stakeholders were canvassed to assess their perspectives on the challenges and the nature of disinvestment. Methods: Senior health policy stakeholders from Australia were criterion and snow-ball sampled (to identify opinion leaders). Participants were primed with a potential disinvestment case study and took part in individual semistructured interviews that focused on mechanisms and challenges within health policy to support disinvestment. Interviews were taped and transcribed for thematic analysis. Participant comments were de-identified. Results: Ten stakeholders were interviewed before saturation was reached. Three primary themes were identified. (i) The current focus on assessment of new and emerging health technologies/practices and lack of attention toward existing practices is due to resource limitations and methodological complexity. Participants considered a parallel model to that of Australia's current assessment process for new medical technologies is best-positioned to facilitate disinvestment. (ii) To advance the disinvestment agenda requires an explicit focus on the potential for cost-savings coupled with improved quality of care. (iii) Support (financial and collaborative) is needed for research advancement in the methodological underpinnings associated with health technology assessment and for disinvestment specifically. Conclusions: In this exploratory study, stakeholders support the notion that systematic policy approaches to disinvestment will improve equity, efficiency, quality, and safety of health care, as well as sustainability of resource allocation.

Research on Economic Inequality 10, 65-100] decomposition to an analysis of the 1998 Swiss health system financing. We see that in addition to measuring horizontal inequality in the classical sense, this decomposition is more efficient and flexible than earlier ones. It is also pointed out that methods involving a nonparametric estimation lead to asymptotically biased vertical and horizontal effects. A procedure to estimate this bias is given. Finally, it is shown that despite a major reform, health system financing is still very regressive and social health insurance is more regressive than direct financing. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of the social milieu on health and wellness is not a new concept. Before the invention of an effective pharmacopoeia, manipulation of the social environment was one of the few tools available to physicians. Modern medicine continues to focus on individual rather than community efforts at risk reduction. To understand health and wellness, we must look not only at bodies and illnesses but also at communities and social structure. This article discusses the impact of spirituality and religion, education, economics, and politics on health and wellness. The impact of these issues on health will drive system-level change in global health.

The predictive value of different socio-economic indicators for overweight in nine European countries	PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION			English	Article						Socio-economic indicators; Overweight; International study; Educational attainment; Household income; Occupational class	BODY-MASS INDEX; EDUCATIONAL-LEVEL; SKINFOLD THICKNESS; MEASURED HEIGHT; SECULAR TRENDS; WEIGHT-GAIN; LIFE-STYLE; OBESITY; INTELLIGENCE; HEALTH	Objectives: To assess which socio-economic indicator best predicts overweight in the European Union: educational attainment, occupational class or household income. Setting: The prevalence of overweight is strongly related to socio-economic position. The relative importance of different socio-economic dimensions is uncertain, and might vary between countries. Design and subjects: Cross-sectional self-report data of the European Community Household Panel were obtained from nine countries (n 52855; age 25-64 years). Uni- and multivariate regression analyses were employed to predict overweight (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) in relationship to socio-economic indicators. Occupational class was measured using the new European Socio-economic Classificatiion. Results: Large socio-economic differences in overweight were observed in all countries, especially for women. For both sexes, a low educational attainment was the strongest predictor of overweight. After controlling for education, overweight was negatively related to household income in women, but positively in men. Similar patterns were found for occupational class. For women, but not for men, educational inequalities in overweight were generally greater in Southern European countries. A similar pattern of inequalities in overweight was observed for all ages between 25 and 64 years. Conclusions: Across Europe, overweight was more strongly and more consistently related to educational attainment than to occupational class or household income. People with lower educational attainment should be a specific target group for programmes and policies that aim to prevent overweight.

The fundamental hypothesis, which emphasizes Environmental Justice, refers to hazards that are disproportionately or unjustly distributed across more socially and economically vulnerable groups, which are generally the poor and the minorities affected by the environmental risks posed by modernity. Therefore, vulnerability and the different levels of deprivation act as drivers of the different levels of health across population groups. Although Environmental Justice has initially been observed as a grassroots movement in the United States, its principles showed compatibility with global and local geographical scales. Therefore, the aim of the study was to understand how the risks of contemporary technologies unequally affect the population under the perspective of Environmental Justice.

Methods This observational follow-up study included 1427 immigrants and 2793 Spanish natives treated at five primary care centers in Lleida in 2005 and followed for 6 months. The sick leave causes were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (10th revision). Multivariate Poisson regressions estimated the rate ratio (RR) for sick leave adjusted for age, and linear regressions evaluated the effect of age, gender, and region of origin on the total number of sick-leave days. Results Altogether 19.5% of the natives and 12.7% of the immigrants had at least one sick-leave episode. The incidence of new episodes per 100 person-years was lower for the immigrants than for the natives (32.5 versus 43.3 for the men and 18.6 versus 35.6 for the women, respectively). The mean duration of sick leave in the 6-month period was 19.4 (SD 29.4) days for the immigrants and 33.5 (SD 39.2) days for the natives. For the men, the risk of sick leave was greater for the natives than for the immigrants (adjusted RR 1.70, 95% confidence interval 1.43-2.02). After adjustment for age, the duration of sick leave for the native workers was 1.5 times greater than for the immigrants. Conclusions Even though sick leave was less frequent among the immigrants than among the natives and the immigrant sick-leave periods were of shorter duration, the two study populations did not show differences in the causes of disability.

The probability to report good or very good health is calculated for the whole sample (after controlling for age, education, income and household composition) using regression coefficients estimated for individuals who do and for those who do not take part in social activities (with correction for selection bias in these two cases). Counterfactual national levels of SRH are derived from integral computation of cumulative distribution functions of the predicted probability thus obtained. The analysis reveals that social participation contributes by three percentage points to the increase in the share of individuals reporting good or very good health on average. Higher rates of social participation could improve health status within the whole sample and within most countries. Context and institutional arrangements (such as income inequality) may explain differences in social participation health efficiency. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Luna, M				Luna, Marcos			Out of sight, out of mind: Distancing and the geographic relationship between electricity consumption and production in Massachusetts	SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; AIR-POLLUTION; UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; POPULATIONS; INEQUALITY; JUSTICE; RACE	Objective. Based on the concept of "distancing'' and its implications for ecological feedback and environmental inequality, this article examines the influence of geographic distance from power plants on residential electricity consumption in Massachusetts. Methods. Mean geographic distance to all power plants in Massachusetts was calculated to a rasterized surface and aggregated by municipality for 243 cities and towns. Using stepwise regression, annual per household residential electricity consumption by municipality was regressed on mean distance to power plants, median household income, percent minority, median number of rooms, and median age. Results. Mean geographic distance to power plants and median number of rooms emerged as statistically significant predictors of per household residential electricity consumption. Conclusions. The findings lend support to the concept of "distancing'' and its implications for consumption in a domestic context. This analysis offers evidence of scale-independent similarity between global and local phenomena of environmental inequality and resource consumption.

The problems to be resolved, reflecting the setbacks of recent decades, are substantial: high levels of out-of-pocket payments and cost escalation, stalled progress in providing adequate health insurance for all, widespread inefficiencies in health facilities, uneven quality, extensive inequality, and perverse incentives for hospitals and doctors. China's leadership is taking bold steps to accelerate improvement, including increasing government spending on health and committing to reaching 100% insurance coverage by 2010. China's efforts are part of a worldwide transformation in the financing of health care that will dominate global health in the 21st century. The prospects that China will complete this transformation successfully in the next two decades are good, although success is not guaranteed. The real test, as other countries have experienced, will come when tougher reforms have to be introduced.

Welfare states contribute to the resources available for their citizens through cash transfer programmes and subsidised services. Although all rich nations have welfare programmes, there are clear cross-national differences with respect to their design and generosity These differences are evident in national variations in poverty rates, especially among children and elderly people. We investigated to what extent variations in family and pension policies are linked to infant mortality and old-age excess mortality. Methods Infant mortality rates and old-age excess mortality rates were analysed in relation to social policy characteristics and generosity. We did pooled cross-sectional time-series analyses of 18 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries during the period 1970-2000 for family policies and 1950-2000 for pension policies. Findings Increased generosity in family policies that support dual-earner families is linked with lower infant mortality rates, whereas the generosity in family policies that support more traditional families with gainfully employed men and homemaking women is not. An increase by one percentage point in dual-earner support lowers infant mortality by 0.04 deaths per 1000 births. Generosity in basic security type of pensions is linked to lower old-age excess mortality, whereas the generosity of earnings-related income security pensions is not. An increase by one percentage point in basic security pensions is associated with a decrease in the old age excess mortality by 0.02 for men as well as for women. Interpretation The ways in which social policies are designed, as well as their generosity, are important for health because of the increase in resources that social policies entail. Hence, social policies are of major importance for how we can tackle the social determinants of health.

Drawing on detailed multidisciplinary evidence assembled by the Globalization Knowledge Network that supported the CSDH, we define globalisation in mainly economic terms. We consider and reject the presumption that globalisation will yield health benefits as a result of its contribution to rapid economic growth and associated reductions in poverty. Expanding on this point, we describe four disequalising dynamics by which contemporary globalisation causes divergence: the global reorganisation of production and emergence of a global labour-market; the increasing importance of binding trade agreements and processes to resolve disputes; the rapidly increasing mobility of financial capital; and the persistence of debt crises in developing countries. Generic policies designed to reduce health inequities are described with reference to the three Rs of redistribution, regulation, and rights.

Meanwhile, humankind is disrupting the global climate and other life-supporting environmental systems, thereby creating serious risks for health and wellbeing, especially in vulnerable populations but ultimately for everybody. Underlying determinants of health inequity and environmental change overlap substantially; they are signs of an economic system predicated on asymmetric growth and competition, shaped by market forces that mostly disregard health and environmental consequences rather than by values of fairness and support. A shift is needed in priorities in economic development towards healthy forms of urbanisation, more efficient and renewable energy sources, and a sustainable and fairer food system. Global interconnectedness and interdependence enable the social and environmental determinants of health to be addressed in ways that will increase health equity, reduce poverty, and build societies that live within environmental limits.

We used comparative risk assessment methods to calculate the mortality effects of unsafe water and sanitation, indoor air pollution from household solid fuel use, and ambient urban particulate matter pollution in Mexico. We also estimated the disparities in mortality caused by each risk factor, across municipios (counties) of residence and by municipio socioeconomic status (SES). Data sources for the analysis were the national census, population-representative health surveys, and air quality monitoring for risk factor exposure; systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies for risk factor effects; and vital statistics for disease-specific mortality. During 2001-2005, unsafe water and sanitation, household solid fuel use, and urban particulate matter pollution were responsible for 3,000, 3,600, and 7,600 annual deaths, respectively. Annual child mortality rates would decrease by 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1 per 1,000 children, and life expectancy would increase by 1.0, 1.2, and 2.4 months, respectively, in the absence of these environmental exposures. Together, these risk factors caused 10.6% of child deaths in the lowest-SES communities (0.9 deaths per 1,000 children), but only 4.0% in communities in the highest-SES ones (0.1 per 1,000). In the 50 most-affected municipios, these 3 exposures were responsible for 3.2 deaths per 1,000 children and a 10-month loss of life expectancy. The large disparities in the mortality effects of these 3 environmental risks should form the basis of interventions and environmental monitoring programs.

J	Vearey, J				Vearey, Joanna			Migration, access to ART, and survivalist livelihood strategies in Johannesburg	AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH			English	Article						equity; government policy; health services; HIV/AIDS; informal sector; local government; public health sector; refugees; South Africa; urban health care	HEALTH	Since the end of apartheid, patterns of migration into South Africa have shifted, and South Africa has become a destination for people from across the African continent and beyond - a small but important number of whom are refugees and asylum seekers. While South Africa has a protective, integrative, urban refugee policy, many of these individuals struggle to access the rights to which they are entitled, including healthcare. In addition, many lower-skilled international migrants are unable to legalise their stay in South Africa. As a result, international migrants often become part of the group of 'urban poor,' falling within the periphery of health and social welfare provision and relying on a survivalist livelihood within the informal economy. The health and wellbeing of an individual impact greatly on their ability to maintain a secure livelihood, and this becomes more difficult in the context of an HIV epidemic. This paper presents findings from a case study situated in the City of Johannesburg. The research made use of 1) 2006 survey data on migrant livelihood strategies in Johannesburg, 2) a study investigating non-citizens' access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in the inner city, which included 3) a set of interviews conducted with migrant ART clients who were working in the city's informal economy. The findings indicate (a) the importance of the informal economy for migrants to Johannesburg; (b) the challenges that non-citizens face in accessing ART in the public sector in South Africa; and (c) the linkages between urban migrants' access to ART and their ability to maintain a survivalist livelihood. The paper argues that upholding people's right to ART for all who need it within South Africa will enable international migrants (including refugees and asylum seekers) to maintain an otherwise fragile survivalist livelihood, and this in turn will assist their self-reliance and integration into urban life. Recommendations are made to ensure that the right to healthcare is upheld for all in South Africa.

In this paper, we explore how to promote the participation of students and new researchers in global health in Quebec. To accomplish this, we undertook a study in order to: 1) document the state of teaching and research activities in global health in Quebec and 2) obtain the point of view of various actors on conducting global health research in the Quebec context. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through specialized grids and a documentation review (5 major universities), surveys (n=25), individual interviews (n=9), and two convened workshops (n=79). Results: We identified 27 courses with global health content, 36 researchers in Quebec working primarily on global health issues, and 76 global health research projects implemented over the past 5 years. A number of threats and opportunities were reported with regards to engaging in global health research activities, as were a number of strengths and weaknesses with respect to the teaching and research environments in Quebec. Conclusion: There appears to be a relatively strong and growing presence of global health in Quebec universities - although the Situation varies across institutions - with room for expansion. This trend is partly attributed to an increase in federal funding for and a growing awareness and profile of global health research activities since 2001 and to a growing expertise in global health research in the province. Students and new researchers, however, continue to face multiple challenges requiring special attention and targeted investment. We conclude with a set of recommendations for key stakeholders.

Negative consequences of childlessness are experienced to a greater degree in developing countries when compared with Western societies. Bilateral tubal occlusion due to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy-related infections is the most common cause of infertility in developing countries, a condition that is potentially treatable with assisted reproductive technologies (ART). New reproductive technologies are either unavailable or very costly in developing countries. This review provides a comprehensive survey of all important papers on the issue of infertility in developing countries. METHODS: Medline, PubMed, Excerpta Medica and EMBASE searches identified relevant papers published between 1978 and 2007 and the keywords used were the combinations of 'affordable, assisted reproduction, ART, developing countries, health services, infertility, IVF, simplified methods, traditional health care'. RESULTS: The exact prevalence of infertility in developing countries is unknown due to a lack of registration and well-performed studies. On the other hand, the implementation of appropriate infertility treatment is currently not a main goal for most international non-profit organizations. Keystones in the successful implementation of infertility care in low-resource settings include simplification of diagnostic and ART procedures, minimizing the complication rate of interventions, providing training-courses for health-care workers and incorporating infertility treatment into sexual and reproductive health-care programmes. CONCLUSIONS: Although recognizing the importance of education and prevention, we believe that for the reasons of social justice, infertility treatment in developing countries requires greater attention at National and International levels.

Between 2004 and 2007, face-to-face consultations were undertaken with community and government stake-holders, and interviews were conducted with eight prominent HIV/AIDS researchers with international experience to identify key research ethics challenges and structural, cultural, political, social, and economic factors that may impact HIV/AIDS research ethics in resource-limited settings. These challenges and factors served as the basis for the hypothetical ethics issues case scenarios developed for each of the four research tracks. Ethics issues were identified at every stage of the research process. Key contextual issues included: (1) stigma and culturally-embedded conceptuatizations of HIV; (2) local and global politics and economics; (3) gender inequities, power dynamics, and sexual roles; and (4) allocation and availability of resources for research and health services. The final document resulting from the consultation process provides a framework for open dialogue on the complex and interconnected ethics issues researchers may experience in the field of international HIV/AIDS research, and contributes to the HIV/AIDS research field by reinforcing the need for high quality and ethically sound research.

Several diseases of adulthood seem to be linked to, or to originate from, lifestyle in childhood and adolescence. Objective: The aims of this study are to describe birth parameters and socioeconomic factors and to assess clinical status in adolescents aged 13-16 years from 10 European countries participating in the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) Cross-Sectional Study (CSS). Methodology: A self-report questionnaire on the socioeconomic status, a parental questionnaire concerning neonatal period and also a case report form (CRF), in which clinical items during clinical examination (such as medical history, treatments, anthropometry, Tanner staging, blood pressure, heart rate) were assessed. To develop these documents, first a list of items was established, a search of existing documents was performed and the advice of local and international experts was taken. All documents (questionnaires and an operations manual) were discussed in plenary HELENA meetings; a final version of these documents was fixed, and the process of translation and back translation was performed. Results: The questionnaires and CRF were tested for validation in all 10 participant cities; 208 adolescents were enrolled during the pilot study. All items that caused problems or questions in one or more participating centers or were completed by < 85% of the adolescents were reviewed before the beginning of the HELENA-CSS. Conclusion: These final questionnaires and CRF will contribute to better understanding of the inequalities in nutrition, behavior and health in the European adolescent population. The experience and process should be useful for other multicenter studies.

Twelve worlds: a geo-demographic comparison of global inequalities in mortality	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							HEALTH INEQUALITIES; GEOGRAPHY; TRENDS	Objective: The aim of this study was to identify clusters of nations grouped by health outcomes in order to provide sensible groupings for international comparisons. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by comparing life expectancy and a range of health system indicators within and between each cluster. Methods: Age- and sex-specific mortality data for 190 member states were extracted from the Burden of Disease Estimates statistics produced by the World Health Organization. A hierarchical cluster method was used to identify groupings of countries that are homogeneous in terms of mortality rates. Results: 12 clusters of countries were identified. The average life expectancy of each cluster ranged from 81.5 years ( cluster 1) to 37.7 years ( cluster 12). The two highest ranked clusters were dominated by Western European countries, Australia, Japan and Canada. Cluster 3 included the UK and USA. The four clusters with the lowest life expectancies were characterised by different configurations of African countries. Health system indicators for workforce, hospital beds, access to medicines and measles vaccination corresponded well with a clear association with cluster life expectancy. On a per capita basis, worldwide health spending was concentrated within the three highest life expectancy clusters, especially cluster 3 containing the USA. Conclusions: Considerable inequalities in life expectancy and healthcare are made clearer when viewed across clusters of countries grouped by health outcomes. This geo-demographic taxonomy of global mortality has advantages over traditional more ad hoc systems for comparing global health inequalities and for deciding which countries appear to have the most comparable health outcomes.

Much of this interest has been tied to efforts to draw up national and international plans to deal with a global pandemic. It is common for these plans to state the importance of drawing upon a well-developed ethics framework and we argue that this framework should reflect the values and insights of feminist relational theory. More specifically, we argue that pandemic planning must be squarely situated in the larger realm of public health and that an ethics framework for public health will be one that recognizes the need to pay particular attention to the vulnerability of subpopulations lacking in social and economic power. We propose an ethics framework for public health that builds on the notions of relational personhood (including relational autonomy and social justice) and relational solidarity. In this way, we aim for a public health ethics that, as appropriate, promotes the public interest and the common good.

It reviews the inadequacies with the current standards of individual informed consent and research ethics committee review, and then, shows how a broader population-based public health perspective raises new demands on justice involving due consideration of the rights, harms and benefits to the community as a whole. As developed here, an ethical standard that requires community oversight of health research is justified on three principled grounds: respect for community autonomy and their right to self-determination; due consideration of the consequences of the research for the community as a whole; and, a more complete understanding of human autonomy. The paper concludes with practical recommendations regarding the composition of Community Advisory Boards to ensure that they have legitimate decision-making authority in diverse socio-cultural contexts.

Treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in Tomsk, Russia: a retrospective cohort study	LANCET			English	Article							SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; THERAPY; PRISON; LIMA	Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains that cause untreatable drug-resistant disease are a threat worldwide. We describe the treatment, management, and outcomes of patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in Tomsk, Russia. Methods We undertook a retrospective cohort study of 608 patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis who had treatment in civilian or prison services, between Sept 10, 2000, and Nov 1, 2004, according to the treatment strategy recommended by WHO. Clinical characteristics, management practices, and treatment outcomes of patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis and non-extensively drug-resistant (non-XDR) tuberculosis are described. The main outcome was the frequency of poor and favourable outcomes at the end of treatment. Findings Of 608 patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis, 29 (4.8%) patients had baseline XDR tuberculosis. Treatment failure was more common in patients with XDR tuberculosis than in those with non-XDR tuberculosis (31% vs 8.5%, p=0.0008). 48.3% of patients with XDR tuberculosis and 66.7% of patients with non-XDR tuberculosis had treatment cure or completion (p=0.04). The frequency and management of adverse events did not differ between patients with XDR and non-XDR tuberculosis. Interpretation The chronic features of tuberculosis in these patients suggest that extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis may be acquired through previous treatments that include second-line drugs. Aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

National and Global Agendas on Violence Against Women: Historical Perspective and Consensus	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPSYCHIATRY			English	Article						violence against women; rape; domestic violence; women's health policy; women's health research agendas	DIALOGUE	A policy analysis of 11 national and global institutions' violence against women agendas spanning 1990 to 2006 is presented. Analysis revealed 85 distinct recommendations. The highest percentages of them referenced prevention (29%); data, design, and measurement (21%); and psychotherapy and support (19%). Consensus (percentage of recommendations for future activities included in four or more agendas) was highest for advocacy (75%), funding (50%), prevention (48%), and data, design, and measurement (44%). Changes in emphasis over time, aims that have been abandoned, and observations contrasting U.S. and global agendas are also examined. The results create a context to inform the agendas currently in development within psychology, criminal justice, medicine, nursing, public health, and other disciplines. Next steps to guide future policy work include investigation of advocates', practitioners', researchers', and policymakers' perceived progress in implementing existing recommendations. empirical cataloguing of achievements that demonstrate progress toward aims, constituent input on reprioritization of activities, and contemporizing action steps.

Preventing childhood falls at home - Meta-analysis and meta-regression	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PRIMARY-CARE; UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES; SAFETY INTERVENTION; INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL; CHILDREN; POPULATION; BABY	Background: Childhood falls are an important global public health problem, but evidence on their prevention has not been quantitatively synthesized. Despite social inequalities in childhood injury rates, there is a lack of evidence examining the effect of fall-prevention practices by social group. Methods: A systematic review of literature was conducted up to June 2004 and meta-analysis using individual patient data to evaluate the effect of home-safety interventions on fall-prevention practices and fall-injury rates. Meta-regression examined the effect of interventions by child age, gender, and social variables. Included were 21 studies, 13 of which contributed to meta-analyses. Results: Home-safety interventions increased stair-gate use (OR-1.26; 95% CI=1.05, 1.51), and there was some evidence of reduced baby-walker use (OR=0.66; 95% CI=0.43, 1.00), but little evidence of increased possession of window locks, screens, or windows with limited opening (OR=1.16, 95% CI=0.84, 1.59) or of nonslip bath mats or decals (OR=1.15; 95% CI=0.51, 2.62). Two studies reported nonsignificant effects on falls (baby walker-related falls on flat ground [OR=1.35; 95% CI=0.64, 2.83] or down steps or stairs [OR=0.70; 95% CI=0.14, 3.49]) and medically attended falls (OR=0.78; 95% CI=0.61, 1.00). Conclusions: Home-safety education and the provision of safety equipment improved some fall-prevention practices, but the impact on fall-injury rates is unclear. There was some evidence that the effect of home-safety interventions varied by social group.	[Kendrick, Denise; Smith, Sherie J.; Coupland, Carol A.

The embodiment of tourism among bisexually-behaving Dominican male sex workers	ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						migration; male sex work; Caribbean; Dominican Republic; tourism; sexual risk; HIV/AIDS; bisexuality	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; HIV-INFECTION; MIGRANT LABOR; AIDS; RISK; AUTHENTICITY; MIGRATION; PARADISE	While theories of "structure" and social inequality have increasingly informed global health efforts for HIV prevention-with growing recognition of the linkages between large-scale political and economic factors in the distribution and impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic-there is still little theorization of precisely how structural factors shape the very bodies and sexualities of specific populations and groups. In order to extend the theoretical understanding of these macro-micro linkages, this article examines how the growth of the tourism industry in the Dominican Republic has produced sexual practices and identities that reflect both the influence of large-scale structural processes and the resistant responses of local individuals. Drawing on social science theories of political economy, embodiment, and authenticity, I argue that an understanding of patterns of sexuality and HIV risk in the region requires analysis of how political-economic transformations related to tourism intersect with the individual experiences and practices of sexuality on the ground. The analysis draws on long-term ethnographic research with bisexually behaving male sex workers in two cities in the Dominican Republic, including participant observation, in-depth interviews, focus groups, and surveys. By examining the global and local values placed on these men's bodies and the ways sex workers use their bodies to broker tourists' pleasure, we may better understand how the large-scale structures of the tourism industry are linked to the specific meanings and practices of sexuality.

This study aims to explore the influence of political and social context in the achievement of poverty eradication. Methods A retrospective ecological study was carried out to explore associations between progress towards the achievement of Target 1 in 2002 and political and social context variables. The study contained cross-sectional estimates in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2002. The analysis and observation unit was the countries (n = 88). A descriptive analysis was made, as well as simple and multiple analyses with logistic regression. Findings Of the 88 countries studied, 71 (80.7%) are not on track to achieving the target of eradicating poverty. The factor most associated with non-attainment of this goal was reduced government consumption per capita (odds ratio, OR: 13.8; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.92-65.26). In the multiple regression analysis, the most significant factors are: reduced government consumption per capita (OR: 9.8; 95% CI: 1.82-52.75), losses in the balance between imports and exports (OR: 5,3; 95% CI: 1.32-21.54) and more inequality in family income (OR: 4.7; 95% CI: 1.12-20.01). Conclusion Progress towards achievement of Target 1 seems to be hindered, fundamentally, by the significant reduction in government consumption in certain countries and the absence of redistribution policies. To understand the political determinants of poverty, more attention must be paid to the national and international political milieu, which seem to have a relevant impact on this problem and hence on population health.

J	Kjellstrom, T; Mercado, S				Kjellstrom, Tord; Mercado, Susan			Towards action on social determinants for health equity in urban settings	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION			English	Review						climate; disease control; economics; environment; equity; food; governance; health services; housing; slums; social determinants; urban health; urbanization	VIOLENCE; VULNERABILITY; INSECURITY; COMMUNITY; DISEASES; WOMEN; CITY	More than half of the global population now live in urban settings. Urbanization can and should be beneficial for health. In general, nations with high life expectancies and low infant mortality rates are those where city governments address the key social determinants of health. Better housing and living conditions, access to safe water and good sanitation, efficient waste management systems, safer working environments and neighbourhoods, food security and access to services such as education, health, welfare, public transportation and child care are examples of social determinants of health that can be addressed through good urban governance. Failure of governance in today's cities has resulted in the growth of informal settlements and slums that constitute unhealthy living and working environments for one billion people. A credible health agenda is one that benefits all people in cities, especially the urban poor who live in informal settlements. International agreements calling for urgent action to reduce poverty, such as the Millennium Development Goals, can only be met through national strategies that include both urban and rural commitments and involve local governments and the poor themselves. Health inequalities in urban areas need to be addressed in countries at all income levels. Urban development and town planning are key to creating supportive social and physical environments for health and health equity. Achieving healthy urbanization in all countries is a shared global responsibility. Eliminating deprived urban living conditions will require resources - aid, loans, private investments - from more affluent countries in the order of US$ 200 billion per year, no more than 20 per cent of the annual increase in GDP in high-income countries. Creating global political support for a sustained and well-funded effort for social, economic and health equity is one of the greatest challenges of this generation.

The MOBILE programme has been investigating these issues in relation to primary total hip and knee joint replacements, using mixed methods research. There have been five main strands: (1) Epidemiological investigations to find out who is receiving total hip and knee replacements in the National Health Service (NHS). This has shown that there are extensive variations in different regions of the UK, with inequalities and probable inequities in the provision of these operations; (2) Epidemiological work to ascertain the population-based needs for the operations, showing under-provision of knee joint replacements, and a relative reluctance of both patients and GPs to consider knee surgery; (3) Quantitative and qualitative research into the views of patients, health care professionals and the public on the indications for, and prioritization of, total hip and knee joint replacements. This has shown lack of agreement within or between professional groups, as well as a mismatch between the views of patients and the public, and those of professionals; (4) Theoretical and experimental work on patient-related outcome measures, and the development of new instruments to assess both pain and function in people with osteoarthritis, based on the International Classification of Function, as well as a new integrated model of function; (5) Cohort studies of patients undergoing hip or knee joint replacements to find out what the determinants of good and bad outcomes are. These studies have emphasized the huge variation in disease severity at the time of surgery. The challenge now is to use and implement our findings for maximum patient benefit.

Global Health Priorities for Developing Countries: Some Equity and Ethical Considerations	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						health quality outcomes	COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; DEAF-CHILDREN; RESCUE; RULE; CARE	Although the need to make health priorities equitable in addressing health disparities among populations of the world is widely acknowledged, there are presently no clear-cut mechanisms for achieving this goal at the global level. This paper highlights some of the limitations associated with priority setting based exclusively on the interplay of burden of disease and cost-effectiveness analysis, and identifies occasions when equity considerations may favor conditions lacking immediate evidence on cost-effectiveness but associated with substantial burden in individuals and the society and for which optimal interventions are time bound. It also highlights the implications of overlooking conditions and issues that are deserving of high-priority status by global health actors and are in the longer-term interest of donor recipients. It concludes by exploring how representative mechanisms for societal preferences such as the periodic resolutions of the World Health Assembly backed by commitments of national governments provide a framework for making global health priorities more equitable.

The impact of gender and family processes on mental health and substance use issues in a sample of court-involved female and male adolescents	JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE			English	Article						gender; family processes; mental health; substance abuse; juvenile justice	GLOBAL RISK INDICATORS; DRUG-USE; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; JUVENILE JUSTICE; PROBLEM BEHAVIOR; YOUTH; GIRLS; LIVES; PERSPECTIVES; PREDICTORS	Greater empirical attention directed toward gender-sensitive assessment strategies that concentrate on family-specific factors is thought to be both timely and necessary, especially with regard to outcome variables associated with mental health and substance abuse in at-risk adolescent populations. A sample of 2,646 court-involved adolescents was used to test two competing models regarding relationships among disruptive family processes, mental health (as both internalizing and externalizing problems), and substance abuse issues according to gender. The results of multiple group structural equation modeling procedures indicated that disrupted family processes were significantly associated with higher levels of internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and substance abuse in both male and female youth. For females, however, disrupted family processes were more related to internalizing problems and substance abuse than externalizing problems. Further, the relationship between disrupted family processes and substance abuse was not mediated by mental health issues, indicating a lack of support for the alternative model tested in this study. Together, the findings underscore the primacy of the family's impact on issues related to adolescent development and well-being in tandem with the need for a more gender sensitive approach to the needs of court-involved males and females.

Differential item functioning of a family affluence scale: Validation study on data from HBSC 2001/02	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						family affluence scale; differential item functioning; Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC); comparability; validity	SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; ADOLESCENTS; MULTILEVEL; VALIDITY; HEALTH; QUALITY	Methodology for making cross-national comparisons is an area of increasing interest in social and public health related research. When studying socio-economic differences in health outcomes cross-nationally, there are several methodological issues of concern, especially when data is derived from self-reported questionnaires. Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (Currie et al. 1998) is a WHO cross-national study using school samples. HBSC provides comparable data, and thereby a unique opportunity to study associations between social indicators and health outcomes within an international perspective. In 2001/02 data was collected from a total of 162,323 children in 32 countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom, USA.). Studies of social inequalities requires that a comparable measure of socio-economic position (SEP) is in use. HBSC has developed a proxy for social position measuring material wealth, the Family Affluence Scale (FAS). This paper studies FAS and whether it is comparable across population subgroups defined by country, age and gender. Initial analysis revealed that an item measuring perceived family wealth was a valid FAS item. Including this item in the FAS score will improve the reliability of FAS. Graphical log-linear Rasch models (GLLRM) showed that FAS contain differential item functioning (DIF) with respect to country, age, and gender as well as local dependency (LD) between items. During the analysis, test equating techniques where used to adjust for the test bias generated by DIF. We recommend that the equated scores are used whenever FAS is included as a variable. This study suggests that HBSC-FAS should contain five items (additional item: perceived family wealth) when analysing data from HBSC 2001/02, and furthermore that each country should adjust for the DIF or make use of the converted FAS scores provided. If using FAS as a proxy for social position at an international level, it is not advised to compare the absolute levels of FAS, but weigh the scale by ridit transformation.	[Schnohr, C. W.; Due, E.

Discourses of disease, discourses of disadvantage: a critical analysis of National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plans	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						pandemic influenza; preparedness; disadvantaged populations; critical discourse analysis; ethics; health policy	PUBLIC-HEALTH; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; POLICY-ANALYSIS; ETHICS; BIOTERRORISM; MORTALITY; SARS; CARE; LAW	Growing recognition of the threat of pandemic influenza to global health has led to increased emphasis on pandemic influenza preparedness planning. Previous analysis of national pandemic preparedness plans has revealed that those plans paid scant attention to the needs and interests of the disadvantaged. This paper investigates those findings via critical discourse analysis of the same plans as well as World Health Organization guidance documents. The analysis reveals that the texts operate within and as parts of an ordered universe of discourse. Among the six discourses which emerge from the analysis the scientific, political, and legal dominate the social, cultural, and ethical. This order of discourse delineates a specific regime of truths within which the lives, needs, and interests of the disadvantaged are masked or neglected. Unless the plans recognize their discursive construction, implementation of the policies and practices they prescribe runs the risk of further disadvantaging those very populations most likely to require protection.

This paper presents early results from an action research project designed to investigate and prevent mental illness at work. It treats the organization as an open sociotechnical system where mental health is measured by self report and the affects experienced at work. Sick days are also measured. The study finds that the second genotypical, organizational design principle creates enabling conditions for mental health, many of which enablers such as trust and equality have previously been hypothesized as determinants of mental health. But the enablers are themselves consequent to a design principle. The results show how the second design principle creates the jointly optimized sociotechnical system that leads to enablers and positive outcomes, for people and the bottom line. This research reinforces the conclusion from the first study of sociotechnical systems that structure is a determinant of mental health.

Old health challenges remain and new priorities have emerged (eg, HIV/AIDS, chronic diseases, and mental health), ensuring that the tenets of Alma-Ata remain relevant. We examine 30 years of changes in global policy to identify the lessons learned that are of relevance today, particularly for accelerated scale-up of primary health-care services necessary to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, the modern iteration of the "health for all" goals. Health has moved from under-investment, to single disease focus, and now to increased funding and multiple new initiatives. For primary health care, the debate of the past two decades focused on selective (or vertical) versus comprehensive (horizontal) delivery, but is now shifting towards combining the strengths of both approaches in health systems. Debates of Community versus facility-based health care are starting to shift towards building integrated health systems. Achievement of high and equitable coverage of integrated primary health-care services requires consistent political and financial commitment, incremental implementation based on local epidemiology, use of data to direct priorities and assess progress, especially at district level, and effective linkages with communities and non-health sectors. Community participation and intersectoral engagement seem to be the weakest strands in primary health care. Burgeoning task lists for primary health-care workers require long-term human resource planning and better training and supportive supervision. Essential drugs policies have made an important contribution to primary health care, but other appropriate technology lags behind. Revitalisng Alma-Ata and learning from three decades of experience is crucial to reach the ambitious goal of health for all in all countries, both rich and poor.

J	Uehling, GL				Uehling, Greta Lynn			The International Smuggling of Children: Coyotes, Snakeheads, and the Politics of Compassion	ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY			English	Article						migration; immigration; state; children; childhood; politics of compassion; humanitarianism		Each year, over 100,000 children are apprehended entering the United States unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians, and without valid immigration documents. As many as 8,000 of these children are placed in on elaborate System of border patrol detention centers, shelter facilities, and courts. While the Department of Health and Human Services (through the Office of Refugee Resettlement) funds programs that care for the undocumented immigrants, the Department of Justice, (through the Department of Homeland Security) sweeps up and deports the very same children (or their parents). Apprehended children therefore bring to light the competing agendas of security and humanitarianism. Based on interviews with policy makers and program officers, visits to the shelters, and interviews with the children, this article explores the politics of compassion surrounding these migrants. In order to provide more humane and egalitarian response to the migration, the tensions and contradictions inherent in current practices need to be mode more conscious. Considering migration from Mexico, Central America, China, and India, the paper challenges the racially and ethnically-coded system that protects some children more than others. Rather than dismantling the politics of compassion, what is needed is a clearer understanding of the children's paths to the United States, and a system without the racial and ethic hierarchies that are currently in place.

J	Igene, H				Igene, Helen			Global health inequalities and breast cancer: An impending public health problem for developing countries	BREAST JOURNAL			English	Article						breast cancer; developed and developing countries; health inequalities; incidence; mortality	AFRICA	The aim of the study was to provide information on the global health inequality pattern produced by the increasing incidence of breast cancer and its relationship with the health expenditure of developing countries with emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa. It examines the difference between the health expenditure of developed and developing countries, and how this affects breast cancer incidence and mortality. The data collected from the World Health Organization and World Bank were examined, using bivariate analysis, through scatter-plots and Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient. Multivariate analysis was carried out by multiple regression analysis. National income, health expenditure affects breast cancer incidence, particularly between the developed and developing countries. However, these factors do not adequately explain variations in mortality rates. The study reveals the risk posed to developing countries to solving the present and predicted burden of breast cancer, currently characterized by late presentation, inadequate health care systems, and high mortality. Findings from this study contribute to the knowledge of the burden of disease in developing countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa, and how that is related to globalization and health inequalities.

CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY			English	Article						consumption; exchange rate; global imbalances; savings; social spending		Our study shows that China could contribute to an orderly global rebalancing using a package of policies to stimulate its domestic consumption. These policies include a progressive appreciation of the RMB, fiscal stimulation by increasing expenditure on education, health care, social safety nets and poverty reduction, income policies to reduce inequality and to strengthen wage income, and reforms of the financial system to improve financial efficiency and to mitigate financial constraints. By implementing such policies, China's external surplus could be narrowed and its domestic imbalances improved. The excessively high savings rate could be lowered and the share of household consumption increased, even though GDP growth would moderate slightly.				hong@un.org; vos@un.org; yaok@un.org	Vos, Rob/AAT-1514-2020						31	3	3	1	6	WILEY-BLACKWELL	MALDEN	COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA	1671-2234			CHINA WORLD ECON	China World Econ.

In this article, I apply insights derived from practice theory and critical psychological anthropology to the ethnographic example of a substance abuse program on a Northern Plains reservation. This analysis suggests that by attending to how addiction and its psychotherapeutic transformation are represented in various community and institutional discourses impacting local services, ethnographers can accomplish two vital tasks: (1) documenting social, cultural, and psychological diversity within contemporary Native American communities, and (2) illuminating forces that undermine recognition of this diversity by federally funded mental health services. These forces include the often subtle but persistent power inequalities in relationships between local communities and federal health agencies.

For public purchasing agencies. these reforms often consisted in contracting external providers for primary care provision. This paper intends to clarify both the complex and intertwined issues characterizing Such contracting as well as health system performances within the context of four Central American countries. It results from a European Commission financed project lead between 2002 and 2005, involving participants from Costa Rica, Guatemala. Nicaragua, Salvador, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Belgium, whose aim was to promote exchanges between these participants. The findings presented in this paper are the results of a two stage process: (a) the design of an initial analytical framework, built upon findings from the literature. interlinking characteristics of contractual relation with health systems performances criteria and (b) the use of that framework in four case studies to identify cross-cutting issues. This paper reinforces two pivotal findings: (a) contracting requires not only technical, but also political choices and (b) it cannot be considered as a mechanical process. The unpredictability of its evolution requires a flexible and reactive approach. This should be better assimilated by national and international organizations involved in health services provision, so as to progressively come out of dogmatic approaches in deciding to initiate contractual relation with external providers for primary care provision.

A case study of exercise referral schemes in England	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY PROMOTION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; POLICY; INEQUALITIES; STRATEGIES; CARE	Political decisions about the way that public health initiatives are implemented have a significant impact on the ability to evaluate their effectiveness. However, the influence of the political imperative has been little explored. This case study of key research, policy and practice events concerning one initiative, exercise referral schemes (ERSs), demonstrates that these schemes were encouraged to expand by the Department of Health (DH) before DH-funded evaluations had reported their findings and with little reference to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommendations. Policy evolved in parallel rather than in conjunction with the development of evidence, and experimental evaluations in England are now unlikely. This is due to the comprehensive coverage of schemes, widespread assumptions of effectiveness, likely difficulties in obtaining research funding, indirect adverse consequences of dismantling schemes and lack of appropriate process and outcome data. Embedding a commitment to robust evaluation prior to universal adoption of new initiatives has been shown to be feasible by policy-makers in the international setting. This is required to prevent the establishment of public health interventions that do not work and may cause harm or widen health inequalities.	[Sowden, S.

J	Cruz, ERB; Perea, RSS				Borroto Cruz, Eugenio Radames; Salas Perea, Ramon Syr			National Training Program for Comprehensive Community Physicians, Venezuela	MEDICC REVIEW			English	Article						medical education; human resources for health; community-based medical education; primary care; health equity; Venezuela		Introduction Through the 1990s, wide disparities in health status were recorded in Venezuela, a mirror of poor social conditions, decreasing investment in the public health sector and a health workforce distribution unable to meet population health needs or to staff effective, accessible public health services. Venezuelans' health status deteriorated as a result. In 2003-2004, the Venezuelan government launched Barrio Adentro, a new national public health model aimed at assuring primary health care coverage for the entire population of an estimated 26 million. Cuban physicians staff Barrio Adentro clinics, mainly in poor neighborhoods, until enough Venezuelan physicians can be trained to fill the posts. Intervention Cuban experience with community-oriented medical education and global health cooperation was drawn upon to develop curriculum and provide faculty for the new National Training Program for Comprehensive Community Physicians, begun in 2005 in cooperation with six Venezuelan universities. The program differs from previous Venezuelan medical education models by adopting a stated goal of training physicians for public service, recruiting students who had no previous opportunity for university-level education, and concentrating the weight of their training on a service- and community-based model of education, relying on practicing physician-tutors. Results Over 20,000 students have been enrolled in three years. The six-year program has been extended to all 24 Venezuelan states, relying mainly on Cuban faculty who are practicing Barrio Adentro doctors and who receive postgraduate training in medical education. This "university without walls" has accredited 5,131 Barrio Adentro clinics as teaching institutions; its infrastructure includes other health care delivery facilities plus 855 multipurpose classrooms throughout the country. For the 2006-2007 academic year, the pass rate was 82% for first-year students and 94% for second-year students. Some difficulties persist in student selection, pre-medical preparation, and achieving optimum use of existing resources. Academic, institutional, and external evaluations are ongoing. Conclusion This is the most ambitious example of scaling up of physician training in a single country. The program has been made possible by considerable political will from the Venezuelan and Cuban governments; by the experience acquired through development of the Cuban health system and medical education programs; by the individual commitment of Cuban curriculum developers and physician-tutors; and by ever-more-organized Venezuelan communities. The size of the undertaking, coupled with significant innovations in curriculum, present challenges. The Venezuelan experience emphasis on training physicians for a revitalized public health sector, accompanied by a paradigm shift in primary care warrants attention from the international community in the context of the global shortage of health workers and efforts to achieve a more equitable distribution of health services worldwide.

J	Dorius, SF				Dorius, Shawn F.			Global demographic convergence? A reconsideration of changing intercountry inequality in fertility	POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW			English	Article							LIFE-SPAN REVOLUTION; WORLD; INCOME; STATE	This research challenges the notion that the second half of the twentieth century was a period of global demographic convergence. To be sure, fertility rates fell substantially during the period, but with considerable un-evenness. The declines in total fertility across population-weighted countries were sufficiently disproportionate that intercountry fertility inequality, estimated using standard measures of inequality, did not begin to decline until at least 1995. Regression analysis also shows that only very recently did lagging countries begin to catch up with countries that began the transition to low fertility earlier. Contrary to findings on changing intercountry health inequality, sub-Saharan Africa has had a greater impact on changes in fertility inequality than China. The trend in fertility inequality, where convergence is a relatively new phenomenon, stands in contrast to trends in inequality in other domains, such as income, education, and health.

PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Mental health; Public health; Health policy; Mental illness; Institutions; Prisons	PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY; HUMAN-RIGHTS; HEALTH; PRISONERS; COMMUNITY; PREVALENCE; EXPERIENCE; CONVENTION; DISORDER; RELEASE	Despite countless promises for a better life by national commissions, governments and the international community, there has evolved a vicious cycle of neglect, abandonment, indignity, cruet and inhuman treatment, and punishment of persons with mental illness. This shameful history of benign, and sometimes malignant, neglect of persons with mental illness is well understood, with the deep stigma and unredressed discrimination, the deplorable living conditions, and the physical and social barriers preventing their integration and full participation in society. The maltreatment of this vulnerable population has been reinforced by the hurtful stereotypes of incompetency and dangerousness. The belief that persons with mental illness are uniformly dangerous is an equally harmful myth. It provides policy makers with an ostensible justification to exercise control over persons with mental illness, even if they have not committed a violent offence. However, research demonstrates that the class of persons with most mental illnesses is no more dangerous than other populations, and that the vast majority of violence is committed by persons without mental illness. This article will show how this vulnerable population has been unconscionably treated. First, the gross violations of human rights that have occurred, and continue to occur, in 'old' psychiatric institutions will be examined. The deinstitutionalization movement, however, resulted in new places of confinement for this population, such as jails, prisons and homeless shelters. The second part of this paper will explore the new realities of criminal confinement of persons with mental illness. As we will see, incarceration of this vulnerable population in the criminal justice system has caused enormous suffering. If Dostoyevsky was correct that the 'degree of civilization... can be judged by entering its prisons', then by that measure, we are a deeply uncivilized society.

The hypotheses state that pesticide and fertilizer use intensity in less-developed countries are both positively associated with foreign investment dependence in the primary sector. The use of such inputs in agriculture production is known to contribute to a variety of human health and environmental problems. Findings for random effects and static score panel regression analyses of 35 less-developed countries confirm the hypotheses, and point to the sociological relevance in assessing the potential social and environmental impacts of both the transnational organization and the relative scale of production in different sectors.

It situates ethical concerns with medical research within the everyday life of scientific fieldwork. Based upon discussions with volunteers and staff, we explore processes of mediation between scientific project and study population, and between formal ethics, local ethical debates and everyday practice. We observe that material contact and substantial transactions, notably of blood and medicine, are central to the construction of the MVT. These transactions are guided by a concrete and relational form of ethics, which contrasts with the abstract and vertical formal ethical principles underwriting the scientific study protocol. The success of the MVT owed much to these kinshiplike ethics. One possible conclusion from these observations is that research ethics should be understood, not just as a quasi-legal frame but also as an open, searching movement, much in the same way that kinship is not merely a juridical institution and a prescriptive frame of rules. but a network made through relational work. However, this conclusion raises new problems: by contrasting formal, abstract principles to intimate, immediate relations, and economic justice to personal morality, we accept that the order of medical research is moved further out of the public and political, and into the domains of either quasi-legal claims or of private morality. Irrespective of the undeniable importance of clear-cut rules and of good face-to-face relations, a third essential foundation of medical research ethics is the democratically constituted public sphere, including equitable health services, and transparent institutions to facilitate open debate and regulate particular interests. Ultimately, the ethics of global science call rely neither on principles nor trust but requires citizenship and democratic government. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Geissler, P.

The persistent problem of malaria: Addressing the fundamental causes of a global killer	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						malaria; poverty; developing countries; environment; political economy	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FALCIPARUM-MALARIA; HEALTH-RISKS; TRANSMISSION; POPULATION; MORTALITY; AFRICA; DDT; RESURGENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Despite decades of global eradication and control efforts and explosive global economic development, malaria is the most important vector-borne disease of our day, killing more people today than 40 years ago and affecting millions worldwide, particularly poor residents of tropical regions. Global eradication efforts from the 19505 through the 1980s largely failed, leaving vector and parasite resistance in their wake. The persistence of malaria and the magnitude of its effects call for an action paradigm that links the traditional proximal arenas of intervention with malaria's fundamental causes by addressing the environmental, economic, and political dimensions of risk. We explore the more distal determinants of malaria burden that create underlying vulnerabilities, evaluating malaria risk as a function of socioeconomic context, environmental conditions, global inequality, systems of health care provision, and research.

Gastroschisis: International epidemiology and public health perspectives	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART C-SEMINARS IN MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article						gastroschisis; omphalocele; body wall defects; birth prevalence; increasing trend; low maternal age; teenage; pandemic	ABDOMINAL-WALL DEFECTS; INCREASING PREVALENCE; BIRTH-DEFECTS; UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTOR; CONGENITAL-ANOMALIES; MATERNAL AGE; OMPHALOCELE; POPULATION; ASSOCIATION	Gastroschisis offers the intriguing epidemiological situation of a pandemic, strongly associated with very low maternal age. Identifying gastroschisis, and distinguishing it from the other abdominal wall defects, is theoretically easy but difficult in practice. The baseline birth prevalence of gastroschisis before the pandemic was approximately 1 in 50,000 births and has increased since between 10- and 20-fold. In many populations worldwide, it is still increasing. Such increasing prevalence and the association with very low maternal age are well proven, but the interaction between these two findings remains unknown. Geographic gradients (decreasing prevalence from North to South) are clear in Continental Europe and suggestive in Britain and Ireland. Gastroschisis seems more frequent in Caucasians compared to African Blacks and Orientals, and in Northern compared to Southern Europeans. These observations indicate the need for investigating gene-environment interactions. Since the global human situation is marked by inequalities among as well as within countries, the medical care and public health impact of gastroschisis varies widely among regions and social strata. The postnatal benefits of prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis include family awareness; adequate planning of delivery with alerted obstetrical, pediatric, and surgical staff, optimal risk categorization, and personalized protocol for action. The increasing prevalence of gastroschisis combined with improved medical techniques to reduce morbidity and mortality are also increasing the burden and costs of this anomaly on health systems.

Few predicted its effect on mortality and morbidity or its devastating social and economic consequences, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Successful responses have addressed sensitive social factors surrounding HIV prevention, such as sexual behaviour, drug use, and gender equalities, countered stigma and discrimination, and mobilised affected communities; but such responses have been few and far between. Only in recent years has the international response to HIV prevention gathered momentum, mainly due to the availability of treatment with antiretroviral drugs, the recognition that the pandemic has both development and security implications, and a substantial increase in financial resources brought about by new funders and funding mechanisms. We now require an urgent and revitalised global movement for HIV prevention that supports a combination of behavioural, structural, and biomedical approaches and is based on scientifically derived evidence and the wisdom and ownership of communities.

Public policy and the market for dental services	COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						health policy; health services accessibility; oral health	ORAL-HEALTH; CARE; EXPENDITURES; BARRIERS; FUTURE; VISITS; IMPACT; NEEDS	Social inequality in access to oral health care is a feature of countries with predominantly privately funded markets for dental services. Private markets for health care have inherent inefficiencies whereby sick and poor people have restricted access compared to their healthy and more affluent compatriots. In the future, access to dental care may worsen as trends in demography, disease and development come to bear on national oral healthcare systems. However, increasing public subsidies for the poor may not increase their access unless availability issues are resolved. Further, increasing public funding runs counter to policies that feature less government involvement in the economy, tax policy on private insurance premiums, tax reductions and, in some instances, free-trade agreements. We discuss these issues and provide international examples to illustrate the consequences of the differing public policies in oral health care. Subsidization of the poor by inclusion of dental care in social health insurance models appears to offer the most potential for equitable access. We further suggest that nations need to develop national systems capable of the surveillance of disease and human resources, and of the monitoring of appropriateness and efficiency of their oral healthcare delivery systems.

DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						global bioethics; culture; universalism; relativism; justice; biopolitics; biodemocracy	HEALTH; RIGHTS	This article discusses what 'global bioethics' means today and what features make bioethical research 'global'. The article provides a historical view of the development of the field of 'bioethics', from medical ethics to the wider study of bioethics in a global context. It critically examines the particular problems that 'global bioethics' research faces across cultural and political borders and suggests some solutions on how to move towards a more balanced and culturally less biased dialogue in the issues of bioethics. The main thesis is that we need to bring global and local aspects closer together, when looking for international guidelines, by paying more attention to particular cultures and local economic and social circumstances in reaching a shared understanding of the main values and principles of bioethics, and in building 'biodemocracy'.

First, it briefly outlines the likely impact of pharmacogenetics on pharmaceutical research and clinical practice within the next five to ten years and then explores the link between pharmacogenetic traits and 'race'. It is shown that any link between apparent race and pharmacogenetics is problematic and that race cannot be used as a proxy for pharmacogenetic knowledge. The final section considers the implications of the development of pharmacogenetics for health care systems in low- and middle-income countries.

J	Tolchin, B				Tolchin, Benjamin			Human rights and the requirement for international medical aid	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						bioethics; developing world; distributive justice; ethics; international justice; rights; moral obligation		Every year approximately 18 million people die prematurely from treatable medical conditions including infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies. The deaths occur primarily amongst the poorest citizens of poor developing nations. Various groups and individuals have advanced plans for major international medical aid to avert many of these unnecessary deaths. For example, the World Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health estimated that eight million premature deaths could be prevented annually by interventions costing roughly US$57 bn per year. This essay advances an argument that human rights require high-income nations to provide such aid. The essay briefly examines John Rawls' obligations of justice and the reasons that their applicability to cases of international medical aid remains controversial. Regardless, the essay argues that purely humanitarian obligations bind the governments and citizens of high-income liberal democracies at a minimum to provide major medical aid to avert premature deaths in poor nations. In refusing to undertake such medical relief efforts, developed nations fail to adequately protect a fundamental human right to life.

J	Bacchi, C				Bacchi, Carol			The politics of research management: Reflections on the gap between what we 'know' (about SDH) and what we do	HEALTH SOCIOLOGY REVIEW			English	Article						Social determinants of health; research utilisation; health services research; governance; knowledge production; priority setting; sociology	EVIDENCE BASED POLICY; HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; CARE	Health researchers in a number of settings are expressing concern about the 'gap' between what we 'know' about the social determinants of health and of health inequalities, and the lack of action based upon this 'knowledge'. Indeed, the 'know-do gap' h as become almost a mantra echoed across international and some national institutional sites. This paper examines how the 'problem' of the 'gap' is understood and represented in dominant and sub-dominant conceptualisations. It highlights what is missing from these representations: adequate reflection on changing modes of governance of research management. Where once there was a degree of separation between research production and government policy, increasingly there is congruence between these governmental functions. This congruence means that the problem we face today is not a 'gap' but rather a 'fit' between what we 'know' and what we (don't) do regarding SDH.

J	Breilh, J				Breilh, Jaime			Latin American critical ('social') epidemiology: new settings for an old dream	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						critical epidemiology; social epidemiology; health science epistemology; collective health; Latin American		Background Epidemiologys role as the diagnostic arm of public health has submitted epidemiological reasoning and practice to the crossfire of oppositional social values and demands. In Latin America, the visible signs of extreme social and political authoritarianism and inequity, as well as the growing unfairness of the World economy, inspired a culture of social critique and a corresponding academic reform movement, which nurtured a profound social awareness among health scientists. Aims The authors aim is to call attention to the need to overcome this scientific North/South divide. An imperative, at a moment when the demolition of health standards under the pressures of global economic acceleration and unhealthy health policies, confront us all with the common challenge of cross-fertilizing the strengths of academic traditions from both South and North. Methods The present paper offers a fresh perspective from the South about the relevance of progressive Latin American public health (termed collective health) by highlighting a number of its hard scientific contributions which, unfortunately, remain almost unknown to mainstream medical and public health researchers outside Latin America. Results An armed form of structural greed has now placed the world on the brink of destruction. At the same time, however, fresh winds blow in the continent. Conclusion This paper is an invitation to confront the menacing forces producing our unhealthy societies and an opportunity to form fraternal partnerships on the intercultural road to a better world, where only an epidemiology of dignity and happiness will make sense.				jbreilh@uasb.edu.ec							44	65	80	0	6	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	0300-5771	1464-3685		INT J EPIDEMIOL	Int.

Little is known about the social factors associated with disabling pain. The objective was to determine the individual and neighbourhood social factors that predict pain that interferes with daily activities. This was a prospective cohort study set within the North Staffordshire Osteoarthritis Project (NorStOP). People aged 50 and over registered with six general practices were sent baseline and 3-year questionnaires. Individual predictors of the onset of pain interference were determined through multilevel modelling. Neighbourhood impact was examined using measures of deprivation taken from the UK Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004. 19% of the 3644 people without pain interference at baseline reported it at follow-up. Baseline social factors were weaker predictors than baseline age, multiple-site pain and anxiety or depression. However, perceived financial strain was a significant predictor (OR 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2, 1.8). Onset of pain interference varied by local area deprivation status. Those living in areas of high health deprivation had an increased risk of developing pain interference (OR 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.3). Whilst the onset of pain which disrupts daily life is influenced mainly by the characteristics of the pain and by the psychological factors. there are links with the social factors. particularly individual measures of perceived income adequacy. The onset of disabling pain is also influenced by the place where one lives. Policies to prevent disabling pain need to consider the contribution of neighbourhood deprivation and income inequalities to the extent of the problem.

Methods We conducted inductive analysis of semi-structured interviews with key informants from a purposive sample of 23 national and international funding agencies that fund health research in Brazil, Colombia, India, the Philippines, South Africa and Thailand. We also surveyed web sites. Findings We found a commitment to knowledge translation in the mandate of 18 of 23 agencies. However, there was a lack of common terminology. Most of the activities were traditional efforts to disseminate to a broad audience, for example using web sites and publications, In addition, more than half (13 of 23) of the agencies encouraged linkage/exchange between researchers and potential users, and 6 of 23 agencies described "pull" activities to-generate interest in research from decision-makers. One-third (9 of 23) of funding agencies described a mandate to enhance health equity through improving knowledge translation. Only 3 of 23 agencies were able to describe evaluation of knowledge translation activities. Furthermore, we found national funding agencies made greater knowledge translation efforts when compared to international agencies. Conclusion Funding agencies are engaged in a wide range of creative knowledge translation activities. They might consider their role as knowledge brokers, with an ability to promote research syntheses and a focus on health equity. There is an urgent need to evaluate the knowledge translation activities of funding agencies.

J	Bognar, G				Bognar, Greg			AGE-WEIGHTING	ECONOMICS AND PHILOSOPHY			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; PREFERENCES; PROGRAMS; LIFE	Some empirical findings seem to show that people value health benefits differently depending on the age of the beneficiary. Health economists and philosophers have offered justifications for these preferences on grounds of both efficiency and equity. In this paper, I examine the most prominent examples of both sorts of justification: the defence of age-weighting in the WHO's global burden of disease studies and the fair innings argument. I argue that neither sort of justification has been worked out in satisfactory form: age should not be taken into account in the framework of the burden of disease measure, and on the most promising formulations of the fair innings argument, it turns out to be merely an indicator of some other factor. I conclude by describing the role of age in theories of justice of healthcare resource allocation.

It has been argued that economic downturn leads to a higher propensity for protectionism. We find for seven Latin American countries in the second half of the 20th century that declining GDP motivated the opening wave, especially during the 1980s. Moreover, inequality could play a role, either in favor of "opening", as Stolper-Samuelson models would predict, or in favor of closing, as recent empirical studies found that open periods were associated with higher inequality. Using anthropometric indicators, we find that inequality in general tended to motivate "closing", whereas inequality did not stimulate opening. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To date, around half of the population is covered with some type of health insurance or prepayment. This review applies a conceptual framework of health financing to provide a coherent assessment of the reforms to date with respect to a set of key policy objectives of health financing, including financial sustainability, efficiency in service provision, and equity in health financing. Based on the assessment, the review discusses the main implications of the reforms focusing on achievements and remaining challenges, the nature of the Vietnamese reforms in an international perspective, and the role of the government. The main lessons from the Vietnamese experiences, from which other reforming countries may draw, are the need for sustained resource mobilization, comprehensive reform involving all functions of the health financing system, and to adopt a long-term view of health insurance reform. Future analysis should include continued evaluation of the reforms in terms of impacts on key outcomes and the political dimensions of health reform.

In this case study, a Uruguayan partner organisation, Iniciativas Sanitarias, adapts this rights-based framework for local application, creating the harm reduction approach. Based on the rights to information, health and women's autonomy, Iniciativas Sanitarias seeks to empower women and strengthen the commitment of health professionals to provide safer abortion information and services based on the bioethical principles of autonomy, justice and patient-provider confidentiality. The increase in service utilisation has proven the practicality and viability of this framework, and is providing the basis for working towards a national health system model that will promote social and human development through the public policies needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

J	Kim, P; Miranda, T; Olaciregui, C				Kim, Paul; Miranda, Talia; Olaciregui, Claudia			Pocket School: Exploring mobile technology as a sustainable literacy education option for underserved indigenous children in Latin America	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Latin America; mobile learning; Pocket School; literacy education; indigenous children; underserved population		Literacy is a human right unequally distributed among the world's population. Despite global efforts to fight illiteracy, high illiteracy rates continue to jeopardize access for many to basic schooling, life-long learning, health, and environment safety. Illiteracy also hinders the economic prosperity of the poorest societies in this digital age. Among the underserved population in Latin America, many of the indigenous children are the poorest of the poor who hardly have access to formal and stable schooling. This paper reviews the literature addressing education inequality issues in Latin America and possible opportunities with mobile learning technology to counter the effects of the education inequality. Also, this paper suggests mobile technology design considerations to meet the particular learning needs of the extremely underserved and underachieving indigenous children in Latin America.

Examining the impact of gender, race/ethnicity, and family factors on mental health issues in a sample of court-involved youth	JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY			English	Article							GLOBAL RISK INDICATORS; GROWING-UP FAST; SERIOUS JUVENILE-OFFENDERS; DELINQUENCY; ADOLESCENTS; PERSPECTIVES; BEHAVIOR; JUSTICE; DIFFERENTIATION; ASSOCIATION	Faced with anywhere between one half and two thirds of its youth having a diagnosable mental illness, the identification and treatment of mental health concerns is a critically important endeavor for professionals working with youth who have contact with the juvenile justice system. In addition, the literature suggests that factors related to both the family and to the gender of the adolescent must be incorporated into any approach to assessment and intervention within this special population. Further, prior work that has documented the interaction of gender and family issues with adolescent race/ethnicity warrants further empirical attention, as does the intermediary role that the family may play in the development of both internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The present study extends this literature by examining factors related to gender, race/ethnicity, family factors, and mental health issues in a sample of 2,549 Caucasian and African American youth coming to the attention of juvenile courts. Multivariate analysis of variance results indicated significant main effects for gender and race/ethnicity, as well as a significant gender X race/ethnicity interaction for the family and externalizing variables. A multiple group structural equation modeling procedure was employed in order to test the hypothesis that family environment mediates the relationship between gender and mental health problems, as well as to test for potential differences in these relationships as a function of race/ethnicity. Results indicated support for the mediation model in the sample of African American youth but not in the sample of Caucasian youth.

Should ethics consultants help clinicians face scarcity in their practice?	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; PHYSICIANS; BEDSIDE; COST; EXPERIENCES	In an international survey of rationing we have found that European physicians encounter scarcity-related ethical difficulties, and are dissatified with the resolution of many of these cases. Here we further examine survey results to explore whether ethics support services would be potentially useful in addressing scarcity related ethical dilemmas. Results indicate that while the type of help offered by ethics support services was considered helpful by physicians, they rarely referred difficulties regarding scarcity to ethics consultation. We propose that ethics consultants could assist physicians by making the process less difficult, and by contributing to decisions being more ethically justifiable. Expertise in bringing considerations of justice to bear on real cases could also be useful in recognising an unjust limit, as opposed to a merely frustrating limit. Though these situations are unlikely to be among the most frequently referred to ethics support services, ethics consultants should be prepared to address them.

Race, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in CKD in the United States	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY			English	Review							CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; HEALTH-CARE DISPARITIES; 3RD NATIONAL-HEALTH; RACIAL-DIFFERENCES; ETHNIC DISPARITIES; VITAMIN-D; RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a national public health problem beset by inequities in incidence, prevalence, and complications across gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. As health care providers, we can directly address some factors crucial for closing the disparities gap. Other factors are seemingly beyond our reach, entrenched within the fabric of our society, such as social injustice and human indifference. Paradoxically, the existence of health inequities provides unique, unrecognized opportunities for understanding biologic, environmental, sociocultural, and health care system factors that can lead to improved clinical outcomes. Several recent reports documented that structured medical care systems can reduce many CKD-related disparities and improve patient outcomes. Can the moral imperative to eliminate CKD inequities inspire the nephrology community not only to advocate for but also to demand high-quality, structured health care delivery systems for all Americans in the context of social reform that improves the ecology, health, and well-being of our communities? If so, then perhaps we can eliminate the unacceptable premature morbidity and mortality associated with CKD and the tragedy of health inequities. By so doing, we could become global leaders not only in medical technology, as we currently are, but also in health promotion and disease prevention, truly leaving no patient behind.

We draw on data from two empirical studies to illustrate our argument. The first study explored the value of nursing globally, the second investigated the experiences of overseas trained nurses recruited to work in a migrant capacity in the UK health care workforce. The indications are that nurses perceive themselves as devalued socially, and that other health care professionals do not give nursing the same status as other, socially more prestigious professions, such as medicine. Organizational and management structures within the NHS and the independent care home sector devalue overseas nurses and the contribution they make to health care. Our conclusions lead us to question the accepted sociocultural value of the global nursing workforce and its perceived contribution to global health care, and to consider two ethical frameworks from which these issues could be discussed further.

This study uses conventional quantitative environmental justice methodology to investigate spatial relationships between residential socio-demographics and maquiladoras (i.e., final assembly plants) in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. When predicting maquiladora density using percent children and social class in a spatial error regression model, we find that percent children was a positive and significant predictor, while social class was not significant. Adding formal residential development to the model, social class becomes a negative and significant predictor. Formal residential development and percent children are also positive and significant. As is the case in the Global North, relationships between neighborhood characteristics and transnationally operated maquiladoras along the northern border of Mexico are linked to urban development.

Third, we examine the pathways and linkages between the social context (drawn from ethnography and secondary sources) and the collective experience, such as massive exodus, forced displacement, resilience and accommodation strategies for coping and survival. When assessing the overall mental health impact of exposure to protracted forms of extreme violence in civilian populations, we argue for the need to move beyond the limited notion of post-traumatic stress disorder, which is a useful but restrictive medical category failing to encompass the myriad of signals of distress, suffering and affliction, as well as other culture bound trauma-related disorders and long-term sequelae of traumatic experiences. Lastly, following the concluding remarks, we discuss some implications the results of the study may have at various levels, not only for the victims and survivors of massive exposure to traumatic events, but also their families and communities, as well as for interventions carried out by humanitarian and emergency relief organizations, and specialised agencies engaged in the promotion of social justice, prevention of human rights abuses, and mental health rehabilitation programs at both national and international levels.

While efficacious rotavirus vaccines are at hand, inequity in health delivery system within and between these countries was found to be the major hurdle against achieving the goal of rotavirus vaccine. When the coverage of currently used vaccines was applied to a rotavirus vaccine, a maximum of 202,550 deaths would be averted. Even if the coverage reached 80%, there would remain 96,841 children dying because of rotavirus diarrhea in these 11 countries. Studies are therefore encouraged to develop comprehensive strategies to resolve inequity in health delivery system enabling the increase in the immunization coverage. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Socioeconomic inequalities and oral cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						meta-analysis; oral cancer; SES; socioeconomic status; systematic review	ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; TOBACCO SMOKING; HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; SOCIAL-CLASS; FOOD GROUPS; HEALTH; CAVITY; ASSOCIATION; MORTALITY	There is uncertainty and limited recognition of the relationship between socioeconomic inequalities and oral cancer. We aimed to quantitatively assess the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and oral cancer incidence risk. A systematic review of case-control studies obtained published and unpublished estimates of the SES risk related to oral cancer. Studies were included which reported odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs of oral cancer with respect to SES, or if the estimates could be calculated or obtained. Meta-analyses were performed on subgroups: SES measure, age, sex, global region, development level, time-period and lifestyle factor adjustments; while sensitivity analyses were conducted based on study methodological issues. Forty-one studies provided 15,344 cases and 33,852 controls which met our inclusion criteria. Compared with individuals who were in high SES strata, the pooled ORs for the risk of developing oral cancer were 1.85 (95%CI 1.60, 2.15; n = 37 studies) for those with low educational attainment; 1.84 (1.47, 2.31; n = 14) for those with low occupational social class; and 2.41 (1.59, 3.65; n = 5) for those with low income. Subgroup analyses showed that low SES was significantly associated with increased oral cancer risk in high and lower income-countries, across the world, and remained when adjusting for potential behavioural confounders. Inequalities persist but are perhaps reducing over recent decades. Oral cancer risk associated with low SES is significant and comparable to lifestyle risk factors. Our results provide evidence to steer health policy which focus on lifestyles factors toward an integrated approach incorporating measures designed to tackle the root causes of disadvantage.

The objective of this paper is to describe the position taken by Indonesia in the events leading to the decision and in those conducted to resolve the situation. Methods: The sources for this paper are the Indonesian human influenza A(H5N1) case reports and study results, summaries, minutes and reports of national and international meetings of virus sharing, and other related Indonesian and WHO documents. Results: The International Health Regulations 2005 have been applied in different ways based on different interpretations. While one party insists on the importance of free, non-conditional, virus sharing for risk assessment and risk response, Indonesia - as supported by most of the developing countries - stresses on the more basic principles such as sovereignty of a country over its biological materials, transparency of the global system, and equity between developed and developing nations. Conclusions: This event demonstrates the unresolved imbalance between the affluent high-tech countries and the poor agriculture-based countries. Regional, global and in-country meetings must continue to be conducted to find solutions acceptable to all.

It also compares the region to the rest of the world on a set of broader development measures. It looks at the evidence of East Asian regional and global convergence in health and education, alongside evidence from the region matching global evidence of a comparatively weak link between income growth and health and education growth. This finding is echoed by available within-country evidence from the region. This paper discusses what might be behind these results, suggesting the importance of a few simple supply-side interventions coupled with the spread of demand for health and education services as sufficient to drive quality-of-life convergence.

A growing literature describes the impact of this new service on existing primary health services. Objective This article summarises the results of telephone triage projects in Australia and New Zealand to acquaint Australian general practitioners with nurse led telephone triage services that have health call centre technology. Discussion Australian and New Zealand services are similar with respect to the demographics of callers, when they call, and the issues on which they seek advice. Further study is needed in order to understand how telenursing can best be integrated with general practice and other primary care services.				ian.stgeorge@mckesson.co.nz							25	30	31	0	12	ROYAL AUSTRALIAN COLLEGE GENERAL PRACTITIONERS	SOUTH MELBOURNE	1 PALMERSTON CRESCENT, SOUTH MELBOURNE, VICTORIA 3205, AUSTRALIA	0300-8495			AUST FAM PHYSICIAN	Aust.

Contextualising workers' health and safety in urban settings: The need for a global perspective and an integrated approach	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						informal work; workers' health; urbanisation; comprehensive public health care; health equity	OCCUPATIONAL-HEALTH; INFORMAL ECONOMY; STREET VENDORS; CONSEQUENCES; EMPLOYMENT; GOVERNANCE; WORKING; CITIES; RISK; JOBS	This paper focuses on the need to contextualise and to address the neglected occupational health and safety rights of workers in the informal economy. Informal economy workers constitute the majority of workers in most countries and the number of informally employed, unprotected and low-income workers is increasing rapidly in both developing as well as developed countries. National and international policies have not acknowledged the linkages between poverty, employment, working conditions, living environment and health inequities. Information on the scale of the problem and the health impact of worsening informal working conditions is still limited. However, the occupational health and safety hazards they face are often added to those of poor living environments, poor nutrition and unsatisfactory housing. They are not covered by social protection or comprehensive health care and besides work-related injury and disease, they are commonly affected by poverty-related diseases. The authors argue that the current context of workers' health differs in many aspects from the past. Therefore, conventional occupational health and safety mechanisms, such as norms and good practices enforcement are insufficient to address the challenges that informal work and poor living environments poses for workers and their families. Given the nature of globalisation and urbanisation, an integrated rights-based approach of determinants at various levels and a more people-centred empowerment perspective is needed. Informal workers' representation, organisation, participation is important for ensuring the right to health of workers in the informal economy. Social mobilisation may prove critical as it did in the past. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These pressures have led governments to look for more efficient and equitable ways to allocate public resources. Prioritisation of health care services for public funding has been one of the strategies used by decision makers to reconcile growing health care demands with limited resources. Priority setting at the macro level has yet to demonstrate real successes. This paper describes international approaches to explicit prioritisation at the macro-governmental level in the six experiences most published in the English literature; analyzes the ways in which values, principles and other normative concepts were presented in these international priority setting experiences; and identifies key elements of a more robust framework for ethical analysis which could promote meaningful and effective health priority setting.

Health literacy is generally agreed upon as a means to find, understand, analyze and use information to make better decisions about health and to ultimately reduce inequities in health. A public health literacy knowledge scale was tested in China, Mexico, Ghana and India. A somewhat unexpected finding, which was that experts 'scored' less on the scale than the general public, led to consideration of differences between clinical and public health approaches to health literacy and their implications. These differences in perspective, for instance consideration of single case effects versus impacts at the societal level, pose significant challenges to developing and assessing health literacy. We suggest that a comprehensive approach to health literacy will include both clinical and public health approaches.

Scholars of developmental health suggest that micro-level influences from the social, economic and psychological circumstances in early life may explain social inequalities across the lifespan. However, children's poor developmental and health outcomes are also a product of the wider contexts of their lives. This paper extends the human developmental framework by linking the proximal determinants of health and well-being with macro-level forces. It reviews recent changes in the political, economic and social environments in developed countries, to provide insights into the recent trends in poor outcomes in children and youth, which remain paradoxical given the expectations of economic prosperity and the advances in medical and other technologies. The paper concludes with policy and research recommendations to reduce social disparities in child outcomes.

Our analysis of this landscape and the people who are a part of it highlights the complexities of the environmental justice movement in the current era of neo-liberal economic policies. Although the colonia that we studied, Derechos Humanos, is located on top of an abandoned landfill near an open sewage canal, living here represents a step forward for many residents. However, to many US environmentalists, this landscape represents a toxic wasteland and the people living here are simply victims of border industrialization. Contributing to critical environmental justice studies, our analysis of Derechos Humanos highlights the injustices of the global political economy, creative responses to these forces by individuals most adversely affected by them, and the potential limitations of conventional framings of environmental justice and mainstream Northern environmentalism.

Using a sample of adult caregivers of first-time misdemeanant offenders, two factors-education and accountability-were significantly associated with recidivistic behavior, supporting the use of GRAD data in correctly identifying first-time offenders who have the greatest and the least likelihood for future offending behavior. Additional analyses utilizing parent reports on African American males indicate that the GRAD provides discrimination in the prediction of recidivism in a group typically seen as being high risk simply because of their gender and race. The assessment drives intervention approach of the GRAD is discussed in terms of using reports from adults to accurately place youth into appropriate levels of supervision and treatment.

Youth sexual behaviour in a boomtown: implications for the control of sexually transmitted infections	SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS			English	Article							RISK; HIV; PREVALENCE	Background: Northeastern British Columbia, Canada, is undergoing rapid in-migration of young, primarily male, workers in response to the "boom'' in the oil/gas industries. Chlamydia rates in the region exceed the provincial average by 32% (294.6 cases per 100 000 persons compared with 213.3). Evidence indicates that sociocultural and structural determinants of young people's sexual health are key to consider in the design of interventions. Objectives: To investigate how sociocultural and structural features related to the oil/gas boom are perceived to affect the sexual behaviour of youth in a Northeastern "boomtown''. Methods: The study included ethnographic fieldwork (8 weeks) and in-depth interviews with 25 youth (ages 15 25 years) and 14 health/social service providers. Results: Participants identified four main ways in which the sociocultural and structural conditions created by the boom affect sexual behaviours, fuelling the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs): mobility of oil/gas workers; binge partying; high levels of disposable income and gendered power dynamics. Conclusions: The sociocultural and structural conditions that are fostered by a resource-extraction boom appear to exacerbate sexual health inequalities among youths who live and work in these rapidly urbanising, remote locales. To meet the needs of this population, we recommend STI prevention and testing service delivery models that incorporate STI testing outreach to oil/gas workers and condom distribution. Global, national and local STI control efforts should consider the realities and needs of similar subpopulations of young people.

Methods: Standard population attributable risk (PAR) methods were used to estimate the proportion of depression attributable to job strain. An adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.82 for job strain in relation to depression was obtained from a recently published meta-analysis and combined with exposure prevalence data from the Australian state of Victoria. Job strain exposure prevalence was determined from a 2003 population-based telephone survey of working Victorians (n = 1101, 66% response rate) using validated measures of job control (9 items, Cronbach's alpha = 0.80) and psychological demands (3 items, Cronbach's alpha = 0.66). Estimates of absolute numbers of prevalent cases of depression and successful stress-related workers' compensation claims were obtained from publicly available Australian government sources. Results: Overall job strain-population attributable risk (PAR) for depression was 13.2% for males [95% CI 1.1, 28.1] and 17.2% [95% CI 1.5, 34.9] for females. There was a clear gradient of increasing PAR with decreasing occupational skill level. Estimation of job strain-attributable cases (21,437) versus "mental stress" compensation claims (696) suggest that claims statistics underestimate job strain-attributable depression by roughly 30-fold. Conclusion: Job strain and associated depression risks represent a substantial, preventable, and inequitably distributed public health problem. The social patterning of job strain-attributable depression parallels the social patterning of mental illness, suggesting that job strain is an important contributor to mental health inequalities. The numbers of compensated 'mental stress' claims compared to job strain-attributable depression cases suggest that there is substantial under-recognition and under-compensation of job strain-attributable depression. Primary, secondary, and tertiary intervention efforts should be substantially expanded, with intervention priorities based on hazard and associated health outcome data as an essential complement to claims statistics.

Conditions such erectile dysfunction or hypoactive sexual desire disorder present one of many barriers to maintain a healthy sex life. Objective: This article links the concurrence between the social, cultural, political, and economic changes on a worldwide and historical level and the changes observed in sexuality. This review comprises from medical, biological and behavioral concerns to those of rights and social justice. To give an idea about the interests and trends of modem research on sexuality, the manuscript includes a review on the impact of contraception, public advertising, mass media and new technologies on sexuality and introduces the concept of sexual dysfunction. Discussion: Data suggest that broader cultural beliefs about appropriate sexuality are evident in general practice. Asking about sexual health remains a low priority for many doctors, particularly when it comes to older patients. Conclusion: The influence of all these previous concerns on the field of sexuality notion is particularly apparent in the development of concepts such as sexual health and sexual fights. These new concepts had an effect on researchers allowing them to describe connections between highly limited occurrence and global systems. Further education is needed to raise professional awareness about the importance of healthy sexuality in aging. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transformation of the nitrogen cycle: Recent trends, questions, and potential solutions	SCIENCE			English	Review							FUTURE; CONSEQUENCES; PERSPECTIVE; DEPOSITION; CLIMATE; CASCADE; SYSTEM	Humans continue to transform the global nitrogen cycle at a record pace, reflecting an increased combustion of fossil fuels, growing demand for nitrogen in agriculture and industry, and pervasive inefficiencies in its use. Much anthropogenic nitrogen is lost to air, water, and land to cause a cascade of environmental and human health problems. Simultaneously, food production in some parts of the world is nitrogen-deficient, highlighting inequities in the distribution of nitrogen-containing fertilizers. Optimizing the need for a key human resource while minimizing its negative consequences requires an integrated interdisciplinary approach and the development of strategies to decrease nitrogen-containing waste.

It is well recognized that prison inmates are a vulnerable group of the population. Research on this group is minimal compared with the general population. The problem of drug use and health consequences among this subpopulation is significant and needs to be explored. Recent findings A higher prevalence of drug use is found among prison inmates than among the general population. The health status of prison inmates seems to be lower because of both the inmates behavior and the prison environment. Various communicable diseases are commonly found such as hepatitis C virus, HIV, and syphilis. Summary The health of prison inmates tended to be worse than in the general population, particularly for those who use drugs. Based on the principle of human rights and equity of access, healthcare services provided to prison inmates should be equivalent to those provided to the general population.

We look at how adolescents themselves interpret and give meaning to the concept of resilience in dehumanising and abnormal conditions. The aim is to 'problematise' the construct to go beyond quantitative research and objective inquiry. Focus groups were conducted with 321 male and female Palestinian students in 15 schools in Ramallah and the surrounding villages. This study presents findings that are consistent with previous research on the value of supportive relationships such as families and friends. Political participation and education are vital to a sense of identity and political resistance. However, a key finding reveals the normalisation of everyday life in fostering resiliency within abnormal living conditions. Palestinian youth, nonetheless, paint a picture of resilience that reveals contradictions and tensions. This study underlines the fluid and dynamic nature of resilience. Despite the desire for order, Palestinian young people complain of emotional distress and boredom. Feelings of desperation are intermingled with optimism. We also argue that the concept of resilience developed in predominantly Western settings ignores a local idiom of communal care and support. International and local organisations providing psychosocial care rely on trauma programmes based on a Western style of counselling. An over-emphasis on individualised intervention overlooks the notion of collective resiliency and fails to build on existing social capital within communities. Policy-makers should do more than 'tweak' preconceived projects to fit the cultural context or to replicate them from one conflict area to another. We should also keep in mind that the search for psychological well-being and justice are not mutually exclusive.

The collective right to development, transcending the right to health's focus on the individual, offers public health actors an opportunity to work through development discourses to obligate and empower states to allocate public goods for the public's health. This article concludes that health scholars and advocates could employ the right to development to ensure that development policies guide states in realizing the highest attainable standard of health, fulfilling underlying determinants of health through the strengthening of national public health systems.

Establishment of a web-based registry for rare (orphan) pediatric lung diseases in the United Kingdom:: The BPOLD registry	PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY			English	Article						respiratory system; rare diseases; children; infants	SURVEILLANCE UNIT; LYMPHANGIOLEIOMYOMATOSIS; CHILDHOOD	Background: Children with orphan lung diseases (defined as a prevalence of <1 in 2000) receive suboptimal care due to a lack of understanding of pathophysiology and management. Aim: To develop a low cost, multidisease, web-based registry for children with rare lung diseases. Methods: The British Pediatric Orphan Lung Disease (BPOLD) electronic registry was established to provide a web-based method for recording monthly incidence data on nine rare pediatric respiratory diseases (www.bpold.co.uk). An email reporting system was developed which required clinicians to input a username and password to respond following a monthly email reminder. The initial reporting rate was poor despite many registrants. The method for reporting was subsequently streamlined enabling reporting to be done via email by a single mouse-click. A follow-up email, with consent forms as attachments, was automatically sent to positive respondents, with negative responses recorded directly to the database. Non-responders receive a reminder email after 2 weeks. Results: Initially 101 respiratory clinicians registered via the BPOLD site, responding 162 times over 17 months. In the 12 months following redevelopment (total 12 monthly group emails) 143 of 222 BPRS members (64%) have provided 1,001 responses. Forty-eight clinicians (34% of responders) have responded to 10-12 group emails, with the next highest total being those responding to one only One hundred fifty-eight cases of orphan lung disease have been identified. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the successful establishment of a low cost, web-based registry for children with rare lung diseases. There is an urgent need for European and International collaboration with the establishment of electronic registries for children with rare diseases, if the inequities of health care are to be addressed. A web-based approach, similar to the one we have developed, will enable this.

J	Persson, A; Newman, C				Persson, Asha; Newman, Christy			Making monsters: heterosexuality, crime and race in recent Western media coverage of HIV	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS			English	Article						HIV; heterosexuality; media; criminal prosecutions; race	PUBLIC-HEALTH; AIDS; INFECTION; TRANSMISSION; HIV/AIDS; PEOPLE	In the early HIV epidemic, Western media coverage encouraged the idea that infection was linked to 'other' identities located outside the 'mainstream'; outside 'proper' heterosexuality. Today, however, HIV has become repositioned as a global heterosexual epidemic. Analyses show that since the 1990s Western media have shifted away from blame and hysteria to an increasingly routinised reporting of HIV as a health story and social justice issue. But recent years have seen the emergence of a new media story in many Western countries; the criminal prosecution for HIV-related offences, and with it a reframing of old discourses of 'innocence' and 'guilt', but now with heterosexuals in focus. We examine this story in recent domestic media coverage in Australia, a country where heterosexual HIV transmission is rare by global comparison. Echoing similar stories in other Western media, in Australian coverage the idea of criminal intent converges with the symbolic weight of black sexuality and African origins to produce a 'monstrous' masculinity, which at the local level taps into contemporary racial tensions and, in so doing, conjures an imagined Anglo-heterosexuality at once vulnerable to and safe from HIV in a globalised epidemic and world.

For more than half a century, its health policies have applied the principles of equity and solidarity to strengthen access to care through public services and universal social health insurance. Costa Rica's population measures of health service coverage, health service use, and health status are excellent, and in the Americas, life expectancy in Costa Rica is second only to that in Canada. Many of these outcomes can be linked to the performance of the public health care system. However, the current emphasis of international aid organizations on privatization of health services threatens the accomplishments and universality of the Costa Rican health care system.

Public health utilitarianism has become increasingly important in shaping national and international policies. However, potentially contradictory imperatives may require reconciliation of individual reproductive and other human rights with public health objectives. Current reproductive health guidelines remain largely nonprescriptive on the advisability of pregnancy amongst HIV-positive couples, mainly relying on effective counselling to enable autonomous decision-making by clients. Yet, health care provider values and attitudes may substantially impact on the effectiveness of nonprescriptive guidelines, particularly where social norms and stereotypes regarding childbearing are powerful, and where providers are subjected to dual loyalty pressures, with potentially adverse impacts on rights of service users. Data from a study of user experiences and perceptions of reproductive and HIV/AIDS services are used to illustrate a rights analysis of how reproductive health policy should integrate a rights perspective into the way services engage with HIV-positive persons and their reproductive choices. The analysis draws on recognised tools developed to evaluate health policies for their human rights impacts and on a model developed for health equity research in South Africa to argue for greater recognition of agency on the part of persons affected by HIV/AIDS in the development and content of policies on reproductive choices. We conclude by proposing strategies that are based upon a synergy between human rights and public health approaches to policy on reproductive health choices for persons with HIV/AIDS.

This study examines health inequalities among older adults in Sweden in 1991-1992 and 2000-2002 and explores the development of these inequalities during this period. Methods: A data set was constructed out of four levels of living surveys, comprising 4085 individuals aged 55 and above. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the association between social class, sex, age and four different domains of self-reported health: global self-rated health, impaired mobility, musculoskeletal pain and psychological distress. Adjustments were made for period of interview. Interaction terms were also used to assess change over time. Levin's attributable risk was used to assess the magnitude of the health inequalities. Results: The results indicate an increase in reports of all specific health problems, but not in the global health measure during the period. Significant sex differences and a clear social gradient in health were discernible during both periods. Women were more likely than men to report problems with impaired mobility, pain and psychological distress. Manual workers were significantly more likely than non-manuals to report problems in all four domains of health. However, both the sex differences and the social gradient seemed to remain constant during the period. Conclusion: Although it seems there are significant differences in health depending on sex and social class among older adults in Sweden, these inequalities appear to be unaffected by the general increase in ill health that has been observed in these groups over the last decade.

Quality of patient care in hospitals is firmly on the agendas of Western countries but has been slower to gain traction in developing countries, despite evidence that there is substantial scope for improvement, that hospitals have a major role in child survival, and that inequities in quality may be as important as inequities in access. There is now substantial global experience of strategies and interventions that improve the quality of care for children in hospitals with limited resources. The World Health Organization has developed a toolkit that contains adaptable instruments, including a framework for quality improvement, evidence-based clinical guidelines in the form of the Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children, teaching material, assessment, and mortality audit tools. These tools have been field-tested by doctors, nurses, and other child health workers in many developing countries. This collective experience was brought together in a global World Health Organization meeting in Bali in 2007. This article describes how many countries are achieving improvements in quality of pediatric care, despite limited resources and other major obstacles, and how the evidence has progressed in recent years from documenting the nature and scope of the problems to describing the effectiveness of innovative interventions. The challenges remain to bring these and other strategies to scale and to support research into their use, impact, and sustainability in different environments.

J	Bachu, S				Bachu, Stefan			CO<sub>2</sub> storage in geological media:: Role, means, status and barriers to deployment	PROGRESS IN ENERGY AND COMBUSTION SCIENCE			English	Review						carbon dioxide storage; CO2; trapping mechanisms; hazards and risks; barriers to deployment	CARBON-DIOXIDE CAPTURE; AQUIFER DISPOSAL; ENERGY; OIL; SEQUESTRATION; STABILIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; SIMULATION; INJECTION; RESERVOIR	Carbon dioxide capture and geological storage is an enabling technology that will allow the continued use well into this century of fossil fuels, mainly coal, for power generation and combustion in industrial processes because they are relatively abundant, cheap, available and globally distributed, thus enhancing the security and stability of energy systems. Geological media suitable for CO2 storage through various physical and chemical trapping mechanisms must have the necessary capacity and injectivity, and must confine the CO2 and impede its lateral migration and/or vertical leakage to other strata, shallow potable groundwater, soils and/or atmosphere. Such geological media are mainly oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline aquifers that are found in sedimentary basins. Storage of gases, including CO2, in these media has been demonstrated on a commercial scale by enhanced oil recovery operations, natural gas storage and acid gas disposal. Some of the risks associated With CO2 capture and geological storage are similar to, and comparable with, any other industrial activity for which extensive safety and regulatory frameworks are in place. Specific risks associated with CO2 storage relate to the operational (injection) phase and to the post-operational phase, of which the risks of most concern are those posed by the potential for acute or chronic CO2 leakage from the storage site. Notwithstanding the global climate effect of CO2 returning to the atmosphere, the local risks to health and safety, environment and equity need to be properly assessed and managed. Currently there are very few operations in the world where CO2 is injected and stored in the ground, mostly if not exclusively as a by-product of an operation driven by other considerations than climate change, such as oil production or regulatory requirements regarding H2S. These operations show that there are no major technological barriers to CO2 geological storage, and that challenges and barriers lie elsewhere. A major challenge in the implementation of CO2 geological storage is the high cost of CO2 capture, particularly for dilute streams like those from power plants and industrial combustion processes. There are concerns that public opinion and public's acceptance or rejection of this technology will likely affect the large-scale implementation of CO2 geological storage. The current paucity of policy, legislation and a proper regulatory framework in most jurisdictions is presently the most significant barrier. The resolution of these challenges will affect the economics and financial risk of CO2 geological storage and will accelerate or delay the deployment of this technology for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

J	Ashcroft, R				Ashcroft, Richard			Fair Process and the Redundancy of Bioethics: A Polemic	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article								Recent doctrine in both national and international organisations concerned with public health planning and resource allocation has it that direct ethical justification of substantive decisions is so difficult as to be impossible. Instead, we should agree on criteria of procedural justice and reach decisions whose justification lies in how they are arrived at, rather than any direct ethical justification on the ground of substantive moral principles. In this polemical article, I argue that this amounts to a serious dereliction of intellectual duty on the part of the bioethics community. Our role in these settings is to produce and defend the best substantive arguments we can. Failing to do this makes bioethicists at best redundant and at worst leads us to seriously defective conclusions. The argument is illustrated by analysis of the ethical frameworks for resource allocation under the UNAIDS '3 by 5' programme and for pandemic influenza planning.

Ethics, Tuberculosis and Globalization	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; GLOBAL HEALTH; DUTY	This article reviews ethically relevant history of tuberculosis and recent developments regarding extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). It argues that tuberculosis is one of the most important neglected topics in bioethics. With an emphasis on XDR-TB, it examines a range of the more challenging ethical issues associated with tuberculosis: individual obligations to avoid infecting others, coercive social distancing measures, third-party notification, healthworkers' duty to treat contagious patients, and international justice. In each of these cases, key philosophical questions are highlighted and the need for empirical research/information is demonstrated.

J	Munthe, C				Munthe, Christian			The Goals of Public Health: An Integrated, Multidimensional Model	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article							MEDICINE	While promoting population health has been the classic goal of public health practice and policy, in recent decades, new objectives in terms of autonomy and equality have been introduced. These different goals are analysed, and it is demonstrated how they may conflict severly in several ways, leaving serious unclarities both regarding the normative issue of what goal should be pursued by public health, what that implies in practical terms, and the descriptive issue of what goal that actually is pursued in different contexts. A basic conflict of perspective is handled by integrating the ideas of public health striving for health-related autonomy and equality, resulting in a prioritarian oriented population approach to health-related autonomy. This integrated goal is demonstrated to constrain itself in several ways attractive from the point of view of the classic goal, but several serious problems remain. For this reason, a model where all of the three goals are integrated into one coherent structure where they can be assigned varying degrees of importance relative to the level of population health is described. It is argued that this model avoids the problems set out earlier, and is actually normatively preferable to the classic goal alone. It is furthermore argued that the model may be employed as a useful tool for descriptive ethics, as well as a vehicle for international harmonisation of public health policies. A number of practical implications regarding, e. g., the importance of respecting autonomy and the allocation of public health resources are noted, as are a battery of questions for further research.

We then describe the major current health policy initiatives in urban and rural areas and discuss likely scenarios for their evolution over time. Using comparisons with international experience regarding different institutional arrangements in the health care sector, we also discuss whether the approaches taken in China are likely to strengthen the health care system in terms of efficiency and equity. Our conclusion is that in order to predict how effectively China's future health care system will perform in the future, one must have more information about what role the state ( central government) will play, as regulator, partial funder and direct provider in the system. We believe that the best strategy at present is to allow the development of a mixed model with significant roles for both the state and the private sector, in both the supply of health care services and the provision of health insurance.

Cross-country associations of income inequality with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						income inequality; obesity; cardiovascular diseases (CVD); coronary heart disease (CND); stroke; body mass index (BMI); cross-national; smoking	POPULATION HEALTH; EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; GLOBAL BURDEN; MORTALITY; HYPERTENSION; STROKE; INTERHEART; SMOKING	Despite a number of cross-national studies that have examined the associations between income inequality and broad health outcomes such as life expectancy and all-cause mortality, investigations of the cross-country relations between income inequality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity, mortality, and risk factors are sparse. We analyzed the cross-national relations between income inequality and age-standardized mean body mass index (BMI), serum total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure (SBP), obesity prevalence, smoking impact ratio (SIR), and age-standardized and age-specific disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and mortality rates from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, controlling for multiple country-level factors and specifying 5- to 10-year lag periods. In multivariable analyses primarily limited to industrialized countries, countries in the middle and highest (vs. lowest) tertiles of income inequality had higher absolute age-standardized obesity prevalences in both sexes. Higher income inequality was also related to higher mean SBP in both sexes, and higher SIR in women. In analyses of larger sets of countries with available data, positive associations were observed between higher income inequality and mean BMI, obesity prevalence, and CHD DALYs and mortality rates. Associations with stroke outcomes were inverse, yet became positive with the inclusion of eastern bloc and other countries in recent economic/political transition. China was also identified to be an influential data point, with the positive associations with stroke mortality rates becoming attenuated with its inclusion. Overall, our findings are compatible with harmful effects of income inequality at the national scale on CVD morbidity, mortality, and selected risk factors, particularly BMI/obesity. Future studies should consider income inequality as an independent contributor to variations in CVD burden globally. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The experience of the nongovernmental organizations Partners In Health (PIH) and Zanmi Lasante (ZL) in Haiti demonstrates the potential for success of a surgical program in a rural, resource-poor area when services are provided through the public sector, integrated with primary health care services, and provided free of charge to patients who cannot pay. Providing surgical care in resource-constrained settings is an issue of global health equity and must be featured in national and international discussions on the improvement of global health. There are numerous training, funding, and programmatic considerations, several of which are raised by considering the data from Haiti presented here.

Workplace discrimination and health among Filipinos in the United States	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							RACE-BASED DISCRIMINATION; RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; LABOR MIGRATION; RACIAL/ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION; PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION; ASIAN-AMERICAN; STRESS; INEQUALITY; WORKERS	Objectives. We examined the association between work discrimination and morbidity among Filipinos in the United States, independent of more-global measures of discrimination. Methods. Data were collected from the Filipino American Community Epidemiological Survey. Our analysis focused on 1652 participants who were employed at the time of data collection, and we used negative binomial regression to determine the association between work discrimination and health conditions. Results. The report of workplace discrimination specific to being Filipino was associated with an increased number of health conditions. This association persisted even after we controlled for everyday discrimination, a general assessment of discrimination; job concerns, a general assessment of unpleasant work circumstances; having immigrated for employment reasons; job category; income; education; gender; and other sociodemographic factors. Conclusions. Racial discrimination in the workplace was positively associated with poor health among Filipino Americans after we controlled for reports of everyday discrimination and general concerns about one's job. This finding shows the importance of considering the work setting as a source of discrimination and its effect on morbidity among racial minorities.

BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article							DISEASE; TRANSPLANTATION; NEPHROLOGY; DIALYSIS; KIDNEY	There is a significant emerging burden of chronic and end-stage kidney disease in low- and middle-income countries, driven by population ageing and the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes. Sufferers of end-stage kidney disease require ongoing dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive; however, in many low- and middle-income countries, treatment options are strictly limited or unaffordable. Low numbers of maintenance dialysis patients and transplant recipients reflect profound economic and service provision challenges for health-care systems in low- and middle-income countries in sustaining renal replacement therapy programmes. Underdeveloped organ donor and transplant programmes, health system and financing issues, ethical regulation of transplantation and the cost of pharmaceuticals commonly pose additional barriers to the delivery of efficient and cost-effective renal replacement therapy. Development of locally appropriate transplant programmes, effective use of nongovernmental sources of funding, service planning and cost containment, use of generic drugs and local manufacture of dialysis consumables have the potential to make life-saving renal replacement therapy available to many more in need. Select low- and middle-income countries demonstrate more equitable provision of renal replacement therapy is possible outside high-income countries. For other low- and middle-income countries, education, the development of good public policy and a supportive international environment are critical. Prevention of end-stage kidney disease, ideally as part of an integrated approach to chronic vascular diseases, must also be a key objective.

Assessing health system performance in developing countries: A review of the literature	HEALTH POLICY			English	Review						health systems; health indicators; health metrics; health system performance; developing countries	INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT; CHILDHOOD ILLNESS; CARE; EQUITY; SERVICES; QUALITY; MORTALITY; COST; INEQUALITIES; INDICATORS	With the setting of ambitious international health goals and an influx of additional development assistance for health, there is growing interest in assessing the performance of health systems in developing countries. This paper proposes a framework for the assessment of health system performance and reviews the literature on indicators currently in use to measure performance using online medical and public health databases. This was complemented by a review of relevant books and reports in the grey literature. The indicators were organized into three categories: effectiveness, equity, and efficiency. Measures of health system effectiveness were improvement in health status, access to and quality of care and, increasingly, patient satisfaction. Measures of equity included access and quality of care for disadvantaged groups together with fair financing, risk protection and accountability. Measures of efficiency were appropriate levels of funding, the cost-effectiveness of interventions, and effective administration. This framework and review of indicators may be helpful to health policy makers interested in assessing the effects of different policies, expenditures, and organizational structures on health outputs and outcomes in developing countries.

JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; TAX PROGRESSIVITY; POOR PAY; EQUITY; COUNTRIES; POVERTY; VIETNAM; FINANCE; EXPENDITURES; PAYMENTS	We estimate the distributional incidence of health care financing in 13 Asian territories that account for 55% of the Asian population. In all territories, higher-income households contribute more to the financing of health care. The better-off contribute more as a proportion of ability to pay in most low- and lower-middle-income territories. Health care financing is slightly regressive in three high-income economies with universal social insurance. Direct taxation is the most progressive source of finance and is most so in poorer economies. In universal systems, social insurance is proportional to regressive. In high-income economies, the out-of-pocket (OOP) payments are proportional or regressive while in low-income economies the better-off spend relatively more OOP. But in most low-/middle-income countries, the better-off not only pay more, they also get more health care. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sharkey, JR; Horel, S				Sharkey, Joseph R.; Horel, Scott			Neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and minority composition are associated with better potential spatial access to the ground-truthed food environment in a large rural area	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article							PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CHOICE; AVAILABILITY; NUTRITION; OBESITY; FRUIT; SUPERMARKETS; STRATEGIES; MORTALITY; ACCURACY	Little is known about spatial inequalities and potential access to the food environment in rural areas. In this study, we assessed the food environment in a 6-county rural region of Texas 0 1,567 km(2)) through ground-truthed methods that included direct observation and on-site Global Positioning System technology to examine the relationship between neighborhood inequalities (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation and minority composition) and network distance from all 101 rural neighborhoods to the nearest food store (FS). Neighborhood deprivation was determined from socioeconomic characteristics using 2000 census block group (CBG) data. Network distances were calculated from the population-weighted center of each CBG to the nearest supermarket, grocery, convenience, and discount store. Multiple regression models examined associations among deprivation, minority composition, population density, and network distance to the nearest FS. The median distance to the nearest supermarket was 14.9 km one way (range 0.12 to 54.0 km). The distance decreased with increasing deprivation, minority composition, and population density. The worst deprived neighborhoods with the greatest minority composition had better potential spatial access to the nearest FS. For > 20% of all rural residents, their neighborhoods were at least 17.7 km from the nearest supermarket or full-line grocery or 7.6 km from the nearest convenience store. This makes food shopping a challenge, especially in rural areas that lack public transportation and where many have no vehicular access. Knowledge of potential access to the food environment is essential for combining environmental approaches and health interventions so that families, especially those in rural areas, can make healthier food choices.

Methods: A representative sample of the Finnish working population aged 30-64 (1667 men, 1707 women) in 2000-2001 responded to a survey questionnaire on non-work factors (marital status, housing conditions, non-work social support, violence victimisation, smoking, physical symptoms), work factors (job demands, job control, social support at work, educational prospects, job insecurity) and household income. Somatic health was examined in a standard health examination. The 12-month prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders was examined with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: The risk of having a depressive or anxiety disorder was 2.8 times higher in the low-income group than in the high-income group among men and 2.0 times higher among women. For men, non- work and work factors explained 20% and 31% of this association, respectively. For women, the corresponding figures were 65% and 23%. Conclusions: Low income is associated with frequent mental disorders among a working population. In particular, work factors among men and non- work factors among women contribute to the income differences in mental health.

It then illustrates the approach by applying it to the question of when coercion might be appropriate in the area of involuntary psychiatric hospitalization and treatment and, when appropriate, how clinicians, judges, and lawyers should act so as to minimize coercion's potentially anti-therapeutic effects and maximize the therapeutic potential of law in this area. The article considers areas of psychological research involving the relative effectiveness of coercion and voluntary choice in the area of hospitalization and treatment, and on what makes patients feel coerced in these contexts.

Social status and health: A comparison of British civil servants in Whitehall-II with European- and African-Americans in CARDIA	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						subjective social status; socioeconomic status (SES); Whitehall-II; CARDIA; occupation; race/ethnicity; UK; USA	SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION; EXPLANATIONS; INEQUALITIES; GENDER; SELF	Socioeconomic status (SES) is related to health in every industrialized society where it has been studied. Indicators include educational attainment, occupational status, and income. Subjective social status (SSS), a summative judgment of one's socioeconomic position across these dimensions, also appears to be associated with health status. The current study examines whether SSS has similar associations with SES indicators and with health outcomes among British civil servants (participants in the Whitehall-II study), and U.S. whites and blacks (participants in the CARDIA study). The comparisons shed light on social status in the U.S. and England and on the applicability of findings from Whitchall-II to both whites and blacks in the U.S. Parallel analyses in each group examined (1) the extent to which income, education, and occupational status determine SSS ratings, (2) the association of SSS with hypertension, depression, and global health, and (3) the extent to which adjustment for education, occupation and income individually and collectively reduce the association of SSS and health outcomes. As predicted, occupation is a more important determinant of SSS in Whitehall-II than in CARDIA; adjustment for occupation reduces the association between SSS and health outcomes more for the Whitehall-II participants-especially males-than for CARDIA participants. Among the latter, education and income play relatively greater roles. Socioeconomic factors do not predict SSS scores for blacks as well as they do for the other two groups. SSS is significantly related to global health and depression in all groups and to hypertension in all groups except black males. Overall, relationships of SSS and health were stronger for Whitehall-II and white CARDIA participants than for blacks in CARDIA. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The difficulties of measuring adolescent socioeconomic status (SES) are both conceptual and methodological. Conceptually, it is unclear whether parental SES should be used as a proxy, and if so, which aspect of SES is most relevant. Methodologically, parental SES information is difficult to obtain from adolescents resulting in high levels of missing data. These issues led to the devlopment of a new measure, the Family Affluence Scale (FAS), in the context of an international study on adolescent health, the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) Study. The paper reviews the evolution of the measure over the past 10 years and its utility in examining and explaining health related inequalities at national and cross-national levels in over 30 countries in Europe and North America. We present an overview of HBSC papers published to date that examine FAS-related socioeconomic inequalities in health and health behaviour, using data from the HBSC study. Findings suggest consistent inequalities in self-reported health, psychosomatic symptoms, physical activity and aspects of eating habits at both the individual and Country level. FAS has recently been adopted, and in some cases adapted, by other research and policy related studies and this work is also reviewed. Finally, ongoing I-AS validation work is described together with ideas for future development of the measure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Creating a Center for Global Health at the University of Wisconsin-Madison	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article								Globalization, migration, and widespread health disparities call for interdisciplinary approaches to improve health care at home and abroad. Health professions students are pursuing study abroad in increasing numbers, and universities are responding with programs to address these needs. The University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison schools of medicine and public health, nursing, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, and the division of international studies have created an interdisciplinary center for global health (CGH). The CGH provides health professions and graduate students with courses, field experiences, and a new Certificate in Global Health. Educational programs have catalyzed a network of enthusiastic UW global health scholars. Partnerships with colleagues in less economically developed countries provide the foundation for education, research, and service programs. Participants have collaborated to improve the education of health professionals and nutrition in Uganda; explore the interplay between culture, community development, and health in Ecuador; improve animal health and address domestic violence in Mexico; and examine successful public health efforts in Thailand. These programs supply students with opportunities to understand the complex determinants of health and structure of health systems, develop adaptability and cross-cultural communication skills, experience learning and working in interdisciplinary teams, and promote equity and reduce health disparities at home and abroad. Based on the principles of equity, sustainability, and reciprocity, the CGH provides a strong foundation to address global health challenges through networking and collaboration among students, staff, and faculty within the UW and beyond.

Shall we operate? Preoperative assessment in elderly cancer patients (PACE) can help - A SIOG surgical task force prospective study	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY			English	Review						oncogeriatrics; elderly; cancer; surgery; CGA; PACE	COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT; OLDER-PEOPLE; COMORBIDITY; RECOMMENDATIONS; MANAGEMENT	Background: A number of elderly cancer patients do not receive standard surgery for solid tumors because they are considered unfit for treatment as a consequence of inaccurate estimation of the operative risk. To tailor treatment to onco-geriatric series, oncologists are now beginning to use a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). This study investigates the value of an extended CGA in assessing the suitability of elderly patients for surgical intervention. Patients and methods: Preoperative assessment of cancer in the elderly (PACE) incorporates validated instruments including the CGA, an assessment of fatigue and performance status and an anaesthesiologist's evaluation of operative risk. An international prospective study was conducted using 460 consecutively recruited elderly cancer patients who received PACE prior to elective surgery. Mortality, post-operative complications (morbidity) and length of hospital stay were recorded up to 30 days after surgery. Results: Poor health in relation to disability (assessed using the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)), fatigue and performance status (PS) were associated with a 50% increase in the relative risk of post-operative complications. Multivariate analysis identified moderate/severe fatigue, a dependent IADL and an abnormal PS as the most important independent predictors of post-surgical complications. Disability assessed by activities of daily living (ADL), IADL and PS were associated with an extended hospital stay. Conclusion: PACE represents a valuable tool in enhancing the decision process concerning the candidacy of elderly cancer patients for surgical intervention and can reduce inappropriate age-related inequity in access to surgical intervention. It is recommended that PACE be used routinely in surgical practice. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Audisio, R. A.; Participants, P. A. C. E.; Pope, D.; Ramesh, H. S.

Globalization, women's migration, and the long-term-care workforce	GERONTOLOGIST			English	Article						aging; elder custodial care; Filipino Americans; geriatrics; globalization; health services for the aged; immigration; long-term care; poverty; social justice; women; workforce	UNITED-STATES; LABOR; WORK	With the aging of the world's population comes the rising need for qualified direct long-term-care (DLTC) workers (i.e., those who provide personal care to frail and disabled older adults). Developed nations are increasingly turning to immigrant women to fill these needs. In this article, we examine the impact of three global trends-population aging, globalization, and women's migration-on the supply and demand for DLTC workers in the United States. Following an overview of these trends, we identify three areas with embedded social justice issues that are shaping the DLTC workforce in the United States, with a specific focus on immigrant workers in these settings. These include world poverty and economic inequalities, the feminization and colorization of labor (especially in long-term care), and empowerment and women's rights. We conclude with a discussion of the contradictory effects that both population aging and globalization have on immigrant women, source countries, and the long-term-care workforce in the United States. We raise a number of policy, practice, and research implications and questions. For policy makers and long-term-care administrators in receiver nations such as the United States, the meeting of DLTC worker needs with immigrants may result in greater access to needed employees but also in the continued devaluation of eldercare as a profession. Source (supply) nations must balance the real and potential economic benefits of remittances from women who migrate for labor with the negative consequences of disrupting family care traditions and draining the long-term-care workforce of those countries.

Although data and methodological limitations suggest caution in drawing conclusions, a critical reading of the available evidence suggests that current health service delivery in China leaves room for improvement, in terms of quality, responsiveness to patients, efficiency, cost escalation, and equity. The literature suggests that these problems will not be solved by simply shifting ownership to the private sector or by simply encouraging providers - public and private - to compete with one another for individual patients. By contrast, substantial improvements could be (and in some places have already been) made by changing the way providers are paid - shifting away from fee-for-service and the distorted price schedule. Other elements of 'active purchasing' by insurers could further improve outcomes. Rigorous evaluations, based on richer micro-level data, could considerably strengthen the evidence base for service delivery policy in China.

In African countries, where it is estimated that 50-60% of the populace lack "access" to essential medicines, health problems associated with limited drug benefits are more damaging. However, there is no single solution to medicine access problem given its multiple dimensions: availability, acceptability, affordability and accessibility. This paper explores affordability dimension of medicine access and concentrates solely on price regulatory policies and institutional structures that national and international policy makers may consider in making prices of essential drugs compatible to the purchasing power of African households. The main theme is the application of the concept of bilateral dependence in creating price-sensitive purchasers to exert countervailing market power on drug price setting in African healthcare systems.

Data were obtained from the 2002-2003 Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health. The sample consisted of 755 Canadians and 1151 Americans aged 65 years or older. HRQL was measured with the multidimensional Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HU13). The results indicated that in the elderly population, HRQL was significantly associated with household income in the United States but not in Canada, controlling for sociodemographic and health indicators. Various explanations for the positive linear relationship between HRQL and income in the elderly population are discussed, including the roles of access to health care and socioeconomic inequalities in the United States and Canada.

Using a comparative case study, I identify the types of transnational networks and exchanges that both help and hinder community-based HIV/AIDS organizations (CBOs) that provide AIDS prevention and treatment services in Tijuana and Mexico City. Data derive from over 50 formal interviews, organizational documents and archival records, and observation. I argue that the form and function of transnational networks is shaped by the geo-political context of local organizational fields and that, in turn, transnational networks provide innovative opportunities for civil society-state partnerships that favor some local organizations over others. Ultimately, I take apart the prevailing assumption that transnational networks are inherently good, and show how they can (re)produce inter-organizational stratification at the local level. The conclusions of this research are helpful to international health practitioners and social scientists seeking to understand how civil society's participation in transnational networks can both challenge and reproduce existing community-state power regimes and health inequities.

J	Lehmann, U; Dieleman, M; Martineau, T				Lehmann, Uta; Dieleman, Marjolein; Martineau, Tim			Staffing remote rural areas in middle- and low-income countries: A literature review of attraction and retention	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							HOSPITAL NURSES; HEALTH-SERVICE; CARE; PHYSICIANS; TURNOVER; RECRUITMENT; SUPERVISION; MOBILITY; INCREASE; WORK	Background: Many countries in middle- and low-income countries today suffer from severe staff shortages and/or maldistribution of health personnel which has been aggravated more recently by the disintegration of health systems in low-income countries and by the global policy environment. One of the most damaging effects of severely weakened and under-resourced health systems is the difficulty they face in producing, recruiting, and retaining health professionals, particularly in remote areas. Low wages, poor working conditions, lack of supervision, lack of equipment and infrastructure as well as HIV and AIDS, all contribute to the flight of health care personnel from remote areas. In this global context of accelerating inequities health service policy makers and managers are searching for ways to improve the attraction and retention of staff in remote areas. But the development of appropriate strategies first requires an understanding of the factors which influence decisions to accept and/or stay in a remote post, particularly in the context of mid and low income countries (MLICS), and which strategies to improve attraction and retention are therefore likely to be successful. It is the aim of this review article to explore the links between attraction and retention factors and strategies, with a particular focus on the organisational diversity and location of decision-making. Methods: This is a narrative literature review which took an iterative approach to finding relevant literature. It focused on English-language material published between 1997 and 2007. The authors conducted Pubmed searches using a range of different search terms relating to attraction and retention of staff in remote areas. Furthermore, a number of relevant journals as well as unpublished literature were systematically searched. While the initial search included articles from high-middle- and low-income countries, the review focuses on middle- and low-income countries. About 600 papers were initially assessed and 55 eventually included in the review. Results: The authors argue that, although factors are multi-facetted and complex, strategies are usually not comprehensive and often limited to addressing a single or limited number of factors. They suggest that because of the complex interaction of factors impacting on attraction and retention, there is a strong argument to be made for bundles of interventions which include attention to living environments, working conditions and environments and development opportunities. They further explore the organisational location of decision-making related to retention issues and suggest that because promising strategies often lie beyond the scope of human resource directorates or ministries of health, planning and decision-making to improve retention requires multi-sectoral collaboration within and beyond government. The paper provides a simple framework for bringing the key decision-makers together to identify factors and develop multi-facetted comprehensive strategies. Conclusion: There are no set answers to the problem of attraction and retention. It is only through learning about what works in terms of fit between problem analysis and strategy and effective navigation through the politics of implementation that any headway will be made against the almost universal challenge of staffing health service in remote rural areas.

J	Rich, R				Rich, Ronald			Fecal free: Biology and authority in industrialized Midwestern pork production	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						agricultural development; animal biology; contract agriculture; hog production; Midwestern US	POLITICAL-ECONOMY; VERTICAL COORDINATION; AGRICULTURE	Ethnographically, "fecal free" is a lexical marker that invokes a form of industrialized swine husbandry used in large-scale confinement hog production. Using participant observation and interview research with Illinois contract hog producers, I explore the basis of this husbandry in the biological fragility of confinement hogs. Rather than biology being a simplistic "state of nature," as it was in early neo-Marxist and populist studies of the 1970s, the frailty of confinement hogs suggests that industrial hog biology is a socially constructed state that justifies the use of contract-based hog production units and their coordination with animal processors. The frailty of confinement hogs results from their genetic characteristics, from the conditions in which they are raised, and from a production rationality that equates animal health with production efficiency. I detail the multiple-site methods, confinement technologies, and contract-based production organization required to raise biologically fragile hogs. And I link hog biology directly to the unequal contract-based relations between actors in industrial pork networks. My study emphasizes the relevance of ethnographic analyses within a political economy of agriculture by describing specific relations of inequalities in local and regional production units and distribution networks that form the building blocks of larger global agro-food systems.

Presently it is more so than ever because of major demographic, economic, technological and scientific, climatic and territorial changes and uncertainties. There are various scenarios which might be envisaged for food-health relationships before global population size is expected to stabilize by about 2050, dependent on planetary health. These will reflect achieved food intakes which for many will not be optimal but realizable and food systems with varying degrees of safety, security and sustainability. Health patterns themselves are bound to continue to change from those associated with different levels of economic development to those which have more to do with locality, climate, education and equity. Every aspect of health is in some way intertwined with food and this will become more explicit. Decisions about food-health relationships will take into account the United Nations MDGs (Millennium Development Goals), but be strongly influenced by technology, affordability, sustainability and ethics.

Ethical questions in the field of pharmacogenetics	EJHP PRACTICE			English	Article						pharmacogenetics; ethical aspects; responsibility; (global) distributive justice	PATIENT; MEDICINE; DISEASE; RACE	This article, which is partly based on an article by Delden et al [1], discusses ethical issues which play a role in pharmacogenetics. Developments in pharmacogenetics have a big impact on many different areas, such as clinical trials, the practice of medicine and society at large. In clinical trials, questions arise regarding the exclusion of genetic subgroups that may be non- or poor-responders to the experimental drug. Also, there is the question of how pharmaceutical companies should deal with their growing knowledge about the relationship between genetic variation and adverse effects. Moreover, pharmacogenetics could provide disease-specific predictive information which could have a significant impact on the relationship between physicians, patients and their relatives in the practice of medicine. Here, issues also arise regarding responsibility of patients and physicians for health and disease. In society at large, the high cost of new pharmacogenetic possibilities leads to questions concerning equitable distribution at a national, as well as an international, level. It is concluded that in the near future, ethical research should be focused on the themes of responsibility, inclusion and exclusion and global justice.	[Bolt, Ineke L. L.

J	Dumez, B; Van Damme, K; Casteleyn, L				Dumez, Birgit; Van Damme, Karel; Casteleyn, Ludwine			Research on ethics in two large Human Biomonitoring projects ECNIS and NewGeneris: a bottom up approach	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Review							ISSUES	Assessment of ethical aspects and authorization by ethics committees have become a major constraint for health research including human subjects. Ethical reference values often are extrapolated from clinical settings, where emphasis lies on decisional autonomy and protection of individual's privacy. The question rises if this set of values used in clinical research can be considered as relevant references for HBM research, which is at the basis of public health surveillance. Current and future research activities using human biomarkers are facing new challenges and expectancies on sensitive socio-ethical issues. Reflection is needed on the necessity to balance individual rights against public interest. In addition, many HBM research programs require international collaboration. Domestic legislation is not always easily applicable in international projects. Also, there seem to be considerable inconsistencies in ethical assessments of similar research activities between different countries and even within one country. All this is causing delay and putting the researcher in situations in which it is unclear how to act in accordance with necessary legal requirements. Therefore, analysis of ethical practices and their consequences for HBM research is needed. This analysis will be performed by a bottom-up approach, based on a methodology for comparative analysis of determinants in ethical reasoning, allowing taking into account different social, cultural, political and historical traditions, in view of safeguarding common EU values. Based on information collected in real life complexity, paradigm cases and virtual case scenarios will be developed and discussed with relevant stakeholders to openly discuss possible obstacles and to identify options for improvement in regulation. The material collected will allow developing an ethical framework which may constitute the basis for a more harmonized and consistent socio-ethical and legal approach. This will not only increase the possibilities for comparison between data generated but may also allow for more equality in the protection of the rights of European citizens and establish trustful relationships between science and society, based on firmly rooted ethical values within the EU legislative framework. These considerations outline part of the research on legal, socio-ethical and communication aspects of HBM within the scope of ECNIS (NoE) and NewGeneris (IP).

A case study for maternal healthcare from Indonesia	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						human rights; maternal mortality; developing countries; Indonesia	MORTALITY; DISTRICTS; COMMUNITY; BARRIERS; PROGRAM; ACCESS	Background: Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high in developing countries despite international advocacy, development targets, and simple, affordable and effective interventions. In recent years, regard for maternal mortality as a human rights issue as well as one that pertains to health, has emerged. Objective: We study a case of maternal death using a theoretical framework derived from the right to health to examine access to and quality of maternal healthcare. Our objective was to explore the potential of rights-based frameworks to inform public health planning from a human rights perspective. Design: Information was elicited as part of a verbal autopsy survey investigating maternal deaths in rural settings in Indonesia. The deceased's relatives were interviewed to collect information on medical signs, symptoms and the social, cultural and health systems circumstances surrounding the death. Results: In this case, a prolonged, severe fever and a complicated series of referrals culminated in the death of a 19-year-old primagravida at 7 months gestation. The cause of death was acute infection. The woman encountered a range of barriers to access; behavioural, socio-cultural, geographic and economic. Several serious health system failures were also apparent. The theoretical framework derived from the right to health identified that none of the essential elements of the right were upheld. Conclusion: The rights-based approach could identify how and where to improve services. However, there are fundamental and inherent conflicts between the public health tradition (collective and preventative) and the right to health (individualistic and curative). As a result, and in practice, the right to health is likely to be ineffective for public health planning from a human rights perspective. Collective rights such as the right to development may provide a more suitable means to achieve equity and social justice in health planning.

Changes in diets following globalization contribute to the development of dental caries in emerging economies. The aim of this paper is to compare the cost and relative affordability of fluoride toothpaste in high-, middle- and low-income countries. The hypothesis is that fluoride toothpaste is not equally affordable in high-, middle- and low- income countries. Methods: Data on consumer prices of fluoride toothpastes were obtained from a self-completion questionnaire from 48 countries. The cost of fluoride toothpaste in high-, middle- and low- income countries was compared and related to annual household expenditure as well as to days of work needed to purchase the average annual usage of toothpaste per head. Results: The general trend seems to be that the proportion of household expenditure required to purchase the annual dosage of toothpaste increases as the country's per capita household expenditure decreases. While in the UK for the poorest 30% of the population only 0.037 days of household expenditure is needed to purchase the annual average dosage (182.5 g) of the lowest cost toothpaste, 10.75 days are needed in Kenya. The proportion of annual household expenditure ranged from 0.02% in the UK to 4% in Zambia to buy the annual average amount of lowest cost toothpaste per head. Conclusion: Significant inequalities in the affordability of this essential preventive care product indicate the necessity for action to make it more affordable. Various measures to improve affordability based on experiences from essential pharmaceuticals are proposed.

Detention of insolvent patients in Burundian hospitals	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Burundi; user fees; detention; cost-recovery; equity; access; human rights	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HEALTH-CARE; USER CHARGES; SERVICES; FEES; INSURANCE; QUALITY; EQUITY; ACCESS; ATTENDANCE	Between February and June 2006, Human Rights Watch and the Association for the Promotion of Human Rights and Detained Persons conducted an investigation into the detention of insolvent hospital patients in Burundi. Of 11 hospitals visited, nine were found to be holding former patients in detention for being unable to pay their hospital bills. Thirty-seven detained patients, and key informants in government, hospital administration and health services, were interviewed. The detention of insolvent hospital patients was described as a routine practice, dating from the 1990s. Conditions of detention included overcrowding, insufficient food and water, and withholding of further medical treatment. Seventy-two per cent of patients interviewed had been detained for 1 month or longer at the time of interview. Mechanisms designed to exempt or reimburse the health fees of low-income and indigent people failed to protect patients from becoming detained. The detention of insolvent patients is a clear violation of rights established under international law, including the right not to be arbitrarily detained or detained as debtors and the right to accessible health care. The abolition of user fees for women giving birth and for small children in May 2006 has reduced the number of detained patients, but in June 2006 we visited two hospitals and found 77 detained men, older children and women with other health problems. Burundi, with the support of the international community, must immediately stop the detention of patients and address the urgent financing needs of health facilities.

The description that follows looks at how the Cape Town Equity Gauge initiative, part of the Global Equity Gauge Alliance (GEGA) is endeavouring to tackle this problem. We give an overview of the first phase of our research in which we did an initial assessment of health status and the socio-economic determinants of health across the subdistrict health structures of Cape Town. We then describe two projects from the second phase of our research in which we move from research to action. The first project, the Equity Tools for Managers Project, engages with health managers to develop two tools to address inequity: an Equity Measurement Tool which quantifies inequity in health service provision in financial terms, and a Equity Resource Allocation Tool which advocates for and guides action to rectify inequity in health service provision. The second project, the Water and Sanitation Project, engages with community structures and other sectors to address the problem of diarrhoea in one of the poorest areas in Cape Town through the establishment of a community forum and a pilot study into the acceptability of dry sanitation toilets. Methods: A participatory approach was adopted. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. The first phase, the collection of measurements across the health subdistricts of Cape Town, used quantitative secondary data to demonstrate the inequities. In the Equity Tools for Managers Project further quantitative work was done, supplemented by qualitative policy analysis to study the constraints to implementing equity. The Water and Sanitation Project was primarily qualitative, using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. These were used to gain an understanding of the impact of the inequities, in this instance, inadequate sanitation provision. Results: The studies both demonstrate the value of adopting the GEGA approach of research to action, adopting three pillars of assessment and monitoring; advocacy; and community empowerment. In the Equity Tools for Managers Project study, the participation of managers meant that their support for implementation was increased, although the failure to include nurses and communities in the study was noted as a limitation. The development of a community Water and Sanitation Forum to support the Project had some notable successes, but also experienced some difficulties due to lack of capacity in both the community and the municipality. Conclusion: The two very different, but connected projects, demonstrate the value of adopting the GEGA approach, and the importance of involvement of all stakeholders at all stages. The studies also illustrate the potential of a research institution as informed 'outsiders', in influencing policy and practice.

J	Forster, R; Gabe, J				Forster, Rudolf; Gabe, Jonathan			Voice or choice? Patient and public involvement in the National Health Service in England under new labour	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							CARE DECISION-MAKING; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; USER INVOLVEMENT; CONSUMERISM; CITIZENSHIP; REFORM; POLICY	Involving patients, caregivers, and citizens in health care and health policy has been recommended by international organizations for over a decade. This article focuses on developments in England under New Labour, places them in the context of broader health policy, and assesses them in the light of the limited empirical evidence. The authors consider a range of possible explanations for these developments. They suggest that we need to distinguish between individual and collective forms of patient involvement, and they chart patient and public involvement in England before New Labour and in three distinct phases under New Labour. There has been a significant extension of opportunities for individual patients and the public to communicate their views, albeit with twists and turns in the policy over time. The authors explain these developments in terms of New Labour's ideological attachment to pragmatism and the Third Way, political calculations about the need to reinvigorate political culture, and attempts to enhance cost-effectiveness. Patient and public involvement seems to be here to stay, but whether this will result in greater equity and a real shift in power away from professionals to citizens and patients is another matter.

J	Bertell, R				Bertell, Rosalie			Chernobyl: An unbelievable failure to help	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article							RADIATION; BOMB	The disaster at the Chernobyl power reactor near Kiev, which began on April 26, 1986, was one of the world's worst industrial accidents. Yet the global community, usually most generous in its aid to a stricken community, has been slow to understand the scope of the disaster and reach out to the most devastated people of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. This article probes the causes of this confusion of perception and failure of response;, clearly the problem is one of communication. Has the International Atomic Energy Agency betrayed the victims of the Chernobyl disaster because of its plans to promote the "peaceful atom" nuclear program in the developing world'? Has the World Health Organization failed to provide clear, reliable information on the health effects resulting from the disaster? Are other historical problems or actors interfering with reasonable handling of the late effects of a nuclear disaster? Most importantly, what can be done to remedy this situation, to assist those most hurt by the late effects of Chernobyl and prevent such injustice in future? With the current promotion of nuclear energy as a "solution" to global climate change, we need to take a sober second look at the nuclear energy experiment and management of its hazards.

This paper articulates a framework for violence prevention in developing countries that is grounded in the knowledge gained from research and programmatic efforts in rich and in poor countries over several decades. This framework can be used by countries and funding agencies as a guide to building strong foundations for ongoing violence prevention efforts and for identifying violence prevention strategies most likely to be effective. The world has learned a lot about preventing violence and, without a doubt, there is a great deal more to learn. As a global community, however, it is not possible to wait for perfect solutions to these problems to act. The obligation is to act now to use the valuable knowledge that has been gained about violence prevention to improve the world.

J	Vanwesenbeeck, I				Vanwesenbeeck, Ine			Sexual Violence and the MDGs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEXUAL HEALTH			English	Article						Sexual violence; gender-based violence; sexual health; MDGs; international policies	WOMEN; HEALTH; RISK; RAPE	Sexual violence is multi-faceted. Three (overlapping) categories can be distinguished: violence that is sexual in nature, gender-based violence, and sexuality-based violence. The latter refers to violence against persons because of their sexuality and/or their (presumed) sexual behavior. Being female, young, poor, and living in a sexually conservative culture and/or in conflict areas appear to be important risk factors for sexual violence. Sexual violence is widespread (one in five girls worldwide are sexually abused in childhood and up to three-quarters of women in some countries have been victimized by a partner), but prevalence figures around the globe are hard to compare. Both the individual and society suffer from sexual violence. The eradication of sexual violence is directly relevant to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to infant and maternal health and mortality, and combating HIV/AIDS. And certainly no less important, it is very closely linked to the MDGs related to gender equality and the empowerment of women, poverty, and primary education for all. Campaigning against sexual violence against women has been presented as one of the 'quick wins' in progress towards achieving the MDGs by the UN Millennium Project. Many good practices have been employed in political-legal, awareness raising, prevention, and health care domains, but important setbacks are noteworthy as well. Priority number one for the World Association for Sexual Health now seems to be to adequately and strategically contribute to the continuous efforts to integrate sexual health into the Millennium Development framework.

J	Heimburger, A; Ward, V				Heimburger, Angela; Ward, Victoria			Putting the "S" Back into Sexual and Reproductive Health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEXUAL HEALTH			English	Article						Sexuality disconnect; sexual health; reproductive health; service providers; program managers; integration of services		Sexuality is the most fundamental aspect of our lives and yet it has long been the silent partner in sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Growing awareness of the rights-based approach to health, the commitment of governments and international bodies to promote sexual health and well-being, and the failure of many of the interventions to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic are helping the reproductive health community put the "S" back into SRH even as the Millennium Development Goals fail to address SRH directly. The disconnect is due to the fragmented, non-holistic approach to reproductive health, short-sightedness in neglecting violations like gender-based violence, a lack of training for students and health care professionals in sexuality, a dearth of indicators and sexuality research and discrimination against vulnerable groups like youth and sexually diverse populations. Recommendations include reaching consensus about the nexus between sexuality and reproductive health and strengthening the commitment to gender equity, empowerment, sexuality and sexual rights among policymakers. Ensuring that explicit and positive references to sexuality are universal, especially in comprehensive sexuality education, youth-focused programs and the integration of HIV and other SRH programs, and strengthening the ability of program managers and service providers to work on sexual health issues are key to successful integration and program sustainability. Strengthening understanding, acceptance and competence in serving sexually diverse populations and improving the research and evaluation specific to sexuality are longer processes, but equally important in the paradigm shift to non-stigmatizing, gender-equitable, rights-based, pleasurable sexual health services.

Environmental change, injustice and sustainability	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						bioethics; conflict; ecology; inequality; sustainability	HEALTH	This paper argues that a combination of increasing inequality, hypocrisy, population growth and adverse global environmental change imperils our civilisation. Selected examples of existing inequality and the immoral treatment of human beings are provided from countries of the Asia Pacific. There is also limited discussion of the global eco-social crisis, stressing the links between environmental scarcity and the human responses of resentment, conflict, terrorism and ill-governance. The essay contends that just as the lives of unborn humans similar to us are of interest and value to bio-ethicists, so too should be the lives and descendants of people who are unlike us, even if such people are perceived to be substantially different to ourselves in terms of status, culture and spending power. It is argued that it is in the interests of ourselves, society, and global civilisation that the lives of such people are considered and where possible improved in order to foster the "sustainability transition" needed to secure our collective future. The essay concludes with a discussion of an important element for securing our future: the development and implementation of alternative economic systems which will provide more accurate indicators of global progress.

Methods: Data from the Canadian national mental health survey were used to examine the gender-specific relationships between work stress dimensions and mental disorders in the working population (n = 24 277). Mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the World Mental Health-Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: In multivariate analysis, male workers who reported high demand and low control in the workplace were more likely to have had major depression (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.69) and any depressive or anxiety disorders ( OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.04) in the past 12 months. In women, high demand and low control was only associated with having any depressive or anxiety disorder (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.84). Job insecurity was positively associated with major depression in men but not in women. Imbalance between work and family life was the strongest factor associated with having mental disorders, regardless of gender. Conclusions: Policies improving the work environment may have positive effects on workers' mental health status. Imbalance between work and family life may be a stronger risk factor than work stress for mental disorders. Longitudinal studies incorporating important workplace health research models are needed to delineate causal relationships between work characteristics and mental disorders.

Environmental equity in air quality management: Local and international implications for human health and climate change	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES			English	Article							RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; PARTICULATE MATTER; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; MEXICO-CITY; SAO-PAULO; POLLUTION; MORTALITY; PARTICLES; RISK	The health burden of environmental exposures, including ambient air pollution and climate-change-related health impacts, is not equally distributed between or within regions and countries. These inequalities are currently receiving increased attention in environmental research as well as enhanced appreciation in environmental policy, where calls for environmental equity are more frequently heard. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 Global Update of the Air Quality Guidelines attempted to address the global-scale inequalities in exposures to air pollution and the burden of diseases due to air pollution. The guidelines stop short, however, of addressing explicitly the inequalities in exposure and adverse health effects within countries and urban areas due to differential distribution of sources of air pollution such as motor vehicles and local industry, and differences in susceptibility to the adverse health effects attributed to air pollution. These inequalities, may, however, be addressed in local air quality and land use management decisions. Locally, community-based participatory research can play an important role in documenting potential inequities and fostering corrective action. Research on environmental inequities will also benefit from current efforts to (1) better understand social determinants of health and (2) apply research evidence to reduce health disparities. Similarly, future research and policy action will benefit from stronger linkages between equity concerns related to health consequences of both air pollution exposure and climate change, since combustion products are important contributors to both of these environmental problems.

In the field of fishing safety policy, it is acknowledged that the development of a working legal framework of reference is a vital prior condition for the implementation of measures aimed at its improving safety. However, the research work on fishing safety does not have at disposal records of a sufficient number of accidents and in most cases is not comparable from one country to another. Moreover, there is no work that focuses on a global view of fishing safety. The aim of the present work is to outline the state-of-the-art in fishing safety. To this end, aspects of fishing safety which are a major concern of institutions, organizations and researchers Alike are analysed. Thus, several questions are addressed, such as: what institutional policy is given to the activity of the fishing sector to improve safety; what aspects and/or parameters are normally used to analyse fishing accidents; what is the usual spatial domain of this analysis; and what are the topics of the research carried out in fishing safety? The results of this analysis, among other aspects, identify eight specific lines of research followed in fishing safety and five which deal with aspects of safety at sea related to the fishing sector.

J	Crigger, NJ				Crigger, Nancy J.			Towards a viable and just global nursing ethics	NURSING ETHICS			English	Article						ethics; global ethics; justice in health care; nursing ethics	HUMAN-RIGHTS; BIOETHICS; JUSTICE	Globalization, an outgrowth of technology, while informing us about people throughout the world, also raises our awareness of the extreme economic and social disparities that exist among nations. As part of a global discipline, nurses are vitally interested in reducing and eliminating disparities so that better health is achieved for all people. Recent literature in nursing encourages our discipline to engage more actively with social justice issues. Justice in health care is a major commitment of nursing; thus questions in the larger sphere of globalization, justice and ethics, are our discipline's questions also. Global justice, or fairness, is not an issue for some groups or institutions, but a deeper human rights issue that is a responsibility for everyone. What can we do to help reduce or eliminate the social and economic disparities that are so evident? What kind of ethical milieu is needed to address the threat that globalization imposes on justice and fairness? This article enriches the conceptualization of globalization by investigating recent work by Schweiker and Twiss. In addition, I discuss five qualities or characteristics that will facilitate the development of a viable and just global ethic. A global ethic guides all people in their response to human rights and poverty. Technology and business, two major forces in globalization that are generally considered beneficial, are critiqued as barriers to social justice and the common good.

J	McGann, S				McGann, Susan			Collaboration and Conflict in International Nursing, 1920-39	NURSING HISTORY REVIEW			English	Article								After the devastation brought about by World War I and the accompanying collapse of the political order in many countries in Europe, there was a general desire to create a new and more humane social order. Supranational institutions like the League of Nations, the International Labor Organization, and the Court of International justice were set up to encourage international collaboration and the sharing of scientific knowledge. The League of Red Cross Societies was formed to address the problems of refugees, starvation, and disease in much of Europe, but it needed nurses who were trained in public health to lead the work. In the absence of nurses with appropriate training, the league decided to organize an international course in London for nurses who would be able to direct its public health work in Europe. This article analyzes how the organization of these international courses in public health for nurses involved the Red Cross movement, the College of Nursing in Britain, the University of London, the International Council of Nurses, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the leaders of nursing in North America. At one level the story is about the international students themselves, the hundreds of nurses from all over the world who came to London to take the courses. The shared experience of each year group led to the founding of the "Old Internationals," the alumnae association, which became an international network and survived the disruptions of World War II. At another level, the story is about the role of nurses in the development of public health services at a time when the field was expanding rapidly. The public health field had no boundaries, and there was no consensus about the best method of training nurses or others for the work. Within nursing, the debate was around whether the training should be completely separate from existing nursing courses, with the emphasis on preventive rather than curative medicine. This debate took place against the background of the competing ideologies of the North Americans and the British about nurse education in general. The tension between these two powerful cultures was also about their vision of nursing. The British believed that traditional hospital-based apprenticeship training was important to inculcate the spirit of service essential in a good nurse, while the Americans believed that nurses needed a modern college-based education if nursing was to hold its own as a profession in the modern world. Ultimately the fate of the international courses was decided by the outcome of this struggle for international hegemony between the American and the British nursing leaders.(1)	Royal Coll Nursing UK, Edinburgh EH9 2HH, Midlothian, Scotland		McGann, S (corresponding author), Royal Coll Nursing UK, 42 S Oswald Rd, Edinburgh EH9 2HH, Midlothian, Scotland.	susan.mcgann@rcn.org.uk							24	8	11	1	15	SPRINGER PUBLISHING CO	NEW YORK	11 WEST 42ND STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10036 USA	1062-8061			NURS HIST REV	Nurs.

Workers' control and workplace democratization became the focus of social movements among labor union activists and scientists. The concepts of workers' control, workers' collectivity, and the "limits of adaptation" formed the deep underpinnings of the model. Work changed dramatically with the advent of globalization and flexibilization. Neoliberal globalization has resulted in growing social inequality and an increasing imbalance of political power between economic elites and the working class. Earlier efforts to democratize worklife have been rolled back along with many of the social protections of the Keynesian era. At the same time, new transnational social movements have arisen. Does the demand-control-support model continue to have relevance today? The paper argues that core elements, namely, the intensification of effort, power, and collectivity, continue to provide important ways of viewing the human impact of neoliberal globalization.

J	Faria, C				Faria, Caroline			Privileging prevention, gendering responsibility: an analysis of the Ghanaian campaign against HIV/AIDS	SOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						HIV/AIDS; Ghana; gender; public health; discourse	COMPETING DISCOURSES; HIV AIDS; WOMEN; GEOGRAPHY; HEALTH; EPIDEMIC; DISEASE	This article focuses on the discourses around HIV/AIDS in the national Ghanaian 'Stop AIDS Love Life!' public health campaign, within non-governmental HIV/AIDS publications, and the Ghanaian national print media. I have used critical discourse analysis to interpret and deconstruct a range of these social texts collected between June and September of 2001 and 2003 in and around Greater Accra, Ghana. I argue, firstly, that these discourses are shaped by an international politics of funding for HIV/AIDS that privileges prevention through behaviour change over treatment action under the premise that prevention is a more cost-effective option for the Global South. I critique this stance, highlighting the emerging possibilities for integrated prevention-treatment efforts in resource-poor settings such as Ghana. Secondly, I argue that the discourses around HIV/AIDS presented in prevention campaign materials powerfully construct normative and gendered subjectivities with assigned roles and responsibilities. The fight against HIV/AIDS is constructed as a national project in which an idealized, and often very young, female citizen is positioned as educator, volunteer, carer and protector of herself and society. This discursive coding of responsibility places the many burdens of HIV upon some of the most vulnerable in society, ignoring the structural constraints of gender, generational and economic inequality. I conclude my paper by arguing that efforts to reduce transmission rates, stigma, and the burden of care for those living with HIV/AIDS in Ghana must integrate both preventative efforts and treatment action. Where prevention campaigns are utilized I suggest that these must recognize the limitations of behaviour change initiatives that primarily target women and acknowledge the gendered constraints faced by those very subjects identified as responsible for the protection and education of the nation.

J	Wight, D				Wight, Daniel			Most of our social scientists are not institution based... they are there for hire - Research consultancies and social science capacity for health research in East Africa	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						sub-Saharan Africa; research capacity; health social sciences; research consultancies; knowledge economy; east African universities	RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS; NORTH; SOUTH	There is a serious shortage of senior African social scientists to lead health-related research in Africa. This is despite the existence of many African social science graduates, and decades of Northern funded research programmes intended to develop local capacity. To investigate the barriers to developing health social science research capacity in East Africa, 29 in-depth interviews, informal conversations and a group discussion were conducted with professionals in this field. Respondents' explanations for inadequate social science research capacity primarily related to under-development and global economic inequalities. However, a recurrent theme was the predominance of individually contracted research consultancies. These seem to divert university staff from academic research, supporting colleagues and training the next generation of researchers, stunt the institutional capacity of university departments, restrict the sharing of research findings and perpetuate donors' control of the research agenda. Although primarily due to macro-economic factors, limited research capacity in sub-Saharan Africa might be ameliorated by modifying the process by which much research is conducted. This exploratory study suggests that institutional research capacity might be strengthened if consultancy research were commissioned through institutions, rather than individuals, with the payment of substantial overheads.

With the engagement of companies such as American Express, Coverse, Gap and Emporio Armani, and now Hallmark, Dell and Microsoft, consumers can help HIV/AIDS patients in Africa. Aid celebrities-Bono, Jeffrey Sachs and Paul Farmer guarantee the 'cool quotient', the management and the target of this new, modality of aid. RED functions using the guarantee of celebrity together with the negotiated representation of a distant 'Africa' to meet competing, and perhaps incommensurable, objectives. A 'rock mans burden'- imagined along familiar constructions of sex, gender, race and place-frames African beneficiaries' receiving process. At the same time, RED depicts consumer-citizens as fashion-conscious yet actively engaged and ethically reflexive. RED rescues international aid from its dour predictive graphs and disappointing 'lessons learnt' and spins it as voting, chic and possible. BY masking the social and environmental relations of trade and production that underpin poverty, inequality and disease, RED reconfigures the world of possibility in what might otherwise be rationally impossible ways.

One strand of this research has investigated the role of neighbourhood access to retail provision of healthy and affordable food. In this national study we used Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to examine the association between food retail (supermarkets, convenience stores and fast food outlets) and licensed alcohol outlet locations, and an area measure of deprivation for urban neighbourhoods across New Zealand. We found that contrary to the international evidence, for all outlet types, access to a range of retail options tended to be better in more deprived neighbourhoods. The implications of this socio-spatial distribution of food and alcohol retailing in reducing health inequalities are discussed.

J	O'Hara, S; Hannan, T; Genina, M				O'Hara, Sarah; Hannan, Tim; Genina, Maria			Assessing access to safe water and monitoring progress on MDG7 target 10 (access to safe water and basic sanitation): Lessons from Kazakhstan	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Kazakhstan; Millennium development goals; water and sanitation	MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; HEALTH	The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), designed to combat global poverty and hunger, protect the environment, improve health and sanitation and promote education and gender equality, were agreed at the UN Millennium Summit in September 2000. The importance of access to clean water in the overall MDG process has been highlighted and shown to contribute to all other goals and targets. Goal 7 target 10 aims to "halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation", compared with 1990. The aim of this MDG is clear and considered to be achievable in most countries. However, it is argued that the base data upon which the targets are set and against which progress will be measured can be problematic, partly because of reliance on poor government information and also on the apparent need of the UN to have a consistent base year and set of definitions across the world. In this paper, we report the findings of a major water and sanitation survey conducted in Kazakhstan designed specifically to quantify the current level of access, providing the base upon which to determine implementation priorities and against which to measure progress. As well as providing country-specific information the survey highlighted several important issues that have more general relevance. We raise three major questions associated with Target 10: how to define "access", how to define "improved source" or "improved sanitation" and whether 1990 is always an appropriate base year. Moreover, we argue that there is need to reconsider the way progress is monitored and that the focus on global comparisons is detrimental to making real progress. In conclusion we argue that improving water supply and sanitation can be done in a way that is (1) appropriate for the country, (2) feasible (and fairly easy) to monitor progress and (3) more likely to be accepted by government as there is a sense of relevance.

BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article								Background: The benefits of genomics and biotechnology are concentrated primarily in the industrialized world, while their potential to combat neglected diseases in the developing world has been largely untapped. Without building developing world biotechnology capacity to address local health needs, this disparity will only intensify. To assess the potential of genomics to address health needs in the developing world, the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health, along with local partners, organized five courses on Genomics and Public Health Policy in the developing world. The overall objective of the courses was to collectively explore how to best harness genomics to improve health in each region. This article presents and analyzes the recommendations from all five courses. Discussion: In this paper we analyze recommendations from 232 developing world experts from 58 countries who sought to answer how best to harness biotechnology to improve health in their regions. We divide their recommendations into four categories: science; finance; ethics, society and culture; and politics. Summary: The Courses' recommendations can be summarized across the four categories listed above: Science: - Collaborate through national, regional, and international networks - Survey and build capacity based on proven models through education, training, and needs assessments Finance: - Develop regulatory and intellectual property frameworks for commercialization of biotechnology - Enhance funding and affordability of biotechnology - Improve the academic-industry interface and the role of small and medium enterprise Ethics, Society, Culture: - Develop public engagement strategies to inform and educate the public about developments in genomics and biotechnology - Develop capacity to address ethical, social and cultural issues - Improve accessibility and equity Politics: - Strengthen understanding, leadership and support at the political level for biotechnology - Develop policies outlining national biotechnology strategy These recommendations provide guidance for all those interested in supporting science, technology, and innovation to improve health in the developing world. Applying these recommendations broadly across sectors and regions will empower developing countries themselves to harness the benefits of biotechnology and genomics for billions who have long been excluded.

Below, I analyze ethical issues surrounding one of gene transfer's most widely praised studies conducted to date: in this study, Italian investigators recruited two subjects from the developing world who were ineligible for standard of care because of economic considerations. Though the study seems to have rendered a cure in these two subjects, it does not appear to have complied with various international guidelines that require that clinical trials conducted in the developing world be responsive to their populations' health needs. Nevertheless, policies devised to address large scale, late stage trials, such as the AZT short-course placebo trials, map somewhat awkwardly to early phase studies. I argue that interest in conducting translational research in the developing world, particularly in the context of hemophilia trials, should motivate more rigorous ethical thinking around clinical trials involving economically disadvantaged populations.

Climate change and global health: Quantifying a growing ethical crisis	ECOHEALTH			English	Review						biofuels; built environment; cobenefits; CO2 emissions; food security; global warming; equity; natural debt; malaria; malnutrition	BURDEN; EQUITY	Climate change, as an environmental hazard operating at the global scale, poses a unique and "involuntary exposure" to many societies, and therefore represents possibly the largest health inequity of our time. According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), regions or populations already experiencing the most increase in diseases attributable to temperature rise in the past 30 years ironically contain those populations least responsible for causing greenhouse gas warming of the planet. Average global carbon emissions approximate one metric ton per year (tC/yr) per person. In 2004, United States per capita emissions neared 6 tC/yr (with Canada and Australia not far behind), and Japan and Western European countries range from 2 to 5 tC/yr per capita. Yet developing countries' per capita emissions approximate 0.6 tC/yr, and more than 50 countries are below 0.2 tC/yr (or 30-fold less than an average American). This imbalance between populations suffering from an increase in climate-sensitive diseases versus those nations producing greenhouse gases that cause global warming can be quantified using a "natural debt" index, which is the cumulative depleted CO2 emissions per capita. This is a better representation of the responsibility for current warming than a single year's emissions. By this measure, for example, the relative responsibilities of the U.S. in relation to those of India or China is nearly double that using an index of current emissions, although it does not greatly change the relationship between India and China. Rich countries like the U.S. have caused much more of today's warming than poor ones, which have not been emitting at significant levels for many years yet, no matter what current emissions indicate. Along with taking necessary measures to reduce the extent of global warming and the associated impacts, society also needs to pursue equitable solutions that first protect the most vulnerable population groups; be they defined by demographics, income, or location. For example, according to the WHO, 88% of the disease burden attributable to climate change afflicts children under age 5 (obviously an innocent and "nonconsenting" segment of the population), presenting another major axis of inequity. Not only is the health burden from climate change itself greatest among the world's poor, but some of the major mitigation approaches to reduce the degree of warming may produce negative side effects disproportionately among the poor, for example, competition for land from biofuels creating pressure on food prices. Of course, in today's globalized world, eventually all nations will share some risk, but underserved populations will suffer first and most strongly from climate change. Moreover, growing recognition that society faces a nonlinear and potentially irreversible threat has deep ethical implications about humanity's stewardship of the planet that affect both rich and poor.

Rose			Building international Indigenous people's partnerships for community-driven health initiatives	ECOHEALTH			English	Article						community-driven health initiative; international Indigenous people's partnership; community-based participatory research; Indigenous research ethics; Indigenous knowledge; knowledge transfer; capacity-building	KNOWLEDGE; WISDOM	In this article we present an international Indigenous people's partnership project co-led by two Indigenous communities, Musqueam (Coast Salish, Canada) and Totoras (Quichua, Ecuador), as a community-driven health initiative. The Musqueam-Totoras partnership includes Indigenous organizations, universities, international agencies, government, and nongovernmental organizations to address Indigenous health concerns in both communities. Our collaborative approach provides a framework to (a) increase the development expertise of Indigenous people internationally, (b) increase skills among all participants, and (c) facilitate Indigenous knowledge mobilization and translation to promote cultural continuity. This international Indigenous people's partnership between north and south reflects the diversity and commonalities of Indigenous knowledge, contributes to cultural revitalization, and minimizes the impact of assimilation, technology, and globalization. Indigenous people's partnerships contribute to self-determination, which is a prerequisite to the building and maintenance of healthy communities and the promotion of social justice. The exchange of Indigenous knowledge upholds Indigenous values of respect, reciprocity, relevance, and responsibility. Given the history of colonization and the negligence of governments in the exercising of these values with respect to Indigenous communities, this contemporary exchange among Indigenous people in the Americas serves to reclaim these values and practices. International cooperation empowering Indigenous people and other marginalized groups has become fundamental for their advancement and participation in globalized economies. An international Indigenous people's partnership provides opportunities for sharing cultural, historical, social, environmental, and economic factors impacting Indigenous health. These partnerships also create beneficial learning experiences in community-based participatory research and community-driven health initiatives, provide culturally sensitive research ethics frameworks, increase capacity building, and address basic human needs identified by participating communities.

A review for health policymakers	HEALTH POLICY			English	Review						health inequalities; population health; socio-economic gradients; policy intervention	MORTALITY DIFFERENCES; GLOBAL BURDEN; EVIDENCE BASE; SOCIAL-CLASS; INEQUALITIES; DETERMINANTS; FRAMEWORK; DISEASE; EQUITY; BIRTH	While many societies have made remarkable progress in population health improvements, health inequalities remain as a central concern to health policy. There is substantial evidence to show that differences in health achievements and access to health care are increasing both within and among societies. Socio-economic and environmental health determinants are strongly associated to population health status regardless of what risk factor or technological advance is in vogue. Understanding the fundamental causes underlying the existence of health inequalities is useful for guiding health policy as it provides a direction to guide resource allocation and the targeting of policy interventions. The purpose of this paper is to review current perspectives and methods in the assessment of health inequalities with particular relevance to public health policymakers and practitioners.

Comparing health inequalities across time and place-rate ratios and rate differences lead to different conclusions: analysis of cross-sectional data from 22 countries 1991-2001	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						health inequalities; international comparisons; ranking; measurement; under-five mortality	SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; WESTERN-EUROPE; MORTALITY; MORBIDITY	Background Socio-economic inequalities in health within countries are a key public health issue. It is important that we can effectively make international comparisons of the level of inequalities and assess trends over time. We investigate how the results of such comparisons can differ depending on whether inequality is quantified using the rate ratio or rate difference. Methods We examine levels and trends in inequality in under-five mortality using data from 22 low/lower-middle income countries [Africa (11), Latin America/ Caribbean (5), Asia (6)], each with two Demographic and Health Surveys between 1991 and 2001. Within-country inequalities are quantified using the rate ratio and rate difference. Results Ranking countries by their level of inequality at one point in time differed, sometimes substantially, according to whether the rate ratio or difference was used (Spearman's rank correlation = 0.49). Similarly, ranking countries according to the magnitude and direction of change in inequality over time depended on the measure used. Importantly from a policy perspective, in five countries the direction of change was in the opposite direction (increase vs decline in inequality) when using the ratio compared with the difference measure. Conclusions The results of comparisons of the magnitude of health inequalities between countries and over time depend upon whether the rate ratio or rate difference is used. When statements are made comparing the size of inequalities it should be made completely clear whether these are measured on an absolute or relative scale. if the substantive conclusions differ according to the measure used this should be clearly stated. in this situation emphasis should only be given to results based on one summary measure if this can be clearly and explicitly justified in the context.

It has long been recognised that individuals with ID or mental-health needs who break the law should be dealt with differently from the general population. There have been an increasing number of empirical studies in this area; however, these have been plagued by various definitional and methodological issues. Prevalence estimates of offenders with ID are complicated by diagnostic variations and inconsistencies in the criminal justice process. International studies have shown a large range, from 2% to 40%, depending on methodological approaches. The following review will highlight the salient issues including prevalence of offending, characteristics of offenders, vulnerabilities within the legal system, assessment, and a brief overview of intervention and treatment approaches.

This paper addresses the need to integrate a gender perspective into epidemiological studies on migration and health, outlines conceptual gaps and discusses some methodological problems. We mainly consider the international voluntary migrant. Women may emigrate as wives or as workers in a labour market in which they face double segregation, both as migrants and as women. We highlight migrant women's heightened vulnerability to situations of violence, as well as important gaps in our knowledge of the possible differential health effects of factors such as poverty, unemployment, social networks and support, discrimination, health behaviours and use of services. We provide an overview of the problems of characterising migrant populations in the health information systems, and of possible biases in the health effects caused by failure to take the triple dimension of gender, social class and ethnicity into account.

Going beyond <i>The three worlds of welfare capitalism</i>:: regime theory and public health research	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							WELFARE-STATE; WORLDS; DECOMMODIFICATION; INEQUALITIES; COUNTRIES; POLITICS; SERVICES; BRITAIN; LIFE; EAST	International research on the social determinants of health has increasingly started to integrate a welfare state regimes perspective. Although this is to be welcomed, to date there has been an over-reliance on Esping-Andersen's The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology ( 1990). This is despite the fact that it has been subjected to extensive criticism and that there are in fact a number of competing welfare state typologies within the comparative social policy literature. The purpose of this paper is to provide public health researchers with an up-to-date overview of the welfare state regime literature so that it can be reflected more accurately in future research. It outlines The three worlds of welfare capitalism typology, and it presents the criticisms it received and an overview of alternative welfare state typologies. It concludes by suggesting new avenues of study in public health that could be explored by drawing upon this broader welfare state regimes literature.

This article assesses the ways in which the individual human right to health has evolved to meet collective threats to the public's health. Despite its repeated expansions, the individual right to health remains normatively incapable of addressing the injurious societal ramifcations of economic globalization, advancing individual rights to alleviate collective inequalities in underlying determinants of health. By examining modern changes to underlying determinants of health, this article concludes that responding to globalized health threats necessitates a collective right to public health.

We construct predicted mortality using preintervention mortality rates from various diseases and dates of global interventions. Predicted mortality has a large impact on changes in life expectancy starting in 1940 but no effect before 1940. Using predicted mortality as an instrument, we find that a 1 percent increase in life expectancy leads to a 1.7-2 percent increase in population. Life expectancy has a much smaller effect on total GDP, however. Consequently, there is no evidence that the large increase in life expectancy raised income per capita.

In analyzing labeling as a technology made up of artifacts, acts, and social organization, this article asks, Can one visually distinguish labels signifying real social and environmental improvements from industry blue/greenwash and typical products? Using the techniques of visual sociology in a grounded-theory-style investigation of a variety of supermarket-available blue/green products, the author identifies five strategies to see shades. She then tests the salience of these visual indicators with a population of coffees from six Pacific Northwest supermarkets. Theoretically, she explores the labeling technology's potential to facilitate conscientious consumption and reshape how social and environmental relationships are represented, regulated, seen, and experienced in a capitalist economy.

J	Pampel, F				Pampel, Fred			National income, inequality and global patterns of cigarette use	SOCIAL FORCES			English	Article							TOBACCO USE; GENDER DIFFERENCES; SMOKING; HEALTH; COUNTRIES; WOMEN	Declining tobacco use in high-income nations and rising tobacco use in low- and middle-income nations raises questions about the sources of worldwide patterns of smoking. Theories posit a curvilinear influence of national income based on the balance of affordability and health-cost effects. In addition, however, economic inequality, gender inequality and government policies may moderate the rise and fall in smoking prevalence with national income, This study tests these arguments using aggregate data for 145 nations and measures of smoking prevalence circa 2000. The results show nonlinear effects of national income for males that take the form of an inverted U, but show linear effects for females. They also show non-additive effects of economic inequality for males that moderate both the rise and decline of smoking with national income and non-additive effects of gender equality for females that moderate the positive effect of national income.

There are now at least 10 such organisations, with more than 500 medical students participating at a local or national level each year. Student international health organisations can deliver short- and long-term benefits to developing countries, while equipping students with skills such as leadership, teamwork and cultural sensitivity. Activities include delivery of medical equipment, fundraising, educating university communities, and acting as advocates for social justice. We believe Australian medical schools must formally incorporate international health into their curricula, drawing upon the experiences of schools in Europe and North America.

The Professionalism Charter Project awarded grants to five academic health centers (AHCs) in support of campus initiatives aimed at implementing the charter's commitments to patient welfare, autonomy, and social justice. One of those centers, the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB), was already deeply involved in a professionalism initiative under the leadership of university president Dr. John Stobo, who had led ABIM's Project Professionalism some years earlier. The authors describe the influence of that initiative on UTMB's professionalism journey, from Stobo's appointment in 1997 to the latest actions undertaken to extend the charter campus-wide, binding all members of the university community to its principles and commitments. They reiterate challenges to professionalism well known to readers of this journal (e.g., the insidious influence of the hidden curriculum) and detail programs undertaken to address those challenges, stressing UTMB's campus-wide approach to interdisciplinary collaboration. Assessment of, and accountability for, professional behavior are key features of UTMB's approach, and particular attention is given to the decisions, circumstances, and programs involved in making the charter relevant, not only to physicians, but to each member of the AHC community. Finally, the authors offer a list of lessons learned along the way.

J	Okorafor, OA; Thomas, S				Okorafor, Okore A.; Thomas, Stephen			Protecting resources for primary health care under fiscal federalism: options for resource allocation	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						decentralization; financing; fiscal federalism; primary health care; resource allocation	DECENTRALIZATION; LESSONS	The introduction of fiscal federalism or decentralization of functions to lower levels of government is a reform not done primarily with health sector concerns. A major concern for the health sector is that devolution of expenditure responsibilities to sub-national levels of government can adversely affect the equitable distribution of financial resources across local jurisdictions. Since the adoption of fiscal federalism in South Africa, progress towards achieving a more equitable distribution of public sector health resources (financial) has slowed down considerably. This study attempts to identify appropriate resource allocation mechanisms under the current South African fiscal federal system that could be employed to promote equity in primary health care (PHC) allocations across provinces and districts. The study uses data from interviews with government officials involved in the budgeting and resource allocation process for PHC, literature on fiscal federalism and literature on international experience to inform analysis and recommendations. The results from the study identify historical incremental budgeting, weak managerial capacity at lower levels of government, poor accounting of PHC expenditure, and lack of protection for PHC funds as constraints to the realization of a more equitable distribution of PHC allocations. Based on interview data, no one resource allocation mechanism received unanimous support from stakeholders. However, the study highlights the particularly high level of autonomy enjoyed by provincial governments with regards to decision making for allocations to health and PHC services as the major constraint to achieving a more equitable distribution of PHC resources. The national government needs to have more involvement in decision making for resource allocation to PHC services if significant progress towards equity is to be achieved.

The metabolic syndrome - A global challenge for prevention	HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH			English	Review						metabolic syndrome; global health; prevention; type 2 diabetes; intervention	IMPAIRED GLUCOSE-TOLERANCE; TYPE-2 DIABETES-MELLITUS; LIFE-STYLE INTERVENTION; KAPPA-B ACTIVATION; ADIPOQ GENE; STRESS; REDUCTION; OBESITY; ASSOCIATION; DEPRESSION	In the last years we have learned a lot about the pathopysiology of a cluster of the diseases called Metabolic Syndrome but currently an exciting discussion debates the Metabolic Syndrome in a light of a mystery of medicine or a clinical paradigm with a controversary about diagnostic, treatment or preventive procedure. There is now convincing evidence that prevention is the most important and effective way to reduce the personal and socio-economic burden of the Metabolic Syndrome and its associated complications.Still, it is currently not clear how to implement preventive interventions into clinical practice but will require an integrated and transdisciplinary approach on an international level in order to efficiently reduce premature morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, global strategies are still lacking but are needed to tackle inequalities in health between industrialized countries and the developing world. A global health strategy has to take into account political, epidemiological, environmental, infrastructural and genetic aspects. The Metabolic Syndrome is not a mystery - it is a clinical paradigm and global challenge.

Methods: In Nouakchott, the Ministry of Health instituted Obstetric Risk Insurance to allow obstetric risk sharing among all pregnant women on a voluntary basis. The fixed premium (US$21.60) entitles women to an obstetric package including EmOC and hospital care as well as post-natal care. The poorest are enrolled at no charge, addressing the problem of equity. Results: 95% of pregnant women in the catchment area (48.3% of the city's deliveries) enrolled. Utilization rates increased over the 3-year period of implementation causing quality of care to decline. Basic and comprehensive EmOC are now provided 24/7. The program has generated US$382,320 in revenues, more than twice as much as current user fees. All recurrent costs other than salaries are covered. Conclusion: This innovative sustainable financing scheme guarantees access to obstetric care to all women at an affordable cost. (c) 2007 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

Perceived socioeconomic status: A new type of identity that influences adolescents' self-rated health	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH			English	Article						socioeconomic status; self-rated health; health disparities	SUBJECTIVE SOCIAL-STATUS; INCOME INEQUALITY; DETERMINANTS; MULTILEVEL; PATHWAYS	Purpose: The cognitive, social, and biological transitions of adolescence suggest that subjective perceptions of social position based on the socioeconomic hierarchy may undergo important changes during this period; yet how such perceptions develop is poorly understood, and no studies have assessed whether changes in such perceptions influence adolescents' health. This study describes adolescents' subjective perceptions of familial socioeconomic status (SSS), how SSS changes over time, and how age, race, and objective socioeconomic status (SES) indicators influence SSS. In addition, the study determines whether SSS independently influences adolescents' self-rated health, an important predictor of morbidity and health service use. Methods: A total of 1179 non-Hispanic black and white baseline 7-12th graders from a Midwestern public school district completed a validated, teen-specific measure of SSS annually for 4 consecutive years. A parent provided information on SES. Markov modeling assessed transitions in SSS over time. Results: SSS declined with age (p =.001) and stabilized among older teens. In addition to age, SES and race, but not gender, were significant correlates of SSS, but the relationships between these factors were complex. In cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, black teens from families with low parent education had higher SSS than white teens from similarly educated families, whereas white teens from highly educated families had higher SSS than black teens from highly educated families. Lower SSS and changes in SSS predicted poor self-rated health even when adjusting for race and objective SES measures. Conclusion: Subjective evaluations of socioeconomic status predict adolescents' global health ratings even when adjusting for the sociodemographic factors that shape them.

J	Soares, RR				Soares, Rodrigo R.			Health and the evolution of welfare across Brazilian municipalities	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS			English	Article						life expectancy; mortality; welfare; inequality; Brazil	MORTALITY	This paper describes the pattern of reductions in mortality across Brazilian municipalities between 1970 and 2000, and analyzes its causes and consequences. It shows that, as in the international context, the relationship between income and life expectancy has shifted consistently in the recent past. But reductions in mortality within Brazil have been more homogeneously distributed than across countries. We use a compensating differentials approach to estimate the value of the observed reductions in mortality. The results suggest that gains in life expectancy had a welfare value equivalent to 39% of the growth in income per capita, being therefore responsible for 28% of the overall improvement in welfare. We then use a dynamic panel to conduct a preliminary assessment of the potential determinants of these gains. We show that improvements in education, access to water, and sanitation seem to be important determinants of the dimension of changes in life expectancy not correlated with income.

Method: Based on information about prevalence of exposure and risk relations for more than 80 disease categories, deaths, years of life lost, and hospitalizations attributable to substance use and misuse were estimated. In addition, substance-attributable fractions for criminal justice expenditures were derived. Indirect costs were estimated using a modified human capital approach. Results: Costs of substance use and misuse totaled almost Can. $40 billion in 2002. The total cost per capita for substance use and misuse was about Can. $1,267: Can. $463 for alcohol, Can. $262 for illegal drugs, and Can. $541 for tobacco. Legal substances accounted for the vast majority of these costs (tobacco: almost 43% of total costs; alcohol: 37%). Indirect costs or productivity losses were the largest cost category (61%), followed by health care (22%) and law enforcement costs (14%). More than 40,000 people died in Canada in 2002 because of substance use and misuse: 37,209 deaths were attributable to tobacco, 4,258 were attributable to alcohol, and 1,695 were attributable to illegal drugs. A total of about 3.8 million hospital days were attributable to substance use and misuse, again mainly to tobacco. Conclusions: Substance use and misuse imposes a considerable economic toll on Canadian society and requires more preventive efforts.

Future Hlth Syst Innovations	Exploring health systems research and its influence on policy processes in low income countries	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							DECISION-MAKERS; PUBLIC-POLICY; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; IMPLEMENTATION; COMMUNICATION; EFFICIENCY; FAIRNESS; PROGRAMS; SCIENCE	Background: The interface between research and policymaking in low-income countries is highly complex. The ability of health systems research to influence policy processes in such settings face numerous challenges. Successful analysis of the research-policy interface in these settings requires understanding of contextual factors as well as key influences on the interface. Future Health Systems (FHS): Innovations for Equity is a consortium conducting research in six countries in Asia and Africa. One of the three cross-country research themes of the consortium is analysis of the relationship between research ( evidence) and policy making, especially their impact on the poor; insights gained in the initial conceptual phase of FHS activities can inform the global knowledge pool on this subject. Discussion: This paper provides a review of the research-policy interface in low-income countries and proposes a conceptual framework, followed by directions for empirical approaches. First, four developmental perspectives are considered: social institutional factors; virtual versus grassroots realities; science-society relationships; and construction of social arrangements. Building on these developmental perspectives three research-policy interface entry points are identified: 1. Recognizing policy as complex processes; 2. Engaging key stakeholders: decision-makers, providers, scientists, and communities; and 3. Enhancing accountability. A conceptual framework with three entry points to the research-policy interface - policy processes; stakeholder interests, values, and power; and accountability - within a context provided by four developmental perspectives is proposed. Potential empirical approaches to the research-policy interface are then reviewed. Finally, the value of such innovative empirical analysis is considered. Conclusion: The purpose of this paper is to provide the background, conceptual framework, and key research directions for empirical activities focused on the research-policy interface in low income settings. The interface can be strengthened through such analysis leading to potential improvements in population health in low-income settings. Health system development cognizant of the myriad factors at the research-policy interface can form the basis for innovative future health systems.

Design Observational study. Setting 126 countries of the world for which complete data on income inequality and mortality by age and sex were available around the year 2002 (including 94.4% of world human population). Data sources Data on mortality were from the World Health Organization and income data were taken from the annual reports of the United Nations Development Programme. Main outcome measures Mortality in 5-year age bands for each sex by income inequality and income level. Results At ages 15-29 and 25-39 variations in income inequality seem more closely correlated with mortality worldwide than do variations in material wealth. This relation is especially strong among the poorest countries in Africa. Mortality is higher for a given level of overall income in more unequal nations. Conclusions Income inequality seems to have an influence worldwide, especially for younger adults. Social inequality seems to have a universal negative impact on health.

A critical but underinvestigated question for planning and allocating resources toward the MDGs is how interventions related to one MDG might affect progress toward other goals. Objectives To estimate the reduction in child mortality as a result of interventions related to the environmental and nutritional MDGs (improving child nutrition and providing clean water, sanitation, and fuels) and to estimate how the magnitude and distribution of the effects of interventions vary based on the economic status of intervention recipients. Design, Setting, and Population Population-level comparative risk assessment modeling the mortality effects of interventions on child nutrition and environmental risk factors, stratified by economic status. Data on economic status, child underweight, water and sanitation, and household fuels were from the nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys for 42 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Data on disease-specific child mortality were from the World Health Organization. Data on the hazardous effects of each MDG-related risk factor were from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies. Main Outcome Measure Child mortality, stratified by comparable international quintiles of economic status. Results Implementing interventions that improve child nutrition and provide clean water and sanitation and clean household fuels to all children younger than 5 years would result in an estimated annual reduction in child deaths of 49 700 (14%) in Latin America and the Caribbean, 0.80 million (24%) in South Asia, and 1.47 million (31%) in sub-Saharan Africa. These benefits are equivalent to 30% to 48% of the current regional gaps toward the MDG target on reducing child mortality. Fifty percent coverage of the same environmental and nutritional interventions, as envisioned by the MDGs, would reduce child mortality by 26 900, 0.51 million, and 1.02 million in the 3 regions, respectively, if the interventions are implemented among the poor first. These reductions are 30% to 75% larger than those expected if the same 50% coverage first reached the wealthier households, who nonetheless are in need of similar interventions. Conclusions Interventions related to nutritional and environmental MDGs can also provide substantial gains toward the MDG of reducing child mortality.

J	Ring, IT; O'Brien, JF				Ring, Ian T.; O'Brien, John F.			Our hearts and minds - What would it take for Australia to become the healthiest country in the world?	MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article								Objective: To highlight recent reductions in mortality rates in Australia and identify conditions and population groups with the greatest potential for further reduction in mortality rates. Design: International benchmarking and intranational comparisons of mortality rates were used to identify areas with the greatest potential for improvement. Results: Latest data from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries confirm that, while Japan's death rates remain the lowest in the world, Australia's are decreasing rapidly and we now rival Switzerland for second overall ranking. When the contributions of specific conditions are compared, the areas with the greatest potential for reductions are circulatory diseases (especially ischaemic heart disease); suicide; injury and violence; smoking-related conditions; and cancers amenable to prevention/early detection. Intranational comparisons show considerable scope for reduction in inequalities, especially those between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians, between males and females, and between low and high socioeconomic groups. These conditions and inequalities are highly interrelated, as differentials in health status are often mediated through broader societal inequalities. Conclusions: Australia should aim to become the country with the lowest mortality rate in the world. This could realistically be achieved by benchmarking performance nationally and internationally, applying current knowledge and available interventions, matching policies with funding, and implementing systemic national programs and activities to promote health and prevent "illth".

Furthermore, current patterns of fossil-fuel use cause substantial ill-health from air pollution and occupational hazards. Impending climate change, mainly driven by energy use, now also threatens health. Policies to promote access to non-polluting and sustainable sources of energy have great potential both to improve public health and to mitigate (prevent) climate disruption. There are several technological options, policy levers, and economic instruments for sectors such as power generation, transport, agriculture, and the built environment. However, barriers to change include vested interests, political inertia, inability to take meaningful action, profound global inequalities, weak technology-transfer mechanisms, and knowledge gaps that must be addressed to transform global markets. The need for policies that prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate while addressing the energy needs of disadvantaged people is a central challenge of the current era. A comprehensive programme for clean energy should optimise mitigation and, simultaneously, adaption to climate change while maximising co-benefits for health-eg, through improved air, water, and food quality. Intersectoral research and concerted action, both nationally and internationally, will be required.

Recruiting foreign nurses from developing countries to alleviate the nursing shortage is a common practice. While specialized visas for these healthcare professionals facilitate the visa application and approval process, immigrants employed in low-wage positions are subjected to long waits for visas, workplace raids, and subsequent deportation. Selective assistance to some immigrants violates basic human rights and global expectations of justice. Moral and ethical frameworks need to guide US immigration policy.

Methods: The study uses data from the European Social Survey 2003. Probability sampling from all private residents aged 15 years and older was applied in all countries. The European Social Survey includes 42,359 cases. Persons under age 25 were excluded to minimise the number of respondents whose education was not complete. Education was coded according to the International Standard Classification of Education. Perceived emotional support was assessed by the availability of a confidant with whom one can discuss intimate and personal matters with. Self-rated health was used as health indicator. Results: Results of multiple logistic regression analyses show that emotional support is positively associated with education among women and men in most European countries. However, the magnitude of the association varies according to country and gender. Emotional support is positively associated with self-rated health. Again, gender and country differences in the association were observed. Emotional support explains little of the educational differences in self-rated health among women and men in most European countries. Conclusion: Results indicate that it is important to consider socio-economic factors like education and country-specific contexts in studies on health effects of emotional support.

Huge poor-rich inequalities in maternity care: an international comparative study of maternity and child care in developing countries	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article							HEALTH; SURVIVAL; MORTALITY; DELIVERY; INEQUITIES; SERVICES; MOTHERS; CONTEXT; ACCESS; WOMEN	Objective Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals for maternal health has been slow, and accelerated progress in scaling up professional delivery care is needed. This paper describes poor-rich inequalities in the use of maternity care and seeks to understand these inequalities through comparisons with other types of health care. Methods Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 45 developing countries were Used to describe poor-rich inequalities by wealth quintiles in maternity care (professional delivery care and antenatal care), full childhood immunization coverage and medical treatment for diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). Findings Poor-rich inequalities in maternity care in general, and professional delivery care in particular, are much greater than those in immunization coverage or treatment for childhood illnesses. Public-sector inequalities make up a major part of the poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery attendance. Even delivery care provided by nurses and midwives favours the rich in most countries. Although poor-rich inequalities within both rural and urban areas are large, most births without professional delivery care occur among the rural poor. Conclusion Poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery care are much larger than those in the other forms of care. Reducing poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery care is essential to achieving the MDGs for maternal health. The greatest improvements in professional delivery care can be made by increasing coverage among the rural poor. Problems with availability, accessibility and affordability, as well as the nature of the services and demand factors, appear to contribute to the larger poor-rich inequalities in delivery care. A concerted effort of equity-oriented policy and research is needed to address the huge poor-rich inequalities in maternity care.

Methods In three separate exercises that took place between March and June 2006 we interviewed three different groups of stakeholders: 1) members of the global research priority setting network; 2) a diverse group of national-level stakeholders from South Africa; and 3) participants at the conference related to international child health held in Washington, DC, USA. Each of the groups was administered different version of the questionnaire in which they were asked to set weights to criteria (and also minimum required thresholds, where applicable) that were a priori defined as relevant to health research priority setting by the consultants of the Child Health and Nutrition Research initiative (CHNRI). Results At the global level, the wide and diverse group of respondents placed the greatest importance (weight) to the criterion of maximum potential for disease burden reduction, while the most stringent threshold was placed on the criterion of answerability in an ethical way. Among the stakeholders' representatives attending the international conference, the criterion of deliverability, answerability, and sustainability of health research results was proposed as the most important one. At the national level in South Africa, the greatest weight was placed on the criterion addressing the predicted impact on equity of the proposed health research. Conclusions Involving a large group of stakeholders when setting priorities in health research investments is important because the criteria of relevance to scientists and technical experts, whose knowledge and technical expertise is usually central to the process, may not be appropriate to specific contexts and in accordance with the views and values of those who invest in health research, those who benefit from it, or wider society as a whole.

These examples relate to migrant agricultural workers, the maquiladora industry and artisanal mining, while reviewing some of the major mechanisms involved, e. g. multinational corporations, the development of free trade zones, multilateral free trade agreements and the export of hazards. A series of strategies are discussed in order to address environmental injustice and health disparities that exist on a global scale. Some of the recommendations involve policy initiatives; others, such as research and mentorship, fall within the traditional domain of public health practice. In this paper, special attention is given to concerned environmental and occupational health professionals using evidence-based data for advocacy. For lasting changes to be made, however, stronger institutions and legislation are required. Those who have the 'right to know' about environmental injustice issues include communities of concern, workers' representatives and lawyers. Government officials and company officials may eventually work on the basis of conflict resolution, compensation and remediation, to quote some examples. Systematic approaches to protect both the environment and public health must be updated.

The predicted effects are severe, but argued by some to be avoidable if we act now. Here we consider the dimensions of another disaster: one for which not only the causes, but also their horrific consequences, are current worldwide. The implicit question is 'why are we more worried about future disasters than those already occurring?' The worldmapper collection of cartograms (where a map is used like a pie-chart to present data) is used here to illustrate the extent of international inequalities in health and living conditions, discussed in relation to other aspects of human lives. Though the shape that we can see the world is in is shocking, we can also envisage a positive future. We compare these current global times to more local past times experienced during the ravaging inequalities of Victorian Britain. We use Britain simply as an example. We end by suggesting a further step the current British Prime Minister could make in his thinking. Doing this we can see the potential for environmental reconstruction, which would result (as it did before) in considerable reductions in infant mortality. Our common future is not already mapped out; it is still to be won.

This paper is based on a review of health literature to identify Australian and international examples of interventions utilising a community development approach with a view to directly addressing a health issue and contributing to the empowerment of Aboriginal people. Seventeen articles published over a ten year period from 1994 were identified which met the criteria for community development with a specific empowerment objective. Aboriginal communities are undoubtedly engaged in community development with the aim of improving health outcomes for their own communities. We argue that interventions promoting empowerment and control should be included as part of an overall strategy to reduce health inequalities in Aboriginal settings. There is an urgent need for further research in this area, particularly research which can engage with unpublished examples of community development in Aboriginal health contexts.

As development experts learn more about the importance of the first three years of life, there is growing recognition that investments In early education, maternal-child attachment and nurturance, and more creative nutrition initiatives are critical to help break the cycle of poverty. Even the slightest forms of food insecurity can affect a young child's development and learning potential. The result is the perpetuation of another generation in poverty. Conceptualizing the poorly developed child as an embodiment of injustice helps ground the two essential frameworks needed to address food insecurity and child development: the capability approach and the human rights framework. The capability approach illuminates the dynamics that exist between poverty and child development through depicting poverty as capability deprivation and hunger as failure in the system of entitlements. The human rights framework frames undernutrition and poor development of young children as intolerable for moral and legal reasons, and provides a structure through which governments and other agencies of the State and others can be held accountable for redressing such injustices. Merging the development approach with human rights can improve and shape the planning, approach, monitoring and evaluation of child development while establishing international accountability in order to enhance the potential of the world's youngest children.

J	Tandon, S; Kohli, A; Bhalla, S				Tandon, Shobha; Kohli, Anil; Bhalla, Sumati			Barriers to leadership positions for Indian women in academic dentistry	INTERNATIONAL DENTAL JOURNAL			English	Article						academic dentistry; women; India; careers; leadership		Indian women, have come up a long way during the past 50 years. Gone are the days when the leadership positions in dentistry and health care professions were occupied solely by males and the women in-charge were looked down upon as anomalies. The staff rooms in dental and medical schools, the research laboratories in India today are employing women, who have quietly begun challenging the conventional male ideas that had shaped the policies earlier on. Women have advanced considerably in academic dentistry but like every coin, this story too, has two sides. In spite of the considerable gain in equity of status, women in research and academic careers related to health care professions still face innumerable barriers to their careers. This study was conducted with an aim to highlight the various barriers being faced by women in leadership positions in academic dentistry in India and this paper also suggests issues which require global concern for unbiased advancement of women. This was a questionnaire-based study in which the subjects were women in leadership positions in the various dental colleges in India. The questions are related to the various barriers like family commitments, attitude of the society, sexual harassment, gender bias and lack of cooperation from spouse which hinders the development of the careers of such women with tremendous potential. The results show that 67% of the subjects feel there are more barriers to their careers as women than men and health care professions definitely need more women leaders for improvement in women's health status globally. 63.5% of women in dentistry feel their family commitments are barriers to rising in their careers and 64.7% report that a marriage is happier if the husband's career graph is better than wife's. The survey results indicate that the same salary is paid to 93.5% women as their male colleagues. The results of the study show that there certainly has been a change in outlook of Indian women as they have broken the traditional norms and taken up careers in academic dentistry. There certainly is a positive side to this story but numerous challenges especially in the form of family commitments still remain for women in leadership positions in the dental colleges in India.

J	Marmot, M				Marmot, Michael		Commission Social Determinants Hlt	Achieving health equity: from root causes to fair outcomes	LANCET			English	Article							SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; INCOME; COUNTRIES	Health is a universal human aspiration and a basic human need. The development of society, rich or poor, can be judged by the quality of its population's health, how fairly health is distributed across the social spectrum, and the degree of protection provided from disadvantage due to ill-health. Health equity is central to this premise and to the work of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Strengthening health equity-globally and within countries-means going beyond contemporary concentration on the immediate causes of disease. More than any other global health endeavour, the Commission focuses on the "causes of the causes"-the fundamental structures of social hierarchy and the socially determined conditions these create in which people grow, live, work, and age. The time for action is now, not just because better health makes economic sense, but because it is right and just. The outcry against inequity has been intensifying for many years from country to country around the world. These cries are forming a global movement. The Commission on Social Determinants of Health places action to ensure fair health at the head and the heart of that movement.

Transport-related carbon emissions are rising and there is increasing consensus that the growth in motorised land vehicles and aviation is incompatible with averting serious climate change. The energy intensity of land transport correlates with its adverse health effects. Adverse health effects occur through climate change, road-traffic injuries, physical inactivity, urban air pollution, energy-related conflict, and environmental degradation. For the world's poor people, walking is the main mode of transport, but such populations often experience the most from the harms of energy-intensive transport. New energy sources and improvements in vehicle design and in information technology are necessary but not sufficient to reduce transport-related carbon emissions without accompanying behavioural change. By contrast, active transport has the potential to improve health and equity, and reduce emissions. Cities require safe and pleasant environments for active transport with destinations in easy reach and, for longer journeys, public transport that is powered by renewable energy, thus providing high levels of accessibility without car use. Much investment in major road projects does not meet the transport needs of poor people, especially women whose trips are primarily local and off road. Sustainable development is better promoted through improving walking and cycling infrastructures, increasing access to cycles, and investment in transport services for essential needs. Our model of London shows how increased active transport could help achieve substantial reductions in emissions by 2030 while improving population health. There exists the potential for a global contraction and convergence in use of fossil-fuel energy for transport to benefit health and achieve sustainability.

J	Wilkinson, P; Smith, KR; Joffe, M; Haines, A				Wilkinson, Paul; Smith, Kirk R.; Joffe, Michael; Haines, Andrew			Energy and Health 1 - A global perspective on energy: health effects and injustices	LANCET			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT	The exploitation of fossil fuels is integral to modem living and has been a key element of the rapid technological, social, and cultural changes of the past 250 years. Although such changes have brought undeniable benefits, this exploitation has contributed to a burden of illness through pollution of local and regional environments, and is the dominant cause of climate change. This pattern of development is therefore unsustainable at a global level. At the same time, about 2.4 billion of the world's population, disadvantaged by lack of access to clean energy, are exposed to high levels of indoor air pollutants from the inefficient burning of biomass fuels. Even in high-income countries, many people live in fuel poverty, and throughout the world, increasingly sedentary lifestyles (to which fossil-fuel-dependent transport systems contribute) are leading to chronic disease and injuries. Energy security is also an issue of growing concern to many governments in both the developed and developing world, and a potential source of international tension and conflict. In this Series, we examine the opportunities to improve health, reduce climate effects, and promote development through realistic adjustments in the way energy and food are produced and consumed.

Such estimates have drawn attention to the importance of mental disorders for public health. However, because they stress the separate contributions of mental and physical disorders to disability and mortality, they might have entrenched the alienation of mental health from mainstream efforts to improve health and reduce poverty. The burden of mental disorders is likely to have been underestimated because of inadequate appreciation of the connectedness between mental illness and other health conditions. Because these interactions are protean, there can be no health without mental health. Mental disorders increase risk for communicable and non-communicable diseases, and contribute to unintentional and intentional injury. Conversely, many health conditions increase the risk for mental disorder, and comorbidity complicates help-seeking, diagnosis, and treatment, and influences prognosis. Health services are not provided equitably to people with mental disorders, and the quality of care for both mental and physical health conditions for these people could be improved. We need to develop and evaluate psychosocial interventions that can be integrated into management of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Health-care systems should be strengthened to improve delivery of mental health care, by focusing on existing programmes and activities, such as those which address the prevention and treatment of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria; gender-based violence; antenatal care; integrated management of childhood illnesses and child nutrition; and innovative management of chronic disease. An explicit mental health budget might need to be allocated for such activities. Mental health affects progress towards the achievement of several Millennium Development Goals, such as promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women, reduction of child mortality, improvement of maternal health, and reversal of the spread of HIV/AIDS. Mental health awareness needs to be integrated into all aspects of health and social policy, health-system planning, and delivery of primary and secondary general health care.

We discuss here the general availability of these resources, especially in low-income and middle-income countries. Government spending on mental health in most of the relevant countries is far lower than is needed, based on the proportionate burden of mental disorders and the availability of cost-effective and affordable interventions. The poorest countries spend the lowest percentages of their overall health budgets on mental health. Most care is now institutionally based, and the transition to community care would require additional funds that have not been made available in most countries. Human resources available for mental health care in most low-income and middle-income countries are very limited, and shortages are likely to persist. Not only are resources for mental health scarce, they are also inequitably distributed-between countries, between regions, and within communities. Populations with high rates of socioeconomic deprivation have the highest need for mental health care, but the lowest access to it. Stigma about mental disorders also constrains use of available resources. People with mental illnesses are also vulnerable to abuse of their human rights. Inefficiencies in the use of available resources for mental health care include allocative and technical inefficiencies in financing mechanisms and interventions, and an overconcentration of resources in large institutions. Scarcity of available resources, inequitles in their distribution, and inefficiencies in their use pose the three main obstacles to better mental health, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.

J	Biehl, J				Biehl, Joao			Pharmaceuticalization: AIDS treatment and global health politics	ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY			English	Article						AIDS treatment; global health; pharmaceuticalization; market-based biopolitics; contemporary Brazil; political subjectivity	LESSONS; HIV/AIDS; EXPERIENCES; HIV	This article examines the political economy of pharmaceuticals that lies behind global AIDS treatment initiatives, revealing the possibilities and inequalities that come with a magic bullet approach to health care. It tells how Brazil, against all odds, became the first developing country to universalize access to antiretroviral drugs-a breakthrough made possible by an unexpected alliance of activists, government reformers, development agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry. The article moves between a social analysis of the institutional practices shaping the Brazilian response to AIDS and the stories and lives of people affected by it. it draws from interviews with activists, policy makers, and corporate actors and from longitudinal ethnographic work among grassroots AIDS core services. Pharmaceutical innovations allow unlikely coalitions that both expose the inadequacies of reigning public health paradigms and act to reform, if to a limited extent, global values and mechanisms (of drug pricing and of types of medical and philanthropic interventions, for example). Treatment rollouts are matters of intense negotiation; their local realizations are shaped by contingency and uncertainty. Such realizations encode diverse economic and political interests, as well as the needs and desires of citizens. These therapeutic coalitions also expose the deficiencies of national and local infrastructures and consolidate novel state-civil society relations. A pharmaceutically-centered model of public health has emerged as a byproduct of AIDS treatment scale-up and the sustainability of the Brazilian AIDS policy has to be constantly renegotiated in light of global drug markets. A multitude of networks and variations in AIDS care have emerged on-the-ground, and the article explores why AIDS treatment has been so difficult to put into practice among poor Brazilians, who are often stigmatized as noncompliant or untreatable, becoming invisible to the public. Poor AIDS patients live in a state of flux, simultaneously acknowledging and disguising their condition while they participate in local economies of salvation. At both the macro and micro levels, we see a state of triage and a politics of survival crystallizing.

Methods The Actuarial Society of South Africa demographic and AIDS model (ASSA 2002) - calibrated to survey, census and adjusted vital registration data - was used to calculate the total number of deaths in 2000. Causes of death were determined from the National lnjury Mortality Surveillance System profile. Injury death rates and years of life lost (YLL) were estimated using the Global Burden of Disease methodology. National years lived with disability (YLDs) were calculated by applying a ratio between YLLs and YLDs found in a local injury data source, the Cape Metropole Study. Mortality and disability-adjusted life years' (DALYs) rates were compared with African and global estimates. Findings Interpersonal violence dominated the South African injury profile with age-standardized mortality rates at seven times the global rate. Injuries were the second-leading cause of loss of healthy life, accounting for 14.3% of all DALYs in South Africa in 2000. Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the leading cause of injury in most regions of the world but South Africa has exceedingly high numbers - double the global rate. Conclusion Injuries are an important public health issue in South Africa. Social and economic determinants of violence, many a legacy of apartheid policies, must be addressed to reduce inequalities in society and build community cohesion. Multisectoral interventions to reduce traffic injuries are also needed. We highlight this heavy burden to stress the need for effective prevention programmes.

J	Carlisle, S; Hanlon, P				Carlisle, Sandra; Hanlon, Phil			Well-being and consumer culture: a different kind of public health problem?	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						well-being; consumer culture		The concept of well-being is now of interest to many disciplines; as a consequence, it presents an increasingly complex and contested territory. We suggest that much current thinking about well-being can be summarized in terms of four main discourses: scientific, popular, critical and environmental. Exponents of the scientific discourse argue that subjective well-being is now static or declining in developed countries: a paradox for economists, as incomes have grown considerably. Psychological observations on the loss of subjective well-being have also entered popular awareness, in simplified form, and conceptions of well-being as happiness are now influencing contemporary political debate and policy-making. These views have not escaped criticism. Philosophers understand well-being as part of a flourishing human life, not just happiness. Some social theorists critique the export Of specific cultural concepts of well-being as human universals. Others view well-being as a potentially divisive construct that may contribute to maintaining social inequalities. Environmentalists argue that socio-cultural patterns of over-consumption, within the neo-liberal economies of developed societies, present an impending ecological threat to individual, social and global wellbeing. As the four discourses carry different implications for action, we conclude by considering their varied utility and applicability for health promotion.

J	Brady, M				Brady, Maggie			Equality and difference: persisting historical themes in health and alcohol policies affecting Indigenous Australians	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article								Disseminating national health and alcohol policies to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia has been a challenging task for governments and public servants. This has been for a number of reasons, including the enduring (negative) legacy of past '' Aboriginal affairs '' policies, the fact that Indigenous health programmes and alcohol programmes have been treated separately since the 1970s, and a more recent context in which the recognition of cultural difference was privileged. Confronted with the politics of difference, health departments were slow to examine avenues through which best practice advice emanating from WHO, and alcohol policies such as harm minimisation and early identification and treatment in primary health care, could be communicated in culturally recognisable ways to independent Indigenous services. In addition, there was hostility towards harm minimisation policies from Indigenous service providers, and Indigenous treatment programmes remained largely committed to abstinence-oriented modalities and the disease model of alcoholism, despite moves away from these approaches in the mainstream. However, genuinely innovative acute interventions and environmental controls over alcohol have been developed by Indigenous community-based organisations, approaches that are reinforced by international policy research evidence.

J	Hunter, D				Hunter, David			AmI my brother's gatekeeper? Professional ethics and the prioritisation of healthcare	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							LIMITS	At the 5th International Conference on Priorities in Health Care in Wellington, New Zealand, 2004, one resonating theme was that for priority setting to be effective, it has to include clinicians in both decision making and the enforcement of those decisions. There was, however, a disturbing undertone to this theme, namely that doctors, in particular, were unjustifiably thwarting good systems of prioritising scarce healthcare resources. This undertone seems unfair precisely because doctors may, and in some cases do, feel obligated by their professional ethics to remain uninvolved either in deciding priorities and in some cases in enforcing them. I will argue that the professional role of a doctor ought not be considered inconsistent with the role of a priority setter or enforcer, as long as one crucial element is in place, a rationally coherent and broadly justifiable regime for prioritising healthcare. Given this I conclude both that prioritisation and doctoring are not incompatible under certain conditions, and that the education of healthcare professionals ought to include material on distributive justice in healthcare.

J	Kukla, R				Kukla, Rebecca			Resituating the principle of equipoise: Justice and access to care in non-ideal conditions	KENNEDY INSTITUTE OF ETHICS JOURNAL			English	Article							CLINICAL-RESEARCH; INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; HEALTH-CARE; ETHICS; TRIALS	The principle of equipoise traditionally is grounded in the special obligations of physician-investigators to provide research participants with optimal care. This grounding makes the principle hard to apply in contexts with limited health resources, to research that is not directed by physicians, or to nontherapeutic research. I propose a different version of the principle of equipoise that does not depend upon an appeal to the Hippocratic duties of physicians and that is designed to be applicable within a wider range of research contexts and types-including health services research and research on social interventions. I consider three examples of ethically contentious research trials conducted in three different social settings. I argue that in each case my version of the principle of equipoise provides more plausible and helpful guidance than does the traditional version of the principle.

An eye for inequality: How trachoma relates to poverty in tanzania and vietnam	OPHTHALMIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						inequality poverty; Tanzania; trachoma; Vietnam	GLOBAL ELIMINATION; BLINDING TRACHOMA; PREVENTION	Purpose: An important challenge for trachoma control strategies is to break the circle of poverty, poor hygiene and poor health by bringing its benefits to the poor. This article aims to assess to what extent trachoma is a disease of the poor, and trachoma services reach the poor in Tanzania and Vietnam. Methods: Individual level data on trachoma prevalence (active trachoma and trichiasis) and utilization of trachoma-related services were collected in both countries in 2004. Prevalence data were also available for Vietnam in 2001. We used household level data to construct an asset index as our living standards measure. Next, we related trachoma prevalence and service use to living standards, and used concentration indices to summarize and test the degree of inequality. Results: Trachoma prevalence was higher among the poorest groups in Tanzania. No such relation could be established in Vietnam where prevalence declined over the period 2001-2004 and particularly so among the least poor. Antibiotics were used more by the poorest in Tanzania and by the less poor in Vietnam. In both countries, there was no unequivocal pattern for the relation between living standards and the use of trachoma services. Conclusions: Trachoma is found to be a disease of the poorest in Tanzania, but not in Vietnam. In the latter country there are indications that district characteristics have an important impact on trachoma prevalence. The higher use of antibiotics among the better-off in Vietnam may have contributed to their larger decline in active trachoma prevalence between 2001 and 2004 compared to the poorer segments.

Influences on children's oral health: A conceptual model	PEDIATRICS			English	Review						oral health; population health; pediatrics	DENTAL-CARIES PATTERNS; LIFE-COURSE APPROACH; SELF-RATED HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; INCOME INEQUALITY; CARE; ASSOCIATION	OBJECTIVES. Despite marked improvements over the past century, oral health in America is a significant problem: caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Much oral health research examines influences primarily in the oral cavity or focuses on a limited number of individual-level factors. The purpose of this article was to present a more encompassing conceptual model of the influences on children's oral health. METHODS. The conceptual model presented here was derived from the population health and social epidemiology fields, which have moved toward multilevel, holistic approaches to analyze the complex and interactive causes of children's health problems. It is based on a comprehensive review of major population and oral health literatures. RESULTS. A multilevel conceptual model is described, with the individual, family, and community levels of influence on oral health outcomes. This model incorporates the 5 key domains of determinants of health as identified in the population health literature: genetic and biological factors, the social environment, the physical environment, health behaviors, and dental and medical care. The model recognizes the presence of a complex interplay of causal factors. Last, the model incorporates the aspect of time, recognizing the evolution of oral health diseases ( eg, caries) and influences on the child-host over time. CONCLUSIONS. This conceptual model represents a starting point for thinking about children's oral health. The model incorporates many of the important breakthroughs by social epidemiologists over the past 25 years by including a broad range of genetic, social, and environmental risk factors; multiple pathways by which they operate; a time dimension; the notion of differential susceptibility and resilience; and a multilevel approach. The study of children's oral health from a global perspective remains largely in its infancy and is poised for additional development. This work can help inform how best to approach and improve children's oral health.

Socioeconomic status predicts objective and subjective sleep quality in aging women	PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE			English	Article						socioeconomic status; sleep; health; neuroticism	SELF-RATED HEALTH; ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY; VULNERABILITY; INDEX; AGE; INTERLEUKIN-6; INEQUALITIES; NIGHTCAP; DURATION; INSOMNIA	Objective: To test the hypothesis that socioeconomic status (SES) would be associated with sleep quality measured objectively, even after controlling for related covariates (health status, psychosocial characteristics). Epidemiological studies linking SES and sleep quality have traditionally relied on self-reported assessments of sleep. Methods: Ninety-four women, 61 to 90 years of age, participated in this study. SES was determined by pretax household income and years of education. Objective and subjective assessments of sleep quality were obtained using the NightCap sleep system and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. Health status was determined by subjective health ratings and objective measures of recent and chronic illnesses. Depressive symptoms and neuroticism were quantified using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and the Neuroticism subscale of the NEO Personality Inventory, respectively. Results: Household income significantly predicted sleep latency and sleep efficiency even after adjusting for demographic factors, health status, and psychosocial characteristics. Income also predicted PSQI scores, although this association was significantly attenuated by inclusion of neuroticism in multivariate analyses. Education predicted both sleep latency and sleep efficiency, but the latter association was partially reduced after health status and psychosocial measures were included in analyses. Education predicted PSQI sleep efficiency component scores, but not global scores. Conclusions: These results suggest that SES is robustly linked to both subjective and objective sleep quality, and that health status and psychosocial characteristics partially explain these associations.

Indeed, there are many similarities between the health, social, economic and demographic profiles of these two groups. However, there is evidence that Caribbean people in the US are faring considerably better. This paper explores differences in the social and economic position of Black American, Black Caribbean and white people in the US and Black Caribbean and white people in England, how these relate to ethnic inequalities in health, and may be underpinned by differences in patterns and contexts of migration. We use similar surveys from the US and England to explore these questions. The US data were drawn from the National Survey of American Life and the English data were drawn from the Health Survey for England and a follow up study. Findings show the advantaged health position of Caribbean American people in comparison with both Caribbean people in England and Black American people. Multivariate analyses indicate that these differences, and the differences in health between Black and white people in the two countries, are a consequence of social and economic inequalities.

Prevailing explanations for these disparities have focused upon socioeconomic inequality and related mechanisms as the causal factors. Yet, despite the explanatory power of socioeconomic status in models of health outcomes, an unexplained racial gap in health persists. This research contributes to the study of the Black-White health divergence by exploring a mechanism with the prospect of explaining a portion of the racial gap in health remaining after adjustment for socioeconomic status. Specifically, using random coefficient regression to analyse pooled data from the 1993-1999 California Dietary Practices Survey, I identify significant differences between Blacks and Whites, after adjustment for socioeconomic status and other controls, both in global nutritional healthfulness and across a range of nutritional behaviours with established links to the development of chronic disease. Given the compelling body of literature linking nutritional behaviour to health outcomes, these differences between Blacks and Whites constitute evidence for the potential explanatory value of nutrition in future studies seeking to explain the residual racial gap in health remaining after adjustment for socioeconomic status and correlates of socioeconomic status.

Ecological study of socio-economic indicators and prevalence of asthma in schoolchildren in urban Brazil	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							CHILDHOOD ISAAC; SYMPTOMS; ALLERGIES; CHILDREN	Background: There is evidence of higher prevalence of asthma in populations of lower socioeconomic status in affluent societies, and the prevalence of asthma is also very high in some Latin American countries, where societies are characterized by a marked inequality in wealth. This study aimed to examine the relationship between estimates of asthma prevalence based on surveys conducted in children in Brazilian cities and health and socioeconomic indicators measured at the population level in the same cities. Methods: We searched the literature in the medical databases and in the annals of scientific meeting, retrieving population-based surveys of asthma that were conducted in Brazil using the methodology defined by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. We performed separate analyses for the age groups 6 - 7 years and 13 - 14 years. We examined the association between asthma prevalence rates and eleven health and socio-economic indicators by visual inspection and using linear regression models weighed by the inverse of the variance of each survey. Results: Six health and socioeconomic variables showed a clear pattern of association with asthma. The prevalence of asthma increased with poorer sanitation and with higher infant mortality at birth and at survey year, GINI index and external mortality. In contrast, asthma prevalence decreased with higher illiteracy rates. Conclusion: The prevalence of asthma in urban areas of Brazil, a middle income country, appears to be higher in cities with more marked poverty or inequality.

Health disparities by occupation, modified by education: a cross-sectional population study	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; SOCIAL-CLASS; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; WORK-ENVIRONMENT; GENERAL-PRACTICE; UNITED-STATES; NETHERLANDS; PREVALENCE; MORBIDITY; MORTALITY	Background: Socio-economic disparities in health status are frequently reported in research. By comparison with education and income, occupational status has been less extensively studied in relation to health status or the occurrence of specific chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate health disparities in the working population based on occupational position and how they were modified by education. Methods: Our data were derived from the National Survey of General Practice that comprised 104 practices in the Netherlands. 136,189 working people aged 25-64 participated in the study. Occupational position was assessed by the International Socio-Economic Index of occupational position (ISEI). Health outcomes were self-perceived health status and physician-diagnosed diseases. Odds ratios were estimated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The lowest occupational position was observed to be associated with poor health in men (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1,5 to 1.7) and women (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.4). The risk of poor health gradually decreased in relation to higher occupational positions. People with the lowest occupational positions were more likely to suffer from depression, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, arthritis, muscle pain, neck and back pain and tension headache, in comparison to people with the highest occupational position (OR 1.2 to 1.6). A lower educational level induced an additional risk of poor health and disease. We found that gender modified the effects on poor health when both occupational position and education were combined in the analysis. Conclusion: A low occupational position was consistently associated working people with poor health and physician-diagnosed morbidity. However a low educational level was not. Occupational position and education had a combined effect on self-perceived health, which supports the recent call to improve the conceptual framework of health disparities.

In Australia, there has been no systematic analysis of the relevance and applicability of international reforms of differing models of primary care delivery and the implications for addressing these issues in the local context. We used a narrative review and synthesis approach to analyse evidence from four English-speaking comparator countries (New Zealand, Canada, United Kingdom, United States of America) and one European country (Netherlands). In this review the term 'Primary care" refers to the system of health care workers (predominantly general practice, nursing and allied health professionals) who provide locally-based first contact care in the community setting. The existing international evidence does not support the adoption of any specific model of primary care delivery that is suitable to the Australian context. However, the evidence does suggest four key mechanisms that should form the basis of future reform. This includes the funding of GP services, quality and performance frameworks, stronger regional structures to support primary care, and investment in practice infrastructure. This paper provides an overview of the review methods and findings. A full report and in-depth discussion of findings are available from http://www.anu.edu.au/aphri/Domain/PHCModels/index.pbp.

The review provides a comprehensive and accessible summary of the numerous definitions and ideas about access, which have been suggested over this time, together with a synthesis of current thinking informed by these past perspectives. Critical Interpretive Synthesis (CIS) methodology was used to review the literature on access. Medline and Australasian Medical Index were searched for English-language articles published between 19 70 and August 2005. The results were supplemented by an internet search of the World Wide Web, augmented by manual scans of material from deeper levels within the sites. The process by which the initial list of 665 potential references was reduced to the final list of 48 references was based on manual inspection of both abstracts and full articles using specific prioritisation criteria. Inter-observer agreement for reference selection using these criteria was checked by two investigators and found to be good (Kappa=0.83). Measuring and monitoring access to primary health care is challenging due to the complexity of the concept of access. To address this shortcoming, a single outcome-based measure of access to primary health care is proposed, pointing to a possible way forward for the concept of access as a practical tool with significant application to future health policy.

This paper examines the evolution of primary health care as a global strategy for responding to the social determinants of health. Primary health care roles require knowledge of, and a focus on social determinants of health, particulars the societal factors that allow and perpetuate inequities and disadvantage. They also require a depth and breadth of leadership skills that are responsive to health needs, appropriate in the social and regulatory context, and visionary in balancing both workforce and client needs. The key to succeeding in working with communities and groups under a primary health care umbrella is to balance the big Picture Of comprehensive primary health care with operational strategies for selective primary health care. The other essential element involves using leadership skills to promote inclusiveness, empowerment and health literacy, and ultimately, better health.

J	Schofield, T				Schofield, Toni			Health inequity and its social determinants: A sociological commentary	HEALTH SOCIOLOGY REVIEW			English	Article						health inequity and inequality; social determinants o f health; critical sociology; policy actions	EQUITY; INEQUALITIES; POLICY	In 2005, the World Health Organisation (WHO) established the Commission on the Social Determinants of Health. It is to produce its final report in May 2008, identifying actions to address the vast health disparities that have accompanied global economic expansion and widespread political turmoil. The Commission and its anticipated report are a major part of a new research and policy approach committed to the advancement of global health equity. This paper explores the fundamental goals, principles and concepts of the health equity 'movement', and its relationship to the 'social determinants of health' approach. It argues that such an approach is an instrument for rendering the problem of health inequity real and actionable by institutional authorities and policy practitioners. However, its prevailing frameworks and methods impose significant constraints on its capacity to identify effectively the mechanisms by which health inequities are produced. Accordingly, the actions suggested by the prevailing approach to the problem of health inequity are likely to be less than efficacious. The paper suggests that a more dynamic understanding of the social, as provided by critical sociology, has much to offer in advancing efficacious policy interventions in the field of health and equity.

The focus of this epidemic will be in low and middle income countries where women are also increasingly involved in the production and manufacturing of tobacco as well as being targeted by tobacco marketing. As the tobacco epidemic evolves in the 21(st) Century, increasing tobacco use and production affecting girls and women threaten to undermine not only their physical and mental health, but also their economic and social progress. This article explores how tobacco use and production will affect the status of women and their progress towards gender and health equity. Several strategies for responding to this are suggested, and it is argued that the tobacco control movement has a responsibility to adopt gender and equity based principles in its goals and practices.

J	Kumar, A				Kumar, Anant			Health inequity and women's self-help groups in India: The role of caste and class	HEALTH SOCIOLOGY REVIEW			English	Article						sociology; self-help groups; health; caste; class; equity	RURAL CREDIT PROGRAMS; GENDER	With the United Nations Millenium Declaration of 2000, the establishment of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) has been identified as a significant strategy in addressing the alarming levels of poverty and marginalisation that have accompanied global development. SHGs are small, voluntary associations of people from the same socio-economic background that have been established for the purpose of solving shared social and economic problems through self help and mutual help. Such grass-roots commonality, it has been assumed, will promote community empowerment and prevent economic marginalisation. Such an assumption is largely based on the global, neo-liberal agenda of seeing the withdrawal of the State from social provisioning. SHGs have been widely adopted in India, especially to eliminate the social exclusion of poor women and improve their access to health. This article reviews the scope and limitations of SHGs in improving women's health, focusing on their implementation in the State of Bihar in India. It critically assesses the extent to which SHGs: can be involved in attaining better health for women and children by exploring the crucial role of caste and class in access to health services. The article concludes that solutions such as SHGs, which emanate from international policy circles, fail to capture local structural contexts such as caste and class and, as a result, develop instrumentalised approaches that are unlikely to produce equitable health services provision to poor and marginalised people.

However, theorization fails to articulate the potential environmental consequences of foreign investment dependence. Here, an ecostructural theory of investment dependence is proposed and a derived hypothesis is tested. The hypothesis states that less developed countries dependent on foreign investment in manufacturing exhibit higher levels of per capita noxious gas emissions. These anthropogenic emissions contribute to global warming, climate change, and a variety of human health problems. To test the hypothesis, newly available panel data for the emission of nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide gas as well as measures of foreign investment in manufacturing are analyzed in random effects generalized least squares (GLS) panel regression models for 39 less developed countries. Findings confirm the hypothesis, even when controlling for domestic investment, the relative size of the manufacturing sector, level of development, and other factors. Overall, the analyses support the ecostructural theory of foreign investment dependence, and underscore the sociological relevance in considering the environmental impacts of the transnational organization of production as well as the overall scale of production.

Our objective was to evaluate the demographic determinants of acute gastrointestinal illness in Canadians. Methods: We used data from two population-based studies conducted in select communities between 2001 and 2003. Together, the studies comprised 8,108 randomly selected respondents; proxies were used for all respondents under 12 years and for respondents under 19 years at the discretion of the parent or guardian. Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, we evaluated the following demographic determinants: age, gender, cultural group, and urban/rural status of the respondent, highest education level of the respondent or proxy, number of people in the household, and total annual household income. Two-way interaction terms were included in the multivariate analyses. The final multivariate model included income, age, gender, and the interaction between income and gender. Results: After adjusting for income, gender, and their interaction, children under 10 years had the highest risk of acute gastrointestinal illness, followed by young adults aged 20 to 24 years. For males, the risk of acute gastrointestinal illness was similar across all income levels, but for females the risk was much higher in the lowest income category. Specifically, in those with total annual household incomes of less than $20,000, the odds of acute gastrointestinal illness were 2.46 times higher in females than in males. Conclusion: Understanding the demographic determinants of acute gastrointestinal illness is essential in order to identify vulnerable groups to which intervention and prevention efforts can be targeted.

It has become an important policy issue around the world. These payments can jeopardize governments' attempts to improve equity and access to care and policies targeted to the poor. It is widely believed that a considerable amount of out-of-pocket payment in the health sector in Turkey is informal. To examine this issue, we used a questionnaire adopted from a wider international study.

J	He, BG; Murphy, H				He, Baogang; Murphy, Hannah			Global social justice at the WTO? The role of NGOs in constructing global social contracts	INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; POWER	Over the past decade, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been contesting the neo-liberal economic order in international politics by campaigning for normative conditions to bring about what Richard Falk calls 'humane governance'. However, the degree to which NGOs have contributed to the formation of global social contracts remains controversial. While NGO activists and various scholars advocate the establishment of such contracts, empirical testing of this normative argument is underdeveloped. Drawing upon this lack of empirical support, critics dismiss the global social contract concept and question the roles played by NGOs in international politics. This article addresses the controversy through a review, refinement and application of global social contract theory and an empirical study of two prominent international NGO campaigns directed at the World Trade Organization (WTO), an institution that represents a 'hard test case'. It explores the ways in which NGOs and their networks are challenging the neo-liberal basis of WTO agreements and contributing to the emergence of global social contracts. The article concludes that in some circumstances, NGOs have the capacity to inject social justice into international economic contracts and there is some basis for optimism regarding the formation of global social contracts involving NGOs, nation-states and international organizations.

Bantebya			Women's perception of self-worth and access to health care	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						self-worth; utilization; women's health		Objective: Research has shown differences in health status and health care utilization related to culture, economic status, and health care development. This paper reports on a study comparing attitudes of women in three countries, at various stages of development, about their own health and self-worth and asks if these differences account for differences in health care utilization and inequities in health status. Method: A questionnaire, administered to 100 women in each of Yemen, Uganda and Canada, explored women's perception of their own health and health care seeking behavior. Result: Women's perception of themselves as worthy of care was positively related to utilization. The ability to make one's own health care decisions varied with her country's development level. Implementation strategies must consider women's decision-making capacity. Conclusion: To achieve improved health status, policies and programs must commit to encouraging appropriate social and cultural changes, using a 'cross-sectoral approach', involving both gender and development issues.

J	Jacobstein, R				Jacobstein, Roy			Long-acting and permanent contraception: An international development, service delivery perspective	JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH			English	Article						contraception; female sterilization; implants; international family planning; IUDs; reproductive health; vasectomy; WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria	PELVIC-INFLAMMATORY-DISEASE; INTRAUTERINE-DEVICES; ECTOPIC PREGNANCY; RISK	Recent scientific findings about long-acting and permanent methods of contraception underscore their safety, effectiveness, and wide eligibility for individuals who desire them. This has led to new guidance from the World Health Organization to inform national policies, guidelines, and standards for service delivery. Although developing countries have made much progress in expanding the availability and use of family planning services, the need for effective contraception in general (and long-acting and permanent methods in particular) is large and growing because the largest cohorts in human history are entering their reproductive years. More than half a billion people will use contraception in developing countries (excluding China) by 2015, an increase of 200 million over levels of use in 2000. The health, development, and equity rationales that historically have underpinned and energized the international family planning effort remain valid and relevant today. Despite the other compelling challenges faced by the international health community, the need to make family planning services more widely available is pressing and should remain a priority.

In France, patients share the cost of both physician visits and hospitalization, in Germany they share the cost of hospitalization, and in Spain there is no system of patient cost sharing. The data were obtained from national health surveys carried out in each of these countries during the last decade of the 20th century. We found that persons belonging to a low social class had fewer physician visits than those belonging to a high social class in France, whereas the opposite occurred in Germany and Spain. After adjusting for a measure of the need for health care, the results in France changed little, whereas no significant differences by social class were seen in Germany and Spain. Persons of low social class had more hospital admissions than those of high social class in France and Spain, while no statistically different differences were seen in Germany. After adjusting for need, no significant differences were seen in any of the three countries. Although other factors related with the structure of the health system can not be ruled out, our findings suggest that patient cost sharing reduces the frequency of physician visits and that this decrease is greater in the low social classes, whereas the effect of co-payment for hospitalization on the frequency of hospital admission is not clear.

TRENDS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review							INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; SCIENTIFIC-RESEARCH; SCIENCE; NORMS	Apocalyptic views on the natural order, chimeras and genetic engineering should not detract from the fact that medical research, similar to the promotion of health, is a public good. Genomics crosses all species, thereby requiring a global approach that respects human rights and public health priorities. Public trust and public participation in research demand clear stewardship as well as transparent and accountable oversight. Characterizing fundamental genomic data as a public resource might counterbalance the current overemphasis on individual rights but this will not be simple. It is only through an attachment to justice and solidarity that the dignity and well-being of persons, both as humans and as citizens, can truly be fostered.

Despite this, investigations of ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk factors have focused mainly on individual-level characteristics. The main purpose of this study was to investigate associations between neighbourhood-level environmental stressors (crime, housing density, nuisance from alcohol and drug misuse, quality of green space and social participation), and blood pressure (BP) and hypertension among different ethnic groups. Methods: Individual data from the Amsterdam Health Survey 2004 were linked to data on neighbourhood stressors creating a multilevel design for data analysis. The study sample consisted of 517 Dutch, 404 Turkish and 365 Moroccans living in 15 neighbourhoods in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Results: Amongst Moroccans, high density housing and nuisance from drug misuse were associated with a higher systolic BP, while high quality of green space and social participation were associated with a lower systolic BP. High level of nuisance from drug misuse was associated with a higher diastolic BP. High quality of green space was associated with lower odds of hypertension. Amongst Turkish, high level of crime and nuisance from motor traffic were associated with a higher diastolic BP. Similar associations were observed among the Dutch group but none of the differences were statistically significant. Conclusion: The study findings show that neighbourhood-level stressors are associated with BP in ethnic minority groups but were less evident in the Dutch group. These findings might imply that the higher BP levels found in some ethnic minority groups might be partly due to their greater susceptibility to the adverse neighbourhood environment in which many ethnic minority people live. Primary prevention measures targeting these neighbourhood stressors may have an impact in reducing high BP related morbidity and mortality among ethnic minority groups.

Fearing that such liability protection would facilitate illicit activity, early twentieth century courts, especially in America, would sometimes 'pierce' the corporate veil. This article explores Adams v. Cape (1990), in which American plaintiffs attempted to persuade the English courts to lift the corporate veil and impose liability for industrial disease on Cape Industries, a leading U.K. asbestos manufacturer. This landmark case shows how corporate strategy can be closely intertwined with international corporate law and occupational health and safety issues. it also highlights how limited liability law and separate legal personality can result in significant injustice to claimants against multinational enterprises.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						mortality; indigenous; Australia; numerator-denominator bias	NEW-ZEALAND; ABORIGINAL MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; DISPARITIES; CANADA	Background international targets for reducing health inequalities, such as the Millennium Development Goals, are stated in terms of national targets. However, dramatic health differentials exist within countries, even developed ones. Studies indicate that the indigenous population of Australia suffers a life expectancy disadvantage greater than differentials found in Indigenous populations of other developed countries. We re-examine recent national mortality levels and trends of Indigenous Australians. Methods Analyses of Indigenous mortality are plagued by 'numerator-denominator bias', whereby reporting of indigenous status differs in deaths (numerators) and population (denominators). We apply demographic evaluation methods developed to address such problems to data from the 1991, 1996 and 2001 censuses of Australia and to the death registration data for the period. Results The propensity of Australia's population to report Indigenous status increased between each census, particularly between 1991 and 1996, while recording of deaths as Indigenous increased sharply. Adjusted for bias, the Indigenous population had a life expectancy similar to 13 years below that of the non-Indigenous population, a 2-year greater disadvantage than recently estimated for the Maori in New Zealand. Indigenous mortality fell during the 1990s, but slightly more slowly than that of non-Indigenous Australians, leaving differentials slightly increased. Conclusions Around the world Indigenous populations are estimated to suffer a mortality disadvantage compared with non-Indigenous populations. However, establishing the magnitude of and trend in the disadvantage is difficult because of bias. Using appropriate methods to adjust for bias, the Indigenous population of Australia is estimated to suffer a life expectancy shortfall of about 13 years, greater than similar gaps in other developed countries.

The impact of social factors on tuberculosis management	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						empirical research report; inequalities in health; infection control; multi-professional practice; public health nursing; risk management; social factors; tuberculosis	DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY	Aim. This paper is a report of a study to examine the impact of social factors on the management of tuberculosis including engagement with services, hospitalization and extended treatment. Background. Rates of tuberculosis in major European cities have increased greatly in the last 10 years. The changing epidemiology of the disease, concentrated in marginalized groups, presents new challenges to the control of tuberculosis. Methods. A prospective cohort study of 250 newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients was conducted in London between January 2003 and January 2005. Data were collected by means of a risk assessment tool and from medical records. Outcome measures included missed appointments, frequency and duration of hospitalization and length of treatment. Results. The median age of the study sample was 33.82 (range 16.4-92.5) and 56.8% were male. Thirty-two per cent were hostel/street homeless or temporarily sharing accommodation with friends or relatives. Thirty-nine per cent were in receipt of welfare benefits and 13.2% had no income. Over a third anticipated difficulties taking their medicines and 30.3% had noone to remind them of this. Increased hospitalization was associated with hostel/street homelessness, drug or alcohol use and having noone to remind them to take their medicines (all P <= 0.01). Missed appointments were associated with drug/alcohol use and previous tuberculosis treatment. Extended treatment was also associated with drug/alcohol use; previous tuberculosis treatment, drug resistance and those anticipating difficulties taking medication (all P <= 0.001). Conclusions. The development of a social outreach model of care with an emphasis on prevention and support is an essential aspect of modern, international tuberculosis care.

Developing health indicators for people with intellectual disabilities. The method of the Pomona project	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH			English	Article						intellectual disabilities; health indicators; health inequality; method	PREVALENCE; ADULTS	Aim Recently, attention has focused on the health inequalities experienced by people with intellectual disabilities (ID) when compared with the general population. To inform policies aimed at equalizing health opportunities, comparable evidence is needed about the aspects of their health that may be amenable to intervention. Method Applying the framework of the European Community Health Indicators (ECHI) for the general population, the Pomona group developed a set of health indicators reflecting aspects of the health of people with ID: socio-demographic data, health status, health determinants and health systems. Results This paper documents the procedures that partners carried out in 13 European countries. The process comprised a search for evidence in published literature; consultation with advocates, family members and health professionals; and analyses of national and international databases. Indicators were selected if they were appraised as important, useful, measurable and if resulting data would enable comparisons between the health of people with ID and that of the general population. Conclusion The thus developed indicator set that is aligned with ECHI will permit investigators to compare key aspects of health of people with ID with those of people in the general population within Europe. The final set of 18 indicators will be applied in the Pomona. project (2005-08) to gather information about the health of samples of adults in 14 participating European countries.

This article describes the development of a proposed national research framework in child maltreatment, as requested by the Department of Justice, Canada, based on (1) a review of the literature, (2) consultation with experts, and (3) application of evaluation criteria for considering research priorities. The article identifies gaps in knowledge about child maltreatment in Canada and proposes a research agenda to make evidence-based policy decisions more likely. Although this work was driven by gaps in Canada's knowledge about child maltreatment, the international scope of the review and consultation process could make the findings useful to broader research and policy audiences.

The migration of nurses, physicians and other health professionals from countries in sub-Saharan Africa poses a major threat to the achievement of health equity in this region. As nurses form the backbone of healthcare systems in many of the affected countries, it is the accelerating migration of nurses that will be most critical over the next few years. In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the literature and argue that, from a human rights perspective, there are competing rights in the international migration of health professionals: the right to leave one's country to seek a better life; the right to health of populations in the source and destination countries; labour rights; the right to education; and the right to nondiscrimination and equality. Creative policy approaches are required to balance these rights and to ensure that the individual rights of health professionals do not compromise the societal right to health.

Human rights and relief organizations try hard to contain the devastation of these interconnected difficulties. What is the role of the biomedical scientist in this endeavor? The challenges that biomedical scientists face in their research lead us to question whether scientists can go beyond the time-consuming realm of experimental investigation and engage the issues of society in a more public way. I suggest how the scientist's role can be expanded in our complex and precarious world, introducing the idea of the modern biomedical researcher as scientist, scholar-philosopher, and statesman for the scientific community and the larger human rights community. I provide examples of where the scientist can interface with human rights organizations, medical doctors, political and civic leaders, and the science-religion dialogue. My argument reveals the emerging role of the biomedical scientist as one of public service in addition to and beyond the realm of the experimental investigator. This role, however, is formidable, and I list some of the obstacles it entails.

MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article							PRIMARY-CARE	There is evidence that Australia is not meeting its obligations to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for their right to the "highest attainable standard" of health, required under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Poor access to primary health care for Aboriginal peoples and substantial shortfalls in government spending to address this are in violation of the ICESCR. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' share of the universal health coverage expenditure offered to all Australians is less per person than for other Australians. The failure to monitor the provision of mainstream health services to Aboriginal peoples and inequitable distribution of health facilities and services compound these violations. Equality in health between Indigenous and non-indigenous Australians is achievable, but not until the shortfall in health services expenditure for Indigenous Australians is addressed.

Using GIS-based methods of multicriteria analysis to construct socio-economic deprivation indices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article							SELF-REPORTED HEALTH; POPULATION HEALTH; MORTALITY; INEQUALITIES; DIMENSIONS; SERVICES; OUTCOMES	Background: Over the past several decades researchers have produced substantial evidence of a social gradient in a variety of health outcomes, rising from systematic differences in income, education, employment conditions, and family dynamics within the population. Social gradients in health are measured using deprivation indices, which are typically constructed from aggregated socio-economic data taken from the national census - a technique which dates back at least until the early 1970's. The primary method of index construction over the last decade has been a Principal Component Analysis. Seldom are the indices constructed from survey-based data sources due to the inherent difficulty in validating the subjectivity of the response scores. We argue that this very subjectivity can uncover spatial distributions of local health outcomes. Moreover, indication of neighbourhood socio-economic status may go underrepresented when weighted without expert opinion. In this paper we propose the use of geographic information science (GIS) for constructing the index. We employ a GIS-based Order Weighted Average (OWA) Multicriteria Analysis (MCA) as a technique to validate deprivation indices that are constructed using more qualitative data sources. Both OWA and traditional MCA are well known and used methodologies in spatial analysis but have had little application in social epidemiology. Results: A survey of British Columbia's Medical Health Officers (MHOs) was used to populate the MCA-based index. Seven variables were selected and weighted based on the survey results. OWA variable weights assign both local and global weights to the index variables using a sliding scale, producing a range of variable scenarios. The local weights also provide leverage for controlling the level of uncertainty in the MHO response scores. This is distinct from traditional deprivation indices in that the weighting is simultaneously dictated by the original respondent scores and the value of the variables in the dataset. Conclusion: OWA-based MCA is a sensitive instrument that permits incorporation of expert opinion in quantifying socio-economic gradients in health status. OWA applies both subjective and objective weights to the index variables, thus providing a more rational means of incorporating survey results into spatial analysis.

Since society does not have sufficient resources to address all of these environmental factors at one time, it is important to set priorities for bioethical theorizing and policy formation. Two considerations should be used to set these priorities: (1) the impact of the environmental factor on health inequality, and (2) the practicality of addressing the factor.

J	Wagstaff, A				Wagstaff, Adam			Health systems in East Asia: What can developing countries learn from Japan and the Asian Tigers?	HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						health systems; Hong Kong; Japan; Korea; Taiwan; Singapore	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; CARE FINANCE; MEDICAL-CARE; REFORM; TAIWAN; EQUITY; PROGRESSIVITY; INSURANCE; SINGAPORE; PAYMENT	The health systems of Japan and the Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan), and the recent reforms to them, provide many potentially valuable lessons to East Asia's developing countries. All five systems have managed to keep a check on health spending despite their different approaches to financing and delivery. These differences are reflected in the progressivity of health finance, but the precise degree of progressivity of individual sources and the extent to which households are vulnerable to catastrophic health payments depend on the design features of the system - the height of any ceilings on social insurance contributions, the fraction of health spending covered by the benefit package, the extent to which the poor face reduced copayments, whether there are caps on copayments, and so on. On the delivery side, too, Japan and the Tigers offer some interesting lessons. Singapore's experience with corporatizing public hospitals - rapid cost and price inflation, a race for the best technology, and so on - illustrates the ditficulties of corporatization. Korea's experience with a narrow benefit package illustrates the danger of providers shifting demand from insured services with regulated prices to uninsured services with unregulated prices. Japan, in its approach to rate setting for insured services, has managed to combine careful cost control with fine-tuning of profit margins on different types of care. Experiences with DRGs in Korea and Taiwan point to cost-savings but also to possible knock-on effects on service volume and total health spending. Korea and Taiwan both offer important lessons for the separation of prescribing and dispensing, including the risks of compensation costs outweighing the cost savings caused by more 'rational' prescribing, and cost-savings never being realized because of other concessions to providers, such as allowing them to have onsite pharmacists.

People in urban settings are exposed to a variety of health hazards that are interconnected with their health effects. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have underlined the multidimensional nature of poverty and the connections between health and social conditions and present an opportunity to move beyond narrow sectoral interventions and to develop comprehensive social responses and participatory processes that address the root causes of health inequity. Considering the complexity and magnitude of health, poverty, and environmental issues in cities, it is clear that improvements in health and health equity demand not only changes in the physical and social environment of cities, but also an integrated approach that takes into account the wider socioeconomic and contextual factors affecting health. Integrated or multilevel approaches should address not only the immediate, but also the underlying and particularly the fundamental causes at societal level of related health issues. The political and legal organization of the policy-making process has been identified as a major determinant of urban and global health, as a result of the role it plays in creating possibilities for participation, empowerment, and its influence on the content of public policies and the distribution of scarce resources. This paper argues that it is essential to adopt a long-term multisectoral approach to address the social determinants of health in urban settings. For comprehensive approaches to address the social determinants of health effectively and at multiple levels, they need explicitly to tackle issues of participation, governance, and the politics of power, decision making, and empowerment.

It is also highly inequitable, as the greatest risks are to the poorest populations, who have contributed least to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The rapid economic development and the concurrent urbanization of poorer countries mean that developing-country cities will be both vulnerable to health hazards from climate change and, simultaneously, an increasing contributor to the problem. We review the specific health vulnerabilities of urban populations in developing countries and highlight the range of large direct health effects of energy policies that are concentrated in urban areas. Common vulnerability factors include coastal location, exposure to the urban heat-island effect, high levels of outdoor and indoor air pollution, high population density, and poor sanitation. There are clear opportunities for simultaneously improving health and cutting GHG emissions most obviously through policies related to transport systems, urban planning, building regulations and household energy supply. These influence some of the largest current global health burdens, including approximately 800,000 annual deaths from ambient urban air pollution, 1.2 million from road-traffic accidents, 1.9 million from physical inactivity, and 1.5 million per year from indoor air pollution. GHG emissions and health protection in developing-country cities are likely to become increasingly prominent in policy development. There is a need for a more active input from the health sector to ensure that development and health policies contribute to a preventive approach to local and global environmental sustainability, urban population health, and health equity.

The complex dynamics of cities, with their concentration of the poorest and most vulnerable (even within the developed world) pose an urgent challenge to the health community. While retaining fidelity to the core principles of disease prevention and control, major adjustments are needed in the systems and approaches to effectively reach those with the greatest health risks (and the least resilience) within today's urban environment. This is particularly relevant to infectious disease prevention and control. Controlling and preventing HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and vector-borne diseases like malaria are among the key global health priorities, particularly in poor urban settings. The challenge in slums and informal settlements is not in identifying which interventions work, but rather in ensuring that informal settlers: (1) are captured in health statistics that define disease epidemiology and (2) are provided opportunities equal to the rest of the population to access proven interventions. Growing international attention to the plight of slum dwellers and informal settlers, embodied by Goal 7 Target 11 of the Millennium Development Goals, and the considerable resources being mobilized by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, among others, provide an unprecedented potential opportunity for countries to seriously address the structural and intermediate determinants of poor health in these settings. Viewed within the framework of the "social determinants of disease" model, preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS, TB and vector-borne diseases requires broad and integrated interventions that address the underlying causes of inequity that result in poorer health and worse health outcomes for the urban poor. We examine insights into effective approaches to disease control and prevention within poor urban settings under a comprehensive social development agenda.

It explains the links between social and environmental determinants of health in urban settings. Interventions to improve health equity through the environment include actions and policies that deal with proximal risk factors in deprived urban areas, such as safe drinking water supply, reduced air pollution from household cooking and heating as well as from vehicles and industry, reduced traffic injury hazards and noise, improved working environment, and reduced heat stress because of global climate change. The urban environment involves health hazards with an inequitable distribution of exposures and vulnerabilities, but it also involves opportunities for implementing interventions for health equity. The high population density in many poor urban areas means that interventions at a small scale level can assist many people, and existing infrastructure can sometimes be upgraded to meet health demands. Interventions at higher policy levels that will create more sustainable and equitable living conditions and environments include improved city planning and policies that take health aspects into account in every sector. Health equity also implies policies and actions that improve the global living environment, for instance, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. In a global equity perspective, improving the living environment and health of the poor in developing country cities requires actions to be taken in the most affluent urban areas of the world. This includes making financial and technical resources available from high-income countries to be applied in low-income countries for urgent interventions for health equity.

The earlier industrialized countries have developed more infrastructure to support the building of healthy housing, in neighborhoods that are strongly linked to municipal and global health initiatives, but to some degree housing and neighborhood issues vary only in degree between the developing and developed worlds. Overall, a billion people, a third of people living in urban areas, live in slums, where environmental determinants lead to disease. Although communicable diseases predominate in the developing world and have reemerged in the developed world, noncommunicable diseases are also growing disproportionately in the developing world. At a global level, the Millennium Development Goals explicitly focus on an integrated approach to slum upgrading. The per capita cost of slum upgrading is almost twice the cost of providing new affordable housing at the outset. It is argued that to improve health and well-being in the slums we need to have interventions that reduce urban poverty in the broadest sense and improve the deficiencies associated with slums. There is an urgent need to scale up the best-practice interventions. Examples are given of successful local community initiatives that have been set up under national strategies in Tanzania and by Indian women's collectives that are globally linked and have helped develop housing and sanitation improvements. The unit costs for such interventions are within the reach of all the key stakeholders. Global commitment is the only missing link.

The foreseeable trend is for rising inequities across a wide range of social and health dimensions. Although qualitatively different, this trend exists in both the developed and developing worlds. Improving the health of people in slums will require new analytic frameworks. The social-determinants approach emphasizes the role of factors that operate at multiple levels, including global, national, municipal, and neighborhood levels, in shaping health. This approach suggests that improving living conditions in such arenas as housing, employment, education, equality, quality of living environment, social support, and health services is central to improving the health of urban populations. While social determinant and multilevel perspectives are not uniquely urban, they are transformed when viewed through the characteristics of cities such as size, density, diversity, and complexity. Ameliorating the immediate living conditions in the cities in which people live offers the greatest promise for reducing morbidity, mortality, and disparities in health and for improving quality of life and well being.

J	Yusuf, S; Nabeshima, K; Ha, W				Yusuf, Shahid; Nabeshima, Kaoru; Ha, Wei			Income and Health in Cities: the Messages from Stylized Facts	JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE			English	Article						Cities; Growth; Health; Income; Sanitation; Water		The benefits of good health to individuals and to society are strongly positive, and improving the health of the poor is a key millennium development goal (MDG). A typical health strategy advocated by some calls for increased public spending on health targeted to favor the poor backed by foreign assistance, combined with an international effort to perfect drugs and vaccines to ameliorate the major infectious diseases prevalent in developing nations. However, if the objective is better health outcomes at the least cost and a reduction in urban health inequity, our research suggests that the four most potent policy interventions are: improving access to clean water and sanitation; widely available primary care and health programs aimed at influencing diets and lifestyles; raising the level of education; and better urban land use and transport planning which contains urban sprawl and minimizes the trend towards sedentary living habits. The payoff from these four, in terms of health outcomes especially for those in low-income categories, dwarfs the returns from new drugs and curative hospital-based medicine, although these certainly have their place in a modern urban health system. We find, moreover, that the resource requirements for successful health care policies are likely to depend on an acceleration of economic growth rates, which increase household purchasing power and enlarge the pool of resources available to national and subnational governments to invest in and maintain health-related infrastructure and services. Thus, an acceleration of growth rates may be necessary to sustain a viable urban health strategy, which is equitable, and to ensure steady gains in health outcomes.

J	Nurse, L; Moore, R				Nurse, Leonard; Moore, Rawleston			Critical considerations for future action during the second commitment period: A small islands' perspective	NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM			English	Article						climate change; second commitment period; emissions reduction targets; SIDS vulnerability; equity	CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; ADAPTATION; DANGERS	If the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to be achieved, Parties must commit themselves to meeting meaningful long-term targets that, based on current knowledge, would minimize the possibility of irreversible climate change. Current indications are that a global mean temperature rise in excess of 2-3 degrees C would enhance the risk of destabilizing the climate system as we know it, and possibly lead to catastrophic change such as a shutdown of the deep ocean circulation, and the disintegration of the West Arctic Ice Sheet. Observations have shown that for many small island developing States (SIDS), life-sustaining ecosystems such as coral reefs, already living near the limit of thermal tolerance, are highly climate-sensitive, and can suffer severe damage from exposure to sea temperatures as low as 1 degrees C above the seasonal maximum. Other natural systems (e.g., mangroves) are similarly susceptible to relatively low temperature increases, coupled with small increments of sea level rise. Economic and social sectors, including agriculture and human health, face similar challenges from the likely impacts of projected climate change. In light of known thresholds, this paper presents the view that SIDS should seek support for a temperature cap not exceeding 1.5-2.0 degrees C above the pre-industrial mean. It is argued that a less stringent post-Kyoto target would frustrate achievement of the UNFCCC objective. The view is expressed that all countries which emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases should commit to binding reduction targets in the second commitment period, but that targets for developing countries should be less stringent than those agreed for developed countries. Such an arrangement would be faithful to the principles of equity and would ensure that the right of Parties to attain developed country status would not be abrogated.

SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Africa; migration; health workers; recruitment; impacts; policy	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HUMAN-RESOURCES; PHYSICIANS; SHORTAGES; NURSES	Migration of skilled health workers from sub-Saharan African countries has significantly increased in this century, with most countries becoming sources of migrants. Despite the growing problem of health worker migration for the effective functioning of health care systems there is a remarkable paucity and incompleteness of data. Hence, it is difficult to determine the real extent of migration from, and within, Africa, and thus develop effective forecasting or remedial policies. This global overview and the most comprehensive data indicate that the key destinations remain the USA and the UK, and that major sources are South Africa and Nigeria, but in both contexts there is now greater diversity. Migrants move primarily for economic reasons, and increasingly choose health careers because they offer migration prospects. Migration has been at considerable economic cost, it has depleted workforces, diminished the effectiveness of health care delivery and reduced the morale of the remaining workforce. Countries have sought to implement national policies to manage migration, mitigate its harmful impacts and strengthen African health care systems. Recipient countries have been reluctant to establish effective ethical codes of recruitment practice, or other forms of compensation or technology transfer, hence migration is likely to increase further in the future, diminishing the possibility of achieving the United Nations millennium development goals and exacerbating existing inequalities in access to adequate health care.

The negative side of focusing rigorously on production improvement was eminent around 1980 and led to considerations of environmental, gender and equity aspects making agricultural development much more complex than previously. In the search for new ways of addressing the persisting problems of food insecurity and malnutrition, new ways should be explored. Based on the experiences from three international, African research projects, the article argues the case of participatory action research and cross-disciplinarity as some of the key elements in future animal science research in developing countries. The benefits are outlined as well as the challenges for the researchers and the donor agencies.

Design: Countries had HIV rates from 27 to 0.1%, the standard of care varied from access to anti retrovi ral drugs to no availability, and the reporting of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) to government agencies was mandatory in some countries and not in others. These variations presented challenges when developing decision rules that could be uniformly adopted across countries and simultaneously follow the ethical principles of beneficence, respect, and justice. Methods: We used several strategies to identify and resolve ethical dilemmas for this international HIV prevention trial. First, we identified key principles, especially those derived for clinical therapeutic, biomedical preventive, or device trials. We convened a 'workgroup on protecting human participants' and charged them with identifying and implementing optimal procedures for ensuring the ethical and equitable treatment of participants and making recommendations to minimize physical, psychological, and social harm to the participants. Each site had a community advisory board, essential in identifying local ethical issues and possible resolutions to them. The NIMH established a data safety and monitoring board with ultimate responsibility for adjudicating ethical dilemmas and decisions. The protocols were deliberated thoroughly by the Trial steering committee, and approved by nine United States and five in-country institutional review boards. Results: We summarize the decision rules adopted to resolve the ethical dilemmas identified. Especially important were the translation of clinical trials principles for a behavioral intervention trial, strategies for ensuring confidentiality and informed consent, dilemmas relating to partner notification of sexually transmitted infections including HIV, minimizing the risks of social harm, establishing community partnerships, ensuring equity among United States and in-country principal investigators, and building capacity for additional research. Conclusion: We document our processes and decisions, and their underlying rationales, and hope they contribute to the development of further thinking and practice regarding the ethics of social and behavioral HIV and STD prevention trials in resource-poor settings.

Demographic changes are precipitating rapid population aging in developing nations, however, and ethical issues regarding older people's claim to scarce healthcare resources must be addressed. This paper posits that the traditional arguments about generational justice and age-based rationing of healthcare resources, which were developed primarily in more industrialized nations, fail to adequately address the unique challenges facing older persons in developing nations. Existing philosophical approaches to age-based resource allocation underemphasize the importance of older persons for developing countries and fail to adequately consider the rights and interests of older persons in these settings. Ultimately, the paper concludes that the most appropriate framework for thinking about generational justice in developing nations is a rights-based approach that allows for the interests I of all age groups, including the oldest, to be considered in the determination of health resource allocation.

J	Pearce, J; Witten, K; Hiscock, R; Blakely, T				Pearce, Jamie; Witten, Karen; Hiscock, Rosemary; Blakely, Tony			Are socially disadvantaged neighbourhoods deprived of health-related community resources?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						health inequality; neighbourhoods; context; community resources; New Zealand	NEW-ZEALAND; GEOGRAPHICAL INEQUALITIES; CARE; ACCESS; AREA; FOOD; ACCESSIBILITY; MORTALITY; ENVIRONMENTS; DISPARITIES	Background Recent work in a number of countries has identified growing geographical inequalities in health between deprived and non-deprived neighbourhoods. The health gaps observed cannot be entirely explained by differences in the characteristics of individuals living in those neighbourhoods, which has led to a concerted international public health research effort to determine what contextual features of neighbourhoods matter. This article reports on access to potentially health-promoting community resources across all neighbourhoods in New Zealand. Prevailing international opinion is that access to community resources is worse in deprived neighbourhoods. Methods Geographical information Systems were used to calculate geographical access to 16 types of community resources (including recreational amenities, and shopping, educational and health facilities) in 38350 small census areas across the country. The distribution of 'these access measures by neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation was determined. Results For 15 out of 16 measures of community resources, access was clearly better in more deprived neighbourhoods. For example, the travel time to large supermarkets was similar to 80% greater in the least deprived quintile of neighbourhoods compared with the most deprived quintile. Conclusions These results challenge the widely held, but largely untested, view that areas of high social disadvantage have poorer access to community resources. Poor locational access to community resources among deprived neighbourhoods in New Zealand does not appear to be an explanation of poorer health in these neighbourhoods.

Design: Analysis of the 2002 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, a cross-sectional survey that employs a self-completion questionnaire in a nationally representative random sample of school classrooms in the Republic of Ireland. Subjects: A total of 8424 schoolchildren (aged 10-17 years) from 176 schools, with an 83% response rate from children. Results: Food poverty was found to be similarly distributed among the three social classes (15.3% in the lower social classes, 15.9% in the middle social classes and 14.8% in the higher social Classes). it was also found that schoolchildren reporting food poverty are less likely to eat fruits, vegetables and brown bread, odds ratio (OR) from 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.87) to 0.81 (95% a 0.63-0.99); more likely to eat crisps, fried potatoes and hamburgers, OR from 1.20 (95% Cl 1.00-1.40) to 1.62 (95% CI 1.39-1.85); and more likely to miss breakfast on weekdays, OR from 1.29 (95% CI 0.33-1.59) to 1.72 (95% CI 1.50-1-95). The risk of somatic and mental symptoms is also increased, OR from 1.48 (95% CI 1.18-1.78) to 2.57 (95% CI 2.33-2.81); as are negative health perceptions, OR from 0.63 (95% CI 0.43-0-83) to 0.52 (95% CI 0.28-0.76) and measures of life dissatisfaction, OR from 1.88 (95% CI 1.64-2.12) to 2.25 (95% CI 2.05-2.45). Similar results were found for life dissatisfaction in an international comparison of 32 countries. All analyses were adjusted for age and social class. Conclusions: Food poverty in schoolchildren is not restricted to those from lower social class families, is associated with a substantial risk to physical and mental health and well-being, and requires the increased attention of policy makers and practitioners.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if the employee's previous learning experience and characteristics of the working environment were associated with positive attitudes towards organizational change. The 467 employees (73.5% males) working in a global oil company in the early phases of a downsizing process were asked to answer a questionnaire with demographic variables, perception of the working environment, and attitude to change (93% response rate). Corporate social responsibility (CSR), involvement and participation, team leadership and team effectiveness were important factors related to positive attitudes towards organizational change. Non-leaders and older employees were positive to change. We conclude that employees' perceptions of their psychosocial working environment, in particular the CSR, were highly related to their attitude to organizational change.

For sustainable development that supports environmental and human health in Beijing and during the upcoming "green" Olympic games in 2008, experts and political leaders must acknowledge the urgent health risks from environmental changes related to urbanization. A range of urban health hazards and associated health risks in Beijing result from a variety of factors including heat islands, air pollution, water crisis, soil pollution, infectious diseases, and urban consumerism; in addition, some hazardous health conditions are associated with inequality in living and working conditions. The authors suggest 2 main areas for policy action and research direction: (1) the need to get full-scale information related to environmental monitoring data and health data (and then to provide new methodological approaches and techniques to implement interventions) and (2) the need for effective cooperation among different sectors.

Given what is known about influences on the social determinants of health in an interconnected world, the G8 are a logical starting point for any enquiry into the relations between foreign policy and health. We first make five arguments for adopting an explicitly normative, equity-oriented perspective on the performance of G8 policy in areas related to population health. We then examine G8 performance with respect to the crucial policy triad of development assistance, debt relief and trade, finding that neither rhetoric nor promising institutional innovation has been matched by resources commensurate with demonstrated. levels of need. We conclude that it is necessary to pursue advocacy efforts based on the normative perspective we have put forward and that doing so effectively requires further investigation of why some polities are more receptive than others to policies of redistribution both within and outside their borders.

J	Scott-Samuel, A; O'Keefe, E				Scott-Samuel, Alex; O'Keefe, Eileen			Health impact assessment, human rights and global public policy: a critical appraisal	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article								Public policy decisions in both the social and economic spheres have enormous impact on global public health. As a result of this, and of the skewed global distribution of power and resources, health impact assessment (HIA) potentially has a key role to play in foreign policy-making and global public policy-making. Governments, multilateral bodies and transnational corporations need to be held to account for the health impacts of their policies and practices. One route towards achieving this objective involves the inclusion of human rights assessments within HIA. International commitments to human rights instruments and standards can be used as a global auditing tool. Methodological issues may limit the effectiveness of HIA in promoting health equity. These issues include the use of procedures that favour those holding power in the policy process or the use of procedures that fail to apply values of equity and participation. The identification and production of evidence that includes the interests of less powerful groups is a priority for HIA and would be furthered if a human rights-based method of HIA were developed. Because HIA considers all types of policies and examines all potential determinants of health, it can play a part when foreign policy is developed and global decisions are made to treat people as rights holders. Since the human right to health is shaped by the determinants of health, developing links between the right to health assessment (that is, an assessment of the impact of policies on the right to health) and HIA - as recently proposed by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to health - could strengthen the development of foreign policy and global decisions. Such links should be pursued and applied to the development of foreign policy and to the operation of multilateral bodies.

J	Cohen, JC; Mrazek, M; Hawkins, L				Cohen, J. C.; Mrazek, M.; Hawkins, L.			Tackling corruption in the pharmaceutical systems worldwide with courage and conviction	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article								Poor drug access continues to be one of the main global health problems. Global inequalities in access to pharmaceuticals are caused by a number of variables including poverty high drug prices, poor health infrastructure, and fraud and corruption - the latter being the subject of this article. There is growing recognition among policy makers that corruption in the pharmaceutical system can waste valuable resources allocated to pharmaceutical products and services. This, in turn, denies those most in need from life-saving or life-enhancing medicines. As a result, international organizations, including the World Health Organization and the World Bank are beginning to address the issue of corruption in the health sector broadly and the pharmaceutical system specifically. This is encouraging news for improving drug access for the global poor who are most harmed by corruption as they tend to purchase less expensive drugs from unqualified or illegal drug sellers selling counterfeit or sub-standard drugs. In our paper, we illuminate what are the core issues that relate to corruption in the pharmaceutical sector. We argue that corruption in the pharmaceutical system can be detrimental to a country's ability to improve the health of its population. Moreover, unless policy makers deal with the issue of corruption, funding allocated to the pharmaceutical system to treat health conditions may simply be wasted and the inequality between rich and poor in access to health and pharmaceutical products will be aggravated.

The authors describe their experience in administering a Web-based, international survey to English-speaking countries. Identifying the sample was a multistage effort involving (a) searching for published e-mail addresses, (b) conducting Web searches for publicly funded agencies, and (c) performing literature searches, personal contacts, and extensive Internet searches for individuals. After pretesting, the survey was converted into an electronic format accessible by multiple Web browsers. Sampling bias arose from (a) system incompatibility, which did not allow potential respondents to open the survey, (b) varying institutional gate-keeping policies that "recognized" the unsolicited survey as spam, (c) culturally unique program terminology, which confused some respondents, and (d) incomplete sampling frames. Solutions are offered to the first three problems, and the authors note that sampling bias remains a crucial problem.

Where it persists, it is a startling reminder of the vast disparities in maternal health care. Inequities in access to skilled care at delivery and caesarean section and lack of available and affordable treatment care mean that tens of thousands of new cases occur and the backlog of cases grows each year. Nurses and midwives have a key role in preventing and treating obstetric fistula. A global Campaign to End Fistula is now bringing actors together to address the neglected condition of obstetric fistula. Nurses and midwives should be engaged in the fight to end this injustice.

Method: Cross-sectional study. Probabilistic sample of clusters including all eligible households (low-income community - Embu, Southeastern Brazil). Participants: 479 children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years; attrition rate: 18.8%). Measurement: 1) Clinical mental health problems in children and adolescents using the Child Behavior Checklist and/or Youth Self-Report total problem scales; 2) Global impairment: positive score in the Brief Impairment Scale (total score > 15.5); 3) Care service capacity: total number of cases annually seen by psychologists/psychiatrists in the health, education, juvenile justice, and child welfare sectors. Results: Prevalence of mental health problems in children and adolescents: 24.6% (20.7-28.5) without considering global impairment; 7.3% (5.0-9.6) with global impairment (cases in need of treatment). Current annual service capacity can only provide care for 14.0% of impaired cases; approximately seven years would be necessary for all to be treated. Conclusions: Mental health problems in children and adolescents are frequent in the studied community, and the current structure of the community's public service system is not prepared to treat impaired cases in an adequate timeframe.

All stakeholders of the healthcare systems and disease treatment-including the pharmaceutical industry-have an ethical obligation to contribute to promoting global health. At Novo Nordisk we primarily focus on providing our contribution to global health through defeating diabetes. At the same time we stand by being a private company required to deliver a financial profit, which is why we must create positive results on the financial, the environmental and the social bottom lines. In this article we attempt to provide a brief overview of some of the initiatives that we think business companies can take - and therefore are also obliged to in promoting global health. Further, we have pointed out a number of dilemmas within research and development as well as business ethics that all companies face when they convert the ethical principles to daily practice globally.

Objective: To examine how well the Indian healthcare system protects households of differing living standards against the financial consequences of unanticipated health shocks. Data: The data are drawn from the 52nd round of National Sample Survey, a nationally representative socioeconomic and health survey conducted in 1995-1996. The sample comprises 24,379 (3.84%) households where a member was hospitalized during the 1-year reference period. Methods: We estimate, using ordinary least squares, the relationship between household consumption (proxy for ability to pay) and OOP payments for hospitalization. We also estimate the relationship between consumption and OOP share in consumption. Results: Our results indicate that both utilization (payments) and the consequent financial burden (payment share) increases with increasing ability to pay (ATP). While this relationship is retained across the different subgroups (e.g., gender, social code, region, etc.), comparisons across groups indicate horizontal inequities including differences in both degrees of progressivity and the redistributive effect. Conclusion: The finding that OOP payments do not decline with ATP could be an indication of: (1) the lack of insurance which implies that the better-off must pay from OOP to secure quality health care and (2) the absence of risk-pooling or prepayments mechanisms which poses financial impediments to the consumption of health care by the poor.

J	Baker, C				Baker, Cynthia			Globalization and the cultural safety of an immigrant Muslim community	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Article						community; cultural issues; multicultural issues; qualitative approaches; stress; transcultural nursing	RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; HEALTH	Aim. This paper reports a study the aim of which was to further understanding of cultural safety by focusing on the social health of a small immigrant community of Muslims in a relatively homogeneous region of Canada following the terror attacks on 11 September 2001 (9/11). Background. The aftermath of 9/11 negatively affected Muslims living in many centers of Western Europe and North America. Little is known about the social health of Muslims in smaller areas with little cultural diversity. Developed by Maori nurses, the cultural safety concept captures the negative health effects of inequities experienced by the indigenous people of New Zealand. Nurses in Canada have used the concept to understand the health of Aboriginal peoples. It has also been used to investigate the nursing care of immigrants in a Canadian metropolitan centre. Findings indicated, however, that the dichotomy between culturally safe and unsafe groups was blurred. Method. The methodology was qualitative, based on the constructivist paradigm. A purposive sample of 26 Muslims of Middle Eastern, Indian or Pakistani origin and residing in the province of New Brunswick, Canada were interviewed in 2002-2003. Findings. Participants experienced a sudden transition from cultural safety to cultural risk following 9/11. Their experience of cultural safety included a sense of social integration in the community and invisibility as a minority. Cultural risk stemmed from being in the spotlight of an international media and becoming a visible minority. Conclusion. Cultural risk is not necessarily rooted in historical events and may be generated by outside forces rather than by longstanding inequities in relationships between groups within the community. Nurses need to think about the cultural safety of their practices when caring for members of socially disadvantaged cultural minority groups as this may affect the health services delivered to them.

J	Luttikholt, LWM				Luttikholt, L. W. M.			Principles of organic agriculture as formulated by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements	NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						externalities; globalization; stakeholder process; value-based agriculture		To address globalization challenges, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (I FOAM) articulated the principles of organic agriculture through a worldwide participatory stakeholder process. The process aimed to bridge the values from the pioneers of organic agriculture to the present time of globalization and to extended growth of the organic sector. As a result the principles of health, ecology, fairness and care are now worldwide considered as the basis from which organic agriculture grows and develops. IFOAM institutionalized these four principles in its own work, for example in the revision of the Organic Guarantee System. The four principles offer a perspective on how to deal with the challenges of globalization. A response to these challenges seems to be to extend and further detail the standards so that, for instance, externalities can be included. However, stricter standards may not do justice to the principle of fairness, as they potentially undermine fair access to markets. Ideal would be a situation in which a balance between the principles and standards can be realized.

J	Gakidou, E; Vayena, E				Gakidou, Emmanuela; Vayena, Effy			Use of modern contraception by the poor is falling behind	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article							MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CHILD HEALTH; UNMET NEED; DETERMINANTS; POPULATION; SERVICES; CAMEROON; ACCESS; WORLD	Background The widespread increase in the use of contraception, due to multiple factors including improved access to modern contraception, is one of the most dramatic social transformations of the past fifty years. This study explores whether the global progress in the use of modern contraceptives has also benefited the poorest. Methods and Findings Demographic and Health Surveys from 55 developing countries were analyzed using wealth indices that allow the identification of the absolute poor within each country. This article explores the macro level determinants of the differences in the use of modern contraceptives between the poor and the national averages of several countries. Despite increases in national averages, use of modern contraception by the absolute poor remains low. South and Southeast Asia have relatively high rates of modern contraception in the absolute poor, on average 17% higher than in Latin America. Over time the gaps in use persist and are increasing. Latin America exhibits significantly larger gaps in use between the poor and the averages, while gaps in sub-Saharan Africa are on average smaller by 15.8% and in Southeast Asia by 11.6%. Conclusions The secular trend of increasing rates of modern contraceptive use has not resulted in a decrease of the gap in use for those living in absolute poverty. Countries with large economic inequalities also exhibit large inequalities in modern contraceptive use. In addition to macro level factors that influence contraceptive use, such as economic development and provision of reproductive health services, there are strong regional variations, with sub-Saharan Africa exhibiting the lowest national rates of use, South and Southeast Asia the highest use among the poor, and Latin America the largest inequalities in use.

J	Babones, SJ; Alvarez-Rivadulla, MJ				Babones, Salvatore J.; Alvarez-Rivadulla, Maria Jose			Standardized income inequality data for use in cross-national research	SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY			English	Article							WORLD	This article introduces the first version of a new, standardized data tool that can be used to test models of global income allocation, the Standardized Income Distribution Database (SIDD). It is based on a comprehensive collection of income distribution data compiled by the United Nations University's World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER 2000). International and intertemporal inconsistencies in these data have historically limited its use. We estimate adjustment factors for different scopes of coverage, income definitions, and reference units which, when applied to the raw data, bring all data to a common standard based on national coverage, gross income, and household per capita inequality. Criterion validity checks confirm that these adjustments boost the correlation between measured income inequality and national social indicators. The SIDD is also clean, free of duplicates, and easy to access. The SIDD will be useful both to students reading income inequality and to those conducting broad cross-national research on the relationship between income inequality and a range of important outcomes, such as health, criminality, and social support.

J	London, L				London, Leslie			'Issues of equity are also issues of rights': Lessons from experiences in Southern Africa	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ESSENTIAL MEDICINES; LIFE EXPECTANCY; GLOBAL HEALTH; HIV; AIDS; HIV/AIDS; AGENCIES; BACK	Background: Human rights approaches to health have been criticized as antithetical to equity, principally because they are seen to prioritise rights of individuals at the expense of the interests of groups, a core tenet of public health. The objective of this study was to identify how human rights approaches can promote health equity. Methods: The Network on Equity in Health in Southern Africa undertook an exploration of three regional case studies - antiretroviral access, patient rights charters and civic organization for health. A combination of archival reviews and stakeholder interviews were complemented with a literature review to provide a theoretical framework for the empirical evidence. Results: Critical success factors for equity are the importance of rights approaches addressing the full spectrum from civil and political, through to socio-economic rights, as well as the need to locate rights in a group context. Human rights approaches succeed in achieving health equity when coupled with community engagement in ways that reinforce community capacity, particularly when strengthening the collective agency of its most vulnerable groups. Additionally, human rights approaches provide opportunities for mobilising resources outside the health sector, and must aim to address the public-private divide at local, national and international levels. Conclusion: Where it is clear that rights approaches are predicated upon understanding the need to prioritize vulnerable groups and where the way rights are operationalised recognizes the role of agency on the part of those most affected in realising their socio-economic rights, human rights approaches appear to offer powerful tools to support social justice and health equity.

Mor			The challenge of workforce management in a global society: Modeling the relationship between diversity, inclusion, organizational culture, and employee well-being, job satisfaction and organizational commitment	ADMINISTRATION IN SOCIAL WORK			English	Review						workforce management; organizational culture; global society; diversity; job satisfaction; organizational commitment	SOCIAL SUPPORT; CHILD-WELFARE; WORK; STRESS; TURNOVER; JUSTICE; PERCEPTIONS; HEALTH; IDENTITY; MINORITY	Social work managers are increasingly challenged by the growing need to effectively manage workforce diversity and to create a welcoming and inclusive organizational environment. This is particularly important in light of the disproportional representation of women and members of minority groups in human service organizations and the gap between diversity of the client Population versus the diversity of the staff. With social identity theory and inclusion-exclusion conceptual frameworkas a backdrop, this. study tests a comprehensive theory-based model of the relationship between diversity, organizational culture, and employee outcomes. Using structural equations modeling, the proposed model was tested in a representative sample of one hundred and fourteen employees in a high tech company in Israel. The results point to significant paths between diversity and organizational-culture variables and between organizational-culture variables such as.faimess, inclusion, stress, and social support to employee outcomes of well-being, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Within the context of globalization, implications for social work management practices are drawn, particularly for implementing policies and practices that promote an inclusive organizational culture and a sense of belonging, satisfaction, and commitment in employees.

These measures frequently include intellectual property provisions that extend beyond the patent law standards agreed upon in recent World Trade Organization negotiations, which promised to balance the exigencies of public health and patent holders. In this paper, we analyze the concern that this augmentation of patent law standards will curtail access to essential medicines, particularly as they relate to the AIDS pandemic. We critically examine the potential threats posed by trade agreements vis-a-vis efforts to provide universal access to antiretroviral medications and contend that the conditioning of economic development upon the strengthening of intellectual property law demands careful attention when public health is at stake. Finally, we examine advocacy successes in challenging patent law and conclude that greater advocacy and policy strategies are needed to ensure the protection of global health in trade negotiations.

Newer genetics and biochemical techniques raise significant issues of community concern, impacting on privacy, informed consent, access to and retention of samples and information. Balance may be required to ensure protection of individual rights against potential benefits to the broader community. While many national organizations may already have appropriate policies addressing various ethics issues, there is a need for an international framework to assist those nations that have not yet developed such policies, as well as to enable alignment of existing national policies. We have proposed a generic ethics framework, incorporating a hierarchy of four fundamental guiding principles: autonomy, justice, non-maleficence and beneficence. Proposals or issues requiring policy development can be considered and tested against this hierarchy, resulting in the development of policy and positions consistent with the above framework, acceptable to all participating stakeholders.

DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW			English	Article						adolescent; education; effectiveness; inequity; school policy; smoking; socio-economic status	POLICIES; HEALTH; ENVIRONMENT; PREDICTORS; ADULTHOOD; CIGARETTE; EDUCATION; ALCOHOL; DRUG	Introduction and Aims. The international evidence about the effectiveness of school smoking bans on youth smoking initiation is equivocal. The purpose of the present study was to examine the association between school smoking bans and smoking initiation as a health outcome as well as academic achievement as an educational outcome, taking into account socioeconomic status. Design and Methods. This multi-level study was based on a cross-sectional self-reported anonymous data from 12 990 students who participated in the 2002 Student Drug Use Survey in the Atlantic Provinces. The main outcomes were having smoked a first whole cigarette in the year prior to the survey, and academic performance. The main independent variable at the individual- and school-levels was a school rule against smoking on school property or at school events, as reported by students. Results. Smoking initiation was predicted by individual-level demographic factors and by the contextual factor of attending a school with a high prevalence of established smoking, but failed to be predicted by a school smoking ban. The academic performance of students who indicated there was no school smoking ban was found to worsen as an increasing proportion of the student body indicated that such a rule existed. Lower socio-economic status was found to be an independent predictor of smoking initiation and poorer academic performance. Discussion and Conclusions. A school ban against smoking, in addition to not being clearly effective, might also not be entirely benign. School smoking policy should be monitored as to educational outcomes and the impact of policy on groups vulnerable to smoking.

An identification of the ethical issues involved may be useful to decision makers, particularly employers, workers, investors, and health authorities. Because the goal of occupational safety and health is the prevention of disease in workers, the situations that have ethical implications that most affect workers have been identified. These situations include the a) identification and communication of hazards and risks by scientists, authorities, and employers; b) workers' acceptance of risk, c) selection and implementation of controls; a) establishment of medical screening programs; and e) investment in toxicologic and control research. The ethical issues involve the unbiased determination of hazards and risks, nonmaleficence (doing no harm), autonomy, justice, privacy, and promoting respect for persons.

J	Kerry, VB; Lee, K				Kerry, Vanessa Bradford; Lee, Kelley			TRIPS, the Doha declaration and paragraph 6 decision: what are the remaining steps for protecting access to medicines?	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article							DRUG DEVELOPMENT; TRADE; AGREEMENT	Background: The World Trade Organisation's Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (known as the Doha Declaration) of 2001, and subsequent Decision on the Interpretation of Paragraph 6 reached in 2003, affirmed the flexibilities available under the Agreement on Trade Related Property Rights (TRIPS) to member states seeking to protect public health. Despite these important clarifications, the actual implementation of these measures to improve access to medicines remains uncertain. There are also concerns that so-called TRIPS-plus measures within many regional and bilateral trade agreements are further undermining the capacity of the poor to access affordable medicines. Methods: The paper reviews policy debates among governments, nongovernmental organisations and international organisations from 1995, and notably since 2003, surrounding access to medicines and trade agreements. The provisions for protecting public health provided by the Doha Declaration and Paragraph 6 Decision are reviewed in terms of challenges for implementation, along with measures to protect intellectual property rights (IPRs) under selected regional and bilateral trade agreements. Results: While provisions, in principle, were affirmed for member states under the TRIPS agreement to protect public health, numerous challenges remain. Implementation of the flexibilities has been hindered by lack of capacity in many LMICs. More intransigent have been stark inequalities in power and influence among trading nations, leaving LMICs vulnerable to pressures to permit the globalization of IPRs in order to protect broader trade and economic interests. Such inequalities are apparent in proposals or adopted TRIPS-plus measures which re-establish the primacy of trade over public health goals. Conclusion: Despite being hailed as a "watershed in international trade", the Doha Declaration and Paragraph 6 decision have not resolved the problem of access to affordable medicines. The way forward must begin with a simplification of their content, to enable actual implementation. More fundamentally, once agreed, public health protections under TRIPS must be recognised as taking precedent over measures subsequently adopted under other trade agreements. This requires, above all, setting aside such protections as a basic need and shared goal from trade negotiations at all levels.

In the first article in this three part series, we described the origins of the series in work conducted for the Globalization Knowledge Network of the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health and in the Commission's specific concern with health equity. We identified and defended a definition of globalization that gives primacy to the drivers and effects of transnational economic integration, and addressed a number of important conceptual and methodological issues in studying globalization's effects on SDH and their distribution, emphasizing the need for transdisciplinary approaches that reflect the complexity of the topic. In this second article, we identify and describe several, often interacting clusters of pathways leading from globalization to changes in SDH that are relevant to health equity. These involve: trade liberalization; the global reorganization of production and labour markets; debt crises and economic restructuring; financial liberalization; urban settings; influences that operate by way of the physical environment; and health systems changed by the global marketplace.

J	Labonté, R; Schrecker, T				Labonte, Ronald; Schrecker, Ted			Globalization and social determinants of health: Promoting health equity in global governance (part 3 of 3)	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Review							WATER PRIVATIZATION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; POOR; POLICY; ACCESS; MARKET; INSTITUTIONS; MORTALITY; POLITICS; PROGRESS	This article is the third in a three-part review of research on globalization and the social determinants of health (SDH). In the first article of the series, we identified and defended an economically oriented definition of globalization and addressed a number of important conceptual and metholodogical issues. In the second article, we identified and described seven key clusters of pathways relevant to globalization's influence on SDH. This discussion provided the basis for the premise from which we begin this article: interventions to reduce health inequities by way of SDH are inextricably linked with social protection, economic management and development strategy. Reflecting this insight, and against the background of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), we focus on the asymmetrical distribution of gains, losses and power that is characteristic of globalization in its current form and identify a number of areas for innovation on the part of the international community: making more resources available for health systems, as part of the more general task of expanding and improving development assistance; expanding debt relief and taking poverty reduction more seriously; reforming the international trade regime; considering the implications of health as a human right; and protecting the policy space available to national governments to address social determinants of health, notably with respect to the hypermobility of financial capital. We conclude by suggesting that responses to globalization's effects on social determinants of health can be classified with reference to two contrasting visions of the future, reflecting quite distinct values.

Broadly stated, SDH are the conditions in which people live and work, and that affect their opportunities to lead healthy lives. In this first article of a three-part series, we describe the origins of the series in work conducted for the Globalization Knowledge Network of the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health and in the Commission's specific concern with health equity. We explain our rationale for defining globalization with reference to the emergence of a global marketplace, and the economic and political choices that have facilitated that emergence. We identify a number of conceptual milestones in studying the relation between globalization and SDH over the period 1987-2005, and then show that because globalization comprises multiple, interacting policy dynamics, reliance on evidence from multiple disciplines (transdisciplinarity) and research methodologies is required. So, too, is explicit recognition of the uncertainties associated with linking globalization - the quintessential "upstream" variable - with changes in SDH and in health outcomes.

For longer-term risk protections, part of the premiums are invested to get higher yields. Although the protection buyer mitigates the individual risk to the large and better diversified portfolio of the insurer, it does not mean that the risk is completely reduced since the insurer may default his obligations. Insurers need to have sufficient equity or buffer capital to meet their obligations in adverse conditions when their losses on the diversified portfolio exceed the expected losses. Ratings provide an assessment of the ability of the insurer to meet its obligations to policy holders and debt holders. In this paper, the relationship between financial ratios and the rating is analyzed for different types of insurance companies using advanced statistical techniques that are able to detect non-linear relationship. The resulting rating model approach is similar to the approach for a low default portfolio, which uses a common set of explanatory variables (such as capitalization, profitability, leverage and size) which is generally applicable for all insurance types, and is complemented with insurance type specific ratios. The resulting model is found to yield a good accuracy, with 75% of the model ratings differing at most one notch from the external rating. (C) 2007 International Institute of Forecasters.

J	Navarro, V				Navarro, Vicente			Neoliberalism as a class ideology; Or, the political causes of the growth of inequalities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article								Neoliberalism is the dominant ideology permeating the public policies of many governments in developed and developing countries and of international agencies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, and many technical agencies of the United Nations, including the World Health Organization. This ideology postulates that the reduction of state interventions in economic and social activities and the deregulation of labor and financial markets, as well as of commerce and investments, have liberated the enormous potential of capitalism to create an unprecedented era of social well-being in the world's population. This article questions each of the theses that support such ideology, presenting empirical information that challenges them. The author also describes how the application of these neoliberal policies has been responsible for a substantial growth of social inequalities within the countries where such policies have been applied, as well as among countries. The major beneficiaries of these policies are the dominant classes of both the developed and the developing countries, which have established worldwide class alliances that are primarily responsible for the promotion of neoliberalism.

Using a large sample of nations, the authors explored whether differences in social policies explain differences in socioeconomic gradients across nations. Analyses were conducted on reading literacy in 15-year-olds, as an outcome related to cognitive development and to a host of factors that contribute to future well-being, including educational attainment and health. The results show a systematic variation in socioeconomic gradients and average scores across countries. Scores were favorable in countries with a long history of welfare state regimes, but countries where institutional change unfolded more recently and rapidly, or where welfare states are less well developed, clustered at the bottom of the rankings. Strong support was found for the "flattening up" hypothesis, which suggests that nations with higher average scores have less socioeconomic inequality in scores (or flatter gradients). Potential explanations for the observed patterns include differences between nations in the extent and distribution of income and social goods important for children's development.

Its theme is the potential of the European Convention on Human Rights to secure the human rights of people with mental disorders and disabilities, viewed in the context of the legislation on mental health and mental incapacity in England and Wales. Its conclusion is that the Convention is better at protecting them from unwanted or unnecessary treatment and care than it is at securing for them equal access to the treatment and care they want or need.

Methods: A comprehensive health information framework was developed on a generic framework by the ISO (2001) to use for the analysis of gender equity within mainstream health systems. A sample of 1095 indicators used by key international organizations were mapped to this framework and assessed for technical quality and gender sensitivity. Results: The evaluation found deficiencies in the indicators currently in use, from the viewpoint of both technical quality and underlying conceptual bases, as well as in their coverage of the framework, and especially in relation to health system performance. Conclusions: Routine administrative reporting offered large numbers of indicators but these did not allow for monitoring of gender equity and health. The paper concludes that there is merit in developing a core set of leading indicators that can be used for comparisons across peer countries and communities.

Approaches to developing an improved cross-national understanding of concepts and terms relating to ethnicity and race	INTERNATIONAL SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						census; concept; ethnicity; race; terminology	CENSUS CATEGORIES; HEALTH-CARE; INEQUALITIES; POPULATION; WHITE	Investigators from the fields of comparative social and epiden-dological research have identified the need for an improved cross-national understanding of the concepts and terms relating to ethnicity and race. Suggestions have included the harmonization in surveys of variables like ethnicity and religion in a comparative European context and an internationally applicable and agreed glossary of terms relating to ethnicity and race. Pleas have been entered for work towards such goals, involving statistical offices and institutions in the European Union and bodies like the World Health Organization and International Epidemiological Association. This article examines how the conceptual bases of this terminology, issues of geographical specificity and the problem of which terms merit recognition impact on these goals. Different approaches to improving our understanding of this terminology in a cross-national context are explored. Given that the meanings of concepts and terms in the field of ethnicity and race invariably can only be understood in their national context of use - which is frequently layered, manifold, subtle and complex - an approach that explores the connotative reach of the different concepts and terms within this context is needed. Functional equivalence is more likely to be achieved by harmonization than the systematization of such knowledge through the economical form of a glossary of synthetic analytical terminology. However, given the socially and psychologically driven nature of ethnicity as a 'global' concept, harmonization may only be successful when limited to its multiple dimensions.

However, as economic and subsistence importance has increased so have incidences of conflict over resource use and threats to ecosystem health. One of the main conflicts relates to traditional resource use as practiced by native islanders alongside new types of uses, methods, and exploitation, particularly with regards to industrial fishing. This conflict is exacerbated by historically centralized marine management processes linked primarily to economic development, which have excluded native islanders from planning and decision-making, failed to recognize their fishing rights, and lacked respect for the inherent sociocultural importance of traditional knowledge. In acknowledgment of the need to involve stakeholders in resource management planning, the local representative of Colombia's National Environment System (SINA), CORALINA, has embraced an alternative approach to historical top-down schemes. The approach is characterized by: (1) recovering traditional best management practices in coastal and marine management and integrating them with appropriate new methods; (2) involving stakeholders, especially native islanders, as equal partners in planning and implementation processes; (3) building local, national, and international coalitions and partnerships; (4) strengthening the capacity of local institutions; and (5) creating new capacity through formal and informal educational initiatives. At the heart of this approach is participation and equity for all, as exemplified in the planning process for the archipelago's Seaflower Marine Protected Area (MPA). (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, health has many determinants beyond the health sector that are less evident than proximate predictors. Aim: To assess the relative importance of major socioeconomic determinants of population health, measured as infant mortality rate (IMR), at country level. Methods: National-level data from 152 countries based on World Development Indicators 2003 were used for multivariate linear regression analyses of five socioeconomic predictors of IMR: public spending on health, GNI/capita, poverty rate, income equality (Gini index), and young female illiteracy rate. Analyses were performed on a global level and stratified for low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Results: In order of importance, GNI/capita, young female illiteracy, and income equality predicted 92% of the variation in national IMR whereas public spending on health and poverty rate were non-significant determinants when adjusted for confounding. In low- income countries, female illiteracy was more important than GNI/capita. Income equality ( Gini index) was an independent predictor of IMR in middle- income countries only. In high-income countries none of these predictors was significant. Conclusions: The relative importance of major health determinants varies between income levels, thus extrapolating health policies from high- to low-income countries is problematic. Since the size, per se, of public health spending does not independently predict health outcomes, functioning health systems are necessary to make health investments efficient. Potential health gains from improved female education and economic growth should be considered in low- and middle- income countries.

L.; Bjerregaard, Peter			Child health in Greenland	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						adolescents; children; disease pattern; inequity; Inuit; Greenland; social ill-health		Aim: To review the knowledge on child health and child health problems in Greenland. Method: The review was based on theses, national statistics, national and international reports, and a search in Pub Med, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and WHOLIB databases from 1985 to 2005. The resulting articles were sorted by topic, type, quality of study, and relevance for child health today, providing 47 articles. Results: Children in Greenland have become taller and have improved their general health. The morbidity found in Greenlandic children is similar to that found elsewhere even though the magnitude of problems might differ. The child mortality is relatively high and unevenly distributed. The acute disease pattern is dominated by infections, mostly airway infections. Otitis and its sequelae is a problem. An increase in chronic conditions such as atopy, asthma, obesity, and disabilities has taken place. Overweight and obesity have tripled in 20 years and are a health threat as well as constituting negative health behaviour. Social ill health, socioeconomic inequity, and sociocultural changes also influence health but their consequences are not well investigated in children. Conclusions: A relatively high child mortality but the same morbidity pattern as in other Western societies was found. Negative health behaviour is frequent in schoolchildren. The influence of rapid cultural changes, and familial and societal factors related to social ill health, together with socioeconomic inequity, are of major importance to the health of children in Greenland. More accurate data on child health are necessary in the future to secure better prioritization. It is suggested to construct a set of reliable indicators of child health in Greenland to monitor the health of children on a national and regional basis.

The data for the study are obtained from 136 developing countries. Structural equation analysis is used to test the hypotheses. The proposed model of women's reproductive health is basically supported by the empirical findings from the developing countries. First, the findings underscore the proposition that gender equality has a pivotal role to play in the promotion of women's reproductive health. The second finding points to the importance of economic development in predicating women's reproductive health. Finally, a positive and statistically significant relationship is found between economic development and gender equality. The results reinforce the Cairo Program of Action that women's reproductive health is contingent upon development policies and gender equality in society. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A PARADIGM SHIFT IN LIFE ORIENTATION: A REVIEW	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN SPORT PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND RECREATION			English	Review						Physical Education; Life Orientation; Education; Developing Countries		Despite all the benefits associated with participation in physical activity, Physical Education (PE) as a school subject and school sport seems to continue to loose ground in a growing number of countries. It seems that there has been little consensus regarding the distinctive characteristics of PE as an educational experience, since the professional PE community is still in disagreement over the mission of PE. The profession has failed to articulate PE in terms which are readily understandable to parents, politicians and children. This article focuses on defining PE and making a case for a paradigm shift in Life Orientation (LO) in the National Curriculum Statement (NCS). Since the 1880s a number of developments regarding PE syllibi were experienced in South Africa (SA). The current emphasis in LO within the South African context is on integration, personalisation, social justice and equity. To make a case for a paradigm shift in LO towards a practical approach is not a difficult task The benefits of such a paradigm shift cab range from education and economy to safe and healthy cities. However, these benefits will not develop automatically. In keeping with the ethos and philosophy of holistic education and international and African trends regarding the use of the term PE, a case is made for a paradigm shift towards Physical and Health Education in Life Orientation (PHELO). The methodology consists of a literature review in the field of education, PE and policy development. The research can be typified within the qualitative-interpretative paradigm. Although a number of developments have recently taken place in SA regarding the provision of PE, it is concluded that not enough was practically done to better the lives of young people. Over the years SA has lost many young talented sports people due to a maladjusted system. Is this to be perpetuated?

This paper overviews national surveillance systems for psychosocial risks and outcomes (35 national systems across 20 different countries, and an additional four multi-country systems), and then looks for convergence between the systems and the current research literature. This paper is the first to provide a compendium of current national surveillance systems on psychosocial risk. It describes the content of each system and gives an overview of sampling methodology, providing an evaluation of comprehensiveness rather than of quality of tools and methods. Recommendations include: (1) surveillance should be the priority for any national research agenda for psychosocial risk management, (2) stakeholders should cooperate with international systems operators to work towards the development of "state of the art" systems; (3) issues for priority inclusion in surveillance systems are emotional demands/emotional labour, workplace bullying, harassment, and violence, exposure to acute stressors, organizational justice, the occurrence and impact of global organizational change, and positive psychological states; (4) systems should be flexible to identify and assess emerging risk factors/groups, and (5) an international surveillance system should be implemented.

This problem is neglected; injuries are often seen as part of everyday life. However, although western Europe has good safety levels, death and disability from injury are rising in eastern Europe. People in low-to-middle-income countries in the Region are 3.6 times more likely to die from injuries than those in high-income countries. Economic and political change have led to unemployment, income inequalities, increased traffic, reduced restrictions on alcohol, and loss of social support. Risks such as movement of vulnerable populations and transfer of lifestyles and products between countries also need attention. In many countries, the public-health response has been inadequate, yet the cost is devastating to individuals and health-service budgets. More than half a million lives could be saved annually in the Region if recent knowledge could be used to prevent injuries and thus redress social injustice in this area.

This integrative literature review sought to identify and assess the current evidence base for CHs. Methods: A range of electronic reference databases were searched from January 1984 to either December 2004 or February 2005: Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, BNI, CINAHL, HMIC, ASSIA, PsychInfo, SIGLE, Dissertation Abstracts, Cochrane Library, Kings Fund website, using both keywords and text words. Thematic analysis identified recurrent themes across the literature; narrative analyses were written for each theme, identifying unifying concepts and discrepant issues. Results: The search strategy identified over 16,000 international references. We included papers of any study design focussing on hospitals in which care was led principally by general practitioners or nurses. Papers from developing countries were excluded. A review of titles revealed 641 potentially relevant references; abstract appraisal identified 161 references for review. During data extraction, a further 48 papers were excluded, leaving 113 papers in the final review. The most common methodological approaches were cross-sectional/ descriptive studies, commentaries and expert opinion. There were few experimental studies, systematic reviews, economic studies or studies that reported on longer-term outcomes. The key themes identified were origin and location of CHs; their place in the continuum of care; services provided; effectiveness, efficiency and equity of CHs; and views of patients and staff. In general, there was a lack of robust evidence for the role of CHs, which is partly due to the ad hoc nature of their development and lack of clear strategic vision for their future. Evidence for the effectiveness and efficiency of the services provided was limited. Most people admitted to CHs appeared to be older, suggesting that admittance to CHs was age-related rather than condition-related. Conclusion: Overall the literature surveyed was long on opinion and short of robust studies on CHs. While lack of evidence on CHs does not imply lack of effect, there is an urgent need to develop a research agenda that addresses the key issues of health care delivery in the CH setting.

J	Alvarez-Castillo, F; Feinholz, D				Alvarez-Castillo, Fatima; Feinholz, Dafna			Women in developing countries and benefit sharing	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						benefit sharing; gender; developing countries	HEALTH SECTOR REFORM; EQUITY; GENDER	The aim of this paper is to show that any process of benefit sharing that does not guarantee the representation and participation of women in decision-making process, as well as in the distribution of benefits, contravenes a central demand of social justice. It is argued that women, particularly in developing countries, can be excluded from benefits derived from genetic research because of existing social structures that promote and maintain discrimination. The paper describes how the structural problem of gender-based inequity can impact on benefit sharing processes. At the same time, examples are given of poor women's ability to organise themselves and to achieve social benefits for entire communities. Relevant international guidelines (e.g. the Convention on Biodiversity) recognise the importance of women's contributions to the protection of biodiversity and thereby, implicitly, their right to share of the benefits, but no mechanism is outlined on how to bring this about. The authors make a clear recommendation to ensure women's participation in benefit sharing negotiations by demanding seats at the negotiation table.

J	Schroeder, D; Lasén-Díaz, C				Schroeder, Doris; Lasen-Diaz, Carolina			Sharing the benefits of genetic resources:: From biodiversity to human genetics	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						benefit sharing; genetics; international justice; biodiversity		Benefit sharing aims to achieve an equitable exchange between the granting of access to a genetic resource and the provision of compensation. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is the only international legal instrument setting out obligations for sharing the benefits derived from the use of biodiversity. The CBD excludes human genetic resources from its scope, however, this article considers whether it should be expanded to include those resources, so as to enable research subjects to claim a share of the benefits to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Our conclusion on this question is: 'No, the CBD should not be expanded to include human genetic resources.' There are essential differences between human and non-human genetic resources, and, in the context of research on human, an essentially fair exchange model is already available between the health care industry and research subjects. Those who contribute to research should receive benefits in the form of accessible new health care products and services, suitable for local health needs and linked to economic prosperity (e.g. jobs). When this exchange model does not apply, as is often the case in developing countries, individually negotiated benefit sharing agreements between researchers and research subjects should not be used as 'window dressing'. Instead, national governments they could make; the investment in population health and health research as outlined by the World Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health; whilst international barriers to such spending need to be removed.

Solidarity: A (New) ethic for global health policy	HEALTH CARE ANALYSIS			English	Review						solidarity; global health; human subject research; Helsinki declaration; CIOMS guidelines	INFORMED-CONSENT; CLINICAL-TRIALS; DECLARATION; HELSINKI; STANDARDS; BIOETHICS; JUSTICE; NEEDS; POOR; CARE	This article explores solidarity as an ethical concept underpinning rules in the global health context. First, it considers the theoretical conceptualisation of the value and some specific duties it supports (ie: its expression in the broadest sense and its derivative action-guiding duties). Second, it considers the manifestation of solidarity in two international regulatory instruments. It concludes that, although solidarity is represented in these instruments, it is often incidental. This fact, their emphasis on other values and their internal weaknesses diminishes the action-guiding impact of the solidarity rules. The global health and human subject research scene needs a completely new instrument specifically directed at means by which solidarity can be achieved, and a reformed infrastructure dedicated to realising that value.

County level socioeconomic position, work organization and depression disorder: A repeated measures cross-classified multilevel analysis of low-income nursing home workers	HEALTH & PLACE			English	Article						depression; county level; multilevel; work organization; inequalities	DEMAND-CONTROL MODEL; SOCIAL-CLASS; JOB DEMANDS; HEALTH; ENVIRONMENT; STRESS; SAFETY; SAMPLE; STRAIN	This study Simultaneously tests the effect of county, organizational, workplace, and individual level variables on depressive disorders among low-income nursing assistants employed in US nursing homes. A total of 482 observations are used from two waves of survey data collection, with an average two-year interval between initial and follow-up surveys. The overall response rate was 62 percent. The hierarchically structured data was analyzed using multilevel modeling to account for cross-classifications across levels of data. Nursing assistants working in nursing homes covered by a single union in three states were asked about aspects of their working conditions, job stress, physical and mental health status, individual and family health-care needs, household economics and household strain. Participants: The 241 nursing assistants who participated in this study were employed in 34 nursing homes and lived in 49 counties of West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. Main results: The study finds that emotional strain, related to providing direct care to elderly and disabled clients, is associated with depressive disorder, as is nursing home ownership type (for-profit versus not-for-profit). However, when controlling for county level socioeconomic variables (Gini index and proportion of African Americans living in the county), neither workplace nor organizational level variables were found to be statistically significant associated with depressive disorder. Conclusions: This study supports previous findings that emotional demand in health-care environments is an important correlate of mental health. It also adds empirical evidence to support a link between financial strain and depression in US women. While this study does not find that lack of a seniority wage benefits-a factor that can conceivably exacerbate financial strain over time-is associated with depressive disorder among low-income health-care workers, it does find county level measures of poverty to be statistically significant predictors of depressive disorder. Longitudinal county level measures of low-income as predictors of depression may even offer a methodological advantage in that they are presumably more stable indicators of cumulative exposure of low income than are more transient workplace indicators. Incorporating measures of cumulative exposure to low income into empirical studies would be particularly timely given the global changes that are currently restructuring the labor force and influencing work organization and labor processes-most notably the growth in low income jobs and the deskilling of labor. Though this study provides evidence that workplace and organizational level variables are associated with depressive disorder among low-wage nursing assistants in US nursing homes, the fact that these relationships do not hold once county level measures of poverty are controlled for, suggests that more distal upstream determinants of workplace mental health problems, such economic inequality, may be at play in determining the mental health of low wage workers.

In contrast with international research, earlier findings from the Brisbane Food Study (BFS), Australia, found no relationship between area socioeconomic characteristics and dietary behaviours or location of food shops. This paper examines whether the price and availability of fruits and vegetables are socioeconomically patterned using data from the BFS. Fifty census collection districts were randomly sampled and all local (i.e. within 2.5 km) supermarkets, greengrocers and convenience stores were observed. Little or no differences in price and availability were found on the basis of area socioeconomic characteristics. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Emerging health issues: the widening challenge for population health promotion	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						sustainability; transitions; globalization; health promotion	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGY; DISEASE; LINK	The spectrum of tasks for health promotion has widened since the Ottawa Charter was signed. In 1986, infectious diseases still seemed in retreat, the potential extent of HIV/AIDS was unrecognized, the Green Revolution was at its height and global poverty appeared less intractable. Global climate change had not yet emerged as a major threat to development and health. Most economists forecast continuous improvement, and chronic diseases were broadly anticipated as the next major health issue. Today, although many broadly averaged measures of population health have improved, many of the determinants of global health have faltered. Many infectious diseases have emerged; others have unexpectedly reappeared. Reasons include urban crowding, environmental changes, altered sexual relations, intensified food production and increased mobility and trade. Foremost, however, is the persistence of poverty and the exacerbation of regional and global inequality. Life expectancy has unexpectedly declined in several countries. Rather than being a faint echo from an earlier time of hardship, these declines could signify the future. Relatedly, the demographic and epidemiological transitions have faltered. In some regions, declining fertility has overshot that needed for optimal age structure, whereas elsewhere mortality increases have reduced population growth rates, despite continuing high fertility. Few, if any, Millennium Development Goals (MDG), including those for health and sustainability, seem achievable. Policy-makers generally misunderstand the link between environmental sustainability (MDG #7) and health. Many health workers also fail to realize that social cohesion and sustainability-maintenance of the Earth's ecological and geophysical systems-is a necessary basis for health. In sum, these issues present an enormous challenge to health. Health promotion must address population health influences that transcend national boundaries and generations and engage with the development, human rights and environmental movements. The big task is to promote sustainable environmental and social conditions that bring enduring and equitable health gains.				colin.butler@deakin.edu.au	Butler, Colin/H-2267-2019	Butler, Colin/0000-0002-2942-5294					37	32	41	0	18	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	0957-4824	1460-2245		HEALTH PROMOT INT	Health Promot.

J	Ikegami, N				Ikegami, Naoki			Should providers be allowed to extra bill for uncovered services? Debate, resolution, and sequel in Japan	JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLITICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article							CARE	Japan has managed to provide universal coverage at relatively low cost by containing prices and restricting the conditions for which services can be billed in the compulsory social health insurance (SHI) program. However, decline in Japan's economic growth ushered in new actors backed by the prime minister who proposed that the providers should be allowed to extra bill for services not covered by the SHI. In 2004 they took the strategy of drawing the attention of the public to areas where the rigidity of the current prohibition appeared to be unfair and ridiculous. They were opposed by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare and the Japan Medical Association, who strongly objected on the grounds of safety and equity. The compromise reached by the two ministers in charge led to a clarification of the services that are to be covered and of the process for extending coverage to new procedures and drugs. The prohibition on extra billing has remained essentially unchanged, but the momentum for deregulation has been lost. In 2005 an alternate proposal was made to contain SHI expenditures by introducing a global cap on health expenditures and increasing out-of-pocket payment. Although this proposal was not fully adopted, the gradual decline in SHI benefit levels could lead to a renewed move to allow extra billing.

J	Collins-Dogrul, J				Collins-Dogrul, Julie			Managing US-Mexico "border health": An organizational field approach	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Mexico; USA; borders; public health; transnational organizational field	MOBILITY; DEATH; CARE	During World War 11 Mexican and US health professionals and organizations constructed a transtiational organizational field to manage the border's public health problems. Despite barriers to inter-organizational cooperation, including disparate administrative structures and North-South stratification, the field's transnational approach to health on the border has continued for 60 years. Using archival data to track changes in the number and types of organizations, this article argues that the field practitioners call "border health" reconfigured during the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) decade from an era of loosely organized professionals to a specialized bureaucracies era. This change brought new vitality to border health, with transnational ties increasing and diversifying, but has not weakened entrenched cross-border inequalities. The organizational history of the US-Mexico border health field demonstrates how macro-politics and inter-organizational stratification shape transnational public health problems.

Our aim was (1) to verify whether MAPs led to a reduction in health resources, and (2) to analyze the consequences of health policies implemented. Cross-sectional and retrospective study, spanning the years 1983-2003. The macro aspect is based upon documents from national and international sources, a database of secondary socioeconomic data, and interviews of key informants working in upper management. Household and health facility surveys were conducted in three regions covering 53 communities. Within the reforms, the health sector benefited from an important flow of resources. There were significant increases in public expenditures, health care staff, the number of primary care facilities and the availability of generic drugs. However, health facilities in the public sector remain underused and major inequities subsist. Access to health care is constrained by the population's ability to pay. Health expenditures impoverish households, creating new poor and impoverishing the already poor. The success of reforms depends largely on the extent to which they remove financial barriers to access to services. The experience of Burkina Faso also reveals the need for fundamental changes that will motivate staff, improve productivity, and ensure good quality services. Integrating health development policies with strategic plans for poverty reduction can provide new opportunities for African countries to redesign their health systems within this type of perspective.

Inequalities in oncology care: Economic consequences of high cost drugs	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						health economics; health care costs; reimbursement policy; medical innovations; inequality; financing system; outcomes research; high cost drugs		The expenditures for hospital drugs are continuously increasing, and grow much faster than the global hospital budgets do. This explosive growth is caused mainly by a few so-called 'expensive drugs' of which the oncolytics form the main part. The global budgets should stimulate more effective provision of care ('technical efficiency'), however the room for technical efficiency is decreasing. Hospitals thus have to make impossible choices, so that eventually equal access can no longer be guaranteed. If no other policies are applied, health care goals will no longer be met. This paper tries to map the contours of the current problem and its possible solutions. It is time governments take up their responsibility and take back control. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in inequality and poverty in Latin America: Looking beyond income to health and education	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article						inequality; poverty; health; education; Latin America	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; GROWTH; CHILDREN; INDIA; COUNTRIES; 1980S	This paper uses Demographic and Health Survey data from six Latin American countries to analyze levels and trends of inequality for two important non-income measures of wellbeing, children's stature and adult women's educational attainment. Our purpose is to determine whether the worrying trend of increasing income inequality in Latin America is also found in non-income dimensions of well-being. We find that it is not. Almost across the board, health inequality, measured by children's stature, and education inequality, measured by young women's years of schooling, have fallen in these countries in the late 1980s and 1990s, often dramatically. Further, by decomposing changes in non-income dimensions of poverty into shifts in the mean and changes in the distribution of health and education, we show that reduced inequality has contributed to significant reductions in education poverty, and to a lesser extent, health poverty. This, too, is a very different result from the income inequality literature.

Global health inequalities: an international comparison	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; RISK	Objective: To study cross-national inequalities in mortality of adults and of children aged < 5 years using a novel approach, with clustering techniques to stratify countries into mortality groups (better-off, worse-off, mid-level) and to examine risk factors associated with inequality. Design, setting and participants: Analysis of data from the World Development Indicators 2003 database, compiled by the World Bank. Main outcome measures: Adult and child mortality among countries placed into distinct mortality categories by cluster analysis. Results: 29 countries had a high adult mortality (mean 584/1000; range 460/1000 to 725/1000) and 23 had a high child mortality (mean 207/1000, range 160/1000 to 316/1000). All these countries were in western and sub-Saharan Africa and Afghanistan. Bivariate analyses showed that relative to countries with low child mortality, those with high child mortality had significantly higher rates of extreme poverty (p < 0.001), populations living in rural areas (p < 0.001) and female illiteracy (p < 0.001), significantly lower per capita expenditure on healthcare (p < 0.001), outpatient visits, hospital beds and doctors, and lower rates of access to improved water (p < 0.001), sanitation (p < 0.001) and immunisations. In multivariate analyses, countries with high adult mortality had a higher prevalence of HIV infection (odds ratio per 1% increase 18.6; 95% CI 0.3 to 1135.5). Between 1960 and 2000, adult male mortality in countries with high mortality increased at > 4 times the rate in countries with low mortality. For child mortality, the worse-off group made slower progress in reducing < 5 mortality than the better-off group. Conclusions: Inequalities in child and adult mortality are large, are growing, and are related to several economic, social and health sector variables. Global efforts to deal with this problem require attention to the worse-off countries, geographic concentrations, and adopt a multidimensional approaches to development.

J	Ruger, JP				Ruger, J. P.			Ethics and governance of global health inequalities	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							JUSTICE; CARE	Background: A world divided by health inequalities poses ethical challenges for global health. International and national responses to health disparities must be rooted in ethical values about health and its distribution; this is because ethical claims have the power to motivate, delineate principles, duties and responsibilities, and hold global and national actors morally responsible for achieving common goals. Theories of justice are necessary to define duties and obligations of institutions and actors in reducing inequalities. The problem is the lack of a moral framework for solving problems of global health justice. Aim: To study why global health inequalities are morally troubling, why efforts to reduce them are morally justified, how they should be measured and evaluated; how much priority disadvantaged groups should receive; and to delineate roles and responsibilities of national and international actors and institutions. Discussion and conclusions: Duties and obligations of international and state actors in reducing global health inequalities are outlined. The ethical principles endorsed include the intrinsic value of health to well-being and equal respect for all human life, the importance of health for individual and collective agency, the concept of a shortfall from the health status of a reference group, and the need for a disproportionate effort to help disadvantaged groups. This approach does not seek to find ways in which global and national actors address global health inequalities by virtue of their self-interest, national interest, collective security or humanitarian assistance. It endorses the more robust concept of "human flourishing" and the desire to live in a world where all people have the capability to be healthy. Unlike cosmopolitan theory, this approach places the role of the nation-state in the forefront with primary, though not sole, moral responsibility. Rather shared health governance is essential for delivering health equity on a global scale.

Case detection rate targets under DOTS: The Indian experience	NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA			English	Article							TUBERCULOSIS-CONTROL	DOTS programme In India has been recognized as the fastest growing programme in the world. It currently covers more than 1 billion people (90% of the population). In spite of this rapid expansion, the programme has consistently achieved the global target of 85% cure rates. However, Improvement In case detection rates has been slow, and the global target of 70% has been achieved only In the last few quarters. Public-private partnerships were initiated at the national and local level with the non-health public sector, corporate sector and non-governmental organizations, private practitioners and medical colleges. The partnerships have significantly contributed to the case detection rates. In the country, especially the medical colleges, which have contributed up to 5%-15%. Some areas achieved case detection rates well above 70%. There is a need to forge new initiatives, strengthen existing partnerships and make special efforts to access the poorer, vulnerable and hard-to-reach sections of society more effectively. This would not only increase the numbers of cases but also serve the overarching objective of equity. Disaggregated targets should be set, with much higher ones for selected areas, sectors and Institutions.

Can patient satisfaction with quality of life predict survival in advanced colorectal cancer?

Materials and methods: A consecutive case series of 177 cases of histologically confirmed colorectal cancer treated at Cancer Treatment Centers of America(R) at Midwestern Regional Medical Center between April 2001 and November 2004. The quality of life index (QLI) was utilized to assess patient satisfaction with QoL. QLI measures global QoL and the QoL in four major subscales: health and physical functioning, social and economic, psychological/spiritual, and family. All scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating a better QoL. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival. Log-rank test was used to study the equality of survival distributions. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were then performed to evaluate the joint prognostic significance of those QoL and clinical factors that were shown to be prognostic in univariate analyses. Results: Of the 177 patients, 46 were newly diagnosed and 131 have treatment history. The median age was 53 years (range 25-85 years). Eight patients had stage I disease, 16 had stage II, 51 had stage III, and 77 had stage IV. Health and physical subscale was significantly associated with survival (p=0.0003), with the median survival for low scores being 8.3 and 20.6 months for high scores. Health and physical subscale was found to be predictive of survival independent of the effects of tumor stage at diagnosis and treatment history. Conclusions: We found that baseline patient satisfaction with QoL, as measured by the QLI, provides useful prognostic information in patients with colorectal cancer independent of tumor stage at diagnosis and treatment history. While these findings require further investigation in large patient cohorts, they may have important implications for patient stratification in clinical trials and aid in clinical decision-making.

J	Bloomfield, K; Grittner, U; Kramer, S; Gmel, G				Bloomfield, Kim; Grittner, Ulrike; Kramer, Stephanie; Gmel, Gerhard			Social inequalities in alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems in the study countries of the EU concerted action 'gender, culture and alcohol problems: A multi-national study	ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLISM			English	Article							SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; EDUCATION; DRINKING; HEALTH; POPULATION; MORBIDITY; TRENDS; YOUNG	Aims: We investigated the presence of social inequalities of alcohol use and misuse using educational attainment as an indicator of socio-economic status in 15 countries: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Israel, Brazil, and Mexico. Methods: Study surveys were independently conducted and the data centrally analysed. Most samples were national. Survey modes and sample sizes varied. The age range was restricted to between 25 and 59 years of age. Socio-economic status was measured by educational level. Multiple logistic regressions were employed to calculate age-adjusted odds ratios for men and women in each country by educational level for current drinking status, heavy drinking (>= 20 g ethanol per day for women, >= 30 g a day for men), heavy episodic (binge) drinking, and alcohol-related problems (using AUDIT). Results: Men and women demonstrated similar patterns in inequalities with regard to current drinking status within a country. In Germany, The Netherlands, France, Switzerland, and Austria higher educated women were most likely to drink heavily, while among men the lower educated were more at risk in most countries. For heavy episodic drinking, almost no significant differences were evident among women, but for men a social gradient was observable with lower educated being more at risk in several countries. Among five countries with data from the AUDIT, men of lower education in Finland, Czech Republic, and Hungary had higher risks to report problems. Nordic countries shared a common pattern in social inequalities as did two Latin American countries, while a mixed picture was observed for middle European countries. Social inequalities in the two Latin American countries display a pattern emerging in other research on developing countries: namely that those in the higher educated groups are more likely to consume alcohol in a risky manner. Conclusions: Patterns in the distribution of social inequalities are not universal. Social inequalities in alcohol use differ by gender according to alcohol measure used and differ also across groups of countries. These variations should be taken into account when formulating international and cross-cultural alcohol policies.

J	Gray, N; Bailie, R				Gray, Natalie; Bailie, Ross			Can human rights discourse improve the health of Indigenous Australians?	AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; EQUITY; LAW; RECONCILIATION	Objective: Recognition of the poor health outcomes of Indigenous Australians has led to an interest in using human rights discourse as a framework for arguing that the Australian Government has an international obligation to improve Indigenous health. Method: This paper explores two potential directions for human rights discourse in this context. The first is the development and elaboration of an asserted 'human right to health'. The second focuses on developing an understanding of the interactions between health and human rights, particularly the underlying social determinants of health, and thereby creating an advocacy framework that could be used to promote the inclusion of human rights considerations into the policy-making agenda. Results: This paper argues that despite the symbolic force of human rights discourse, its capacity to improve the health of Indigenous Australians through international law is limited. This is so irrespective of whether recourse is made to a legal or moral imperative. Conclusion and Implications: The 'human right to health' is limited primarily by several barriers to its implementation, some of which are perpetuated by the current Australian Government itself. Although the potential advocacy capacity of human rights discourse is similarly limited by the hostility of the Government towards the notion of incorporating human rights considerations into its public policy decision making, it does provide a sustainable intellectual framework in which to consider the social and structural determinants of health and maintain these issues on the political agenda.

In the present study, data are gathered from a sample of male and female youth assessed at a juvenile court detention facility. As hypothesized, analyses revealed significantly higher scores for males on prior offenses and significantly higher scores for females on family/parenting, mental health, traumatic events, and health-related risks. Unexpectedly, females also scored significantly higher than males in domains associated with psychopathy, accountability, and peer relationships. Female and male youth also differed in type of offense that brought them to the attention of the detention facility. In turn, type of offense was a predictor of risk/needs levels in the family/parenting domain, underscoring the particularly salient role family factors play in the lives of court-involved youth.

A translated and adapted version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 2,645 11-15-yr-olds in state and fee-paying schools in Cairo. The overall prevalences of wheeze ever, wheeze during the last year and physician-diagnosed asthma were 26.5% (697 out of 2,631), 14.7% (379 out of 2,570) and 9.4% (246 out of 2,609), respectively. The prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis was 15.3% (399 out of 2,616). Asthma symptoms were independently associated with attendance at a state school, parental asthma, age, history of rhinitis and owning a pet cat. Rhinoconjunctivitis was independently associated with attendance at a state school, father's education, parental history of asthma, asthma symptoms and owning a pet cat. In spite of a higher prevalence of severe asthma symptoms in state schools prevalence of physician diagnosis of asthma was the same in both school types, suggesting inequalities in access to healthcare. In conclusion, the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma in Cairo was 9.4%, while the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis was 15.3%. There is a higher prevalence and increased severity of asthma symptoms in children of lower socioeconomic groups, as defined by state school attendance in Cairo.

J	Getzen, TE				Getzen, Thomas E.			Aggregation and the measurement of health care costs	HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						health expenditures; multilevel analysis; aggregation; costs; units of observation	MEDICAL-CARE; EXPENDITURES; LUXURY; MODELS; INCOME; DETERMINANTS; SERVICES; FUTURE; GROWTH	This study evaluated the extent to which the causes of variation in health care costs differ by the level at which observations are made. More than 40 U.S. and international studies providing empirical estimates of the sources of variation in health care costs were reviewed and arrayed by size of observational units. A simplified graphical analysis demonstrating how estimated correlation coefficients change with the level and type of aggregation is presented. As the unit of observation becomes larger, association between health care costs and health status/morbidity becomes weaker and smaller in magnitude, while correlation with income (per capita GDP) becomes stronger and larger. Individual expenditure variation within a particular health care system is largely due to differences in health status, but across systems, morbidity has almost no effect on costs. For nations, differences in per capita income explain over 90 percent of the variation in both time series and cross section. Units of observation used for analysis of health care costs must be matched to the units at which decision making occurs. The observed pattern of empirical results is consistent with a multilevel allocative model incorporating aggregate capacity constraints. To the extent that macro constraints determine total budgets at the national level, policy interventions at the micro level (substitution of generic pharmaceuticals, use of CEA for allocation of treatments, controls on construction and technology, etc.) can act to improve efficiency, equity and average health status, but will not usually reduce aggregate average per capita costs of medical care.

Rosemary; Dezateux, Carol		Millennium Cohort Study Child	Are breastfeeding rates higher among mothers delivering in Baby Friendly accredited maternity units in the UK?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						breastfeeding; Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative; inequalities; policy	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PROMOTION; SCOTLAND; SUPPORT; UNICEF	Background The promotion and support of breastfeeding is a global priority with benefits for maternal and infant health, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries where its relevance for child survival is undisputed. However, breastfeeding rates are strikingly low in some higher-income countries, including the UK. Evidence to support the effectiveness of public health interventions to increase rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration in this setting is limited. We examined whether mothers were more likely to start and continue to breastfeed if they delivered in a UNICEF UK Baby Friendly accredited maternity unit, in a cohort with a high representation of disadvantaged and lower socioeconomic groups with traditionally low rates of breastfeeding. Methods We analysed maternally reported breastfeeding initiation and prevalence of any breastfeeding at 1 month for 17 359 singleton infants according to maternity unit Baby Friendly Initiative participation status at birth (accredited, certificated, or neither award). Results Mothers delivering in accredited maternity units were more likely to start breastfeeding than those delivering in units with neither award [adjusted rate ratio: 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.15], but were not more likely to breastfeed at 1 month (0.96, 95% CI 0.84-1.09), after adjustment for social, demographic, and obstetric factors. Antenatal class attendance (1.14, 95% CI 1.11-1.17), vaginal delivery (1.05, 1.03-1.08), a companion at delivery (1.09, 1.04-1.16), and maternal post-partum hospital stay > 24 h (1.06, 1.04-1.09) were also independently associated with breastfeeding initiation. Conclusions Policies to increase the proportion of maternity units participating in the UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative are likely to increase breastfeeding initiation but not duration. Other strategies are required in order to support UK mothers to breastfeed for the recommended duration.

This paper reviews international experiences and shows that private health insurance is significant in countries with widely different income levels and health system structures. It contrasts trends in private health insurance expansion across regions and highlights countries with particularly important experiences of private coverage. It then discusses the regulatory approaches and policies that can structure private health insurance markets in ways that mobilize resources for health care, promote financial risk protection, protect consumers and reduce inequities. The paper argues that policy makers need to confront the role that private health insurance will play in their health systems and regulate the sector appropriately so that it serves public goals of universal coverage and equity.

Meeting report on the Bellagio Conference 'prevention of vascular diseases in the emerging world: An approach to global health equity'	KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						ABC transporter; acidosis; aldosterone; epithelial; intracellular pH	TYPE-2 DIABETES-MELLITUS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; LIFE-STYLE; BURDEN; HYPERTENSION; MORTALITY	Representatives from five international organizations (International Society of Nephrology, World Heart Federation, International Diabetes Federation, International Atherosclerosis Federation, and International Society of Hypertension) participated in a strategic planning workshop in December 2005 in Bellagio, Italy sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. There were equal representatives from developed and developing countries. Global perspectives on diabetes and cardiovascular and renal diseases were presented, with special emphasis on China, India, Latin America, and Africa. The rationale and effectiveness of preventive measures were discussed. It was apparent that measures for primary prevention and early intervention for all the chronic vascular diseases are similar. The five organizations agreed that an integrated global approach to chronic vascular diseases is needed. They resolved to collaborate and work towards an integrated approach to chronic vascular diseases with the establishment of a 5-year plan for the prevention and treatment of chronic vascular diseases, including public advocacy, advising international and national agencies, and improving education and the practice of established approaches.

Body and illness: Considering Visayan Filipino children's perspectives within local and global relationships of inequality	MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article						body mapping; children; health beliefs; Philippines; poverty	URBAN-POOR; HEALTH; PHILIPPINES; STREETS; SPACES	Despite a plethora of studies counting, examining, assessing, and diagnosing Filipino children living in poverty, children's own perceptions and concerns about their health and security are rarely elicited. This article draws from fieldwork in an urban neighbourhood in the Visayan Philippines among children who, every day, face a complex and precarious landscape dominated by multigenerational poverty, social marginalization, recurring hunger, and the hazards of living and playing amidst mounting garbage and effluent. I discuss children's perspectives on body and illness in this challenging environment and examine their ideas within the larger context of adult-child, hierarchical relationships, and colonial and contemporary government discourses on children, health, and citizenship. I also examine children's sense of place, agency, and vulnerability, and I discuss the view held by many adults in this community: their children's ideas hold little value.

It uses information collected from mothers aged 15-49-years participating in Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 42 developing countries. In multilevel regression models, the three study variables exhibited strong independent associations with child health: GDP-PPP accounted for the largest amount of unique variation, followed by maternal education and household wealth. There was also substantial overlap (shared variance) between maternal education and the other two study variables. The regressions of child health on household wealth and maternal education exhibited substantial cross-national variation in both strength and form of association. Although higher education levels were associated with disproportionately greater returns to child health, the pattern for household wealth was erratic: in many countries there were diminishing returns to child health at higher levels of household wealth. We conclude that there are inextricable links among different strategies for improving child health and that policy planners, associating benefits with these strategies, must take into account the strong moderating impact of national context.

J	Gideon, J				Gideon, Jasmine			Accessing economic and social rights under neoliberalism: gender and rights in Chile	THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY			English	Article							HEALTH; GLOBALIZATION; WORKERS; EQUITY; LABOR	There is now a general consensus regarding the importance of social and economic rights within development and, recently, the language of women's human rights has been adopted by organisations that focus on gender and development and draw mainly upon economic and social analysis. Despite some limitations from a gender perspective, human rights instruments such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) can offer an important focus for such groups to claim these rights. Nevertheless, the challenge of upholding treaty obligations and guaranteeing rights to all citizens remains, particularly within the context of the neoliberal reforms that have been widely implemented in both the North and the South. Drawing on the case of Chile, this paper will consider how access to certain rights, including the rights to social security and health, can be made more difficult for some women and men as a consequence of processes following trade liberalisation and health sector reforms. An analysis of power relations is central to understanding the failure of states to guarantee an enabling environment for women's enjoyment of their social and economic rights, as many women remain excluded from decision-making processes within policy arenas.

J	De Vos, P; De Ceukelaire, W; Van der Stuyft, P				De Vos, Pol; De Ceukelaire, Wim; Van der Stuyft, Patrick			Colombia and Cuba, contrasting models in Latin America's health sector reform	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						Latin America; Cuba; Colombia; health sector reform; privatization; national health system	MANAGED CARE; UNITED-STATES; TRANSFORMATION; SYSTEM; COSTS	Latin American national health systems were drastically overhauled by the health sector reforms the 1990s. Governments were urged by donors and by the international financial institutions to make major institutional changes, including the separation of purchaser and provider functions and privatization. This article first analyses a striking paradox of the far-reaching reform measures: contrary to what is imposed on public health services, after privatization purchaser and provider functions are reunited. Then we compare two contrasting examples: Colombia, which is internationally promoted as a successful - and radical - example of 'market-oriented' health care reform, and Cuba, which followed a highly 'conservative' path to adapt its public system to the new conditions since the 1990s, going against the model of the international institutions. The Colombian reform has not been able to materialize its promises of universality, improved equity, efficiency and better quality, while Cuban health care remains free, accessible for everybody and of good quality. Finally, we argue that the basic premises of the ongoing health sector reforms in Latin America are not based on the people's needs, but are strongly influenced by the needs of foreign - especially North American - corporations. However, an alternative model of health sector reform, such as the Cuban one, can probably not be pursued without fundamental changes in the economic and political foundations of Latin American societies.

The sources of information included the mental health focal points in the Ministries of Health, published literature and unpublished reports available to WHO. The results show that global mental health resources remain low and grossly inadequate to respond to the high level of need. In addition, the revised Atlas shows that the improvements over the period 2001 to 2004 are very small. Imbalances across income groups of countries remain largely the same.

The model suggests that in a situation where a strong asymmetry in economic power and wealth dominates global economic and political relations, further trade and migration liberalization may have predominantly negative impact on Southern natural systems, while solving little or nothing of the poverty problems. In the North, uncontrolled immigration may in the long run produce economic, social, and probably ethnic tensions which costs could by far exceed the medium-term benefits (rejuvenation of active population and reduction in the strain imposed on the pension system).

Beliefs about informal payments in Albania	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						health care financing; informal payments; beliefs; behaviour; government health facilities; transition economies	HEALTH-CARE; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; EXPENDITURES; INTENTIONS; ATTITUDES; CAMBODIA	Informal payments for health care are a growing concern in Albania and other transitional economy countries. Recent international studies have shown that informal payments can have negative effects on health care access, equity and health status by causing people to forgo or delay seeking care, or sell assets to pay for care. Many countries are putting in place reforms meant to reduce informal payments. In order to be successful, such policies need to consider people's attitudes and beliefs about the practice. This study collected data from 222 citizens in Albania regarding intentions, past behaviours, attitudes and beliefs about informal payments. Comparing people who intend to make informal payments with people who do not intend to make payments, the study found differences in attitudes as well as beliefs about the consequences of making informal payments, in perceptions about what others think and in control beliefs, but no difference in moral beliefs or demographic characteristics. People who intend to make informal payments the next time they seek care are more likely to believe they will get faster and better quality care than non-intenders, but also think they must pay to receive any care at all. People who do not intend to make informal payments are more likely to report that they have connections with medical personnel, which may be substituting for informal payments. The study has implications for educational campaigns accompanying policy reforms. Campaigns which focus on anti-corruption messages are unlikely to be effective,. as moral beliefs do not appear to influence intention.

J	Tovey, P; de Barros, NF; Hoehne, EL; Carvalheira, JBC				Tovey, Philip; Filice de Barros, Nelson; Luiz Hoehne, Eduardo; Campello Carvalheira, Jose Barreto			Use of traditional medicine and globalized complementary and alternative medicine among low-income cancer service users in Brazil	INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES			English	Article						traditional medicine; CAM; cancer	CARE; UK	Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has become increasingly high profile in prosperous countries over the past 2 decades. Alongside this has been a renewed interest in the use of traditional medicine (TM) in poorer countries. Academic attention has tended to focus on either CAM in rich countries or indigenous TM in poorer ones. However, such a differentiation leads to a potential to gloss over global complexities, such as the study of countries where both CAM and TM are a potentially significant part of health options. Brazil is just such a country. Brazil is marked by massive socioeconomic inequalities; cancer is its second highest cause of death. To date, there has been little research on CAM/TM in cancer care in Brazil. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide the first exploratory data on the proportion of the use of CAM and/or TM among low-income cancer service users in Brazil. Method: A survey of cancer patients was conducted in November 2004 in a public-sector hospital in a major city in Brazil. A random sample (n = 92) was generated from a list of all appointments scheduled during that month (n = 570). Eighty-nine of the 92 patients contacted (97%) completed the questionnaire. Results: Of the sample, 62.9% had used at least 1 form of CAM or TM. However, this headline figure is potentially misleading. The data reveal an almost total absence of use of non-indigenous international CAM; it also shows prayer to be a major contributor to the relatively high use rate. Discussion: On the basis of this small-scale exploratory study, there is no evidence that those international CAMs ubiquitous in the West are spreading to low-income cancer service users in Brazil (despite anecdotal evidence of its increasing presence in the country generally). Moreover, when excluding prayer, use of indigenous traditional medicine was found to be relatively low. Further research is needed to examine these findings on a larger scale and to explore the relative importance of social, cultural, and economic factors behind them.

Women's access to health care: The legal framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						evidence-based access; fairness; transparency; women's health; human rights	EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION; CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION	The Millennium Development Goats set ambitious targets for women's health, including reductions in maternal and child mortality and combating the spread of HIV/AIDS. The law, which historically has often obstructed women's access to the health care they require, has a dynamic potential to ensure women's access that is being progressively realized. This paper identifies three legal principles that are key to advancing women's reproductive and sexual health. First, taw should require that care be evidence-based, reflecting medical and social science rather than, for instance, religious ideology or morality. Second, legal guidance should be clear and transparent, so that service providers and patients know their responsibilities and entitlements without litigation to resolve uncertainties. Third, law should provide applicable measures to ensure fairness in women's access to services, both general. services and those only women require. Legal developments are addressed that illustrate how law can advance women's equality, and social justice. (c) 2006 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

It is rooted in poverty, social inequity, and denial of women's basic human rights. As experience from Latin America and other regions demonstrates, obstetrician-gynecologists can be leaders in supporting reproductive rights and access to safe abortion, through their professional societies and also by way of their roles as providers, academicians, and advocates. Ob-gyns are often most effective when working in partnership with women's organizations, lawyers, and other stakeholders. (c) 2006 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

Violence against women and the Millennium Development Goals: Facilitating women's access to support	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						violence against women; domestic violence	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; PREGNANT-WOMEN; PHYSICAL VIOLENCE; FAMILY VIOLENCE; ABUSE; RISK; CARE; HIV	Violence against women is a serious health and development concern, as well as a violation of women's human rights. Violence against women has a devastating effect on women's sexual and reproductive health, as well. as the health of their children, and is rooted in gender inequality. Reducing violence against women is therefore a key strategy for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goats. Key lessons have emerged from more than two decades of experiences dealing with violence against women within the health sector. Interventions must go beyond training and curricula reform and utilize a system-wide approach, including changes in policies, procedures and attention to privacy and confidentiality. Providers must work together with other sectors, particularly at a community level, to strengthen local networks for support of survivors of violence. Prevention activities are critical, particularly those that seek to change cultural norms and laws that encourage violence and discriminate against women and girls.

J	Huda, S				Huda, S.			Sex trafficking in South Asia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						trafficking; sex-trafficking; HIV; AIDS; South Asia		Economic and social inequalities and political conflicts have led to the movement of persons within each country and across the borders in South Asia. Globalization has encouraged free mobility of capital, technology, experts and sex tourism. Illiteracy, dependency, violence, social stigma, cultural stereotypes, gender disparity and endemic poverty, among other factors, place women and children in powerless, non-negotiable situations that have contributed to the emergence and breeding of the cavernous problem of sex trafficking in the entire region. This alarming spread of sex trafficking has fuelled the spread of HIV infection in South Asia, posing a unique and serious threat to community health, poverty alleviation and other crucial aspects of human development. Although the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) Convention on Trafficking in Women and Children has been an important breakthrough, most of the countries in the region do not have anti-trafficking legislation or means to protect the victims. Countries of the region should make a concerted effort to treat trafficking victims as "victims" of human rights violations in all anti -trafficking strategies and actions.

This article provides an overview of prevalence data that indicates a significant over representation of people with intellectual disabilities in correctional facilities and reviews the problems facing this population. Findings from two specific evaluation studies undertaken by the Centre for Developmental Disability Studies are presented, along with recommendations for future provision based on these results. One of these projects trialled a case management approach to supporting offenders with an intellectual disability upon their release from prison. The 20-month follow-up found that a number of serious barriers were encountered within the overall system of provision for this population; the most serious of which related to lack of adequate accommodation upon release. The second project involved a two-stage evaluation of one model of provision for individuals with intellectual disabilities who are sex offenders, only some of whom were on parole. This service provided both residential and therapy services in a small group home located in the community. Residents were found to have high levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties, in addition to offending behaviour, that continue to require support and supervision. Critical issues, including guardianship involvement, restrictive practices and retrieval, therapy provision, and risk management issues are discussed in relation to overall clinical and lifestyle outcomes.

An opinion piece of international interest	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						Australia; cultural Safety; health; history; indigenous nursing; recruitment; retention		Aim: This paper overviews Indigenous disadvantage in relatively wealthy Australia. It describes efforts to increase the recruitment and retention of Indigenous people in nursing and to reform nursing education to be more inclusive of Indigenous culture, health and history. Backround: Indigenous people on average die 17 years younger than non-Indigenous people and have health problems similar to those of people in some underdeveloped countries. Moreover, social injustice and human rights issues affect their health and well-being and educational opportunities. They are under-represented in the health professions, including nursing, often through a lack of educational preparation and historical, socio-economic and cultural factors hindering them from entering and succeeding in university studies. Methods: In 2000, a project was funded by the Australian commonwealth government and led by the Indigenous Nursing Education Working Group. This Group worked for five years on a wide range of methods that included consultation within the profession, information dissemination and longitudinal surveying of university schools of nursing and Indigenous support units. Results: Findings show that collaborative efforts between key stakeholders in nursing education appear to be succeeding to increase the numbers of Indigenous students of nursing. Around two-thirds of schools of nursing now include Indigenous content in their undergraduate curricula, but the majority is yet to provide Indigenous cultural awareness/cultural safety training for faculty.

J	Leader, S				Leader, Sheldon			Human rights, risks, and new strategies for global investment	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW			English	Article								It is often argued that the rules and practices of foreign direct investment can threaten the protection of human rights. That danger used to arise from the fact that the investors simply dismissed concern for these rights as their responsibility. This is no longer so. Major lenders and project sponsors now regularly make commitments to human rights and to allied principles governing environmental protection and health and safety. The danger instead arises from the way in which the two domains are being brought together. The collision that threatens is not over whether, but over how commercial imperatives are to be integrated with this branch of social justice. The article aims at diagnosis of the problem and considers some possible solutions to it. It frames the issues in terms of several competing fundamental principles, and draws on concrete examples from the investment contracts regulating the Baku-Tibilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) and Chad/Cameroon pipeline projects. Once the areas of potential collision between these contracts and human rights requirements are explored, the essay considers a significant alteration to the BTC agreement, designed to open it up more effectively to human rights concerns. The analysis ends with a consideration of some model clauses for investment contracts in the future.

We divided the race-county combinations of the US population into eight distinct groups, referred to as the "eight Americas,'' to explore the causes of the disparities that can inform specific public health intervention policies and programs. Methods and Findings The eight Americas were defined based on race, location of the county of residence, population density, race-specific county-level per capita income, and cumulative homicide rate. Data sources for population and mortality figures were the Bureau of the Census and the National Center for Health Statistics. We estimated life expectancy, the risk of mortality from specific diseases, health insurance, and health-care utilization for the eight Americas. The life expectancy gap between the 3.4 million high-risk urban black males and the 5.6 million Asian females was 20.7 y in 2001. Within the sexes, the life expectancy gap between the best-off and the worst-off groups was 15.4 y for males ( Asians versus high-risk urban blacks) and 12.8 y for females ( Asians versus low-income southern rural blacks). Mortality disparities among the eight Americas were largest for young (15-44 y) and middle-aged (45-59 y) adults, especially for men. The disparities were caused primarily by a number of chronic diseases and injuries with well-established risk factors. Between 1982 and 2001, the ordering of life expectancy among the eight Americas and the absolute difference between the advantaged and disadvantaged groups remained largely unchanged. Self-reported health plan coverage was lowest for western Native Americans and low-income southern rural blacks. Crude self-reported health-care utilization, however, was slightly higher for the more disadvantaged populations. Conclusions Disparities in mortality across the eight Americas, each consisting of millions or tens of millions of Americans, are enormous by all international standards. The observed disparities in life expectancy cannot be explained by race, income, or basic health-care access and utilization alone. Because policies aimed at reducing fundamental socioeconomic inequalities are currently practically absent in the US, health disparities will have to be at least partly addressed through public health strategies that reduce risk factors for chronic diseases and injuries.

J	Ewig, C				Ewig, Christina			Global processes, local consequences: Gender equity and health sector reform in Peru	SOCIAL POLITICS			English	Article								This article brings into relief the gendered tensions and contradictions that have resulted from Peru's neoliberal health sector reforms. Previous studies were clear that economic adjustment bad a negative impact on women and gender relations. I show more nuanced effects of neoliberal policies when applied to health sector reforms. To evaluate these policies, I utilize the distinction between redistribution and recognition. I depart from the supposition that policies serve either redistributive or recognition ends and show that single policies can have both types of effects. I conclude that policies based on neoliberal principles in some instances have a negative impact on women, in other instances reify existing unequal gender relations, while in still others open up spaces for positive change. On the whole, however, neoliberal health reforms have had a negative impact on gender equity.

Moreover, age and gender differences in the association between education and health are analysed. The study uses data from the European Social Survey 2003. Probability sampling from all private residents aged 15 years and older was applied in all countries. The European Social Survey includes 42,359 cases. Persons under age 25 were excluded to minimise the number of respondents whose education was not complete. Education was coded according to the International Standard Classification of Education. Self-rated health and functional limitations were used as health indicators. Results of multiple logistic regression analyses show that people with low education (lower secondary or less) have elevated risks of poor self-rated health and functional limitations. Inequalities are relatively small in Austria, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, large inequalities were found for Hungary, Poland, and Portugal. Analyses of age differences reveal that health effects of education are stronger at ages 25-55 than in the higher age groups. However, age differences in the education-health association vary between countries, sexes, and health indicators. In conclusion, our results confirm that educational inequalities in health are a generalised though not invariant phenomenon. Variations between countries, sexes and health indicators might be one explanation for the inconsistent results of other studies on age differences in the association between socioeconomic position and health.

J	Davies, G				Davies, Gail			Patterning the geographies of organ transplantation: corporeality, generosity and justice	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						organ transplantation; health inequalities; London; ethics; corporeal generosity; difference	ASIAN POPULATION; DISPARITIES; BODY; ETHICS; ACCESS; XENOTRANSPLANTATION; ANTHROPOLOGY; EXPERIENCE; HEALTH; PARTS	Organ transplantation is now an established treatment for patients with end-stage organ failure, yet there are spatial inequalities in access to this procedure. This paper explores the uneven geographies of kidney transplantation in London, arguing that inequalities in access to organ transplantation are created through interlocking spatialities of corporeal difference, enacted through global movements of populations, national organ transplantation protocols and the internal immunological spaces of the body. The combination of these processes, operating at different scales, has produced a distinctive configuration in the embodiment of risk in relation to kidney transplants, particularly born by London's Black and Asian communities. Two ethical dimensions to this geography of organ transplantation are explored here: the ethical responsiveness to others shaping the generous practices of organ donation, and the medical practices categorizing difference through techniques of blood typing, tissue matching and the spatial organization of organ transplantation. In concluding, I argue both are critical to understanding the links between ethics and justice in the geographies of organ exchange in London. Further, I suggest geography is central to political debate about the exchange of biological material elsewhere, for it is only through tracing the intersection of ethical, corporeal and technological practices in situ that we can fully reflect on questions of justice within the developing bioeconomy.

In view of these findings and in collaboration with the World Federation of Neurology (WFN), WHO has recently organized an international Survey of Country Resources for Neurological Disorders, which involved 109 countries and covered over 90% of the world's population. This large WHO/WFN collaborative endeavour collected expert information on a number of aspects of neurological care provision around the world including availability of neurological services in primary care; human resources for neurological disorders; sub-specialized neurological services; primary method of financing of neurological care; and disability benefits for patients with neurological disorders. The WHO/WFN Survey results clearly demonstrate that there are inadequate resources for patients with neurological disorders in most parts of the world, and highlight inequalities in the access to neurological care across different populations, and in particular in those living in low-income countries and in developing regions of the world. The key findings of the WHO/WFN Survey including their impact on delivery of neurological care around the world are presented and discussed in this paper. The entire set of WHO/WFN Survey results including numerous tables, graphs and accompanying commentaries can be found in the WHO/WFN Atlas of Country Resources for Neurological Disorders, which is available on request from WHO or at http://www.who.int/mental health/neurology/.

J	Sleeboom-Faulkner, M				Sleeboom-Faulkner, Margaret			Chinese concepts of euthanasia and health care	BIOETHICS			English	Article						euthanasia; China; the Netherlands; biomedical textbooks; decriminalization; healthcare system; legislation	LIFE; END	This article argues that taking concepts of euthanasia out of their political and economic contexts leads to violations of the premises on which the Stoic ideal of euthanasia is based: `a quick, gentle and honourable death'.(2) For instance, the transplantation of the narrowly defined concept of euthanasia developed under the Dutch welfare system into a developing country, such as the People's Republic of China (PRC), seems inadequate. For it cannot deal with questions of anxiety about degrading forms of dying and suffering without reference to its economic rationale, demanded by a scarcity (unequal distribution) of health care resources. The weakness of health care provisions for the terminally ill in Mainland China has become increasingly poignant since the collapse of collective health care institutions in the countryside since the reforms of the late-1980s. As in most cases where health care facilities are wanting, it is difficult to apply the criteria of gentleness and dignity at reaching death. Its solution lies not in a faster relief from suffering by euthanasia, but in extending the quality of life through distributive justice within Chinese healthcare policy-making. This paper begins with a brief description of the Dutch euthanasia law, after which it discusses Chinese conceptions of euthanasia in biomedical textbooks, the media and in surveys. It concludes by pointing out the need for a transnational framework in which both the specifics and generalities of euthanasia can be discussed.

Evaluating the effect of policies and interventions to address inequalities in health: lessons from a Dutch programme	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						evaluation studies; health; socioeconomic status	PUBLIC-HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; REDUCE INEQUALITIES; EDUCATION	Objectives: Many initiatives have been taken in European countries that are designed to reduce inequalities in health. However, the effects of only a very few of these initiatives have been assessed. The main aim of a Dutch research and development programme was to systematically investigate and evaluate interventions aimed at reducing inequalities in health. In this paper, we report on this investigation, and draw lessons from the methodology used to evaluate such interventions. Approach: The programme included 12 evaluation studies, focusing on the wider determinants of inequalities in health (n = 2), behavioural determinants (n = 4), working conditions (n = 3) and health care (n = 3). Results: An experimental design was applied in two evaluation studies. The studies provided evidence of a positive effect. A quasi-experimental design appeared to be the only attainable option in seven studies. Five of these provided sufficient evidence for a positive effect, but two interventions appeared not to be successful. In three studies, no experimental or quasi-experimental design could be applied. Conclusions: The programme showed that it is possible to apply experimental or quasi-experimental studies to complex public health interventions. The Programme Committee steering the programme considered that the evidence generated by the experimental and quasi-experimental studies justified the implementation of the interventions on a wider scale, accompanied by further evaluation studies. Further development of the methodology of public health interventions is necessary. These include non-experimental designs such as international comparisons and time trend studies, especially in order to be able to evaluate broader policy measures.

In this article, we briefly examine the burden of non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and how chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a key integrated element in the setting, even in developing countries. A possible explanation of the increasing number of people who have or are at risk to develop CKD in poor countries is also given. A survey of major screening and intervention programmes performed or ongoing globally is then presented, highlighting differences and hurdles of projects planned in developed or developing nations as well as in unprivileged communities in developed countries. Finally, some recommendations on future steps to implement prevention programmes in emerging worlds are provided.

This is reflected in a number of high-profile conferences sponsored by international agencies, and a profusion of externally funded reform projects. This article assesses the potential of SHI to provide a sound model of health-care financing, drawing on the experiences of Argentina and Mexico. It uses four criteria to assess the performance of SHI: coverage, equity, effectiveness and sustainability. The article begins by outlining key principles of SHI and comparing it to other models of health-care financing. It then gives a comparative overview of four SHI programmes in Argentina and Mexico, before analysing their performance in greater detail. The article finishes by extracting lessons from this comparative analysis, both for the countries studied and for global debates on SHI.

A study of the perceptions of the use of anthropology in tropical public health research	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						anthropology; tropical public health; inequities in health	MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY; INTERNATIONAL HEALTH; INFECTIOUS-DISEASE; SOCIAL PRODUCTION; SCIENCE RESEARCH; MALARIA-CONTROL; GLOBAL FUND; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVENTION; KNOWLEDGE	Over the past 50 years, there have been considerable changes both in how medical anthropologists view their relationship to topical public health and in how tropical public health professionals view the role of anthropologists. In particular, in recent decades critical currents have emerged from an anthropology of medicine, calling for an examination of biomedicine and its conceptualisation of public health. There are parallel debates in public health about a narrow disease-focused or broader socio-cultural approach to improving population health. Based on a review of the literature and a qualitative study of the views of public health professionals and anthropologists working in tropical public health, the data presented in this paper suggest that public health professionals remain unaware of many of the contributions anthropology could make to tropical public health theory and practice. However, the objectives of a critical social science are not dissimilar to those of the broader concept of public health. We suggest that there are grounds for optimism. For those of us concerned not just with disease but also with inequities in health, the challenge is to work towards a critical tropical public health which draws as much from social science as from biomedicine, in theory and practice.

Mapping the environmental coverage of the INDEPTH demographic surveillance system network in rural Africa	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						demographic surveillance; INDEPTH network; satellite imagery; environmental distance; ecozonation; dendrogram	DISEASE; BURDEN; URBANIZATION	OBJECTIVES The INDEPTH DSS network was founded in 1998 to provide an international network of field sites for continuous demographic evaluation of populations and their health. Results from the network have been used to derive estimates of mortality, morbidity and health equity. Spatial extrapolation and logical summaries of these findings are dependent on the network covering a representative sample of the environments in a region and their interrelationships being known. Here, we investigate how comprehensive is the coverage of the network of rural DSS sites in Africa in terms of the range of ecological zones found across the continent. METHODS We used satellite imagery to define an environmental signature for each INDEPTH DSS site, and then calculate Euclidean distances from these signatures to the environmental signatures of every image pixel across Africa. These distances were then mapped and a gridded population surface used to mask uninhabited areas to illustrate the extent of the environmental coverage of the INDEPTH network. Environmental similarities between DSS sites were also calculated, hierarchically clustered and visualized as a dendrogram to examine between site relationships. Finally, an ecozonation of Africa was used to analyse the per-ecozone environmental similarity of the INDEPTH DSS network. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The current INDEPTH DSS network in Africa spans all the major environmental zones, but within these zones the environmental coverage of the network varies. These variations were mapped by ecozone. These maps provide valuable information in determining the confidence with which relationships derived from rural INDEPTH DSS sites can be extended to other areas. The results also indicate suites of sites that form environmentally cohesive groups and from which data can be logically summarized. Finally, the results highlight areas where the location of new INDEPTH DSS sites would increase significantly the environmental coverage of the network.

J	Dodd, R; Cassels, A				Dodd, R.; Cassels, A.			Health, development and the millennium development goals	ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY			English	Review								The Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which emerged from the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, are increasingly recognized as the over-arching development framework. As such, the MDG are increasingly guiding the policies of poor countries and aid agencies alike. This article reviews the challenges and opportunities for health presented by the MDG. The opportunities include that three of the eight MDG relate to health -(_)a recognition that health is central to global agenda of reducing poverty, as well as an important measure of human well-being in its own right. A related point is that the MDG help to focus attention on those health conditions that disproportionally affect the poor (communicable disease, child health and maternal health), which should, in turn, help to strengthen the equity focus of health policies in low-income countries. Further, because the MDG are concrete, it is possible to calculate the cost of achieving them, which in turn strengthens the long-standing calls for higher levels of aid for health. The challenges include that, while the MDG focus on specific diseases and conditions, they cannot be achieved without strengthening health systems. Similarly, progress towards the MDG will require health to be prioritized within overall development and economic policies. In practice, this means applying a health 'lens' to processes such as civil-service reform, decentralization and the drawing-up of frameworks of national expenditure. Finally, the MDG cannot be met with the resources available in low-income countries. While the MDG framework has created pressure for donors to commit to higher levels of aid, the challenge remains to turn these commitments into action. Data are presented to show that, at current rates of progress, the health-related MDG will not be achieved. This disappointing trend could be reversed, however, if the various challenges outlined are met.

Urbanization and tropical health - then and now	ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY			English	Review							TRANSMITTED HELMINTH INFECTIONS; URBAN MALARIA; REGIONAL BURDEN; RISK-FACTORS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ENVIRONMENT; DISEASE; AFRICA; ISSUES; TRENDS	Since the launch of the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology 100 years ago, the percentage of the world's population living in urban settings has more than tripled and is now approaching 50%. Urbanization will continue at a high pace, particularly in the less developed regions of Africa and Asia. The profound demographic, ecological and socio-economic transformations that accompany the process of urbanization have important impacts on health and well-being. In industrialized countries, urbanization led to the so-called 'epidemiological transition', from acute infectious and deficiency diseases to chronic non-communicable diseases, many decades ago. In the developing world, surprisingly little research has been carried out on the health-related aspects of urbanization. In a temporal analysis of publications in the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, for example, in which the first volume in every decade from 1907 was examined, only 16 (2.6%) of the 604 articles investigated focused on epidemiological and/or public-health issues in urban tropical settings. This review begins with the question 'what is urban?' and then provides a summary of the trends seen in urbanization, and its impacts on human health, over the past century, on both a global and regional scale. For the main tropical diseases, estimates of the at-risk populations and the numbers of cases are updated and then split into urban and non-urban categories. The inhabitants of urban slums are particularly vulnerable to many of these diseases and require special attention if internationally-set targets for development are to be met. Heterogeneity, a major feature of urban settings in the tropics that complicates all efforts at health improvement, is demonstrated in an exploration of a densely populated municipality of a large West African town. Urban planners, public-health experts and other relevant stakeholders clearly need to make much more progress in alleviating poverty and enhancing the health and well-being of urban residents, in an equity-effective and sustainable manner.

Methods We use data from international household-level surveys (Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)) to demonstrate that establishing an equity baseline is necessary and feasible, even in low-income and data-poor countries. We assess data from six countries using 11 health indicators and six social stratifiers. Simple bivariate stratification is complemented by simultaneous stratification to expose the compound effect of multiple forms of vulnerability. Findings The data reveal that inequities are complex and interactive: inferences cannot be drawn about the nature or extent of inequities in health outcomes from a single stratifier or indicator. Conclusion The MDGs and other development initiatives must become more comprehensive and explicit in their analysis and tracking of inequities. The design of policies to narrow health gaps must take into account country-specific inequities.

To fill this information gap, a survey of country resources available for epilepsy care was conducted within the framework of the ILAE/IBE/WHO Global Campaign Against Epilepsy. Methods: The study represents a major collaborative effort involving the World Health Organization (WHO), the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE). Results: Data were collected from 160 countries representing 97.5% of the world population. The information included availability, role, and involvement of professional and patient associations for epilepsy, epilepsy treatment and services including antiepileptic drugs, human resources involved in epilepsy care, teaching in epileptology, disability benefits, and problems encountered by people with epilepsy and health professionals involved in epilepsy care. The data confirm that epilepsy care is grossly inadequate compared with the needs in most countries. In addition, large inequities exist across regions and income groups of countries, with low-income countries having extremely meager resources. Complete results of this survey can be found in the Atlas: Epilepsy Care in the World. Conclusions: The data reinforce the need for urgent, substantial, and systematic action to enhance resources for epilepsy care, especially in low-income countries.

The women completed a questionnaire assessing various areas (e.g. pain). The design was cross-sectional and data were collected during 8 consecutive weeks. Sixty-three per cent of women reported pain during the last 3 months, of which 65% during more than 3 months. The multivariate analyses revealed associations between various socio-economic factors (e.g. financial strain) and pain in general/all studied body sites. In addition, psychosocial work conditions (i.e. work strain and social support) were significantly related to pain. Moreover, the multivariate analyses conducted among women with pain indicated relationships between socio-economic/psychosocial work conditions, and pain characteristics (e.g. intensity) and consequences (i.e. disability). A large number of women from the general population suffer from pain, in particularly prolonged pain. Women in a deprived socio-economic situation not only run a higher pain risk, but also experience their pain as more severe/disabling than their more privileged counterparts. Improvements of, for example, the socio-economic status among women living in deprived social and material circumstances, along with improved working environment may be crucial to reduce women's pain problems.

J	Pachanee, CA; Wibulpolprasert, S				Pachanee, Cha-Aim; Wibulpolprasert, Suwit			Incoherent policies on universal coverage of health insurance and promotion of international trade in health services in Thailand	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						universal access; health insurance; private health providers; trade in health services; human resources for health; brain drain; health care equity		The Thai government has implemented universal coverage of health insurance since October 2001. Universal access to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs has also been included since October 2003. These two policies have greatly increased the demand for health services and human resources for health, particularly among public health care providers. After the 1997 economic crisis, private health care providers, with the support of the government, embarked on new marketing strategies targeted at attracting foreign patients. Consequently, increasing numbers of foreign patients are visiting Thailand to seek medical care. In addition, the economic recovery since 2001 has greatly increased the demand for private health services among the Thai population. The increasing demand and much higher financial incentives from urban private providers have attracted health personnel, particularly medical doctors, from rural public health care facilities. Responding to this increasing demand and internal brain drain, in mid-2004 the Thai government approved the increased production of medical doctors by 10 678 in the following 15 years. Many additional financial incentives have also been applied. However, the immediate shortage of human resources needs to be addressed competently and urgently. Equity in health care access under this situation of competing demands from dual track policies is a challenge to policy makers and analysts. This paper summarizes the situation and trends as well as the responses by the Thai government. Both supply and demand side responses are described, and some solutions to restore equity in health care access are proposed.

Assessing progressivity of out-of-pocket payment: with illustration to Malaysia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						progressivity; equity; health financing; out-of-pocket payment	HEALTH-CARE; INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; POOR PAY; EQUITY; IMPACT; FINANCE; REFORM	Throughout the world, policy makers are considering or implementing financing strategies that are likely to have a substantial impact on the equity of health financing. The assessment of the equity implication is clearly important, given the potential impact that alternative finance sources have on households. Households incur out-of-pocket payment directly from their budget, apart from their public or private insurance. Out-of-pocket payment is the primary concern, given their undesirable impact on households. Progressivity measures departures from proportionality in the relationship between out-of-pocket payment and ability to pay. It is the most frequently used yardstick to assess the equity of out-of-pocket payments in empirical studies. This paper provides an evaluation of such progressivity measures, undertaken using four approaches (proportion approach, tabulation approach, concentration curve and Kakwani's index), in order to reveal their usefulness and underlying notion. It is illustrated empirically with data on out-of-pocket payment for health care in Malaysia for 1998/1999, based on the nationally representative Household Expenditure Survey. Results indicate that out-of-pocket payments are mildly progressive, whilst the four approaches have their benefits and limitations in assessing equity implications. This analysis is of interest from a policy perspective, given Malaysia's heavy reliance on out-of-pocket payments to finance health care. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Recently, however, those who have fostered nurse migration believe that it will solve nursing shortages in developed countries and offer nurse migrants better working conditions and an improved quality of life. Whether natural or manipulated, migration flow patterns largely occur from developing to developed countries. In this article, nurse migration is examined using primary health care (PHC) as an ethical framework. The unmanaged flow of nurse migrants from developing to developed countries is inconsistent with "health for all" principles. Removing key health personnel from countries experiencing resource shortages is contrary to PHC equity. Often, nurse migrants are placed in vulnerable, inequitable work roles, and employing nurse migrants fails to address basic causes of nurse shortages in developed countries, such as dissatisfaction with work conditions and decreased funding for academic settings. Nurse migration policies and procedures can be developed to satisfy PHC ethics criteria if they (1) leave developing countries enhanced rather than depleted, (2) contribute to country health outcomes consistent with essential care for all people, (3) are based on community participation, (4) address common nursing labor issues, and (5) involve equitable and clear financial arrangements.

These measures were then examined in relation to four sexual risk behaviors: frequency of condom use (with primary or secondary partners) and number of partners (last 3 months and lifetime). Participants were 101 male and 199 female young adults, aged 18-24, recruited from a secondary school in northern KwaZulu/ Natal province. Associations between gender and relationship scale scores and sexual risk outcomes yielded both expected and contradictory findings. For men, more frequent condom use was associated with higher levels of partner attachment (hyper-romanticism) but also with stronger approval of relationship violence and dominant behavior. In contrast, for women, more frequent condom use was correlated with a lower endorsement of relationship violence. Men with lower relationship power scores had fewer sexual partners in the preceding 3 months, while women with more egalitarian sexual scripts reported more sexual partners, as did those with higher hyper-romanticism scores. In logistic regression analysis, more egalitarian relationship norms among men were predictive of less consistent condom use, as were higher relationship power scores for women. These findings are discussed in relation to previous research on gender, heterosexual interactions and masculinity in this area, as well as the implications for HIV prevention programs.

J	Moore, S; Teixeira, AC; Shiell, A				Moore, Spencer; Teixeira, Ana C.; Shiell, Alan			The health of nations in a global context: Trade, global stratification, and infant mortality rates	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						global health; health inequalities; trade; world-systems theory; infant mortality; automorphic equivalence	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; LESS-DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES; WORLD-SYSTEM; INCOME INEQUALITY; ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY; NETWORK ANALYSIS; WOMENS STATUS; DETERMINANTS; DEMOCRACY; EXCHANGE	Despite the call for a better understanding of macro-level factors that affect population health, social epidemiological research has tended to focus almost exclusively on national-level factors, such as Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP/c) or levels of social cohesion. Using a world-systems framework to examine cross-national variations in infant mortality, this paper seeks to emphasize the effects of global trade on national-level population health. Rather than viewing national-level health indicators as autonomous from broader global contexts, the study uses network analysis methods to examine the effects of international trade on infant mortality rates. Network data for countries were derived from international data on the trade of capital-intensive commodities in 2000. Using automorphic equivalence to measure the degree to which actors in a network perform similar roles, countries were assigned into one of six world-system blocks, each with its own pattern of trade. These blocks were dummy-coded and tested using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. A key finding from this analysis is that after controlling for national-level factors, the two blocks with the lowest density in capital-intensive exchange, i.e., the periphery, are significantly and positively associated with national-level infant mortality rates. Results show the effects of peripherality and stratification on population health, and highlight the influence of broader macro-level factors such as trade and globalization on national health.

J	Brown, C; Lilford, R				Brown, Celia; Lilford, Richard			Cross sectional study of performance indicators for English Primary Care Trusts: testing construct validity and identifying explanatory variables	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; HOSPITALS; QUALITY	Background: The performance of Primary Care Trusts in England is assessed and published using a number of different performance indicators. Our study has two broad purposes. Firstly, to find out whether pairs of indicators that purport to measure similar aspects of quality are correlated ( as would be expected if they are both valid measures of the same construct). Secondly, we wanted to find out whether broad ( global) indicators correlated with any particular features of Primary Care Trusts, such as expenditure per capita. Methods: Cross sectional quantitative analysis using data from six 2004/ 05 PCT performance indicators for 303 English Primary Care Trusts from four sources in the public domain: Star Rating, aggregated Quality and Outcomes Framework scores, Dr Foster mortality index, Dr Foster equity index ( heart by-pass and hip replacements), NHS Litigation Authority Risk Management standards and Patient Satisfaction scores from the Star Ratings. Forward stepwise multiple regression analysis to determine the effect of Primary Care Trust characteristics on performance. Results: Star Rating and Quality and Outcomes Framework total, both summary measures of global quality, were not correlated with each other ( F = 0.66, p = 0.57). There were however positive correlations between Quality and Outcomes Framework total and patient satisfaction (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) and between screening/' additional services' indicators on the Star Ratings and Quality and Outcomes Framework ( F = 24, p < 0.001). There was no correlation between different measures of access to services. Likewise we found no relationship between either Star Rating or Litigation Authority Standards and hospital mortality ( F = 0.61, p = 0.61; F = 0.31, p = 0.73). Conclusion: Performance assessment in healthcare remains on the Government's agenda, with new core and developmental standards set to replace the Star Ratings in 2006. Yet the results of this analysis provide little evidence that the current indicators have sufficient construct validity to measure the underlying concept of quality, except when the specific area of screening is considered.

A cross-country study	APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS			English	Article							MARITAL-STATUS	This paper complements the burgeoning literature on country-specific studies of happiness by taking a global look at happiness and its determinants. In so doing, it makes two contributions. First, it presents indicators of happiness that are 'equity adjusted' and compares their values to those of unadjusted indicators. This comparison shows that countries with the lowest mean happiness scores have their unhappiness compounded when these means are adjusted to take account of the glaring inequality in their inter-personal distribution of happiness. Second, using data on nearly 113 000 respondents, drawn from 80 countries, it shows that people everywhere want broadly the same things in order to be happy: faith in a deity; a decent standard of living; a job; a good family and social life; a good neighbourhood in which to live; and, above all, good health.

J	Vargas, V; Wasem, J				Vargas, V; Wasem, J			Risk adjustment and primary health care in Chile	CROATIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							LATIN-AMERICA; TRANSITION; COSTS	Aim To offer a capitation formula with greater capacity for guiding resource spending on population with poorer health and lower socioeconomic status in the context of financing and equity in primary health care. Methods We collected two years of data on a sample of 10 000 individuals from a region in Chile, Valdivia and Temuco and evaluated three models to estimate utilization and expenditures per capita. The first model included age and sex; the second one included age, sex, and the presence of two key diagnoses; and the third model included age, sex, and the presence of seven key diagnoses. Regression results were evaluated by R-2 and predictive ratios to select the best specifications. Results Per-capita expenditures by age and sex confirmed international trends, where children under five, women, and the elderly were the main users of primary health care services. Women sought health advice twice as much as men. Clear differences by socioeconomic status were observed for the indigent population aged >= 65 years who under-utilized primary health care services. From the three models, major improvement in the predictive power occurred from the demographic (adjusted R-2, 9%) to the demographic plus two diagnoses model (adjusted R-2, 27%). improvements were modest when five other diagnoses were added (adjusted R-2, 28%). Conclusion The current formula that uses municipality's financial power and geographic location of health centers to adjust capitation payments provides little incentive to appropriate care for the indigent and people with chronic conditions. A capitation payment that adjusts for age, sex, and the presence of diabetes and hypertension will better guide resource allocation to those with poorer health and lower socioeconomic status.

J	Moore, S				Moore, Spencer			Peripherality, income inequality, and life expectancy: revisiting the income inequality hypothesis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						trade; income inequality; global health; life expectancy	EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION; WORLD-SYSTEM; POPULATION HEALTH; GLOBALIZATION; MORTALITY; POSITION	Background. Recent criticisms of the income inequality and health hypothesis have stressed the lack of consistent significant evidence for the stronger effects of income inequality among rich countries. Despite such criticisms, little attention has been devoted to the income-based criteria underlying the stratification of countries into rich/poor groups and whether trade patterns and world-system role provide an alternative means of stratifying groups. Methods. To compare income-based and trade-based criteria, 107 countries were grouped into four typologies: (I) high/low income, (II) OECD membership/non-membership, (III) core/non-core, and (IV) non-periphery/periphery. Each typology was tested separately for significant differences in the effects of income inequality between groups. Separate group comparison tests and regression analyses were conducted for each typology using Rodgers (1979) specification of income, income inequality, and life expectancy. Interaction terms were introduced into Rodgers specification to test whether group classification moderated the effects of income inequality on health. Results. Results show that the effects of income inequality are stronger in the periphery than non-periphery (IV) (-0.76 vs -0.23; P < 0.05). An incremental F-test confirmed significant differences in the coefficient subsets between the two groups (F-2,F-101 = 6.31; P < 0.01). Conclusions. Cross-national analyses of income inequality and population health have assumed (i) income differences between countries best capture global stratification and (ii) the negative effects of income inequality are stronger in high-income countries. However, present findings emphasize (i) the importance of measuring global stratification according to trading patterns and (ii) the strong, negative effects of income inequality on life expectancy among peripheral populations.

A needs assessment to build international research ethics capacity	JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS			English	Article						international collaboration; needs assessment; cross-cultural; ethics review committee; ethics capacity; informed consent; justice; guidelines		INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATORS IN BIOMEDICAL sciences face ethical challenges in the design, review, and conduct of research. Challenges include differences in research ethics capacity, cultural differences in interpretation and application of ethical principles, and cooperation between ethics review boards at collaborating institutions. Indiana University School of Medicine (Indianapolis, USA) and Moi University Faculty of Health Sciences (Eldoret, Kenya) developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish greater cooperation between their ethics review boards, followed by a joint needs assessment to assess barriers to implementing the MOU. Focus groups and interviews at each institution revealed that while each side verbalized understanding and respect for the other's culture, there were misunderstandings deeply rooted in each culture that could potentially derail the collaboration. Although the participants at each university agreed on the major principles and issues in research ethics and on the importance attributed to them, a more in-depth evaluation of the responses revealed important differences. Methods to address these misunderstandings are outlined in the recommended Best Practices.

J	Hall, AL				Hall, Amy Laura			Whose progress? The language of global health	JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						bioethics; Darwin; global health; justice; race		The barrier to global health most often noted in Western discourse is the enduring disparity of access to medical technologies. This assessment of the circumstances in global health fits well within a bioethic centered on the equitable distribution of access to medical goods. Yet through an interrogative consideration of two episodes in the marketing of progress, namely the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago ( 1933 1934) and one post-war spin on atomic development in the National Geographic, I suggest that the language of medical advancement continues to trade on a division between civilized, rational, scientifically developed peoples and the atavism of peoples by whom Western science gauges its progress. I recommend unremittingly self-critical attention to the dynamics of language and legitimization used within the Western academy by those who seek ostensibly to be of use in regions ( powerfully) labeled as "developing."

Socioeconomic and country variations in knowledge of health risks of tobacco smoking and toxic constituents of smoke: results from the 2002 International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey	TOBACCO CONTROL			English	Article							CORONARY HEART-DISEASE; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; EDUCATIONAL-LEVEL; POPULATION; TRENDS; PREVALENCE; CANCER; ADULTS; PERCEPTIONS; CESSATION	Background: Socioeconomic status is strongly associated with smoking prevalence and social class differences contribute substantially to social inequalities in mortality. This research investigated socioeconomic and country variations in smokers' knowledge that smoking causes heart disease, stroke, impotence and lung cancer, that smoke contains cyanide, mercury, arsenic and carbon monoxide, and whether nicotine causes most of the cancer. Methods: Data were from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Survey, a cohort survey of over 9000 adult smokers from four countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Data were collected via telephone interviews in 2002. Results: Higher education and income were associated with higher awareness. For example, the odds of knowing that smoking causes heart disease, stroke and lung cancer were respectively 71%, 34% and 83% larger for respondents with high versus low income. The odds of knowing that smoke contains cyanide, mercury, arsenic and carbon monoxide were respectively 66%, 26%, 44% and 108% larger for respondents with a university degree than those with a high school diploma or lower level of education. Results also revealed that awareness of harms of smoking was generally the highest in Canada and the lowest in the UK. Conclusions: Lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower awareness of the harms of smoking and misunderstanding around nicotine. There is a need to improve knowledge of the dangers of smoking among the disadvantaged segments of the population.

J	Zhao, YJ; Dempsey, K				Zhao, YJ; Dempsey, K			Causes of inequality in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in the Northern Territory, 1981-2000: a decomposition analysis	MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article							RENAL-DISEASE; INFECTION; MORTALITY; AUSTRALIA; DEATH	Objective: To identify the causes of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations of the Northern Territory and how the causes have evolved over time. Design and setting: Analysis of NT death data over four 5-year periods, 1 January 1981 to 31 December 2000 inclusive. A decomposition. method using discrete approximations (Vaupel and Romo) was applied to abridged life tables for the Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations of the NT. Main outcome measures: Contribution of causes of death, grouped according to global burden of disease groups and categories, to the life expectancy gap. Results: The gap between the life expectancy of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in the NT did not appear to narrow over time, but there was a marked shift in the causes of the gap. In terms of disease groups, the contribution of communicable diseases, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions halved during the 20 years to 2000. Meanwhile, the contribution of non-communicable diseases and conditions increased markedly. The contribution of injuries remained static. In terms of disease categories, the contribution of infectious diseases, respiratory infections and respiratory diseases declined considerably; however, these gains were offset by significantly larger increases in the contribution of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes for Indigenous women and cardiovascular diseases, cancers and digestive diseases for Indigenous men. Conclusions: The main contributors to the gap in life expectancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations were non-communicable diseases and conditions, which are more prevalent in ageing populations. With the life expectancy of Indigenous people in the NT expected to improve, it is important that public health initiatives remain-focused on preventing and managing chronic diseases.

By 2010, approximately 60% of new cancer cases will occur in the developing world, higher than rates developed countries. However, disparities exist not only between countries but also within countries. Cancer epidemiology in developing countries is paradoxical: Increased incidence is partially due to increased development resulting in longer life expectancy and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Reduced mortality from infectious diseases results in relatively greater mortality from chronic diseases. However, infectious diseases are also risk factors for the leading causes of cancer mortality in these countries. While health disparities in developing versus developed countries are quantitatively worlds apart, they are qualitatively rather similar. They share common causes, such as environmental pollution, the need for social justice, large gaps between the rich and the poor, lack of access to cancer resources, and health services that are available to some but not to all. While industrialization and urbanization elevate a country's economic base while contributing to cancer incidence and mortality. Strategies to reduce international cancer disparities include country- and regional-level interventions, utilizing nongovernmental organizations, and developing long-term interinstitutional partnerships. Although economic aid is undoubtedly necessary, it is not sufficient to control cancer in the developing world. To address these problems, it will be necessary to focus attention on what can be done locally-within countries, not only between countries.

In contrast, strong and robust household effects are evident, though relatively rarely examined. This study investigated household and area effects in the distribution of mental health scores using Australian data. Method: Analysis of data from the first wave of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey: a large representative survey of 13 969 Australian adults. Multilevel regression methods were used to model variance in the mental health scale and mental component summary scale of the Short-Form 36 at the individual, household and area (Census Collection District) levels. A number of risk factors at various levels of the model were also examined. Results: Very little variance in mental health scores occurred at the area level (1.5%), whereas significant and substantial variance occurred at the household level (23.0%). The variance at the household level remained highly significant following the inclusion of a range of risk factors at the individual, household and area levels. Conclusions: The results confirm the absence of substantial area-level variation in mental health using Australian data. The findings highlight the importance of focusing on household-level characteristics in future research.

Governance is likely to be central in the next phase of Asia's growth and poverty reduction, and gaining a better understanding of poor people's governance priorities, such as better service delivery (particularly in health and education) and access to justice, is necessary. There is no single model of governance associated with positive growth and poverty reduction outcomes in Asia to date. Changes in the nature of governance in successful Asian countries over the last two decades have been driven by a range of factors including: domestic economic reform, increased integration with the global economy, citizen-led demands for better governance and influence of aid donors, Of the governance initiatives introduced by Asian governments, decentralisation and service delivery reforms have the greatest potential to contribute to poverty reduction.

J	Rosenberg, M				Rosenberg, Martha			A decade after Cairo in Latin America: An overview	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article								To understand what has happened to women's health in Latin America over a decade or more since the Cairo conference, one has to analyse how Latin America has been affected byglobalisation. Exploitation has been globalised with the transnational circulation of profits, and capital can now grow at the expense of the resources and labour of any country in the world. Areas of social life that had hitherto not been ruled by the logic of profit were now commercialised. In Latin America, unemployment increased, average salaries decreased, and the precariousness of working conditions grew dramatically. Services that had been accessible to most people were privatised, thereby increasing inequality between poorer people and the rest of society; thus, in turn, has increased the pressure on households that are mainly run by women-in Argentina, these form nearly one-third of the households. Using examples from Argentina, this article describes how the economic changes brought about by the processes of globalisation have had an impact on the lives of women in Latin America. These are, in turn, seen in relation to the Cairo commitments. It also traces the reactions of feminist and women's movements to the challenges posed by these changes.

J	Lynch, J; Smith, GD; Harper, S; Bainbridge, K				Lynch, J; Smith, GD; Harper, S; Bainbridge, K			Explaining the social gradient in coronary heart disease: comparing relative and absolute risk approaches	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASES; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; BLOOD CHOLESTEROL; HEALTH BEHAVIORS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; GLOBAL BURDEN; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; PREVENTION	Study objectives: There are contradictory perspectives on the importance of conventional coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in explaining population levels and social gradients in CHD. This study examined the contribution of conventional CHD risk factors (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes) to explaining population levels and to absolute and relative social inequalities in CHD. This was investigated in an entire population and by creating a low risk sub-population with no smoking, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension to simulate what would happen to relative and social inequalities in CHD if conventional risk factors were removed. Design, setting, and participants: Population based study of 2682 eastern Finnish men aged 42, 48, 54, 60 at baseline with 10.5 years average follow up of fatal (ICD9 codes 410-414) and non-fatal (MONICA criteria) CHD events. Main results: In the whole population, 94.6% of events occurred among men exposed to at least one conventional risk factor, with a PAR of 68%. Adjustment for conventional risk factors reduced relative social inequality by 24%. However, in a low risk population free from conventional risk factors, absolute social inequality reduced by 72%. Conclusions: Conventional risk factors explain the majority of absolute social inequality in CHD because conventional risk factors explain the vast majority of CHD cases in the population. However, the role of conventional risk factors in explaining relative social inequality was modest. This apparent paradox may arise in populations where inequalities in conventional risk factors between social groups are low, relative to the high levels of conventional risk factors within every social group. If the concern is to reduce the overall population health burden of CHD and the disproportionate population health burden associated with the social inequalities in CHD, then reducing conventional risk factors will do the job.

J	Gerein, N; Green, A; Pearson, S				Gerein, Nancy; Green, Andrew; Pearson, Stephen			The implications of shortages of health professionals for maternal health in sub-Saharan Africa	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS			English	Article						maternal health; human resources; midwives; staff turnover and attrition; Africa	HUMAN-RESOURCES	This paper discusses the implications of shortages of midwives, nurses and doctors for maternal health and health services in sub-Saharan Africa, and inequitable distribution of maternal health professionals between geographic areas and health facilities. Shortages of health professionals reduce the number of facilities equipped to offer emergency obstetric care 24 hours a day, and are significantly related to quality of care and maternal mortality rates. Some countries are experiencing depletion of their workforces due to emigration and HIV-related illness. Another feature is the movement from public to private health facilities, and to international health and development organisations. The availability of skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care may be reduced due to understaffing, particularly in rural, poor areas. The existing workforce may experience increased workloads and job dissatisfaction, and may have to undertake tasks for which they are not trained. If governments and development partners are serious about reaching the Millennium Development Goal on maternal health, substantial numbers of professionals with midwifery skills will be needed. Shortages of maternal health professionals should be addressed within overall human resources policy. A rethink of health sector reforms and macro-economic development policies is called for, to focus on equity and strengthening the role of the state. (c) 2006 Reproductive Health Matters.

In Morocco, there is a persistent lack of professional recognition of midwifery which is consistent with widespread gender inequality and women's low status. Midwifery training in Morocco has evolved since the 1960s into a three-year undergraduate programme. Despite this, there is currently a shortfall of midwives to attend the large number of births in Morocco. Midwives have only partially replaced traditional birth attendants, especially in rural areas. Maternal mortality remains high. However, several recent government policies reflect increased attention to women's needs, e.g. since February 2006, midwives may be eligible for reimbursement should a medical doctor be unavailable. Since 1990, the Moroccan Midwives Association has been actively encouraging midwifery curriculum review, improvements in training and the professional status of midwifery. Partnerships with international midwifery associations have revealed challenges encountered elsewhere and helped us to establish specific strategies for promoting the professional recognition, autonomy and visibility of midwifery in Morocco. In a cultural context such as Morocco's, a disciplinary link between midwives and the medical community seems crucial. However, only with recognition of midwives as competent, skilled and valued partners can midwifery practice in Morocco progressively evolve into women-centred moternity core.

J	Gabriele, A				Gabriele, Alberto			Social services policies in a developing market economy oriented towards socialism: The case of health system reforms in Vietnam	REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article						health policy; market socialism; services; Vietnam; development; equality; growth; state		This paper analyzes Vietnam's health policies. It adopts an interpretative framework stressing that policy approaches to strategic and commercial services, on one hand, and social services, on the other hand, should be fundamentally different, given the structurally different nature of such diverse services activities. The paper analyzes the evolution of health policies during the doi moi period and reviews the national and international debate on health systems reforms, arguing that an approach prone to blur the intrinsic difference between social and non-social services has led to market-oriented health reforms that are severely flawed in Vietnam, with negative impacts on universality of access, equity, poverty, and efficiency. In sum, social services policies, and policies in the domain of health in particular, appear to constitute the weakest and most contentious component of Vietnam's otherwise extremely successful development strategy. Therefore, they are a prime candidate for critical re-examination.

The current study approaches one step for international conceptual validation by analysing the association between various health determinants and different types of health outcomes (mental health, quality of life) across a range of countries or geographical areas. The current study is based on the EUROHIS project that has been conducted in a sample of 4849 adults across 10 European countries. Results highlight that interactions between health determinants with subjective mental health, general health and quality of life (QoL) differ between Western European countries, Eastern European countries and the Newly Associated States as well as Israel. Using a MIMIC model approach, we were able to show that the impact of each of the sociodemographic variables cannot be interpreted on the basis of its single loading but only seeing the interacting with other indicators. Future studies should include sociodemographics in MIMIC models in each latent factor before carrying out regressions on a larger scale. Future investigations will require larger and representative samples to (a) test models on latent factors of mental health and QoL and (b) on the basis of these findings test overall structural models across countries.

SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						US; socioeconomic status; child health	SOCIAL-CLASS GRADIENTS; BRITISH WOMENS HEART; CHILDRENS HEALTH; ADULT MORTALITY; ECONOMIC-STATUS; LIFE-COURSE; DISEASE; INCOME; INEQUALITIES; YOUTH	Socioeconomic status (SES) gradients may not be static across the lifespan, but instead may vary in strength across different life stages. This study examined the periods in childhood when SES and health relationships emerge and are strongest among US children. Data came from the National Health Interview Survey, 1994, a cross sectional, nationally representative sample of 33,911 US children ages 0-18. Parents were asked about family SES and child health status. Global health measures included overall ratings of child health, activity and school limitations. Acute conditions included childhood injuries and respiratory illnesses. For all global child health measures, lower family SES was associated with poorer child health in a gradient fashion (P < .001); these differences did not vary across age. For specific conditions, interaction effects of SES with age were found (P < .05). Interaction effects revealed that for injury and acute respiratory illness, expected SES gradients (lower SES with poorer outcomes) were evident during adolescence. In contrast, respiratory illness had a reverse SES gradient in early childhood. In sum, for global child health measures, associations of lower SES with poorer health throughout childhood suggest that factors that do not change with age (e.g., health care quality) may best explain overall health status. However, for acute conditions, the relationship between low SES and poor child health appears most consistently during adolescence. This suggests that normal development-related changes during adolescence, such as increasing peer group affiliation, may help explain these gradients. These patterns are important to understand for optimally timing interventions to reduce SES disparities in US children's health. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two index technologies were considered: implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and drug-eluting stents (DES). The use of ICDs range from 35 implants/million population in Portugal to 166 implants/million population in Germany, whereas for implants of DES (as percentage of total stents) it is lowest in Germany at 14% and high in Portugal at 65%. These differences can in part be explained by a lack of structured implementation of guidelines, the direct cost in relation to the overall healthcare budget, and to differences in procedures and models applied by Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies in Europe. The workshop participants concluded that physicians need to be involved in a more structured way in HTA and need to become better acquainted with its methods and terminology. Clinical guidelines should be systematically translated, explained, disseminated, updated, and adopted by cardiologists in Europe. Clinically appropriate, consistent and transparent health economic models need to be developed and high-quality international outcome and cost data should be used. A process for funding of a technology should be developed after a positive recommendation from HTA agencies. Both the ESC and the national cardiac societies should build-up health economic expertise and engage more actively in discussions with stakeholders involved in the provision of healthcare.

It influences the lives and fortunes of individuals, organizations, and nations/regions. However because offshoring so broadly affects different stakeholders, a multi-level theory is required so that influences that may positively affect one set of stakeholders while negatively affecting another are not misinterpreted by an overly narrow analysis. This article discusses how IT development is differentiated from other global labor sourcing and argues that it is worthy of investigation as an offshoring domain. The article proposes that the study of IT development offshoring needs to recognize precursors and results as they affect individuals, organizations, and nation/regions, and presents examples and discussion in each of these areas. The article further argues that the domain of IT development offshoring is incomplete without consideration of interactions between the individual and nation/region as well as between the organization and nation/region. The article concludes by considering the complexity of presenting a complete picture in this domain and suggesting some areas for future research.

Today, nurses are increasingly taking on leadership roles in community, settings. This article addresses the application of Leininger's culture care theory with the sunrise model and Hersey and Blanchard's tri-dimensional leader effectiveness model as potential collaborating theories for capacity building and community transformation from a global, transcultural nursing perspective. The two theories, used in collaboration, view the provision of competent leadership as the delivery of effective, culturally congruent nursing care in promoting health and health equity at the community level.

It builds on traditional microbiology and epidemiology but within a legal framework. Important motives for forensic investigations include interdiction of criminals, prosecution of justice, and ideally, deterrence of others from committing similar acts. Forensic capabilities in animal health should focus on building capacity for detection and reporting of increases in infectious disease morbidity and mortality among animals that might reflect a covert release of a pathogen. Suspicion should be raised when epidemiological patterns are different from those expected for the animal population and the pathogen in question. Existing capacities for the detection and reporting of epidemic and even endemic diseases should be an international priority for the prevention of catastrophic losses in animal and potentially in human life. The veterinary community needs to be more aware of the legal requirements related to forensic investigations so that veterinarians will be prepared to handle evidence properly within their own fields.

The risk of stillbirth or neonatal death is also high in developing countries. The inequality of research funding between rich and poor countries is dramatic, with only 10% of research funding directed towards diseases which contribute 90% of the global burden of disease. The need for high-quality, relevant perinatal research in developing countries is compelling. There are many examples of good perinatal research in developing countries. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain and are being tackled. We need better information about maternal and perinatal health, and about performance of the health services, we need more evaluation of what helps and what harms within the existing health services, and we need improved strategies for implementation of research findings.

We decided to review the evidence and see if we could find a consistent interpretation of both the positive and negative findings. We identified 168 analyses in 155 papers reporting research findings on the association between income distribution and population health, and classified them according to how far their findings supported the hypothesis that greater income differences are associated with lower standards of population health. Analyses in which all adjusted associations between greater income equality and higher standards of population health were statistically significant and positive were classified as "wholly supportive"; if none were significant and positive they were classified as "unsupportive"; and if some but not all were significant and supportive they were classified as "partially supportive". Of those classified as either wholly supportive or unsupportive, a large majority (70 per cent) suggest that health is less good in societies where income differences are bigger. There were substantial differences in the proportion of supportive findings according to whether inequality was measured in large or small areas. We suggest that the studies of income inequality are more supportive in large areas because in that context income inequality serves as a measure of the scale of social stratification, or how hierarchical a society is. We suggest three explanations for the unsupportive findings reported by a minority of studies. First, many studies measured inequality in areas too small to reflect the scale of social class differences in a society; second, a number of studies controlled for factors which, rather than being genuine confounders, are likely either to mediate between class and health or to be other reflections of the scale of social stratification; and third, the international relationship was temporarily lost (in all but the youngest age groups) during the decade from the mid-1980s when income differences were widening particularly rapidly in a number of countries. We finish by discussing possible objections to our interpretation of the findings. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						mortality; inequalities; social; employment; France; temporal change	HEALTH INEQUALITIES; OCCUPATIONAL-MOBILITY; SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; MEN; MORBIDITY; BRITAIN; EUROPE; TRENDS; KOREA	An increase in social inequalities in premature mortality has been observed in the last decades in various European countries. In France, large inequalities have been reported for several years, but the changes over time have been only partially examined. The study was based on the analysis of a large longitudinal data set. Four periods of 7 years following a census were compared. Deaths in the period (21,003 deaths for men, 9418 for women) were recorded and studied according to socioeconomic status (SES) at the census. Relative Index of Inequality (RII) was calculated in order to quantify the magnitude of inequalities among those employed, and also in the entire population, with specific categories for those inactive. The results showed that the magnitude of inequalities remained mainly stable over time for men and women working at the time of the census. However, for the entire population, a strong increase in the magnitude of social inequalities was observed. For men the RIIs increased from 3.53 in the first period to 6.54 in the most recent period. For women, the corresponding figures were 1.94 and 3.88. The increase was observed also for specific causes of deaths: cancer and cardiovascular diseases for both sexes, and external causes for men. In spite of a global decrease in the mortality over the period, the absolute differences between the top and the bottom of the socioeconomic scale did not change. The results highlight the importance of temporal changes in mortality associated with an increase of unemployment, changes in the labour market, and the consequences of selective exclusion from work. The classification of those not working is an important point to consider in the study of social inequalities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we analysed data from four repeated, cross-sectional surveys and applied European Data Food Networking (DAFNE) methodology for post-harmonising the data. Raw data of 19 483 households in Bolivia (3035 in 1999, 4857 in 2000, 5845 in 2001 and 5746 in 2002) were retrieved from the databases of the national household surveys. Results showed that the Bolivian diet is characterised by higher availability of foods of plant origin (cereals, fruits, potatoes and vegetables). Meat, milk and their products follow in the dietary preferences of Bolivians. Disparities in food availability within the country were also observed. Rural households systematically recorded lower amounts of food available, in comparison with the urban ones. Households of higher social status recorded higher availability values for all food groups, except for potatoes and cereals. Findings suggest that Bolivian households of lower socio-economic status prefer energy-dense and cheaper food sources. We concluded the dietary and socio-demographic data collected in the MECOVI household surveys could serve nutrition surveillance purposes. In addition, the application of DAFNE methodology for post-harmonising the data allows both national and international comparisons.

Mobilizing the Canadian public health community around a global health advocacy agenda	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article								Growing poverty, collapsing health care systems, the AIDS pandemic and the widening of health and health care inequities within and between countries all point to the limited success of global public health interventions over the past few decades. Notwithstanding the efforts of multilateral agencies such as the World Health Organization and the many existing contributions from the Canadian community of health professionals, this commentary argues and appeals for further action particularly in relation to the social and political impediments to better health and justice. Specifically, it calls for the development of a robust instrument to assess the impact of Canada as a whole on the state of global health, and to monitor the performance of key Canadian institutions. It is suggested that such an instrument would result in a process that enhances global citizenship and public accountability, and buttresses the efforts of civil society to forge trans-national links in pursuit of a fairer and healthier world. Public health professionals, by virtue of their social standing as well as the nature and tools of their discipline, should be at the forefront of such civic efforts.

J	Furuta, M; Salway, S				Furuta, M; Salway, S			Women's position within the household as a determinant of maternal health care use in Nepal	INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PERSPECTIVES			English	Article							FERTILITY; MORTALITY	CONTEXT: Although gender inequality is often cited as a barrier to improving maternal health in Nepal, little attention has been directed at understanding how sociocultural factors may influence the use of health core. In particular, how a woman's position within her household may affect the receipt of health care deserves further investigation. METHODS. Data on ever-married women aged 15-49 from the 2001 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey were analyzed to explore three dimensions of women's position within their household-decision making, employment and influence over earnings, and spousal discussion of family planning. Logistic regression models assessed the relationship of these variables to receipt of skilled antenatal and delivery core. RESULTS: Few women reported participation in household decision making, and even fewer had any control over their own earnings. However, more than half reported discussing family planning with their husbands, and there were significant differences among subgroups in these indicators of women's position. Though associations were not consistent across all indicators, spousal discussion of family planning was linked to an increased likelihood of receiving skilled antenatal and delivery care (odds ratios, 1.4 and 1.3, respectively). Women's secondary education was also strongly associated with the greater use of health care (5.1-5.6). CONCLUSIONS: Gender inequality constrains women's access to skilled health core in Nepal. Interventions to improve communication and strengthen women's influence deserve continued support. The strong association of women's education with health care use highlights the need for efforts to increase girls' schooling and alter perceptions of the value of skilled maternal health care.
