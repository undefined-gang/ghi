J	Ataguba, JE; Asante, AD; Limwattananon, S; Wiseman, V				Ataguba, John E.; Asante, Augustine D.; Limwattananon, Supon; Wiseman, Virginia			How to do (or not to do) ... a health financing incidence analysis	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Financing incidence analysis; progressivity; regressivity; health financing; ability-to-pay; methodology	BENEFIT-INCIDENCE ANALYSIS; INCOME-TAX PROGRESSION; SOUTH-AFRICA; INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; STATISTICAL-INFERENCE; UNIVERSAL COVERAGE; CARE; EQUITY; TANZANIA; GHANA	Financing incidence analysis (FIA) assesses how the burden of health financing is distributed in relation to household ability to pay (ATP). In a progressive financing system, poorer households contribute a smaller proportion of their ATP to finance health services compared to richer households. A system is regressive when the poor contribute proportionately more. Equitable health financing is often associated with progressivity. To conduct a comprehensive FIA, detailed household survey data containing reliable information on both a cardinal measure of household ATP and variables for extracting contributions to health services via taxes, health insurance and out-of-pocket (OOP) payments are required. Further, data on health financing mix are needed to assess overall FIA. Two major approaches to conducting FIA described in this article include the structural progressivity approach that assesses how the share of ATP (e. g. income) spent on health services varies by quantiles, and the effective progressivity approach that uses indices of progressivity such as the Kakwani index. This article provides some detailed practical steps for analysts to conduct FIA. This includes the data requirements, data sources, how to extract or estimate health payments from survey data and the methods for assessing FIA. It also discusses data deficiencies that are common in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). The results of FIA are useful in designing policies to achieve an equitable health system.

We aimed to estimate the differences in risk of TI-related disability according to individual characteristics that might generate health inequalities. Methods: Cross-sectional study using a representative Spanish population sample drawn from the European Health Interview Survey 2009/2010. We calculated traffic crashes in the preceding year which resulted in injuries. Disability was measured using the Global Activity Limitation Indicator and four indicators of limitations (sensory, physical functional, self-care and domestic activities). Principal socio-demographic and behavioural/lifestyle variables were studied. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the risk (ORs) of TI-related disability in the sample as whole and disability-related factors in persons who had experienced TIs. Results: Persons with TIs had a higher risk of global disability (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.17-2.20), physical functional limitations (OR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.33-2.89) and self-care limitations (OR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.98-3.05). Among persons with TIs, GALI-related risk was higher in women (OR = 3.06, p = 0.002) and persons aged over 30 years (OR31-45years = 6.81, p < 0.001; OR46-64years = 5.96, p = 0.011; OR>64years = 4.54, p = 0.047). Lower risk was observed among persons with a higher educational level (OR = 0.22, p = 0.003). The risk of disability among persons with TIs who consumed illegal drugs was OR = 3.9 (p = 0.023). Conclusions: Traffic injuries in the preceding year are associated with higher risk of disability, which is unevenly distributed. Individual (women and persons over 30 years), socio-economic (lower educational level) and behavioural (illegal drug use) factors are involved. Actions aimed at changing the unequal risk among vulnerable subgroups and providing health, social and protective services should be implemented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present paper will examine the experience of older people in a rapidly changing modern world, a world in which opportunity to grow old is afforded to more people but one in which doing so positively and in accordance with their human rights is not assured. Taking Scotland as its focus, but mindful of wider experiences, the paper will look firstly at the notion of human rights, global demographic change and the challenges facing the realisation of human rights amongst older people in the UK. Next, using Scotland as a case study, the paper will explore the philosophy, policy and practice that shape the experience of growing old in an advanced western society. Finally, the paper will reflect upon ways of overcoming injustice and social exclusion amongst older people, pointing the way towards a more civilised society where older people are assured of their human rights. The latter will involve a human rights-based approach to working with older people, informed by applying the PANEL principles of 'participation', 'accountability', 'non-discrimination', 'empowerment' and 'legality'.

Unemployment protection policies, particularly the unemployment insurance (UI) system, have become a weighty issue for many modern welfare states. Decades of research have established concrete findings on the adverse impacts of unemployment on poverty-and health-related outcomes. This provided a foundation for further exploration into the potential protective effects of UI in offsetting these adverse outcomes. Methods: We developed a systematic review protocol in four stages (literature search, study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal) to ensure a rigorous data collection and inter-rated reliability. We examined the full body of empirical research published between 2000 and 2013 on the pathways by which UI impacts poverty and health. Results: Out of 2233 primary studies identified, a total of 12 met our inclusion criteria. The selected studies assessed poverty-related outcomes (absolute/relative poverty and material hardship) or one or more health-related outcomes (health behaviors, self-rated health, well-being and mental health). Across various UI systems, jurisdictions from high income countries, and study designs, we found good support for our conceptual framework, by which UI attenuates the effect of unemployment on both poverty and health, with a few exceptions. Conclusion: Whether UI impacts differ by age and region might be explored further in future research. The complex mediating relationship between unemployment, UI, poverty and health should further be assessed in light of economic and historical contexts. This could inform decision-making processes during future periods of economic recession.

An analogy between socioeconomic deprivation level and loss of health from adverse effects of medical treatment in England	INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article						adverse effects; mortality; DALY; population health; England	GLOBAL BURDEN; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; DISEASE; EVENTS; INEQUALITIES; DISABILITY; MORTALITY; DEATH	Background The purpose of this study was to show whether and how levels, trends and patterns obtained from estimates of premature deaths from adverse effects (AEs) of medical treatment depended on the deprivation level in England over the 24-year period, 1990-2013. We provide a report to inform decision-making strategies to reduce the burden of disease arising from AEs of medical treatment in the most deprived areas of the country. Methods Comparative analysis was driven by a single cause-of-injury categoryAEs of medical treatmentfrom the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study. We report the mean values with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for five socioeconomic deprivation areas of England. Results In the most deprived areas of England, the death rate declined from 2.27 (95% UI 1.65 to 2.57) to 1.54 (1.28 to 2.08) deaths (32.16% change). The death rate in the least deprived areas was 1.22 (0.88 to 1.38) in 1990; it was 1.17 (0.97 to 1.59) in 2013 (4.1% change). Regarding disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates, the same trend is observed. Although the gap between the most deprived and least deprived populations of England narrowed with regards to number of deaths, and rates of deaths and DALYs from AEs of medical treatment, inequalities between marginal levels of deprivation remain. Conclusions The study suggests that a relationship between deprivation level and health loss from the AEs of medical treatment across England is possible. This could then be used when devising and prioritising health policies and strategies.

Responsibility and Solidarity in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article							GLOBAL HEALTH; TERRITORY; JUSTICE; PEOPLE; PEACE; GAZA	This article examines the Israeli government's role in supporting living conditions conducive to health in the occupied Palestinian territories (OPT). Limiting the discussion to public health, the authors argue that-whether justified in its overall political policy-the Israeli government and people are legally and ethically obligated to care for the well-being of the Palestinian people. The authors first review the current situation in the OPT and compare health statistics with Israel. Next, the authors make three arguments as to why the Israeli government and citizens should assist the Palestinian people: moral responsibility, legal responsibility and solidarity. Based on these, the authors make the case for Israel's moral duty to ensure that Palestinian people living in the OPT achieve equitable levels of health as compared to Israeli citizens, while minimizing restrictions on Palestinian self-determination. The authors urge the Israeli government and citizens to improve Palestinian's daily living conditions, tackle inequitable distribution of power and allow international support in these efforts.				zoharlederman@gmail.com	Lederman, Zohar/GWZ-3014-2022; Lederman, Shmuel/GNP-7554-2022	Lederman, Shmuel/0000-0002-9270-4392; Lederman, Zohar/0000-0003-0547-1066					55	8	8	1	5	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	1754-9973	1754-9981		PUBLIC HEALTH ETH-UK	Public Health Ethics	APR	2018	11	1					103	120		10.1093/phe/phx004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/phe/phx004			18	Ethics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)	Social Sciences - Other Topics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics	GB3GA					2025-01-01	WOS:000428942900011

The objective of the present study was to describe the prevalence of disrespect and abuse of women during childbirth in Pelotas City, Brazil, and to investigate the factors involved. Methods: This was a cross-sectional population-based study of women delivering members of the 2015 Pelotas birth cohort. Information relating to disrespect and abuse during childbirth was obtained by household interview 3 months after delivery. The information related to verbal and physical abuse, denial of care and invasive and/or inappropriate procedures. Poisson regression was used to evaluate the factors associated with one or more, and two or more, types of disrespectful treatment or abuse. Results: A total of 4275 women took part in a perinatal study. During the three-month follow-up, we interviewed 4087 biological mothers with regards to disrespect and abuse. Approximately 10% of women reported having experienced verbal abuse, 6% denial of care, 6% undesirable or inappropriate procedures and 5% physical abuse. At least one type of disrespect or abuse was reported by 18.3% of mothers (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.2-19.5); and at least two types by 5.1% (95% CI: 4.4-5.8). Women relying on the public health sector, and those whose childbirths were via cesarean section with previous labor, had the highest risk, with approximately a three-and two-fold increase in risk, respectively. Conclusions: Our study showed that the occurrence of disrespect and abuse during childbirth was high and mostly associated with payment by the public sector and labor before delivery. The efforts made by civil society, governments and international organizations are not sufficient to restrain institutional violence against women during childbirth. To eradicate this problem, it is essential to 1) implement policies and actions specific for this type of violence and 2) formulate laws to promote the equality of rights between women and men, with particular emphasis on the economic rights of women and the promotion of gender equality in terms of access to jobs and education.

The last decade has seen a global spread of AHC models and a growing interest in the role of AHCs in addressing health system equity. The purpose of this paper is to synthesise and critically appraise the evidence on the role of AHCs in improving health equity. Design/methodology/approach Peer-reviewed and grey literature published in English between 2000 and 2016 were searched. Articles that identified AHCs as the primary unit of analysis and that also addressed health equity concepts in relation to the AHC's activity or role were included. Findings In total, 103 publications met the inclusion criteria of which 80 per cent were expert opinion. Eight descriptive themes were identified through which health equity concepts in relation to AHCs were characterised, described and operationalised: population health, addressing health disparities, social determinants of health, community engagement, global health, health system reform, value-based and accountable financing models, and role clarification/recalibration. There was consensus that AHCs can and should address health disparities, but there is a lack of empirical evidence to show that AHCs have a capacity to contribute to health equity goals or are demonstrating this contribution. Originality/value This review highlights the relevance of health equity concepts in discussions about the role and missions of AHCs. Future research should improve the quality of the evidence base by empirically examining health equity strategies and interventions of AHCs in multiple countries and contexts.

The spatial distribution pattern of the cancer incidence was estimated using the Global Moran's index. The association between environmental health indicators and cancer incidence was evaluated by multiple regression. From 2009 to 2012, 1261 new cases of cancer were diagnosed in patients younger than 20 years old in the state of Pernambuco. Leukemia/lymphoma were the most common type of cancer contemplating 45.28% of the cases. The average age-adjusted incidence rate was 113 cases per million with no spatial distribution pattern. The municipalities were clustered according to their degree of inequality (P = 0.017), human development index (P = 0.001), population growth rate (P = 0.008), urbanization level (P = 0.001), number of agricultural crops per capita (P = 0.001), and number of industries per capita (P = 0.030). However, only urbanization level was positive correlated with incidence of pediatric cancer (P = 0.009) likely because in more developed cities, people are more exposed to potential oncogenic factors, such as air and water pollution and processed and ultraprocessed food. The better access to specialized health services, which increases the chances of early diagnosis, may also contributes for a higher number of cases in more developed cities.	[Bastos, Lidia N.

There are four values of CNHGP for healthcare reform. First, these principles provide an innovative strategic framework for healthcare reform with three levels, from 'One priority population' to 'Four approaches' and then to 'Two aims.' The second is the importance of mass/grassroots participation, which runs through all three levels of CNHGP. The third value is that the CNHGP used nonspecific social approaches, an innovation in healthcare delivery that addressed the social determinants of health. The fourth value is the integration between Chinese traditional medicine and Western medicine.

J	Arpad, T				Arpad, Todor			Strengthening civil society beyond the 'assistance-for-democratization' era. Lessons from Romania	ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						NGO; Romania; funding; democratization	EAST-CENTRAL-EUROPE; STATE; NGOS; ACCESSION; DEMOCRACY	This article investigates the puzzling observation that, despite the vigorous mass protests that have taken place since 2012 and mobilized Romanian civil society against attempts to implement unpopular policies in fields such as health, environment or justice, and which have led to the fall of two cabinets, the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector suffers from structural weaknesses and has a limited capacity to systematically influence public policies, especially in the post-EU accession environment. This weakness has contributed to the fact that, despite the EU accession process, the quality, level of transparency and accountability of government have not significantly improved in the last decade. Based on a recent extensive survey of the NGOs involved in promoting quality of democracy, this article questions: what explains the intensity of activity and tactics of Romanian NGOs in the context of post-EU accession? Using regression analysis, I test the explanatory power of hypothesis derived from four models: the financial dependence model, the type of activism model, the cooperation with state institutions model and the network participation model. The analysis shows the waning importance of international donors, while confirming the importance of network participation and the simultaneous employment of confrontational and transaction activism. Overall, the puzzling feature of NGOs' mass protest capacity combined with their low structural influence is explained by the concentration within just a few NGOs of the capacity and interest to get involved in a wide area of activities and efficiently employ both confrontational and collaborative tactics.

Our research presents a robust impact evaluation of a biofuel investment in northern Sierra Leone. The LSAT case evaluated has been certified by the Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterial and is noted for complying with several other international guidelines. A total of 882 households were surveyed in the treatment and control areas, and asked about their livelihood structures. Statistical results show that farmers in the LSAI area have reduced their agricultural area for food production, have lower yields, and need to spend more on external labour. By contrast, the LSAI-impacted villages present a clear increase in total monetary income, a perceived improvement in food and water security, and an increase in food consumption expenditure. However, the improvement in financial income was higher for landowners than for tenants, and access to wage labour was mainly given to men rather than women, suggesting that LSAT can potentially increase local inequalities. It is therefore not possible to speak about a linear impact in this case, but more of a transformation of livelihood structures toward a more wage-dependent system. The findings also support the idea that the enforcement of international guidelines on responsible investment is necessary to mitigate the negative consequences of LSAI on local livelihoods. Further efforts must also be made along these lines to create a security net, to prevent potentially harmful consequences in the case of operations shutting down.

We examine this question, comparing domestic and international institutional activity in correlation with reproductive health policy change, specifically, abortion access policy. At the domestic level, we examine female legislators and policies set to encourage gender equality, namely, electoral gender quotas. In the international arena, our theory distinguishes regional from international inter-governmental bodies. Original data with measurement innovations introduced hereincluding the Comparative Abortion Policy Index (CAPI1 and CAPI2)are analysed for over 150 countries for close to two decades. We find a heretofore-overlooked relationship between international entities and reproductive health. Gender quotas, however, do not correspond with the general association between female representation and pro-women policy. When researchers and policy-makers consider gender quotas to promote women's rights, they may be advised to encourage female political participation through more organic means.

Social inequalities in healthcare systems persist worldwide. Physicians' prejudices and negative attitudes towards people living in poverty are one of the determinants of healthcare inequalities. We know very little about general practitioners' (GPs) perceptions of poverty, which shape their attitudes. Objective. To identify the perceptions of poverty of GPs who deal with it in everyday practice. Methods. A qualitative study based on interviews with GPs working in deprived urban neighbourhoods. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with physicians working in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Montreal, Canada. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis consisted of interview debriefing, transcript coding, and thematic analysis using an inductive and iterative approach. Results. Our study revealed two contrasting perceptions of poverty. The global conception of poverty referred to social determinants and was shared by the majority of physicians interviewed, while the moral conception, centring on individual responsibility, was shared by a minority of participants. Conclusion. The moral judgments and misunderstandings evidenced by GPs regarding poverty suggest avenues for improving general medical training. Understanding social determinants of health should be an important component of this training, to improve access to care for people living in poverty.

We analyzed three sets of social-investment policies implemented in Europe and previously hypothesized to reduce gender inequity in labor market outcomes: childcare; active labor market programs; and long-term care. Methods: We use 12 indicators of social-investment policies from the OECD Social Expenditure Database, the OECD Family Database, and the Social Policy Indicators' Parental Leave Benefit Dataset. We draw outcome data from the 2015 Global Burden of Disease for years lived with disability and all-cause mortality among men and women ages 25-54 for 18 European nations over the 1995-2010 period. We estimate 12 linear regression models each for mortality and morbidity (i.e. years lived with disability), one per social-investment indicator. All models use country fixed-effects and cluster-robust standard errors. Results: For years lived with disability, women benefit more from social investment for most indicators. The only exception is the percentage of young children in publicly funded childcare or schooling, which equally benefits men. For all-cause mortality, men benefit more or equally from social investment for most indicators, while women benefit more from government spending on direct job creation through civil employment. Conclusions: Social policy contributes to the distribution of population health. Social-investment advocates argue such policies in particular enhance economic gender equity. Our results show that these polices have ambiguous effects on gender health equity and even differential improvements among men for some outcomes.

The goals do not offer a prescriptive plan but establish levers of policy action that seek to improve the three pillars of sustainable development: society, environment, and the economy. To facilitate achieving the SDGs, it will be critical to identify context-specific opportunities and challenges for implementation. Tropical regions of the world currently host not only the highest levels of biodiversity but also some of the highest rates of urbanization and development globally. Moreover, tropical forest deforestation is a globally significant issue; it has adverse impacts on biodiversity, climate systems, and socioeconomic equality. Here, we provide a rapid overview and qualitative assessment of the academic and policy literature on development and tropical forests, using the framework of the SDGs to examine issues broadly relevant to both tropical forests and sustainable development. Our assessment gathers existing knowledge and reveals critical knowledge gaps. In doing so, we identify key synergies between SDGs and tropical forests. We also suggest potential pathways of influence to improve social, environmental, and economic conditions in these rapidly developing regions of the world.

When should governments increase the supply of psychiatric beds?	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							HOSPITAL BEDS; TIME-COURSE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CARE; HEALTH; MORTALITY; SUICIDE; CRIME; DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION; IMPROVEMENT	Low numbers of hospital-based psychiatric beds create problems for people with severe mental illness (SMI), when they face extended emergency department (ED) waits, higher thresholds for admission to an acute bed, and short revolving-door stays with high rates of rehospitalisation. Limited access to inpatient treatment has been associated with higher suicide risk, premature mortality, homelessness, violent crime and incarceration. Ultimately, people with SMI can be transinstitutionalised to the criminal justice system. In the USA, for example, prisons have replaced mental hospitals as the largest institutions housing people with SMI. There is no international consensus on the safe minimum numbers of acute, forensic and rehabilitation beds needed to reduce these risks. As a consequence, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries have wide variations in the mix of hospital beds with an average of 71 beds per 100 000 population. Policymakers face difficult choices with few studies to guide decisions on supplying beds. The UK Royal College of Psychiatrists offered a policy framework, which was adapted for Australia. The government of the State of South Australia increased the supplies of crisis, acute and forensic beds to meet a mandatory target to safely reduce mental health boarding in the EDs.

Global incidence and mortality rates in pancreatic cancer and the association with the Human Development Index: decomposition approach	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Pancreatic cancer; Incidence; Mortality; Human Development Index; Decomposition	LIFE-STYLE	Objectives: Pancreatic cancer has a lower morbidity yet higher case fatality rates (CFRs) compared with other gastrointestinal cancers. The effects of socio-economic components on pancreatic cancer rates have been acknowledged; however, the effects of the Human Development Index (HDI) inequality are not. In this study, we aimed to determine the contribution of important socio-economic components on pancreatic cancer rates using a decomposition approach. Study design: Global ecological study. Methods: Incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer were obtained for 172 countries from GLOBOCAN and the United Nations Development Program. The World Bank database was also used to obtain the HDI and its gradient for 169 countries. Inequality in pancreatic cancer age-specific incidence and mortality rates was calculated according to the HDI using the concentration index (CI). We decomposed the CI to determine main contributors of the inequality. Results: The CI for incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer in both genders according to the HDI was 0.26 (95% confidence interval: 0.21-0.30) and 0.25 (95% confidence interval: 0.21-0.30), respectively, which indicated more concentrated inequality in advantaged countries. About 80% of the inequality sources were predicted by socio-economic component in both rates of pancreatic cancer. The main contributors to inequality were the mean years of schooling, life expectancy at birth, expected years of schooling, and urbanization. Conclusion: Global inequalities exist in pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates according to the HDI; in addition, inequality was more concentrated in countries with higher score of HDI.

Multinational corporations-in particular-can benefit from an extension of empirical inquiry which looks at economic inequality in conjunction with cultural orientation in order to understand the behavior of their cross-border subsidiary employees. To this end, we report on an exploratory, multi-case study using data drawn from interviews, observation and company information with frontline, base of the organizational pyramid employees at the Thai subsidiaries of Anglo-US MNCs. Our findings detail the manifestations of high economic inequality and low worker status, as well as the adverse implications for subsidiary service delivery (e.g., absenteeism, moonlighting, deficient-communication) and broader corporate reputation concerns. We also detail the specific role of vertical-collectivist cultural norms and values in both exacerbating and mitigating the adverse effects observed. Finally, we discuss the implications for international business managers seeking to address (and prevent) subsidiary performance suppression due to economic inequality, focusing on the development of 'social embeddedness' as a key competence in the engagement and nurturing of base-of-pyramid employees in emerging Asia.

Looking behind the bars: emerging health issues for people in prison	BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN			English	Review						prison health; research; ageing; deaths in custody	PREVALENCE	There are more than 10 million people imprisoned worldwide. These individuals experience a higher burden of communicable and non-communicable disease, mental health and substance misuse problems than the general population and often come from marginalized and underserved groups in the community. Prisons offer an important opportunity for tackling health problems in a way that can deliver benefits to the individual and to the community. This paper focuses specifically on emerging health issues for prisons across the world. This paper uses sources of international data from published systematic reviews and research studies, the Ministry of Justice for England and Wales, the Prisons and Probations Ombudsmen Review and other United Kingdom government briefing papers. Deaths in custody are a key concern for the justice system as well as the health system. Suicide is the leading cause of mortality in prisons worldwide but non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, are increasing in importance in high-income countries and are now the leading cause of mortality in prisons in England and Wales. The prison population is ageing in most high-income countries. Older people in prison typically have multiple and complex medical and social care needs including reduced mobility and personal care needs as well as poor health. Further research is needed to understand the complex relationship between sentencing patterns, the ageing prison population and deaths in custody; to model its impact on prisons and healthcare provision in the future and to determine effective and cost-effective models of care. Research into the health of prisoners is important in improving the health of prisoners but there is considerable variation in quantity and quality between countries. Recent innovations seek to address this disparity and facilitate the sharing of good practice.	[Sturup-Toft, S.; O'Moore, E. J.; Plugge, E.

Sickle cell and thalassaemia are recessively inherited, potentially life-threatening haemoglobin disorders with significant variation of severity, often needing life-long treatment. I argue that the re-classification of inherited blood disorders (IBDs) under prevention and management of birth defects' by the WHO in 2010 can be read as an ethical moment within the globalising turn' of IBDs and the use of genomics in addressing structural inequalities underpinning health in low- and middle-income countries. Using an Indian case study, the paper aims at first examining the language of risk through which genes and IBDs are mapped onto pre-existing populations (e.g. caste and tribe) as discrete, categories. Second, it discusses the likely social and ethical ramifications of classifying these recessive gene disorders as essentially preventable, despite cheaply available diagnostic tests and treatment options available in most countries in the South.

The focus is on vertical equity, i.e. whether BRT systems achieve progressive benefits for poorer segments of the population. Findings from Africa, Asia, and Latin America all suggest that BRT does offer significant benefits to low-income groups, in terms of travel time and cost savings, access enhancement, and safety and health benefits. However benefits are often skewed toward medium-income users and thus less progressive than they might be. Two primary reasons for this are insufficient spatial coverage and inappropriate fare policies. While many features of BRT potentially allow it to deliver pro-poor outcomes, such outcomes only materialize if BRT implementers pay specific and sustained attention to equity. The paper identifies key issues that need to be addressed to steer BRT implementation toward more socially sustainable outcomes-including better integration with other transit, paratransit, and nonmotorized transport services, and with the housing sector.

High resolution age-structured mapping of childhood vaccination coverage in low and middle income countries	VACCINE			English	Article						Measles vaccine; Demographic and Health Surveys; Bayesian geostatistics; Coverage heterogeneities	MEASLES; AFRICA; RISK	Background :The expansion of childhood vaccination programs in low and middle income countries has been a substantial public health success story. Indicators of the performance of intervention programmes such as coverage levels and numbers covered are typically measured through national statistics or at the scale of large regions due to survey design, administrative convenience or operational limitations. These mask heterogeneities and 'coldspots' of low coverage that may allow diseases to persist, even if overall coverage is high. Hence, to decrease inequities and accelerate progress towards disease elimination goals, fine-scale variation in coverage should be better characterized. Methods: Using measles as an example, cluster-level Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data were used to map vaccination coverage at 1 km spatial resolution in Cambodia, Mozambique and Nigeria for varying age-group categories of children under five years, using Bayesian geostatistical techniques built on a suite of publicly available geospatial covariates and implemented via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Results: Measles vaccination coverage was found to be strongly predicted by just 4-5 covariates in geostatistical models, with remoteness consistently selected as a key variable. The output 1 x 1 km maps revealed significant heterogeneities within the three countries that were not captured using province-level summaries. Integration with population data showed that at the time of the surveys, few districts attained the 80% coverage, that is one component of the WHO Global Vaccine Action Plan 2020 targets. Conclusion: The elimination of vaccine-preventable diseases requires a strong evidence base to guide strategies and inform efficient use of limited resources. The approaches outlined here provide a route to moving beyond large area summaries of vaccination coverage that mask epidemiologically-important heterogeneities to detailed maps that capture subnational vulnerabilities. The output datasets are built on open data and methods, and in flexible format that can be aggregated to more operationally-relevant administrative unit levels. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Longitudinal studies of ethnicity, length of residence, and adiposity in contexts outside of the United States are lacking. Methods: Nine waves (2006-2014) of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey were analyzed (n = 20,934; 52% women; 101,717 person-year observations) using random effects modeling to assess average annual change in body mass index (BMI) by ethnic group. A second analysis used an immigrant only cohort (n = 4583; 52% women; 22,301 person-year observations) to examine BMI change by length of residence. Results: Over 9 years, mean BMI increased significantly in all ethnic and Australian-born groups, and by the final wave, mean BMI exceeded 25 kg m(-2) for all groups. Trajectories of change did not vary between groups, with the exception of slower BMI increases for North-West European men compared with Australian born. Immigrants residing in Australia for 10-19 years had significantly faster annual increases in BMI compared with long-term immigrants (>= 30 years). Conclusions: Immigrants to Australia, regardless of ethnicity, are at risk of obesity over time. Obesity prevention policy should prioritize immigrants in the early-mid settlement period.

World Kidney Day and International Women's Day in 2018 coincide, thus offering an opportunity to reflect on the importance of women's health and specifically their kidney health, on the community and the next generations, as well as to strive to be more curious about the unique aspects of kidney disease in women so that we may apply those learnings more broadly. Girls and women, who make up approximately 50% of the world's population, are important contributors to society and their families. Gender differences continue to exist around the world in access to education, medical care, and participation in clinical studies. Pregnancy is a unique state for women, offering an opportunity for diagnosis of kidney disease, but also a state where acute and chronic kidney diseases may manifest, and which may impact future generations with respect to kidney health. There are various autoimmune and other conditions that are more likely to have an impact on women, with profound consequences for child bearing, and on the fetus. Women have different complications on dialysis than men, and are more likely to be donors than recipients of kidney transplants. In this editorial, we focus on what we do and do not know about women, kidney health, and kidney disease, and what we might learn in the future to improve outcomes worldwide. (C) 2018 S.

Integrating Palliative Care Into Global Health Initiatives: Opportunities and Challenges	JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE NURSING			English	Article						global health; global nursing; human rights; international palliative care; social justice	NURSING-EDUCATION; ADVISORY PANEL; FUTURE; NEEDS	The landscape of global health is quickly evolving as international health care systems and nursing organizations are developing solutions to dilemmas that face the global village and planet as a whole. Nurses remain key players in advancing all major transnational initiatives. Despite admirable efforts by many governing bodies to unify globalized health improvement, palliative care as a specialty has often not been included as a priority for health research, education, practice, or policy. The purpose of this article is to identify both opportunities and challenges for nurses to integrate palliative care into established global health initiatives and the emerging professional organizational movements impacting the future development of both global and palliative nursing. Partnerships across disciplines, with policy makers, and in research, education, and practice will assist in the creation of new knowledge and in continuing to establish the evidence-based value of palliative care on a global scale.

Distributive Justice: An Ethical Priority in Global Palliative Care	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Global health; bioethics in palliative care; economics of palliative care; justice	PUBLIC-HEALTH; CHALLENGES; AFRICA; CANCER	Providing care to cancer patients in resource-poor settings often demands complex trade-offs regarding resource allocation. It is estimated that over 60% of all cancer deaths worldwide occur in low-and middle-income countries, where channels to care and appropriate symptom management interventions are overstressed or obsolete. Concepts of distributive justice underlie much of global health policy. As appetites for expanding global palliative care services increase, so do questions of fair and culturally appropriate distribution. The ethical principle of distributive justice underpins questions of resource allocation at a fundamental level. One of the most challenging concepts for health care workers immersing in cross-cultural contexts is the idea that ethics are somewhat malleable; they shape and are shaped by the unique sociopolitical, economic, intracultural, and power dynamics of a particular setting. In this article, we use the case of a young woman diagnosed with terminal cancer in an underserved community in rural Uganda to illustrate the conflicting concepts of fairness, which dictate distribution of scarce resources in low-and middle-income countries. Notions of distributive justice vary across cultural, societal, and even individual norms, with some definitions allowing for discrimination based on merit or need. Resource allocation in the absence of cultural humility or a genuine willingness to understand decision-making priorities in a given culture can contribute to inequity and may have harmful consequences.

J	Hodes, R; Morrell, R				Hodes, Rebecca; Morrell, Robert			Incursions from the epicentre: Southern theory, social science, and the global HIV research domain	AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH			English	Article						global HIV domain; knowledge production; social science; South Africa; Southern theory	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; GOOGLE-SCHOLAR; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; AIDS ACTIVISM; WOMEN; TRANSMISSION; HIV/AIDS; MEN; PREVALENCE; RESISTANCE	Research about HIV constitutes a global domain of academic knowledge. The patterns that structure this domain reflect inequalities in the production and dissemination of knowledge, as well as broader inequalities in geopolitics. Conventional metrics for assessing the value and impact of academic research reveal that Northern research remains dominant, while Southern research remains peripheral. Southern theory provides a framework for greater critical engagement with knowledge produced by researchers within the global South. With a focus on HIV social science, we show that investigators working in and from Africa have produced and disseminated knowledge fundamental to the global domain of HIV research, and argue that their epistemological contribution may be understood within the framework of Southern theory. Through repurposing a bibliometrical measure of citation count, we constitute a new archive of highly cited social science research. With a focus on South Africa, we situate this archive within changing historical contexts, connecting research findings to developments in medicine, health sciences and politics. We focus on two key themes in the evolution of HIV knowledge: (1) the significance of context and locality - the setting of HIV research; and (2) sex, race and risk - changing ideas about the social determinants of HIV transmission.

Associations between methadone maintenance treatment and crime: a 17-year longitudinal cohort study of Canadian provincial offenders	ADDICTION			English	Article						Crime; methadone; methadone maintenance treatment; MMT; offenders; substitution treatment	RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; ILLICIT DRUG-USE; OPIOID DEPENDENCE; GLOBAL BURDEN; FOLLOW-UP; BUPRENORPHINE; CONVICTIONS; RECIDIVISM; RETENTION; INCARCERATION	Aims To estimate and test the difference in rates of violent and non-violent crime during medicated and non-medicated methadone treatment episodes. Design, Setting and Participants The study involved linkage of population level administrative data (health and justice) for all individuals (n = 14 530) in British Columbia, Canada with a history of conviction and who filled a methadone prescription between 1 January 1998 and 31 March 2015. Methadone maintenance treatment was the primary independent variable and was treated as a time-varying exposure. Each participant's follow-up (mean: 8 years) was divided into medicated (methadone was dispensed) and non-medicated (methadone was not dispensed) periods with mean durations of 3.3 and 4.6 years, respectively. Measurements Socio-demographics of participants were examined along with the main outcomes of violent and non-violent offences. Findings During the first 2 years of treatment (<= 2.0 years), periods in which methadone was dispensed were associated with a 33% lower rate of violent crime [0.67 adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.59, 0.76] and a 35% lower rate of nonviolent crime (0.65 AHR, 95% CI = 0.62, 0.69) compared with non-medicated periods. This equates to a risk difference of 3.6 (95% CI = 2.6, 4.4) and 37.2 (95% CI = 33.0, 40.4) fewer violent and non-violent offences per 100 person-years, respectively. Significant but smaller protective effects of dispensed methadone were observed across longer treatment intervals (2.0 to <= 5.0 years, 5.0 to <= 10.0 years). Conclusions Among a cohort of Canadian offenders, rates of violent and non-violent offending were lower during periods when individuals were dispensed methadone compared with periods in which they were not dispensed methadone.

Universal insurance and an equal access healthcare system eliminate disparities for Black patients after traumatic injury	SURGERY			English	Article							ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; RACIAL DISPARITIES; UNITED-STATES; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; RISK-FACTORS; OUTCOMES; RACE; MORTALITY; SURGERY; ASSOCIATION	Background. Although inequities in trauma care are reported widely, some groups have theorized that universal health insurance would decrease disparities in care for disadvantaged minorities after a traumatic injury. We sought to examine the presence of racial disparities in outcomes and healthcare utilization at 30- and 90-days after discharge in this universally insured, racially diverse, American population treated for traumatic injuries. Methods. This work studied adult beneficiaries of TRICARE treated at both military and civilian trauma centers 2006-2014. We included patients with an inpatient trauma encounter based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) code. The mechanism and severity of injury, medical comorbidities, region and environment of care, and demographic factors were used as covariates. Race was considered the main predictor variable with Black patients compared to Whites. Logistic regression models were employed to assess for risk-adjusted differences in 30-and 90-day outcomes between Blacks and Whites. Results. A total of 87,112 patients met the inclusion criteria. Traditionally encountered disparities for Black patients after trauma, including increased rates of mortality, were absent. We found a statistically significant decrease in the odds of 90-day complications for Blacks (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84-0.98; P= 0.01). Blacks also had lesser odds of readmission at 30-days (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.94; P= 0.002) and 90 days (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.79-0.93; P < 0.001). Conclusion. Our findings support the idea that in a universally insured, equal access system, historic disparities for racial and ethnic minorities, including increased postinjury morbidity, hospital readmission, and postdischarge healthcare utilization, are decreased or even eliminated.

Fostering equity and wellbeing through water: A reinterpretation of the goal of securing access	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Water; Development; Access; Wellbeing; Rights; Equity	MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS; HYDROSOCIAL CYCLE; URBAN SANITATION; PARTICIPATION; GOVERNANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; POVERTY; SLUMS	Current approaches to the development of water services such as water supply, sanitation, and hygiene in the Global South are driven by the aim to secure people's rights to access such services. In this literature based paper, we illustrate how such an interpretation of access limits the ability of development efforts in the sector to (i) address power inequities mediating access to water services, and; (ii) acknowledge and strengthen wellbeing factors implicated with water services beyond basic health. We argue that maintaining the current interpretation of access limits the ability of development initiatives in the water sector to address pressing issues mediating people's ability to benefit from water services. To address these limitations, we propose a reinterpretation of the goal of securing access in international development frameworks grounded in Ribot and Peluso's (2003) theory of access and Amartya Sen's (1999, 2008, 2013) Capability Approach to human development. Such a reinterpretation strengthens the capacity of global efforts to improve water services to not only foster good health, but also address inequity and other dimensions of human wellbeing such as livelihoods and education.

In 2015, heart disease accounted for approximately 630,000 deaths, representing one in four deaths in the United States. Although heart disease death rates decreased 68% for the total population from 1968 to 2015, marked disparities in decreases exist by race and state. Period Covered: 1968-2015. Description of System: The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) data on deaths in the United States were abstracted for heart disease using diagnosis codes from the eighth, ninth, and tenth revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10) for 1968-2015. Population estimates were obtained from NVSS files. National and state-specific heart disease death rates for the total population and by race for adults aged >= 35 years were calculated for 1968-2015. National and state-specific black-white heart disease mortality ratios also were calculated. Death rates were age standardized to the 2000 U.S. standard population. Joinpoint regression was used to perform time trend analyses. Results: From 1968 to 2015, heart disease death rates decreased for the total U.S. population among adults aged >= 35 years, from 1,034.5 to 327.2 per 100,000 population, respectively, with variations in the magnitude of decreases by race and state. Rates decreased for the total population an average of 2.4% per year, with greater average decreases among whites (2.4% per year) than blacks (2.2% per year). At the national level, heart disease death rates for blacks and whites were similar at the start of the study period (1968) but began to diverge in the late 1970s, when rates for blacks plateaued while rates for whites continued to decrease. Heart disease death rates among blacks remained higher than among whites for the remainder of the study period. Nationwide, the black-white ratio of heart disease death rates increased from 1.04 in 1968 to 1.21 in 2015, with large increases occurring during the 1970s and 1980s followed by small but steady increases until approximately 2005. Since 2005, modest decreases have occurred in the black-white ratio of heart disease death rates at the national level. The majority of states had increases in black-white mortality ratios from 1968 to 2015. The number of states with black-white mortality ratios > 1 increased from 16 (40%) to 27 (67.5%). Interpretation: Although heart disease death rates decreased both for blacks and whites from 1968 to 2015, substantial differences in decreases were found by race and state. At the national level and in most states, blacks experienced smaller decreases in heart disease death rates than whites for the majority of the period. Overall, the black-white disparity in heart disease death rates increased from 1968 to 2005, with a modest decrease from 2005 to 2015. Public Health Action: Since 1968, substantial increases have occurred in black-white disparities of heart disease death rates in the United States at the national level and in many states. These increases appear to be due to faster decreases in heart disease death rates for whites than blacks, particularly from the late 1970s until the mid-2000s. Despite modest decreases in black-white disparities at the national level since 2005, in 2015, heart disease death rates were 21% higher among blacks than among whites. This study demonstrates the use of NVSS data to conduct surveillance of heart disease death rates by race and of black-white disparities in heart disease death rates. Continued surveillance of temporal trends in heart disease death rates by race can provide valuable information to policy makers and public health practitioners working to reduce heart disease death rates both for blacks and whites and disparities between blacks and whites.

A total of 343 international medical tourists who took low invasive treatments in Taiwan were surveyed using questionnaires. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling, and the results of this work are as follows. Medical tourists felt that higher service quality led to better corporate image. The service quality and corporate image of medical institutions had positive influences on the perceived value of medical travel. Perceived value plays a significant mediating role for the relationships between various medical institution factors and behavioural intention. Furthermore, destination image can be regarded as an important moderator that facilitates the influences of medical institution factors on perceived value.

Does Walkability Contribute to Geographic Variation in Psychosocial Distress? A Spatial Analysis of 91,142 Members of the 45 and Up Study in Sydney, Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						disease mapping; geographic variation; psychosocial distress; spatial analysis; walkability	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; NEIGHBORHOOD WALKABILITY; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; SUICIDE MORTALITY; MENTAL-DISORDERS; GLOBAL BURDEN	Walkability describes the capacity of the built environment to promote walking, and has been proposed as a potential focus for community-level mental health planning. We evaluated this possibility by examining the contribution of area-level walkability to variation in psychosocial distress in a population cohort at spatial scales comparable to those used for regional planning in Sydney, Australia. Data on psychosocial distress were analysed for 91,142 respondents to the 45 and Up Study baseline survey between January 2006 and April 2009. We fit conditional auto regression models at the postal area level to obtain smoothed "disease maps" for psychosocial distress, and assess its association with area-level walkability after adjusting for individual-and area-level factors. Prevalence of psychosocial distress was 7.8%; similar for low (7.9%), low-medium (7.9%), medium-high (8.0%), and high (7.4%) walkability areas; and decreased with reducing postal area socioeconomic disadvantage: 12.2% (most), 9.3%, 7.5%, 5.9%, and 4.7% (least). Unadjusted disease maps indicated strong geographic clustering of psychosocial distress with 99.0% of excess prevalence due to unobserved and spatially structured factors, which was reduced to 55.3% in fully adjusted maps. Spatial and unstructured variance decreased by 97.3% and 39.8% after adjusting for individual-level factors, and another 2.3% and 4.2% with the inclusions of area-level factors. Excess prevalence of psychosocial distress in postal areas was attenuated in adjusted models but remained spatially structured. Postal area prevalence of high psychosocial distress is geographically clustered in Sydney, but is unrelated to postal area walkability. Area-level socioeconomic disadvantage makes a small contribution to this spatial structure; however, community-level mental health planning will likely deliver greatest benefits by focusing on individual-level contributors to disease burden and inequality associated with psychosocial distress.

J	Paakkari, L; George, S				Paakkari, Leena; George, Shanti			Ethical underpinnings for the development of health literacy in schools: ethical premises ('why'), orientations ('what') and tone ('how')	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; OBESOGENIC ENVIRONMENTS; FRAMEWORK; EDUCATION; CITIZENSHIP; INDICATORS; STRATEGIES; INEQUALITY; CHALLENGE; PROMOTION	Background: Schools are seen as crucial environments to influence and develop the health literacy of new generations, but without sufficient reflection on the ethical underpinnings of intentions and interventions around health literacy. In contrast, we argue here that ethics are fundamental to all education. The article adopts a 'One world' approach that generalizes broadly across the so-called Global North and Global South. It also generalizes across various age groups among school pupils, advocating age appropriate application of the arguments advanced. Main text: Our analysis examines why health literacy should be promoted in schools and argues that the purpose should embrace the values of social justice and should not stop at individual and national cost benefit analysis. Discussion about the orientation of health literacy highlights meta-cognitive skills around critical thinking, self-awareness and citizenship rather than lists of practical skills. Finally, approaches to health literacy in classrooms are presented with an ethical tone that draws attention to the power relations responsible for health inequities and that does not assume that such power relations are the given framework for health literacy interventions and activities. These arguments are reinforced by urging that related debates address dynamic social realities such as international migration. Conclusions: We reiterate the need for ethical questions to be consciously and systematically addressed from early on, beginning with intentions to promote health literacy even before these intentions are translated into action, within the political space where education meets public health and health promotion. We underline again the context of fluidity and dynamism, as new challenges emerge within pedagogies and curricula, especially in response to changing populations in the society around.

Objective The purpose of this study is to present the newly developed French National Authority for Health (HAS) guidelines on budget impact analysis as follows: process, literature review, recommendations and comparisons with other guidelines. Methods The development process of the HAS guidelines included a literature review (search dates: January 2000 to June 2016), a retrospective investigation of BIA previously submitted to HAS, a public consultation, international expert reviews and approval from the HAS Board and the Economic and Public Health Evaluation Committee of HAS. Results Documents identified in the literature review included 12 national guidelines, 5 recommendations for good practices developed by national and international society of health economics and 14 methodological publications including recommendations for conducting BIA. Based on its research findings, HAS developed its first BIA guidelines, which include recommendations on the following topics: BIA definition, perspective, populations, time horizon, compared scenarios, budget impact models, costing, discounting, choice of clinical data, reporting of results and uncertainty exploration. Conclusion It is expected that the HAS BIA guidelines will enhance the usefulness, quality and transparency of BIA submitted by drug manufacturers to HAS. BIA is becoming an essential part of a comprehensive economic assessment of healthcare interventions in France, which also includes cost-effectiveness analysis and equity of access to healthcare.

A social-geographical framework	HEALTH & PLACE			English	Article						Volunteering; Development; Global health; Socio-geographic theory; IVHNs	MEDICAL GEOGRAPHY; PLACE; WORK; CARE; INEQUALITIES; SCIENCE; SECURITY; ILLNESS; LIFE	Trans-national medicine, historically associated with colonial politics, is now central to discourses of global health and development, thrust into mainstream media by catastrophic events (earthquakes, disease epidemics), and enshrined in the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals. Volunteer human-resource is an important contributor to international health-development work. International Voluntary Health Networks (IVHNs, that connect richer and poorer countries through healthcare) are situated at a meeting-point between geographies and sociologies of health. More fully developed social-geographic understandings will illuminate this area, currently dominated by instrumental health-professional perspectives. The challenge we address is to produce a geographically and sociologically-robust conceptual framework that appropriately recognises IVHNs' potentials for valuable impacts, while also unlocking spaces of constructive critique. We examine the importance of the social in health geography, and geographical potentials in health sociology (focusing on professional knowledge construction, inequality and capital, and power), to highlight the mutual interests of these two fields in relation to IVHNs. We propose some socio-geographieal theories of IVHNs that do not naturalise inequality, that understand health as a form of capital, prioritise explorations of power and ethical practice, and acknowledge the more-than-human properties of place. This sets an agenda for theoretically-supported empirical work on IVHNs.

J	Jerneck, A				Jerneck, Anne			Taking gender seriously in climate change adaptation and sustainability science research: views from feminist debates and sub-Saharan small-scale agriculture	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE			English	Article						Development; Distribution; Empowerment; Environment; Inequality; Poverty	WOMENS EMPOWERMENT; RESEARCH AGENDA; FOOD SECURITY; VULNERABILITY; ENVIRONMENT; RESILIENCE; POVERTY; JUSTICE; POLICY; CHALLENGES	People, places, and production contributing the least to climate change will suffer the most. This calls for adaptation as a key climate change response. But adaptation is surrounded by problems. Finance is uncertain and fragmented, mainstreaming into development is complicated, and technical solutions often overshadow existing social relations and institutions. From a gender perspective, and as a critical research initiative to support the building of sustainability science as an umbrella field, this article raises three pertinent questions on adaptation in the global South: what is its purpose, how can development inform it, and what institutions in terms of rights and responsibilities are core to it? Focusing on sub-Saharan small-scale agriculture, three main points emerge. Regarding the purpose, adaptation should be a transformative pathway out of poverty, ill-health, and food insecurity. Regarding development, adaptation can learn from how development theory, policy, and practice have addressed women, gender, and environment in varied settings and debates. Regarding core institutions, adaptation must address gender regimes that regulate access to, use of, and control over resources, especially those defining land distribution, labour division, and strategic decision-making power. To conclude, I propose gender-informed research questions for further inquiry.

Little research has focused on the differential impact of each indicator on adolescent health, and few measures have been developed that provide a global evaluation. In this research, the relationship between classic socioeconomic indicators (education and occupation) and others that have been proposed more recently (family affluence scale and subjective family wealth) is analysed. A composite global score of socioeconomic position is also presented, based on the principal objective dimensions: parental education, parental occupation and family material wealth. Data were collected in Spain, in 2014, within the framework of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study, from a representative national sample of 8739 adolescents aged between 11 and 16 (mean = 13.72, SD = 1.71). The results contribute to resolving methodological difficulties associated with the evaluation of adolescent socioeconomic position, showing the unidimensionality of a global measure of objective wealth and demonstrating it to be a useful instrument for assessing the socioeconomic position in health inequalities research. The subjective perception of wealth presented a similar, and even higher, association with health than the objective measures. However, low correlations between perceived family wealth and the objective socioeconomic indicators (oscillating between .110 and .299) proved to measure a different construct, and thus was not included in the composite measure for assessing the adolescents' objective socioeconomic position. Results highlighted the importance of including different indicators for measuring socioeconomic inequalities in adolescent health.

Basic research design: Cross-sectional study analysing data from the National Child Measurement Programme (N=2427) and the Local Dental Health Survey (N=1425). The association of deprivation with weight status and caries was determined at individual and area level, using ANOVA and Poisson models. The overall spatial clustering was assessed using a modified version of the Global Moran's I, while clusters were located through Local Indicators of Spatial Association. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed using the variograms of the raw values. Log-linear Poisson models were fitted to assess the significance of neighbourhood characteristics on overweight/obesity and caries distribution. Results: At an individual level, deprivation was not associated with BMI z-scores but was a significant predictor of caries (p<0.05). However, at area level, deprivation related to the rates of both conditions. A significant positive autocorrelation was observed across neighbourhoods for caries. The variograms suggested spatial autocorrelations up to 2.5 km and 3 km for overweight/obesity and caries, respectively. Among several neighbourhood characteristics, the proportion of people on benefits was found to be a significant predictor of caries rates. Conclusions: Our results underline the importance of considering geographic location and characteristics of the broader environment when developing strategies to target obesity and caries.

J	Alemayehu, C; Mitchell, G; Nikles, J				Alemayehu, Chalachew; Mitchell, Geoffrey; Nikles, Jane			Barriers for conducting clinical trials in developing countries- a systematic review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Review						Barriers; Clinical trials; Developing countries	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE; HEALTH RESEARCH; CHALLENGES; CAPACITY; PARTICIPATION; AFRICA; IMPACT; ISSUES; VARY	Background: Clinical trials for identification of efficient and effective new diagnostic and treatment modalities are needed to address disproportionately high burden of communicable (e.g., HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria) and non-communicable diseases (e.g., diabetes) in developing countries. However, gross under-representation in global clinical trial platforms contributes to sustained health inequity in these countries. We reviewed the literature on barriers facing clinical researchers in developing countries for conducting clinical trials in their countries. Methods: Literature indexed in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science, WHO Global Health Library were searched. Grey literature was also searched. Search key words included barriers, challenges, clinical trials and developing countries. Articles within the scope of this review were appraised by two reviewers. Results: Ten studies, which are reported in 15 papers, were included in this review. Following critical review we identified five unifying themes for barriers. Barriers for conducting clinical trials included lack of financial and human capacity, ethical and regulatory system obstacles, lack of research environment, operational barriers and competing demands. Conclusion and recommendation: There were substantial barriers at system, organization and individual level. We propose that to address this problem, instituting a system for wider implementation of local investigator-initiated trials is warranted. These trials are more applicable to local populations because they build on local healthcare knowledge. They are more demand-led, influence policy and responsive to a country's needs because they are driven by a local or national agenda.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article								Background: In resource-constrained health systems medical travel is a common alternative to seeking unavailable health services. This paper was motivated by the need to understand better the impact of such travel on households and health systems. Methods: We used primary data from 344 subsidized and 471 non-subsidized inbound medical travellers during June to December 2013 drawn from the North, Centre and South regions of the Maldives where three international airports are located. Using a researcher-administered questionnaire to acquire data, we calculated annual out-of-pocket (OOP) spending on health, food and non-food items among households where at least one member had travelled to another country for medical care within the last year and estimated the poverty head count using household income as a living standard measure. Results: Most of the socio demographic indicators, and costs of treatment abroad among Maldivian medical travellers were similar across different household income levels with no statistical difference between subsidized and non-subsidized travellers (p value: 0.499). The government subsidy across income quintiles was also similar indicating that the Maldivian health financing structure supports equality rather than being equity-sensitive. There was no statistical difference in OOP expenditure on medical care abroad and annual OOP expenditure on healthcare was similar across income quintiles. Diseases of the circulatory system, eye and musculoskeletal system had the most impoverishing effect -diseases for which half of the patients, or less, did not receive the public subsidy. Annually, 6 and 14% of the medical travellers in the Maldives fell into poverty ($2 per day) before and after making OOP payments to health care. Conclusion: Evidence of a strong association between predominant public financing of medical travel and equality was found. With universal eligibility to the government subsidy for medical travel, utilization of treatment abroad, medical expenditures abroad and OOP expenditures on health among Maldivian medical travellers were similar between the poor and the rich. However, we conclude mixed evidence on the linkages between public financing of medical travel and impoverishment which needs to be further explored with comparison of impoverishment levels between households with and without medical travel.

Socioeconomic Inequalities Persist Despite Declining Stunting Prevalence in Low- and Middle-Income Countries	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						prevalence; rural population; socioeconomic factors; family characteristics; income; growth disorders; surveys and questionnaires	CHILD UNDERNUTRITION; NATIONAL SURVEYS; INTERVENTIONS; HEALTH	Background: Global stunting prevalence has been nearly halved between 1990 and 2016, but it remains unclear whether this decline has benefited poor and rural populations within low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Objective: We assessed time trends in stunting among children < 5 y of age (under-5) according to household wealth and place of residence in 67 LMICs. Methods: Stunting prevalence was analyzed in 217 nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys from 67 countries with >= 2 surveys between 1993 and 2014. National estimates were stratified by wealth and area of residence, comparing the poorest 40% with the wealthiest 60%, and those residing in urban and rural areas. Time trends were calculated for LMICs by using multilevel regression models weighted by under-5 population, with stratification by wealth and by residence. Trends in absolute (slope index of inequality; SII) and relative (concentration index; CIX) inequalities were calculated. Results: Mean prevalences in 1993 were 53.7% in low-income and 48.2% in middle-income countries, with annual average linear declines of 0.76 and 0.72 percentage points (pp), respectively. Although similar slopes of declines were observed for the poorest 40% and wealthiest 60% groups in all countries (0.78 and 0.74 pp, respectively), absolute and relative inequalities increased over time in low-income countries (SII increased from -19.3% in 1993 to -23.7% in 2014 and CIX increased from -6.2% to -10.8% in the same period). In middle-income countries, socioeconomic inequalities remained stable. Overall, stunting prevalence decreased more rapidly among rural than for urban children (0.78 and 0.55 pp, respectively). Conclusions: The prevalence of stunting is decreasing. Poor-rich gaps are stable in middle-income countries and slightly increasing in low-income countries. Rural-urban inequalities are decreasing over time.	[da Silva, Inacio Crochemore M.; Franca, Giovanny V.; Barros, Aluisio J.

PREVALENCE OF HIV-RELATED ORAL MANIFESTATIONS AND THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH HAART AND CD4+T CELL COUNT: A REVIEW	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL REGULATORS AND HOMEOSTATIC AGENTS			English	Review						HIV; AIDS; HIV-related oral manifestations; HAART; CD4	INFECTED PATIENTS; LESIONS; RECONSTRUCTION; CARCINOMA; HIV/AIDS; HEALTH; FLAP; PERIODONTITIS; OSTEOSARCOMA; INEQUALITIES	HIV infection is one of the major health problem of the last decades. This disease causes a chronic infection that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). According to the Global AIDS update, released in 2016 by HIV department of World Health Organization (WHO) and by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), at the end of 2015, 36.7 million people were infected by HIV: 34.9 million of these were adults and 1.8 million were children under 15 years of age. The same report shows that during 2015, 2.1 million of new infection cases have occurred all over the world and about 1.1 million people have died for HIV. The aim of this short review is to up-date of the main HIV-related oral manifestations and their correlation with HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) and CD4+ T-cell count. Despite that more than 20 years have elapsed, this classification still remains valid: even today, group 1 lesions are found in the majority of HIV-positive patients with oral manifestations. Group 1 includes the following conditions: oral candidiasis (pseudomembranous candidiasis, erythematous candidiasis, angle cheilitis), oral hairy leukoplakia, periodontal diseases (necrotizing gingivitis, necrotizing periodontitis, linear gingival erythema), Kaposi's sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Melanotic hyperpigmentation, HSV infection and HPV infection, which are included in group 2, are also common. Oral candidiasis, oral hairy leukoplakia, Kaposi's sarcoma and HSV infection are the lesions that have seen the major drop in their incidence after the HAART introduction. The increase in CD4+ T-cell count is not significantly correlated to the decrease of every type of oral lesions, but it is statistically significant only in relation to oral candidiasis (p-value <0.001). Oral lesions are an important sign of immunodepression and with the introduction of HAART their incidence has strongly decreased, particularly in urban areas. Nevertheless, developing countries still have a high prevalence of these manifestations because of the persistence of many risk factors, like the difficulty to access treatment, poor oral hygiene, low socioeconomic status and late diagnosis.

Mental illness is pervasive in the United States, and patients with comorbid psychiatric disease experience inequities in treatment for a range of conditions. We aimed to determine whether comorbid psychiatric disease is associated with differences in IVT use in acute ischemic stroke. Methods-Acute ischemic stroke admissions between 2007 and 2011 were identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Psychiatric disease was defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for secondary diagnoses of schizophrenia or other psychoses, bipolar disorder, depression, or anxiety. Using logistic regression, we tested the association between IVT and psychiatric disease, controlling for demographic, clinical, and hospital factors. Results-Of the 325009 ischemic stroke cases meeting inclusion criteria, 12.8% had any of the specified psychiatric comorbidities. IVT was used in 3.6% of those with, and 4.4% of those without, psychiatric disease (P < 0.001). Presence of any psychiatric disease was associated with lower odds of receiving IVT (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.85). When psychiatric diagnoses were analyzed separately individuals with schizophrenia or other psychoses, anxiety, or depression each had significantly lower odds of IVT compared to individuals without psychiatric disease. Conclusions-Acute ischemic stroke patients with comorbid psychiatric disease have significantly lower odds of IVT. Understanding barriers to IVT use in such patients may help in developing interventions to increase access to evidence-based stroke care.

Traditionally, the focus on inequality in scientific publishing has focused on prestige hierarchies in established print journals. This project examines stratification in contemporary publishing with a particular focus on subscription vs. various Open Access (OA) publishing options. Findings show that authors working at lower-ranked universities are more likely to publish in closed/paywalled outlets, and less likely to choose outlets that involve some sort of Article Processing Charge (APCs; gold or hybrid OA). We also analyze institutional differences and stratification in the APC costs paid in various journals. Authors affiliated with higher-ranked institutions, as well as hospitals and non-profit organizations pay relatively higher APCs for gold and hybrid OA publications. Results suggest that authors affiliated with high-ranked universities and well-funded institutions tend to have more resources to choose pay options with publishing. Our research suggests new professional hierarchies developing in contemporary publishing, where various OA publishing options are becoming increasingly prominent. Just as there is stratification in institutional representation between different types of publishing access, there is also inequality within access types.

Governments that use HiAP face the challenge of instituting governance structures and processes to facilitate policy coordination in an evidence-informed manner. Due to the complexity of government institutions and the policy process, systems theory has been proposed as a tool for evaluating the implementation of HiAP. Methods: Our multiple case study research programme (HiAP Analysis using Realist Methods On International Case Studies - HARMONICS) has relied on systems theory and realist methods to make sense of how and why the practices of policy-makers (including politicians and civil servants) from specific institutional environments (policy sectors) has either facilitated or hindered the implementation of HiAP. Herein, we present a systems framework for the implementation of HiAP based on our experience and empirical findings in studying this process. Results: We describe a system of 14 components within three subsystems of government. Subsystems include the executive (heads of state and their appointed political elites), intersectoral (the milieu of policy-makers and experts working with governance structures related to HiAP) and intrasectoral (policy-makers within policy sectors). Here, HiAP implementation is a process involving interactions between subsystems and their components that leads to the emergence of implementation outcomes, as well as effects on the system components themselves. We also describe the influence of extra-governmental systems, including (but not limited to) the academic sector, third sector, private sector and intergovernmental sector. Finally, we present a case study that applies this framework to understand the implementation of HiAP - the Health 2015 Strategy - in Finland, from 2001 onward. Conclusions: This framework is useful for helping to explain how, why and under what circumstances HiAP has been successfully and unsuccessfully implemented in a sustainable manner. It serves as a tool for researchers to study this process, and for policy-makers and other public health actors to manage this process.

Analyses are based on the International Social Survey Programme. Data stem from 23 countries (N = 37,228) that were assigned to six welfare states. Sociodemographic, socio-economic, and health-related factors were considered as individual level characteristics. Gross domestic product, relative poverty rate, Gini coefficient, and magnitude of health inequalities were additionally introduced as macro level factors. About 47% of the respondents in all countries agreed with the statement that people suffer from severe health problems because they are poor (range 30-77%). Multilevel analyses reveal that awareness was least pronounced in Liberal, East European, and East Asian welfare regimes. Moreover, women, older adults, respondents with low education and income, as well as poor health were more likely to show awareness. There is a need to raise public awareness of the adverse health effects of poverty as the public opinion can be an important driver of political will on health and social issues.

Association between literacy and self-rated poor health in 33 high- and upper middle-income countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Literacy; Educational attainment; Self-rated poor health; Socioeconomic status; OECD; Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies	MORTALITY; OUTCOMES	To assess the relationship between general literacy proficiency and self-rated poor health by analyzing data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies, an international survey conducted from 2011 to 2015 in 33 high- and upper middle-income countries and national sub-regions. Logistic regression was used to model general literacy proficiency as a predictor of self-rated poor health. Data from 167,062 adults aged 25-65 years were analyzed. The mean overall prevalence of self-rated poor health was 24%. The odds ratio of self-rated poor health for those in the lowest level of general literacy proficiency compared to those in the highest level was 2.5 (95% CI 2.2-3.0) in the unadjusted model, and 1.9 (95% CI 1.6-2.2) in the adjusted model. This association was robust over time and across countries. General literacy proficiency attenuated 22% of the effect of self-education on self-rated poor health, in addition to a substantial independent effect of its own. Our study provides robust and generalizable evidence that general literacy proficiency is independently associated with self-rated poor health. These results offer a potential modifiable target for policy interventions to reduce educational inequities in health.

However, research with court-involved adolescents has neglected to examine the mental health of their parents, who may also have significant personal and parenting stress. This sample consisted of 144 parent-adolescent dyads. Adolescents (aged 11-17 years) identified by court officials were referred to the study to receive mental health treatment. Parents and adolescents completed surveys about their mental health diagnoses, treatment, and family relationships. Using the clinical cut-off for the global severity index of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine group differences between parents with and without significant mental health symptoms. Results indicated that 35% of parents endorsed clinically significant mental health symptoms. Parents with clinically significant symptoms, compared to those without, reported significantly greater parenting stress (p < .05), and were more likely to have received prior mental health treatment (54 vs. 25%; p < .05) and a psychiatric diagnosis (52 vs. 19%; p < .05). Our findings revealed that more than one in three parents of court-involved adolescents are currently experiencing significant mental health symptoms. Improved mental health screening and intervention that incorporates the unique needs of families is recommended, including the possible use of family-based approaches as well as individualized treatment for the parents of court-involved youth.

J	November, L; Sandall, J				November, Lucy; Sandall, Jane			'Just because she's young, it doesn't mean she has to die': exploring the contributing factors to high maternal mortality in adolescents in Eastern Freetown; a qualitative study	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Article						Sierra Leone; Adolescent; Pregnancy; Transactional sex; Abandonment; Delayed care-seeking; Maternal death; Mentoring; Blood donation	BLOOD; HEALTH; COUNTRIES	Background: In Sierra Leone, 34% of pregnancies and 40% of maternal deaths are in the adolescent population. Risks are known to be higher for younger adolescents, this being borne out by a household survey in Eastern Freetown in 2015. This current qualitative study, funded by Wellbeing of Women's international midwifery fellowship, was conducted to explore the causes of this high incidence of maternal death for younger teenagers, and to identify possible interventions to improve outcomes. Methods: This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews (n = 19) and focus groups (n = 6), with a wide range of professional and lay participants, recorded with consent. Recordings were transcribed by the first author and a Krio-speaking colleague where necessary, and Nvivo software was used to assist with theming of the data around the three main research questions. Results: Themes from discussions on vulnerability to teenage pregnancy focused on transactional sex, especially for girls living outside of their birth family. They included sex for school fees, sex with teachers for grades, sex for food and clothes, and sex to lessen the impact of the time-consuming duties of water collection and petty trading. In addition, the criminal justice system and the availability and accessibility of contraception and abortion were included within this major theme. Within the major theme of vulnerability to death once pregnant, abandonment, delayed care seeking, and being cared for by a non-parental adult were identified. Several obstetric risks were discussed by midwives, but were explicitly related to the socio-economic factors already mentioned. A cross-cutting theme throughout the data was of gendered social norms for sexual behaviour, for both boys and girls, being reinforced by significant adults such as parents and teachers. Conclusion: Findings challenge the notion that adolescent girls have the necessary agency to make straightforward choices about their sexual behaviour and contraceptive use. For girls who do become pregnant, risks are believed to be related more to stigma and abandonment than to physical maturity, leading to lack of family-based support and delayed care-seeking for antenatal and delivery care. Two potential interventions identified within the research are a mentoring scheme for the most vulnerable pregnant girls and a locally managed blood donation register. A feasibility study of a pilot mentoring scheme is currently underway, run by the first author and a local partner.

J	Schütze, S				Schuetze, Stephanie			Gender and Belonging: The Political Engagement of Mexican Migrant Leaders in Chicago	SOCIOLOGUS			English	Article						Transnational political spaces; Mexican migrant organisations; political leaders; gender roles; belonging		The article explores differences in the motivation for political engagement in a transnational context according to gender. The underlying ethnographic research reveals that the majority of Chicago's Mexican migrant leaders - male and female - are simultaneously engaged in various political and civil society organisations; they are not only members of hometown associations and Mexican political parties, but also participate in nationwide US Latino organisations, immigrant organisations, human rights organisations and even in Mexican and US government institutions. In the article the political trajectories of four Mexican migrant leaders from Chicago are presented in short biographical portraits. The biographical approach shows the difference in life experience that formed these male and female leaders. For the men the motivation to become politically engaged is rooted in the sentiment of belonging to and being recognised in a community of origin. Therefore, male migrant leaders are deeply involved in community politics in Mexico. The motivation of the female leaders presented here is different: for them the recognition in their community and country of origin is not as important as it is for the men. Their political motivation is based much more on the feeling of belonging to the migrant community in Chicago and on improving their living conditions in the United States. Their concerns are fair conditions in everyday life in the United States - in education, health care and at work, as well as in terms of immigration status or with respect to gender equality in migrant organisations.

International variability in 20 m shuttle run performance in children and youth: who are the fittest from a 50-country comparison? A systematic literature review with pooling of aggregate results	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Review							BODY-MASS INDEX; VIGOROUS PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; ENGLISH CHILDREN; AEROBIC FITNESS; PRIMARY SCHOOLCHILDREN; CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK; ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL; ADOLESCENT HEALTH	Objectives To describe and compare 20 m shuttle run test (20mSRT) performance among children and youth across 50 countries; to explore broad socioeconomic indicators that correlate with 20mSRT performance in children and youth across countries and to evaluate the utility of the 20mSRT as an international population health indicator for children and youth. Methods A systematic review was undertaken to identify papers that explicitly reported descriptive 20mSRT (with 1-min stages) data on apparently healthy 9-17 year-olds. Descriptive data were standardised to running speed (km/h) at the last completed stage. Country-specific 20mSRT performance indices were calculated as population-weighted mean z-scores relative to all children of the same age and sex from all countries. Countries were categorised into developed and developing groups based on the Human Development Index, and a correlational analysis was performed to describe the association between country-specific performance indices and broad socioeconomic indicators using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results Performance indices were calculated for 50 countries using collated data on 1 142 026 children and youth aged 9-17 years. The best performing countries were from Africa and Central-Northern Europe. Countries from South America were consistently among the worst performing countries. Country-specific income inequality (Gini index) was a strong negative correlate of the performance index across all 50 countries. Conclusions The pattern of variability in the performance index broadly supports the theory of a physical activity transition and income inequality as the strongest structural determinant of health in children and youth. This simple and cost-effective assessment would be a powerful tool for international population health surveillance.

These proportions are higher for minority and low-income populations. Although the relationships among traffic exposure, race, and socioeconomic status have been consistent and reproducible, they are spatially heterogeneous and there has been limited investigation into the patterns heterogeneity. Using a spatially-explicit global regression and an exploratory geographically weighted regression (GWR), we examined variation in residential exposure to traffic at regional and neighborhood scales. Race/ethnicity, income, and college attainment are our variables of interest. Consistent with prior studies, we found that minority and lower socioeconomic status are systematically linked to higher exposure to traffic. Furthermore, the GWR approach has the potential to uncover patterns of disparities at a more localized level. However, a richer set of land use variables needs to be evaluated within this framework.

Epistemic Injustice and Disability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FEMINIST APPROACHES TO BIOETHICS			English	Article						disability and epistemic injustice; epistemic exclusion; impairment; epistemic injustice and marginalized groups	DISABLED PEOPLE; HEALTH-CARE; DEAF; ATTITUDES	Epistemic injustice is the idea that social power ensures that the knowledge of some groups is excluded from the collective epistemic resources. In this paper, I argue that there are distinctive features of disabled life that, because they shape the processes through which knowledge is gathered, evaluated, judged, and disseminated, also influence the ways in which epistemic injustice is experienced by disabled people. These features include the ascription of a global epistemic incapacity to people affected by impairment. Against a background of contemporary political shifts and biotechnology innovation, the implications of epistemic injustice for disabled people are serious.

World Kidney Day and International Women's Day in 2018 coincide, thus offering an opportunity to reflect on the importance of women's health and specifically their kidney health, on the community, and the next generations, as well as to strive to be more curious about the unique aspects of kidney disease in women so that we may apply those learnings more broadly. Girls and women, who make up approximately 50% of the world's population, are important contributors to society and their families. Gender differences continue to exist around the world in access to education, medical care, and participation in clinical studies. Pregnancy is a unique state for women, offering an opportunity for diagnosis of kidney disease, but also a state where acute and chronic kidney diseases may manifest, and which may impact future generations with respect to kidney health. There are various autoimmune and other conditions that are more likely to impact women with profound consequences for child bearing, and on the fetus. Women have different complications on dialysis than men, and are more likely to be donors than recipients of kidney transplants. In this editorial, we focus on what we do and do not know about women, kidney health, and kidney disease, and what we might learn in the future to improve outcomes worldwide.

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3c is to substantially increase the health workforce in developing countries. We measured the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of community-based support (CBS) provided by lay health workers for adolescents and youth receiving ART in South Africa. MethodsA retrospective cohort study including adolescents and youth who initiated ART at 47 facilities. Previously unemployed CBS-workers provided home-based ART-related education, psychosocial support, symptom screening for opportunistic infections and support to access government grants. Outcomes were compared between participants who received CBS plus standard clinic-based care versus participants who received standard care only. Cumulative incidences of all-cause mortality and loss to follow-up (LTFU), adherence measured using medication possession ratios (MPRs), CD4 count slope, and virological suppression were analysed using multivariable Cox, competing-risks regression, generalized estimating equations and mixed-effects models over five years of ART. An expenditure approach was used to determine the incremental cost of CBS to usual care from a provider perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as annual cost per patient-loss (through death or LTFU) averted. ResultsAmongst 6706 participants included, 2100 (31.3%) received CBS. Participants who received CBS had reduced mortality, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=0.52 (95% CI: 0.37 to 0.73; p<0.0001). Cumulative LTFU was 40% lower amongst participants receiving CBS (29.9%) compared to participants without CBS (38.9%), aHR=0.60 (95% CI: 0.51 to 0.71); p<0.0001). The effectiveness of CBS in reducing attrition ranged from 42.2% after one year to 35.9% after five years. Virological suppression was similar after three years, but after five years 18.8% CBS participants versus 37.2% non-CBS participants failed to achieve viral suppression, adjusted odds ratio=0.24 (95% CI: 0.06 to 1.03). There were no significant differences in MPR or CD4 slope. The cost of CBS was US$49.5/patient/year. The incremental cost per patient-loss averted was US$600 and US$776 after one and two years, respectively. ConclusionsCBS for adolescents and youth receiving ART was associated with substantially reduced patient attrition, and is a low-cost intervention with reasonable cost-effectiveness that can aid progress towards several health, economic and equality-related SDG targets.

The link between better health and better economic performance is by now well established, and many vaccines have been shown to generate significant ROI in a classical cost-benefit framework. To our knowledge, the longer term macroeconomic benefits of improved vaccination programs have not been estimated. We modify the standard conditional convergence model to account for changes in vaccination rates across time and countries, and use the modified model to estimate the macroeconomic gains from improved vaccination rates, using the DTP vaccine as a proxy for vaccination programs generally. We find evidence to suggest economically and statistically significant and sustained increases in the GDP growth rate associated with lagged increases in vaccination rates; furthermore, we find these effects increasing over time. We find that investments of the sort made by the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization (Gavi) are linked to measurably higher DTP rates, and we estimate the returns to such investments as at least 12:1. For countries on the threshold of graduating from Gavi, these results suggest that much is at stake: reducing investment in vaccination could reverse both the public health improvements and tangible economic benefits associated with ongoing improvements in vaccination rates.

J	Domagala, A; Klich, J				Domagala, Alicja; Klich, Jacek			Planning of Polish physician workforce - Systemic inconsistencies, challenges and possible ways forward	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Health workforce; Workforce planning; Physicians; Medical; Education; Migrations	FUTURE; EFFICIENCY; EQUITY; SERVICE; ISSUES	Background: Poland has the lowest number of physicians per 1000 population (2.2/1000) in the EU. This is accompanied by a considerable migration rate of Polish physicians to other EU countries (estimated at above 7%). Among other consequences, this results in waiting lists and unmet health needs. Objective: The aim of this article is an identification of the main challenges for physician workforce planning in Poland. Methods: The authors analysed national and international documents, reports, official statements, publications and statistical databases. Main findings: In Poland health workforce planning is inadequate and insufficient. There is no formal structure and no strategy regarding human resource planning or regular forecasts for the health workforce, which results in many negative effects for the healthcare system. Currently the shortage of physicians in some specialties is becoming one of the most important reasons for limited access to care and lengthening the average wait time. Conclusions: To improve this situation operational and strategic actions should be undertaken without unnecessary delay. Effective and close cooperation between key stakeholders is needed. Health workforce planning needs to become one of the key building blocks of the Polish health system's reforms, strongly connected to the other functions of the health system. It is essential for Poland to follow available good practices in health workforce planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Toward this audacious egalitarian and humanitarian goal, the Ministry of Health worked with partners to develop palliative care policies and a strategic plan, secure adequate supplies of opioid for the country, initiate palliative care training programs, and begin studying a model for integrating coordinated palliative care into the public health care system at all levels. It also initiated training of a new cadre of home-based care practitioners to provide palliative care in the home. Based on these developments, the goal appears within reach.

J	Powell, LJ; Wittman, H				Powell, Lisa Jordan; Wittman, Hannah			Farm to school in British Columbia: mobilizing food literacy for food sovereignty	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						Food sovereignty; Food literacy; Farm to school	TO-SCHOOL; PROGRAMS; CONSUMPTION; MOVEMENTS; MOTIVATIONS; PROCUREMENT; EDUCATION; ACCESS; SYSTEM	Farm to school programs have been positioned as interventions that can support goals of the global food sovereignty movement, including strengthening local food production systems, improving food access and food justice for urban populations, and reducing distancing between producers and consumers. However, there has been little assessment of how and to what extent farm to school programs can actually function as a mechanism leading to the achievement of food sovereignty. As implemented in North America, farm to school programs encompass activities not only related to school food procurement, but also to the development of student knowledge and skills under the framework of food literacy. Research on farm to school initiatives has largely been conducted in countries with government-supported national school feeding programs; this study examines farm to school organizing in Canada, where there is no national student nutrition program. Using qualitative fieldwork and document analysis, we investigate the farm to school movement in British Columbia, in a context where civil society concerns related to education and health have been the main vectors of farm to school mobilization. Our analysis suggests that, despite limited institutional infrastructure for school meals, the British Columbia farm to school movement has contributed toward realizing goals of food sovereignty through two main mechanisms: advocacy for institutional procurement of local and sustainable foods and mobilizing food literacy for increased public engagement with issues of social justice and equity in food systems.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of contextual and individual factors with the utilisation of dental services by Brazilian adults using the Andersen's behavioural model. Methods Individual-level data from 27,017 adults residents in the State capitals who were interviewed in the 2013 Brazilian National Health Survey were pooled with contextual city-level data. The outcomes were non-utilisation of dental services and last dental visit over 12 months ago. Individual predisposing variables were age, sex, race/skin colour, schooling and social network. Individual enabling variables included income, health insurance and registration in primary health care. Individual need variables were self-perceived dental health and self reported missing teeth. Multilevel logistic regression models were performed to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% Cls) of the association of contextual and individual predisposing, enabling and need-related variables with dental services outcomes. Results Predisposing (OR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.81-0.97) and enabling (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.85-0.96) contextual factors were associated with non-utilisation of dental services. Individual predisposing (sex, race/skin colour, schooling), enabling (income, health insurance) and need (self-perceived oral health, missing teeth) were associated with non-utilisation of dental services and last dental visit over 12 months ago. The latter was also associated with other individual predisposing (age, social network) and need (eating difficulties due to oral problems) characteristics. Conclusions Individual and contextual determinants influenced dental services utilisation in Brazilian adults. These factors should be on the policy agenda and considered in the organisation of health services aiming to reduce oral health inequalities related to access and utilisation of dental services.

J	Diego-Rosell, P; Tortora, R; Bird, J				Diego-Rosell, Pablo; Tortora, Robert; Bird, James			International Determinants of Subjective Well-Being: Living in a Subjectively Material World	JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES			English	Article						Subjective well-being; Life evaluation; Experienced well-being; International differences; World Poll	HAPPINESS; HAPPY; HEALTH; INCOME; LIFE	Researchers, policymakers, and the general public increasingly agree on the importance of subjective well-being as an indicator of individual and societal welfare. A vast literature has emerged over the last twenty years documenting the many variables that influence subjective well-being. The purpose of this study is to quantify the relative importance of these determinants in an attempt to synthesize the main strands in the literature and inform policy formulations. We use in our analysis three years' worth of data from the Gallup World Poll, including 153 countries and ten geopolitical regions. We estimate the relative importance of four major domains of subjective well-being using a basic model with 25 independent variables, and a broader set of seven domains using an extended model with 60 independent variables. Our results show that material well-being is the main determinant of subjective well-being across all ten geopolitical regions. A particularly strong determinant of subjective well-being in our study is feelings about household income, whereas community functioning, governance and altruistic behaviors have a relatively low importance. Our results suggest that subjective material well-being and its objective determinants, including economic growth and income inequality, should remain at the center of the research and policy agenda. Further research is recommended to ascertain the relative importance of social, physical and purpose well-being.

Association Between Socioeconomic Status and Access to Care and Quitting Smoking With and Without Assistance	NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO CONTROL; CESSATION TREATMENTS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; UNITED-STATES; POPULATION; SMOKERS; HEALTH; RELAPSE; INEQUALITIES; ABSTINENCE	Introduction: Socio-economic disparities in smoking rates persist, in Ontario, despite public health care and universal tobacco control policies. Mechanisms for continuing disparities are not fully understood. Unequal access or utilization of assistance for cessation may contribute. The objective of this research was to use longitudinal data on smokers to examine the associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and access to care measures and assisted and unassisted quit attempts. Methods: Data were taken from 3578 smokers with at least one follow-up interview participating in the Ontario Tobacco Survey (OTS). Multinomial regression models with imputed missing values were run for each measure of SES and access to care to assess the association with quitting behavior and use of assistance, unadjusted and while adjusting for smoking history and demographic covariates. Results: Adjusted analyses found smokers living in areas with the lowest ethnic concentration were more likely to make an assisted quit attempt compared to unassisted quitting (RR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.08-2.50) or making no quit attempt (RR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.15-2.37). Smokers who reported visiting a doctor in the previous 6 months were more likely to quit with assistance versus unassisted compared to those not visiting a doctor, whether they were advised (RR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.43-2.48) or not advised to quit (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.01-1.74). Similar results were seen when comparing assisted quit attempts with no quit attempts. Conclusions: Adjusted analyses showed that quitting with assistance was unrelated to measures of SES except ethnic concentration. Physician intervention with patients who smoke is important for increasing assisted quit attempts. Implications: For most measures of SES there were no significant associations with either assisted or unassisted quitting adjusting for demographic and smoking history. Smokers who live in areas with the lowest ethnic concentration were most likely to use assistance as were smokers who visited their doctor and were advised to quit smoking. Interventions to increase the delivery of effective quitting methods in smokers living in areas with high ethnic concentrations and to increase physician compliance with asking and advising patients to quit may increase assisted quit attempts.

Overall mortality of Canadian Armed Forces personnel enrolled 1976-2012	OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD			English	Article						Longitudinal studies; military; mortality; occupational health; veterans	ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY; PERSIAN-GULF-WAR; US VETERANS; INCOME INEQUALITY; MILITARY SERVICE; HEALTH; RISK	Military personnel may be exposed to hazardous substances or environments, making health surveillance critical. However, surveillance is frequently handicapped by long lag times between exposure(s) and outcomes, which often manifest post-military release and are often not recorded. To describe the burden of mortality in still serving and released Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel. The Canadian Forces Cancer and Mortality Study II (CF CAMS II) is an interdepartmental record linkage study using CAF pay data and Statistics Canada cancer and mortality data. The cohort included all Regular Force and class C Reservist men and women who first enrolled in the CAF between 1976 and 2012, inclusive. The anonymized linked data included death data, including cause and location of death. All-cause mortality (ACM) and International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 chapter-level mortality (CLM) were quantified using standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), with the Canadian general population (CGP) as the reference population. Approximately 6870 deaths occurred during over 5 million person-years of observations. For ACM, the CAF risk of death was significantly lower than the CGP for both sexes (females: n = 540, SMR = 0.76 [95% CI 0.69-0.82]; males: n = 6330, SMR = 0.79 [95% CI 0.77-0.81]). In the CLM analysis, SMRs were significantly lower than, or not statistically different from, 1.0 for all ICD chapters. Military service may have a protective effect that may be partly explained by the healthy soldier effect and the stringent selection process at enrolment.

Specifically, few studies have focused on the low-income population (LIP). Methods: A nationwide prospective study based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance dataset was conducted during 2003-2012. The International Classification of ICD-9-CM procedure codes 51.2 and 51.21-51.24 were identified as the inclusion criteria for cholecystectomy. Temporal trends were analyzed using a joinpoint regression, and the hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) method was used as an analytical strategy to evaluate the group-level and individual-level factors. Interactions between age, gender and SES were also tested in HLM model. Results: Analyses were conducted on 225,558 patients. The incidence rates were 167.81 (95% CI: 159.78-175.83) per 100,000 individuals per year for the LIP and 123.24 (95% CI: 116.37-130.12) per 100,000 individuals per year for the general population (GP). After cholecystectomy, LIP patients showed higher rates of 30-day mortality, in-hospital complications, and readmission for complications, but a lower rate of routine discharge than GP patients. The hospital costs and length of stay for LIP patients were higher than those for GP patients. The multilevel analysis using HLM revealed that adverse socioeconomic status significantly negatively affects the outcomes of patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Additionally, male sex, advanced age, and high Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores were associated with higher rates of in-hospital complications and 30-day mortality. We also observed that the 30-day mortality rates for patients who underwent cholecystectomy in regional hospitals and district hospitals were significantly higher than those of patients receiving care in a medical center. Conclusion: Patients with a disadvantaged finance status appeared to be more vulnerable to cholecystectomy surgery. This result suggested that further interventions in the health care system are necessary to reduce this disparity.

J	Sarkin, J				Sarkin, Jeremy			A Methodology to Ensure that States Adequately Apply Due Diligence Standards and Processes to Significantly Impact Levels of Violence Against Women Around the World	HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY			English	Article							INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; HUMAN-RIGHTS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE; GENDER EQUALITY; HEALTH; DISCRIMINATION; PREVALENCE; EUROPE; CONVENTION	This article argues that until there are adequate processes in states around the world to accurately know the circumstances concerning discrimination and violence against women (VAW), and that until states are held accountable to deal with those circumstances, little will change to deal with the extensive problems that exist around the world. Due diligence processes can play a positive role in this regard. The article reviews the extent of gender discrimination and VAW globally. It examines the instruments and documents relating to non-discrimination and VAW, and argues that despite a tremendous number of such tools, VAW problems remain at extremely high levels. The article explores what constitutes discrimination against women and VAW, and the relationship between the two. It examines what due diligence is, why it is useful, what some of the issues concerning it are, and where it is found in international law. The provisions of various treaties that affect VAW, and specifically those that have due diligence provisions are examined, as well as how due diligence has been applied by some human rights bodies to determine how due diligence can be more regularly and usefully applied. Recommendations are made on how to practically bring about a reduction in violence against women and specifically how due diligence can assist in this regard. It is contended that a 7P response is needed (i.e. seven steps that all have a word beginning with the letter P designating what needs to be done by states) to deal with VAW. These are: (1) prevention, (2) protection against, (3) promoting awareness and adherence to non-discrimination and no VAW, (4) probing, (5) prosecuting, (6) punishing, and (7) providing redress for acts of violence against women. A key issue, noted by the article, is to ensure that due diligence becomes a more useful tool for there to be the regular collection of relevant, timely, coordinated, and accurate disaggregated data on all matters that affects VAW in states globally. For more information to be known and for problems are identified, data collected should not just be national totals, but also broken down by region and locality in all countries. The article argues that a universal process and oversight mechanism is needed to ensure that more states comply with a due diligence approach so that real measurable change can occur for women in all parts of the world. Violence against women remains pervasive, estimated to affect one in three women globally. We continue to witness, in the name of perceived honour, beauty, purity and tradition, girls and women are subject to "honor" killings, child marriages, and female genital mutilation. Too many women are being deprived of their sexual and reproductive health and rights, fundamental human rights of women.(1)	[Sarkin, Jeremy] Univ South Africa UNISA, Law, Pretoria, South Africa; [Sarkin, Jeremy] NOVA Univ Lisbon, Law Sch, Law, Lisbon, Portugal; [Sarkin, Jeremy] NOVA Univ Lisbon, CEDIS, Lisbon, Portugal	University of South Africa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa	Sarkin, J (corresponding author), Univ South Africa UNISA, Law, Pretoria, South Africa.; Sarkin, J (corresponding author), NOVA Univ Lisbon, Law Sch, Law, Lisbon, Portugal.; Sarkin, J (corresponding author), NOVA Univ Lisbon, CEDIS, Lisbon, Portugal.

Leprosy and poverty are closely associated, and therefore the economic burden of leprosy is a concern. However, evidence on patient's expenditure is scarce. In this study, we estimate the expenditure in primary care (outpatient) by leprosy households in two different public health settings. Methodology/Principal findings We performed a cross-sectional study, comparing the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli with the Umbergaon block of Valsad, Gujrat, India. A household (HH) survey was conducted between May and October, 2016. We calculated direct and indirect expenditure by zero inflated negative binomial and negative binomial regression. The sampled households were comparable on socioeconomic indicators. The mean direct expenditure was USD 6.5 (95% CI: 2.4-17.9) in Dadra and Nagar Haveli and USD 5.4 (95% CI: 3.8-7.9) per visit in Umbergaon. The mean indirect expenditure was USD 8.7 (95% CI: 7.2-10.6) in Dadra and Nagar Haveli and USD 12.4 (95% CI: 7.0-21.9) in Umbergaon. The age of the leprosy patients and type of health facilities were the major predictors of total expenditure on leprosy primary care. The higher the age, the higher the expenditure at both sites. The private facilities are more expensive than the government facilities at both sites. If the public health system is enhanced, government facilities are the first preference for patients. Conclusions/Significance An enhanced public health system reduces the patient's expenditure and improves the health seeking behaviour. We recommend investing in health system strengthening to reduce the economic burden of leprosy.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						cycling; walking; commuting; physical activity; social inequalities in health	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS; LEISURE-TIME; ADULTS; ASSOCIATIONS; ENVIRONMENTS; TRANSPORT; CURITIBA; WORK	Purpose: To analyze the factors associated with commuting by bicycling and walking in adult participants from ELSA-Brasil (Longitudinal Study of Adult Health). Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Six teaching/research institutions throughout Brazil. Participants: A total of 15 105 civil servants. Measures: Commuting by bicycling and walking was analyzed using the long-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Analysis: A hierarchical model containing possible factors associated with commuting by bicycling and walking was constructed. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Considering the 2 forms of commuting, 66% of the participants were being considered inactive or insufficiently active. In women, being "heavier," feeling unsafe practicing physical activity, and being a former smoker were factors negatively associated with commuting by bicycling and walking. In men, active commuting was less common among those who were overweight or had abdominal obesity, those with a negative perception of safety, and those reporting that there was nowhere suitable in the neighborhood to practice physical activity. Conclusion: Obesity and negative perceptions in the neighborhood are associated with inactive or insufficiently active commuting. The relevance of this finding for public health is reinforce developing policies aimed at promoting health in Brazil and in other countries with similar characteristics.

This study analyzed 2859 counties using the average shortest distance traveled from settlements to medical facilities to calculate spatial accessibility. The Theil index at three levels (three partitions, eight economic zones and provinces) was used to assess the inequality between regions. Then, a method of spatial autocorrelation was used to assess the spatial agglomeration characteristics of spatial accessibility. To explore the underlying reasons for the imbalance in spatial accessibility, a total of eight indicators in three aspects (nature, society, and economy) were collected and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to investigate spatial heterogeneity. We observed marked disparities in spatial accessibility to medical facilities at the national level. In particular, there appears to be improved spatial accessibility and lesser regional inequality in eastern and central regions as opposed to western Chinese regions; in coastal regions instead of inland regions; and in municipalities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, but not in other provinces and autonomous regions. Besides, significant global autocorrelation and obvious clusters were revealed in a spatial pattern analysis. A wide range of hot-spot areas (clusters of poor spatial accessibility) mainly concentrated in Tibet and other areas with complex terrain and lagging social and economic development. A number of cold-spot areas (clusters of good spatial accessibility) mostly scattered in built-up areas especially municipalities and well-developed urban agglomeration such as the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Wuhan 1 + 8 city circle. Furthermore, the relationships between influencing factors and spatial accessibility were also investigated. The influence of altitude on spatial accessibility gradually decreased from the West to the East, while the influence of slope decreased from the South to the North with prominent provinces of Qinghai and Gansu. Population density exerted a higher impact on the distance in the southwest region whereas the urbanization rate influenced the northeast and southeast coastal region more intensively. In contrast, the pattern of educational level was relatively discrete. The influencing pattern of economic factors in both per area GDP and tertiary industry output share of accessibility showed apparent regional characteristics in the southeast coastal areas, as well as in the northwestern and northeastern parts. Outcomes from this study can be used to provide important information to aid policy making, while also facilitating future research aimed at improving the understanding of equality and sustainable development of medical facilities.

Access to emergency hospital care provided by the public sector in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015: a geocoded inventory and spatial analysis	LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							CONSENSUS CONFERENCE; HEALTH; COUNTRIES; MORTALITY; BURDEN	Background Timely access to emergency care can substantially reduce mortality. International benchmarks for access to emergency hospital care have been established to guide ambitions for universal health care by 2030. However, no Pan-African database of where hospitals are located exists; therefore, we aimed to complete a geocoded inventory of hospital services in Africa in relation to how populations might access these services in 2015, with focus on women of child bearing age. Methods We assembled a geocoded inventory of public hospitals across 48 countries and islands of sub-Saharan Africa, including Zanzibar, using data from various sources. We only included public hospitals with emergency services that were managed by governments at national or local levels and faith-based or non-governmental organisations. For hospital listings without geographical coordinates, we geocoded each facility using Microsoft Encarta (version 2009), Google Earth (version 7.3), Geonames, Fallingrain, OpenStreetMap, and other national digital gazetteers. We obtained estimates for total population and women of child bearing age (15-49 years) at a 1 km (2) spatial resolution from the WorldPop database for 2015. Additionally, we assembled road network data from Google Map Maker Project and OpenStreetMap using ArcMap (version 10.5). We then combined the road network and the population locations to form a travel impedance surface. Subsequently, we formulated a cost distance algorithm based on the location of public hospitals and the travel impedance surface in AccessMod (version 5) to compute the proportion of populations living within a combined walking and motorised travel time of 2 h to emergency hospital services. Findings We consulted 100 databases from 48 sub-Saharan countries and islands, including Zanzibar, and identified 4908 public hospitals. 2701 hospitals had either full or partial information about their geographical coordinates. We estimated that 287 282 013 (29.0%) people and 64 495 526 (28.2%) women of child bearing age are located more than 2-h travel time from the nearest hospital. Marked differences were observed within and between countries, ranging from less than 25% of the population within 2-h travel time of a public hospital in South Sudan to more than 90% in Nigeria, Kenya, Cape Verde, Swaziland, South Africa, Burundi, Comoros, Sao Tome and Principe, and Zanzibar. Only 16 countries reached the international benchmark of more than 80% of their populations living within a 2-h travel time of the nearest hospital. Interpretation Physical access to emergency hospital care provided by the public sector in Africa remains poor and varies substantially within and between countries. Innovative targeting of emergency care services is necessary to reduce these inequities. This study provides the first spatial census of public hospital services in Africa.

We analysed the extent to which health co-benefits would compensate the mitigation cost of achieving the targets of the Paris climate agreement (2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C) under different scenarios in which the emissions abatement effort is shared between countries in accordance with three established equity criteria. Methods Our study had three stages. First, we used an integrated assessment model, the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), to investigate the emission (greenhouse gases and air pollutants) pathways and abatement costs of a set of scenarios with varying temperature objectives (nationally determined contributions, 2 degrees C, or 1.5 degrees C) and approaches to the distribution of climate change methods (capability, constant emission ratios, and equal per capita). The resulting emissions pathways were transferred to an air quality model (TM5-FASST) to estimate the concentrations of particulate matter and ozone in the atmosphere and the resulting associated premature deaths and morbidity. We then applied a monetary value to these health impacts by use of a term called the value of statistical life and compared these values with those of the mitigation costs calculated from GCAM, both globally and regionally. Our analysis looked forward to 2050 in accordance with the socioeconomic narrative Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2. Findings The health co-benefits substantially outweighed the policy cost of achieving the target for all of the scenarios that we analysed. In some of the mitigation strategies, the median co-benefits were double the median costs at a global level. The ratio of health co-benefit to mitigation cost ranged from 1.4 to 2.45, depending on the scenario. At the regional level, the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions could be compensated with the health co-benefits alone for China and India, whereas the proportion the co-benefits covered varied but could be substantial in the European Union (7-84%) and USA (10-41%), respectively. Finally, we found that the extra effort of trying to pursue the 1.5 degrees C target instead of the 2 degrees C target would generate a substantial net benefit in India (US$3.28-8.4 trillion) and China ($0.27-2.31 trillion), although this positive result was not seen in the other regions. Interpretation Substantial health gains can be achieved from taking action to prevent climate change, independent of any future reductions in damages due to climate change. Some countries, such as China and India, could justify stringent mitigation efforts just by including health co-benefits in the analysis. Our results also suggest that the statement in the Paris Agreement to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C could make economic sense in some scenarios and countries if health co-benefits are taken into account.

However, such onedimensional perspectives do not accurately capture the character and complexity of the landscapes in which urban inhabitants live. The new approach presented in this paper demonstrates how open-source, high spatial and temporal resolution data with global coverage can be used tomeasure and represent the landscape qualities of urban environments. Through going beyond simple metrics of quantity, such as percentage green and blue cover, it is now possible to explore the extent to which landscape quality helps to unpick the mixed evidence presented in the literature on the benefits of urban nature to human well-being. Here we present a landscape approach, employing remote sensing, GIS and data reduction techniques to map urban green infrastructure elements in a large U.K. city region. Comparison with existing urban datasets demonstrates considerable improvement in terms of coverage and thematic detail. The characterisation of landscapes, using census tracts as spatial units, and subsequent exploration of associations with social-ecological attributes highlights the further detail that can be uncovered by the approach. For example, eight urban landscape types identified for the case study city exhibited associations with distinct socioeconomic conditions accountable not only to quantities but also qualities of green and blue space. The identification of individual landscape features through simultaneous measures of land use and land cover demonstrated unique and significant associations between the former and indicators of human health and ecological condition. The approach may therefore provide a promising basis for developing further insight into processes and characteristics that affect human health and well-being in urban areas, both in the United Kingdom and beyond.

Neurodevelopmental disorders in prison inmates: comorbidity and combined associations with psychiatric symptoms and behavioural disturbance	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Neurodevelopmental disorders; ADHD; Autism; Intellectual disability; Prison	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MAUDSLEY VIOLENCE QUESTIONNAIRE; QUOTIENT AQ; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; PREVALENCE; ADHD; OFFENDERS; ADULTS	The identification and management of inmates with neurodevelopmental disorders (ND) has been insufficiently addressed in the literature. We estimated the proportion of cases with Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Intellectual disability (ID) in prison, their comorbidity, and associations with disruptive behaviours and with psychiatric symptoms. Further, we examined the role of coexisting ND on psychiatric symptoms and attitudes toward violence. All 390 male inmates underwent an assessment that included the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in Adults 2.0, the Autism Quotient, the Learning Disability Screening Questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and measures of disruptive behaviours and attitudes towards violence. The percentage of cases with ADHD, ASD and ID were 25%, 9% and 9%. Inmates with ADHD and those with ID had significantly higher levels of disruptive behaviours. The combined ADHD/ASD group had significantly higher scores on global severity symptoms than either ADHD or ASD only. Meanwhile, the combined ADHD/ID group had significantly higher scores of behavioural disturbance than the ADHD-only group. Our findings show the extent of ND in prison, their inter-relations and associations with further mental health problems. Vulnerabilities conferred by ND within the criminal justice system should be addressed via interventions and preventative strategies.

J	Hoover, KC				Hoover, Kara C.			Sensory Disruption in Modern Living and the Emergence of Sensory Inequities	YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article								Modern lifestyles are disrupting the human senses-primarily sight, sound, and smell. Noise-induced hearing loss has been noted for centuries and increasing over time following the industrial era. From the mid-20th century, the numbers of individuals with myopia (the leading visual impairment) have been increasing globally. Historical evidence for olfactory dysfunction is not known but its etiological links to pollution suggest it increased following industrialization. Clinical interventions for sight and sound loss include preventative and corrective measures but none exist for olfactory dysfunction. Further, olfactory loss is linked to multiple negative health outcomes across physical, mental, and social domains. Due to the global rates of exposure to pollution, olfaction is a global health concern. The environmental injustice inherent in human society (locally and globally) results in inequitable risk for sensory loss by the most vulnerable populations and creates an even deeper gradient in health disparity. Situated within the environmental justice and health disparity literature, this paper introduces the term sensory inequity to describe variation in sensory environments based on socio-economic status (which is often entwined with race and education). A key challenge to risk management is awareness of sensory inequity experienced by vulnerable populations and incorporating that awareness into basic research and policy.

Rwanda and other low-resource countries face a critical shortage of health professionals, particularly nurses and midwives. This article describes the Human Resources for Health (HRH) Program in Rwanda, a collaboration between the Ministry of Health of Rwanda and a U.S. consortium of academic institutions. The ultimate goal of the HRH Program is to strengthen health service delivery and to achieve health equity for the poor. The aim of this article is to highlight the HRH nursing and midwifery contributions to capacity building in academic and clinical educational programs throughout Rwanda. International academic partnerships need to align with the priorities of the host country, integrate the strengths of available resources, and encourage a collaborative environment of cultural humility and self-awareness for all participants.

We aimed to describe spatially the burden of chronic conditions and primary medical care funding in England at a low geographical level, and to measure how much variation in funding is explained by chronic condition prevalence and other patient and regional factors. Methods: We used multiple administrative data sets including chronic condition prevalence and management data (2014/15), funding for primary-care practices (2015-16), and geographical and area deprivation data (2015). Data were assigned to a low geographical level (average 1500 residents). We investigated the overall morbidity burden across 19 chronic conditions and its regional variation, spatial clustering and association with funding and area deprivation. A linear regression model was used to explain local variation in spending using patient demographics, morbidity, deprivation and regional characteristics. Results: Levels of morbidity varied within and between regions, with several clusters of very high morbidity identified. At the regional level, morbidity was modestly associated with practice funding, with the North East and North West appearing underfunded. The regression model explained 39% of the variability in practice funding, but even after adjusting for covariates, a large amount of variability in funding existed across regions. High morbidity and, especially, rural location were very strongly associated with higher practice funding, while associations were more modest for high deprivation and older age. Conclusions: Primary care funding in England does not adequately reflect the contemporary morbidity burden. More equitable resource allocation could be achieved by making better use of routinely available information and big data resources. Similar methods could be deployed in other countries where comparable data are collected, to identify morbidity clusters and to target funding to areas of greater need.

We compared their frequencies and antibiotic susceptibilities in the treatment of patients with UTI from 2 cities, Kobe, Japan, and Surabaya, Indonesia. We retrospectively analyzed 1,804 urine samples collected from patients with UTI in 2014 (1,251 collected in 11 months at Kobe University Hospital in Kobe and 544 collected in 2 months at Dr. Soetomo Hospital in Surabaya). Surabaya data were divided into adult and pediatric patients because a substantial number of specimens from pediatric-patients had been collected. The results indicated that Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen (24.1% in Kobe and 39.3% in Surabaya) and was significantly resistant to ampicillin and substantially to first-and third-generation cephalosporins in Surabaya adults but not in Kobe adults (p < 0.01). Enterococcus faecalis was often isolated in Kobe (14.0%), but not in Surabaya (5.3%). Klebsiella spp. were isolated at a higher rate in Surabaya pediatric patients (20.3%) than in Surabaya adults (13.6%) and Kobe adults (6.6%). The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates form Surabaya isolates tended to be lower than the ones from Kobe. Extended-spectrum 13-lactamaseproducing Gram-negative bacteria were detected at a significantly higher rate in Surabaya than in Kobe (p < 0.001). These results showed that the antimicrobial resistance patterns of UTI-causative bacteria are highly variable among 2 countries, and the continuous surveillance of trends in antibiotic resistance patterns of uropathogens is necessary for the future revision of antibiotic use.

Differences in cataract burden by sex is a major concern of reducing avoidable blindness caused by cataract. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of sex with the global burden of cataract by year, age, and socioeconomic status using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This international, comparative burden-of-disease study extracted the global, regional, and national sex-specific DALY numbers, crude DALY rates, and age-standardized DALY rates caused by cataract by year and age from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015. The DALY data were collected from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2015, for ever 5 years. The human development index (HDI) in 2015 was extracted as an indicator of national socioeconomic status from the Human Development Report. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Comparisons of sex-specific DALY estimates due to cataract by year, age, and socioeconomic status at the global level. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, Pearson correlation, and linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the socioeconomic-associated sex differences in cataract burden. RESULTS Differences in rates of cataract by sex were similar between 1990 and 2015, with age-standardized DALY rates of 54.5 among men vs 65.0 among women in 1990 and 52.3 among men vs 67.0 among women in 2015. Women had higher rates than men of the same age, and sexual differences increased with age. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that age-standardized DALY rates among women were higher than those among men for each HDI-based country group (z range, -4.236 to -6.093; P < .001). The difference (female minus male) in age- standardized DALY rates (r = -0.610 [P < .001]; standardized beta = -0.610 [P < .001]) and the female to male age- standardized DALY rate ratios (r = -0.180 [P = .02]; standardized beta = -0.180 [P = .02]) were inversely correlated with HDI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although global cataract health care is progressing, sexual differences in cataract burden showed little improvement in the past few decades. Worldwide, women have a higher cataract burden than men. Older age and lower socioeconomic status are associated with greater differences in rates of cataract by sex. Our findings may enhance public awareness of sexual differences in global cataract burden and emphasize the importance of making sex-sensitive health policy to manage global vision loss caused by cataract.

J	Brisbois, B; Plamondon, K				Brisbois, Ben; Plamondon, Katrina			The possible worlds of global health research: An ethics-focused discourse analysis	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Global health; Ethics; Discourse analysis; Imaginative geographies; Colonialism; Equity; Indigenous		Representations of the world enable global health research (GHR), discursively constructing sites in which studies can legitimately take place. Depoliticized portrayals of the global South frequently obscure messy legacies of colonialism and motivate technical responses to health problems with political and economic root causes. Such problematic representations of the world have not yet been rigorously examined in relation to global health ethics, a major site of scholarly effort towards GHR that promotes justice and fairness. We carried out a discourse analysis of four guidance documents relevant to the ethical practice of GHR, purposively selecting texts covering different genres (UN documents and journal articles) and prominent GHR foci (HIV and clinical trials). In light of increasing acknowledgement of the lessons Indigenous health scholarship holds for global health ethics, the four analyzed texts also included a set of principles developed to support Indigenous nation-building. Three of four documents featured global disparities as reasons for ethical caution. These inequalities appeared without explanation or causes, with generation of new scientific knowledge following as a logical response to such disparities. The fourth Indigenous health-focused document clearly identified 'colonialism' as a reason for both inequities in society, and related harmful research practices. Solutions to disparities in this text did not necessarily involve cutting-edge research, but focused instead" on empowerment and responsiveness to community priorities and needs. These contrasting representations of the world were accomplished in ways that depended on texts' 'participants', or the people they represented; specific vocabularies or language usages; intertextual relationships to prior texts; and overall objectives or intentions of the author(s). Our results illustrate how ethics and other guidance documents serve as an important terrain for constructing, naturalizing or contesting problematic representations of the world of GHR.

We studied the association between lung cancer and occupationally derived SES, using data from the international pooled SYNERGY study. Methods Twelve case-control studies from Europe and Canada were included in the analysis. Based on occupational histories of study participants we measured SES using the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI) and the European Socio-economic Classification (ESeC). We divided the ISEI range into categories, using various criteria. Stratifying by gender, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, study, and smoking behavior. We conducted analyses by histological subtypes of lung cancer and subgroup analyses by study region, birth cohort, education and occupational exposure to known lung carcinogens. Results The analysis dataset included 17,021 cases and 20,885 controls. There was a strong elevated OR between lung cancer and low SES, which was attenuated substantially after adjustment for smoking, however a social gradient persisted. SES differences in lung cancer risk were higher among men (lowest vs. highest SES category: ISEI OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.61-2.09); ESeC OR 1.53 (95% CI 1.44-1.63)), than among women (lowest vs. highest SES category: ISEI OR 1.54 (95% CI 1.20-1.98); ESeC OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.19-1.52)). Conclusion SES remained a risk factor for lung cancer after adjustment for smoking behavior.

However, a small portion of the population is physically active. Recent reviews show that physical activity classes in community settings have the potential to increase population levels of physical activity and reduce health inequalities. Objective To evaluate the effect of the Academias da Cidade Program in Belo Horizonte on the practice of physical activity in leisure time (PALT) by non-users living near the program centers. Methods We conducted a home-based health survey in Belo Horizonte (2008 +/- 2009) with 1,581 adults who were non-users of the program and who lived within a 1,500-meter radius of one active program center (exposed group) and two nonoperational centers with sites reserved for their construction (unexposed group). We collected data on PALT levels (>= 150 minutes/week), which was measured with the Physical Activity International Questionnaire and analyzed with binary logistic regression using the Generalized Estimating Equations method. The propensity score was used as an adjustment variable to control the potential confusion in the measures of effect of exposure studied. Results The overall prevalence of the PALT was 26.5% in the exposed group and 22.7% in the unexposed group. The exposed group was more likely to be active in leisure time (OR = 1.05; CI 95%: 1.01 +/- 1.10). When considering the interaction between exposed group and distance, individuals in the exposed group who lived less than 500 meters from the program center were more likely to be active in leisure time (OR = 1.18, CI 95%: 1.03 +/- 1.35) compared to their counterparts. Conclusion Promoting physical activity in the community can favorably affect PALT levels among residents, especially those living closest to intervention centers. We believe the Academias da Cidade Program is a promising strategy to facilitate the access to appropriate spaces for the practice of physical activity and contribute to increase the levels physical activity within populations.

In this article, we ask whether the social vulnerability of Amazonian cities to floods and droughts is linked to differences in their spatial accessibility. To assess the accessibility of 310 urban centers, we developed a travel network and derived measures of connectivity and geographical remoteness. We found that 914,654 people live in roadless urban centers (n = 68) located up to 2,820km from their state capital. We then tested whether accessibility measures explained interurban differences in quantitative measures of social sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and an overlooked risk area, food system sensitivity. Accessibility explained marked variation in indicators of each of these dimensions and, hence, for the first time, we show an underlying spatial basis for social vulnerability. For instance, floods pose a greater disease risk in less accessible urban centers because inadequate sanitation in these places exposes inhabitants to environmental pollution and contaminated water, exacerbated by poverty and governance failures. Exploring the root causes of these spatial inequalities, we show how remote and roadless cities in Amazonia have been historically marginalized and their citizens exposed to structural violence and economic disadvantage. Paradoxically, we found that places with the highest social vulnerability have the greatest natural and cultural assets (rainforest, indigenous peoples, and protected areas). We conclude that increasing accessibility through road building would be maladaptive, exposing marginalized people to further harm and exacerbating climatic change by driving deforestation.

J	Cohidon, C; Wild, P; Senn, N				Cohidon, Christine; Wild, Pascal; Senn, Nicolas			Coping better with health problems after a visit to the family physician: associations with patients and physicians characteristics	BMC FAMILY PRACTICE			English	Article						Coping better; Family medicine; Patients' characteristics; Physicians' characteristics - practices' characteristics-multilevel analysis	PRIMARY-CARE CONSULTATIONS; CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY; GENERAL-PRACTICE; REPORTED OUTCOMES; ENABLEMENT; SATISFACTION; CENTEREDNESS; SWITZERLAND; DEPRIVATION; QUALITY	Background: Good patient experience is recognized as an important component of a strong primary care system. Among the dimensions related to experience in family medicine, the ability to cope better with health problems is considered to be a measure of the quality of a consultation with a family physician (FP). The objective is to identify factors related to patients, physicians and practice, associated with patients' ability to cope better with their health problems after a family medicine consultation. Methods: The data stemmed from the Swiss part of the Quality and Costs of Primary Care (QUALICOPC) study, an international cross sectional survey aiming to compare quality, cost and equity in primary care. In Switzerland, a random sample of 199 FPs and 1791 patients participated. The negative answer to the question: "After this visit, I feel I can cope better with my health problems" was modeled using multilevel logistic regressions. Results: Difficulty to cope better with health problems was positively associated with the following: younger age (OR: 1.58, 95% CI [1.03-2.41]), cultural aspects related to the Swiss area of language (French speaking people declared higher inability than German and Italian ones), presence of chronic disease (OR: 1.54 95% CI [1.00-2.39]). Conversely an intermediate number (1-4) of visits during the last 6 months (OR: 0.37 95% CI [0.23-0.62]) and the satisfaction with the physician (OR: 0.18 95% CI [0.08-0.44]) are negative predictors of the patient inability to cope better with his health problems. A self-reported effort-reward imbalance at work (OR: 0.64 95% CI [0.41-1.00]) was the only predictive FP characteristic (negatively associated). Conclusions: Although the design of the study does not allow causal inference, this study showed that the predictors of patient difficulties to cope better with health problem are mainly centered on the patients' characteristics. The patient-physician relationship both in terms of quality and frequency of visits is probably also important. Organizational practice characteristics do not seem to play a major role but stress at work among physicians should be further investigated.

The biosensors have found an empirical role in health applications (e.g. clinical diagnostics) as they represent the technological counterpart of living senses. On a global scale, alcohol analysis is indispensable for criminal justice systems, monitoring medical conditions of HIV patients & pregnant women as well as public safety issues regarding pilots, metro drivers, doctors etc. For addressing the clinical and toxicological problems, much advancement in the improvement of biosensors have been witnessed in recent decades. Currently, electrochemical biosensors dominate the field which harnesses the synergistic action of enzymes and nanomaterials for the analysis of ethanol. The enzymatic biosensors are the most explored biosensing devices among all the types of biosensors, and employment of nanomaterials has paved a way to the further improvements in this gem of a discovery. The relative comparison to precise the alcohol biosensors has been aptly discussed in the review on the basis of several analytical properties including fabrication, linearity, sensitivity, response time, detection limit as well as storage stability. Finally, the recent trends and emerging future prospects of alcohol biosensors have been reviewed.

Methods: A mathematical model to estimate the number of new HIV infections averted and the associated lifetime costs over 5 years if all HIV-positive temporary residents in Australia had access to ART and subsidised medical care was developed. Input data came from a cohort of 180 HIV-positive temporary residents living in Australia who are receiving free ART donated by pharmaceutical companies for up to 4 years. Results: Expanding ART access to an estimated total 450 HIV+ temporary residents in Australia for 5 years could avert 80 new infections. The model estimated the total median discounted (5%) cost for ART and associated care to be A$36 million, while the total savings in lifetime-discounted costs for the new infections averted was A$22 million. Conclusions: It is estimated that expanded access to ART for all HIV-positive temporary residents in Australia will substantially reduce HIV transmission to their sexual partners at little additional cost. In the context of Australia's National HIV strategy and Australia's endorsement of global goals to provide universal access to ART for all people with HIV, this is an important measure to remove inequities in the provision of HIV-related treatment and care.

J	O'Donnell, P; O'Donovan, D; Elmusharaf, K				O'Donnell, Patrick; O'Donovan, Diarmuid; Elmusharaf, Khalifa			Measuring social exclusion in healthcare settings: a scoping review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Review						Social exclusion; Social inclusion; Health inequality; Equity; Poverty; Measure; Instrument	MENTAL-HEALTH; GLOBAL BURDEN; HONG-KONG; INCLUSION; COMMUNITY; RECOVERY; PARTICIPATION; VALIDATION; QUESTIONNAIRE; RELIABILITY	Background: Social exclusion is a concept that has been widely debated in recent years; a particular focus of the discussion has been its significance in relation to health. The meanings of the phrase "social exclusion", and the closely associated term "social inclusion", are contested in the literature. Both of these concepts are important in relation to health and the area of primary healthcare in particular. Thus, several tools for the measurement of social exclusion or social inclusion status in health care settings have been developed. Methods: A scoping review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted to examine tools developed since 2000 that measure social exclusion or social inclusion. We focused on those measurement tools developed for use with individual patients in healthcare settings. Efforts were made to obtain a copy of each of the original tools, and all relevant background literature. All tools retrieved were compared in tables, and the specific domains that were included in each measure were tabulated. Results: Twenty-two measurement tools were included in the final scoping review. The majority of these had been specifically developed for the measurement of social inclusion or social exclusion, but a small number were created for the measurement of other closely aligned concepts. The majority of the tools included were constructed for engaging with patients in mental health settings. The tools varied greatly in their design, the scoring systems and the ways they were administered. The domains covered by these tools varied widely and some of the tools were quite narrow in the areas of focus. A review of the definitions of both social inclusion and social exclusion also revealed the variations among the explanations of these complex concepts. Conclusions: There are several definitions of both social inclusion and social exclusion in use and they differ greatly in scope. While there are many tools that have been developed for measuring these concepts in healthcare settings, these do not have a primary healthcare focus. There is a need for the development of a tool for measuring social inclusion or social exclusion in primary healthcare settings.

An assessment of financial catastrophe and impoverishment from out-of-pocket health care payments in Swaziland	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						Universal health coverage; health financing; catastrophic health care payments; poverty; Swaziland	LOW-INCOME; SOUTH-AFRICA; EXPENDITURE; INSURANCE; EQUITY; SECTOR; GHANA	Background: As the drive towards universal coverage is gaining momentum globally, the need for assessing levels of financial health protection in countries, particularity the developing world, has increasingly become important. In Swaziland, the level of financial health protection is not clearly understood. Objective: To assess financial catastrophe and impoverishment from out-of-pocket payments for health services in Swaziland. Methods: The nationally representative Swaziland Household Income and Expenditure Survey (2009/2010) dataset is used for the analyses. Data are collected by the Central Statistics Office in Swaziland. The final dataset contains information on 3,167 households (i.e. about 14,145 individuals) out of the anticipated 3,750 households. Financial catastrophe is assessed using an initial threshold that is adjusted to increase with household income (i.e. rank-dependent). Payment for health services is considered catastrophic when they exceed the threshold. Impoverishment is assessed using a national poverty line and an international poverty line ($ 1.25/day). Results: Using an initial threshold of 10.0% of household expenditure, 9.7% of Swazi households experience financial catastrophe while the proportion is estimated at 2.7% using an initial threshold of 40.0% of non-food expenditure. Between 1.0% and 1.6% of the Swazi population, representing between 10,000 and 16,000 people are pushed below the poverty line because of out-of-pocket payments. These findings indicate that financial health protection is not adequate in Swaziland. Conclusion: If Swaziland is to move towards achieving universal health coverage, there is a need to address the burden created by direct out-of-pocket payments. Among other things, this means that the country needs to consider financing mechanisms that guarantee equitable access to needed quality health services, which do not place undue hardship on the poor and vulnerable.

Particular emphasis is placed on building mental health service capacity in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) where over 80% of the global population live. Consistent with this approach, concerted efforts are being made to globally disseminate psychological interventions. These initiatives must negotiate tensions that exist between making interventions sufficiently scalable, whilst retaining aspects of the psychotherapy process that maximize both the acceptability and efficacy of psychological interventions. This paper reflects on the important contribution that Contextual Behavioral Science (CBS) can make to GMH. CBS draws on behavioral and environmental principles that translate into various therapeutic applications [including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP)] and social change initiatives (such as the PROSOCIAL approach). Consideration will be given to the cross-cultural utility and validity of CBS approaches, and the way in these can help ensure that GMH initiatives extend beyond narrow efforts to address symptoms of mental disorders to include a focus on enhancing wellbeing. It is proposed that knowledge from ACT and FAP can help build sophistication in efforts to develop and deliver 'therapist-free' psychological interventions that will need to retain sensitivity to clients' emotional expressions. In addition, the PROSOCIAL approach provides opportunities for groups of people to cooperate effectively to achieve shared aspirations and build 'communities of support' that can serve to optimize peoples' mental health and wellbeing.

Globally the number of road traffic deaths has plateaued despite an increase in motorization, but it is uncertain whether this applies to the Region. This study investigated the regional trends in both road traffic injury mortality and morbidity and examined country-based differences considering on income level, categories of road users, and gender distribution. Methods: Register-based ecological study linking data from Global Burden of Disease Study with the United Nations Statistics Division for population and World Bank definition for country income level. Road traffic injury mortality rates and disability-adjusted life years were compiled for all ages at country level in 1995, 2005, 2015 and combined for a regional average (n = 22) and a global average (n = 122). The data were stratified by country economic level, road user category and gender. Results: Road traffic injury mortality rates in the Region were higher than the global average for all three reference years but suggest a downward trend. In 2015 mortality rates were more than twice as high in low and high income countries compared to global income averages and motor vehicle occupants had a 3-fold greater mortality than the global average. Severe injuries decreased by more than half for high/middle income countries but remained high for low income countries; three times higher for males than females. Conclusion: Despite a potential downward trend, inequalities in road traffic injury mortality and morbidity burden remain high in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Action needs to be intensified and targeted to implement and enforce safety measures that prevent and mitigate severe motor vehicle crashes in high income countries especially and invest in efforts to promote public, active transport for vulnerable road users in the resource poor countries of the Region.

Distribution of the benefits from public health expenditures in Ghana	QUALITY & QUANTITY			English	Article						Public health expenditures; Equity; Healthcare utilisation; Benefit/utilisation incidence analysis; Ghana	CARE SERVICES; INEQUALITIES; OUTCOMES; INCOME; POOR	Government intervention in the healthcare market is, partly, justified on grounds of equity and redistribution. The intervention usually comes in the form of expenditures-direct provision of care and subsidies-in many developing countries. Given the expected redistributive impact of public health expenditures, the aim of this paper was to establish the beneficiaries of public health spending in Ghana using utilisation data for outpatient care. We applied utilisation incidence analysis on outpatient healthcare utilisation data from the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health, Ghana Wave 1 to conduct the analysis. The results show that ill-health was high in the rural areas, particularly among low income groups. While utilisation of public healthcare facilities for outpatient care was generally high, there was some disparities in utilisation. That is, utilisation of public health services, especially hospital care, was unfairly distributed among various income/wealth groups. Implications of these findings are that policymakers should continue to devise means to ensure equitable and even distribution of healthcare services, particularly hospital care, so that the poor and other vulnerable groups, whose plight call for government intervention, benefit.

Views of commissioners, managers and healthcare professionals on the NHS Health Check programme: a systematic review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review							GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; ENGLAND	Objective To synthesise data concerning the views of commissioners, managers and healthcare professionals towards the National Health Service (NHS) Health Check programme in general and the challenges faced when implementing it in practice. Design A systematic review of surveys and interview studies with a descriptive analysis of quantitative data and thematic synthesis of qualitative data. Data sources An electronic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Health Management Information Consortium, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, PsycInfo, Web of Science, OpenGrey, the Cochrane Library, NHS Evidence, Google Scholar, Google, ClinicalTrials. gov and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry from 1 January 1996 to 9 November 2016 with no language restriction and manual screening of reference lists of all included papers. Inclusion criteria Primary research reporting views of commissioners, managers or healthcare professionals on the NHS Health Check programme and its implementation in practice. Results Of 18 524 citations, 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. There was evidence from both quantitative and qualitative studies that some commissioners and general practice (GP) healthcare professionals were enthusiastic about the programme, whereas others raised concerns around inequality of uptake, the evidence base and cost-effectiveness. In contrast, those working in pharmacies were all positive about programme benefits, citing opportunities for their business and staff. The main challenges to implementation were: difficulties with information technology and computer software, resistance to the programme from some GPs, the impact on workload and staffing, funding and training needs. Inadequate privacy was also a challenge in pharmacy and community settings, along with difficulty recruiting people eligible for Health Checks and poor public access to some venues. Conclusions The success of the NHS Health Check Programme relies on engagement by those responsible for its commissioning, management and delivery. Recognising and addressing the challenges identified in this review, in particular the concerns of GPs, are important for the future of the programme.

Yet there is an increasing preference among consumers toward locally sourced and supplied foods among perceptions of health, economic and community benefits. Typically purchased in farmers' markets and specialty outlets, local foods are becoming more widely available in supermarkets, who are now interested in how they might introduce or increase that product range. We collect actual purchase data from a regional supermarket chain and analyze the drivers of higher local food proportional outcomes across a sample of consumers. Attempts to link theoretically important drivers of local food purchasing in traditional (e.g., farmers' market) outlets to supermarket settings proved difficult. Results do, however, suggest some means by which parties interested in developing local value chains between regional suppliers and supermarket outlets could be achieved. As such, the study is a useful first-step in the development of new value chains to address future potential issues of socio-economic stratification and inequality as a consequence of GVC prevalence.

However, the association between underweight or thinness and chronic bullying victimization is unclear. The current study examined whether chronic bullying victimization is associated with weight status and body self-image. Methods: A school-based, cross-sectional study in 39 North American and European countries and regions was conducted. A total of 213,595 adolescents aged 11, 13, and 15 years were surveyed in 2009/10. Chronic bullying victimization was identified using the Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire. Weight status was determined using self-reported height and weight and the body mass index (BMI), and body self-image was based on perceived weight. We tested associations between underweight and bullying victimization using three-level logistic regression models. Results: Of the 213,595 adolescents investigated, 11.28% adolescents reported chronic bullying victimization, 14.80% were classified as overweight/obese according to age and sex specific BMI criteria, 12.97% were underweight and 28.36% considered themselves a little bit fat or too fat, 14.57% were too thin. Bullying victimization was less common in older adolescent boys and girls. Weight status was associated with chronic bullying victimization (adjusted ORundeweight 1.10, 95% CI = 1.05-1.16, p = 0.002; adjusted ORoverweight = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.32-1.49, p < 0.0001; adjusted ORobese 1.91, 95% CI = 1.71-2.14, p < 0.0001). Body self-image also related to chronic bullying victimization (adjusted ORtoo (thin) = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.36-1.49, p < 0.0001; adjusted ORa little bit fat = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.48-1.61, p < 0.0001; adjusted ORtoo fat = 3.30, 95% CI = 2.96-3.68, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Both perceived weight and self-rated overweight are associated with chronic bullying victimization. Both overweight and underweight children are at risk of being chronically bullied.

The aim of this study was to assess HRQoL inequalities between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people and heterosexuals in the 2011 Barcelona population, to describe the extent to which sociodemographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, and chronic conditions could explain such inequalities, and to understand if they are sexual orientation inequities. Methods In the 2011 Barcelona Health Interview Survey 3277 adults answered the EQ-5D, which measures five dimensions of HRQoL summarized into a single utility index (1 = perfect health, 0 = death). To assess HRQoL differences by sexual orientation we constructed Tobit models for the EQ-5D index, and Poisson regression models for the EQ-5D dimensions. In both cases, nested models were constructed to assess the mediator role of selected variables. Results After adjusting by socio-demographic variables, the LGB group presented a significantly lower EQ-5D index than heterosexuals, and higher prevalence ratios of problems in physical EQ-5D dimensions among both genders: adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 1.70 for mobility (p = 0.046) and 2.11 for usual activities (p = 0.019). Differences in mental dimensions were only observed among men: aPR = 3.15 for pain/discomfort (p = 0.003) and 2.49 for anxiety/depression (p = 0.030). All these differences by sexual orientation disappeared after adding chronic conditions and health-related behaviors in the models. Conclusion The LGB population presented worse HRQoL than heterosexuals in the EQ-5D index and most dimensions. Chronic conditions, health-related behaviors and gender play a major role in explaining HRQoL differences by sexual orientation. These findings support the need of including sexual orientation into the global agenda of health inequities.

Austerity measures resulting in insufficient staff with heavy workloads limit the amount of time available to assist residents with eating. Within a feminist political economy framework, rapid team-based ethnography was used for an international study involving six countries exploring promising practices and also for a study conducted in one Canadian province in which interrelationships between formal and informal care were investigated. Data collection methods included interviews and observations. In addition, dining maps were completed providing a cross-jurisdictional comparison of mealtime work organization, and illustrating the time spent assisting residents with meals. Dining maps highlight the reliance on unpaid care as well as how low staffing levels leave care providers rushing around, preventing a pleasurable resident dining experience, which is central to overall health and well-being.

Yet the resulting guidelines, which Member States are encouraged, but not required to adopt, are a powerful way of developing rigorous policy and fostering implementation. Using the example of the housing and health guidelines, which are currently being finalised, this paper outlines the process for developing WHO guidelines. This includes: forming a Guidelines Review Group that represents all regions of the world, and ensures gender balance and technical expertise; identifying key health outcomes of interest; commissioning systematic reviews of the evidence; assessing the evidence; and formulating recommendations. The strength of each recommendation is assessed based on the quality of the evidence, along with consideration of issues such as equity, acceptability, and feasibility of the implementation of the recommendation.

Lead Emissions and Population Vulnerability in the Detroit (Michigan, USA) Metropolitan Area, 2006-2013: A Spatial and Temporal Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						lead emissions; lead deposition; environmental justice; AERMOD; Detroit; Michigan; USA	CHILDRENS BLOOD LEAD; AIR; INEQUALITY; EXPOSURE; HEALTH; LEVEL	Objective: The purpose of this research is to geographically model airborne lead emission concentrations and total lead deposition in the Detroit Metropolitan Area (DMA) from 2006 to 2013. Further, this study characterizes the racial and socioeconomic composition of recipient neighborhoods and estimates the potential for IQ (Intelligence Quotient) loss of children residing there. Methods: Lead emissions were modeled from emitting facilities in the DMA using AERMOD (American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model). Multilevel modeling was used to estimate local racial residential segregation, controlling for poverty. Global Moran's I bivariate spatial autocorrelation statistics were used to assess modeled emissions with increasing segregation. Results: Lead emitting facilities were primarily located in, and moving to, highly black segregated neighborhoods regardless of poverty levels-a phenomenon known as environmental injustice. The findings from this research showed three years of elevated airborne emission concentrations in these neighborhoods to equate to a predicted 1.0 to 3.0 reduction in IQ points for children living there. Across the DMA there are many areas where annual lead deposition was substantially higher than recommended for aquatic (rivers, lakes, etc.) and terrestrial (forests, dunes, etc.) ecosystems. These lead levels result in decreased reproductive and growth rates in plants and animals, and neurological deficits in vertebrates. Conclusions: This lead-hazard and neighborhood context assessment will inform future childhood lead exposure studies and potential health consequences in the DMA.

Due to the high prevalence of use in Asian and African countries, skin fairness product use is recognized as a growing public health concern. The multi-million-dollar skin fairness product industry has also been criticized for perpetuating racism and social inequalities by reinforcing beliefs about the benefits of skin fairness for cultural capital. No quantitative studies have assessed people's beliefs about fairness and reasons for using or not using these products in India, one of the largest global markets for skin fairness products. The current study explored skin fairness product use among 1,992 women and men aged 16-60 years in the city of Mumbai, India using a self-report questionnaire. A total of 37.6% of the sample reported currently using skin fairness products, with women being two times more likely to use these products. Among current users, 17% reported past experiences of adverse side effects, and "Media/TV/Adverts" were the most common prompts for using fairness products, followed by "Friends" and "Family." Men were significantly more likely than women to endorse beliefs about fairness being more attractive and were more likely to perceive family and peers as viewing fairness as beneficial for cultural capital. There were no differences between women and men currently using products in their desire to look as fair as media celebrities. Among non-users, women were significantly more likely than men to report concerns about product efficacy and side effects as reasons for non-use, while men were significantly more likely to report socioeconomic reasons for non-use. Implications of these findings are discussed in light of growing public health concerns about the use of fairness products, and potential for advocacy and public health interventions to address the use of skin fairness products.

J	Schenker, K				Schenker, Katarina			Health(y) education in Health and Physical Education	SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Health and Physical Education; HPE; physical education teacher education; PETE; thesis; equity; Bildung	OBESITY DISCOURSE; BODY PEDAGOGIES; TEACHERS; BODIES; FITNESS; SCHOOLS; FUTURE	Teachers in the school subject Health and Physical Education (HPE) need to be able both to teach health and to do so in a healthy (equitable) way. The health field has, however, met with difficulties in finding its form within the subject. Research indicates that HPE can be excluding, meaning that it may give more favours to some pupils (bodies) than to others [cf. Webb, L.A., Quennerstedt, M., & ohman, M.(2008). Healthy bodies: Construction of the body and health in physical education. Sport, Education and Society, 13(4), 353-372.; Webb, L., & Quennerstedt, M.(2010).

Algorithmic skin: Health-tracking technologies, personal analytics and the biopedagogies of digitized health and physical education. Sport, Education and Society, 20(1), 133-151], and thereby being unhealthy for unfavoured pupils. The purpose of this study is therefore to investigate how HPE teacher education students in Sweden interpret health in HPE and discuss possible implications for future education in the school subject. The study involves 81 Bachelor/Master theses, connected to the HPE school subject and examined at six different Swedish universities. All the student theses were examined in 2012. Of the identified theses, 30 can be related more or less directly to health in physical education. These are the ones further scrutinized here. The contents of the selected essays may be categorized on the basis of tests as tools to measure health/ill health/performance, the knowledge required to teach health and also health as part of pedagogy. In sum, the theses display a reproductive approach to the subject, which involves the risk that the subject will subsequently function as disciplining, standardizing and excluding for some pupils, especially for those who do not engage in sports in their leisure time. In order to develop HPE's potential into becoming healthier and more equal, researchers, teacher education and teachers do not primarily need to perceive health from the activity and individual perspectives, but rather from a power relations and equity perspective aiming towards equality.

J	Kennedy, M				Kennedy, Melissa			MAORI ECONOMIC INEQUALITY: READING OUTSIDE OUR COMFORT ZONE	INTERVENTIONS-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES			English	Article						Inequality; Maori fiction; neo-liberalism; New Zealand poverty; precarity		In Aotearoa-New Zealand as elsewhere in the world, the 2008 global financial crisis and ensuing critique of the global political economy that enabled it shifted focus away from cultural identity and onto socioeconomic inequality. Since the 1980s, the number of poor New Zealanders has doubled, with 20 per cent today living below the poverty line, with Maori disproportionately affected by poverty, precarity and social indicators including unemployment, educational achievement, health and morbidity. Not only do Maori underperform, the gap between Maori and Pakeha has widened in almost all social indicators for which data have been collected since the 1980s. The narrative of the cultural equality of biculturalism has run in parallel with social and economic inequality, with the two discourses hardly touching each other. Indeed, the terms and parameters of the identity politics of difference have masked the insidious effects of that other national sea-change of the 1980s, the irruption of free-market neoliberalism. While Maori literature and its critical analysis support biculturalism, striking hierarchies of material inequality within Maori society remain understated in the fiction and ignored in critique. This essay traces the history of economic inequality lightly registered in Maori fiction, and argues the inability to tackle Maori poverty head-on reflects the broader national and international difficulty of naming and defining the current era of neo-liberal capitalism that post-2008 responses to the financial crisis have identified.

A Comparison of the Expectations and Experiences of Medical Students From High-, Middle-, and Low-Income Countries Participating in Global Health Clinical Electives	TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Global health; global health education; undergraduate medical education; international medical education; institutional partnerships	POTENTIAL BENEFITS; IDENTIFY NEEDS; EDUCATION; PRINCIPLES; PERSPECTIVES; COMPETENCES; OBJECTIVES; KNOWLEDGE; PROGRAMS; DEFICITS	Phenomenon: Global health education (GHE) is expanding to include socioculturally and resource-different settings, with the goal of developing a workforce with members who can promote health equity locally and globally. GHE is also no longer limited to students from high-income countries (HICs). However, it is unknown whether the motivations and experiences of medical students from HICs and from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) participating in GHE clinical electives through institutional partnerships are similar or different. Such an understanding is needed to design programs that meet the needs of participants and effectively train them in the principles and practice of global health. Approach: This was a cross-sectional, mixed-methods survey of LMIC students from partner sites rotating at one U.S. medical school, and U.S. students from one medical school rotating at partner sites, between 2010 and 2015. Variables included demographic characteristics of participants, components of the curriculum at the home institution, and components of the away rotation, including perceptions of its content and impact. Content analysis was used to identify themes in the responses provided to open-ended questions. Findings: In all, 63 of 84 (75%) LMIC and 61 of 152 (40%) U.S. students participated. Recall of predeparture training was low for both LMIC and U.S. students (44% and 55%, respectively). Opportunities to experience different healthcare systems, resource-different settings, and cultural exposure emerged as motivators for both groups. Both groups noted differences in doctor-patient relationships, interactions between colleagues, and use of diagnostic testing. U.S. respondents were more likely to perceive differences in the impact of social determinants of health and ethical issues. Both groups felt that their experience affected their interactions with patients and perspectives on education, but U.S. students were more likely to mention perspectives on healthcare delivery and social determinants of health, whereas LMIC respondents noted impacts on career goals. Insights: These results argue that GHE is not restricted to resource-constrained settings and that students from LMICs have similar reasons for participation as those from HICs. LMIC students also identified a lack of emphasis on GHE topics like social determinants of health during GH electives, which could diminish the effectiveness of these experiences. Both U.S. and LMIC students emphasized the cultural component of their GHE experience but had different perceptions regarding core tenets of GHE, such as the social determinants of health and health equity, during these experiences.

Method: The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was administered during 2011-2012 to 99 cleanup workers and 100 population-based controls previously screened for mental health symptoms. Results: Logistic regression analysis showed that cleanup workers had higher odds of current depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR]=3.07, 95% confidence interval [CI: 1.34, 7.01]), alcohol dependence (OR=3.47, 95% CI [1.29, 9.34]), and suicide ideation (OR=3.44, 95% CI [1.28, 9.21]) than did controls. Except for suicide ideation, associations with Chernobyl exposure became statistically nonsignificant when adjusted for education and ethnicity. Conclusion: A quarter of a century after the Chernobyl accident, Estonian cleanup workers were still at increased risk of mental disorders, which was partly attributable to sociodemographic factors.

The aim is to build our understanding of rural as a dynamic context within which the processes, outcomes, and experiences of aging are created, confronted, and contested by older adults and their communities. A review of key developments within gerontology and rural studies reveals how competing policies, discourses, and practices relating to healthy aging and aging in place, rural citizenship and governmentality, and social inclusion and inequality combine in particular ways to empower or disempower a diverse range of older rural adults aging in a diverse range of rural communities. The article provides a contextually sensitive perspective on potential sources of conflict and exclusion for older adults in dynamic rural spaces and further enhances our understanding of how rural physical and social environments are constructed and experienced in older age. A framework for interrogating emergent questions about aging in rural contexts is developed and implications for advancing research, policy, and practice are discussed.

Policymakers increasingly recognize that "successful" aging policies must not only address physical health needs but also factors that influence subjective well-being. To investigate the influence of area-level distribution of "public goods" on well-being in a low- and middle-income setting, nationally representative WHO-Study of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE) survey data is combined with district-level data that captures built resources and health system distribution. Multilevel regression modeling is utilized to explore how community context, including built resources and health infrastructure quality, influence older persons' quality of life and how chronic health conditions may moderate this relationship while controlling for important individual characteristics. While controlling for individual and district level factors, it is found community level provision of built resources of basic services (i.e., water, sanitation, electricity, housing) has a modest but significant impact on older persons' subjective well-being. Further, this effect on older persons' perceptions of quality of life is moderated by individual chronic health status; individuals with a chronic health condition do not receive an equivalent benefit from district built condition like those without an illness do. This work adds to the literature concerning the effect of environments in low- and middle-income countries on older adults' subjective well-being. It also adds to the growing literature on the complex relationship between subjective well-being and health in diverse contexts.

Positive effects of refugee presence on host community nutritional status in Turkana County, Kenya	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article							NOMADIC TURKANA; BODY-COMPOSITION; HUMAN-BIOLOGY; HEALTH; CONSEQUENCES; INEQUALITY; PREGNANCY; DROUGHT; PEOPLE; LIFE	ObjectivesRefugee camps are often assumed to negatively impact local host communities through resource competition and conflict. We ask instead whether economic resources and trade networks associated with refugees have benefits for host community health and nutrition. To address this question we assess the impacts of Kakuma Refugee Camp in northwest Kenya, comparing anthropometric indicators of nutritional status between Turkana communities in the region. MethodsParticipants were recruited at four sites in Turkana County (N=586): Kakuma Town, adjacent to Kakuma Refugee Camp; Lorugum, an area with sustained economic development; Lokichoggio, formerly host to international NGOs, and now underdeveloped; and Lorengo, an undeveloped, rural community. We evaluated nutritional status using summed skinfold thickness and body mass index (BMI). Structured interviews provided contextual data. ResultsAge-controlled multiple regression models reveal two distinct skinfold thickness profiles for both sexes: comparatively elevated values in Kakuma and Lorugum, and significantly lower values in Lorengo and Lokichoggio. BMI did not vary significantly by location. Despite better nutritional status, a large proportion of Kakuma residents still report worries about basic needs, including hunger, health, and economic security. ConclusionsKakuma Refugee Camp is associated with better host community energetic status indicators, compared to other relevant, regional sites varying in development and resources. Based on global nutritional standards, observed differences likely represent meaningful disparities in overall health. We suggest that access to cereals via refugee trade networks and employment might mediate this relationship. However, perceptions of refugees as illegitimate interlopers maintain a high psychological burden.

Due to the absence of fine level aggregated data, however, rather limited studies have been conducted to explore the neighborhood social determinants of public health in developing countries, especially in China. Using district level official data in 2010, this study examines the neighborhood social determinants of three prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Shenzhen, China. In total, 22 exploratory social variables are selected from five domains: employment, education, housing, demographic structure and income. Spatial regression in binary and stepwise form is used to recognize the most influential social determinants. Results indicate the social determinants vary with the three NCDs and they have some general similarities. Spatial binary regression identifies four principle social determinants of NCDs prevalence: employment, income, housing and demographic structure. One essential social determinant (percentage of the floating population) is identified for all the three diseases by stepwise regression. Our study highlights that the main social determinant related to the incidence rates of all NCDs is the indicator of demographic structure denoting percentage of the floating population. This paper advances the understanding of the essential social determinants of NCDs in China.

Their reception and security in overburdened camps, combined with limited information and protection, increases their risk and exposure to sexual violence (SV). This literature review explores the opportunities to address SV against female refugees, with a particular focus on low-resource settings. A systematic literature review of articles published between 2000 and 2016 was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Databases including Medline (Ovid), PubMed,Scopus, PsychINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library. Grey literature from key refugee websites were searched. Studies were reviewed for quality and analysed according to the framework outlined in the UNHCR Guidelines on Prevention and Response of Sexual Violence against Refugees. Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 7 studies addressed prevention, 14 studies response and 8 addressed both. There are limited numbers of rigorously evaluated SV prevention and response interventions available, especially in the context of displacement. However, emerging evidence shows that placing a stronger emphasis on programmes in the category of engagement/participation and training/education has the potential to target underlying causes of SV. SV against female refugees is caused by factors including lack of information and gender inequality. This review suggests that SV interventions that engage community members in their design and delivery, address harmful gender norms through education and advocacy, and facilitate strong cooperation between stakeholders, could maximise the efficient use of limited resources.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article							SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; LIFE EXPECTANCY; GOVERNANCE; QCA	Background: According to the recommendations of the World Health Organization Commission On Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) for intersectoral action on health, the well-being of and equity in health within a population are achieved via a complex fusion of policies and actions. In this study, following the CSDH's approach and considering set-theoretic relations, we aimed to unravel this complexity and answer the kinds of questions that are outside the scope of conventional variable-oriented approach. Methods: A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of 131 countries was conducted to examine the configurational effects of five macro-level structural conditions on life expectancy at birth. The potential causal conditions were level of country wealth, income inequality, quality of governance, education, and health system. The data collected from different international data sources were recorded during 2004-2015. Results: The intermediate solution of the truth table analysis indicated a configuration of conditions including high level of governance, education, wealth, and affluent health system to be consistently sufficient for high life expectancy. On the other hand, four configurations, each containing two or three conditions, were consistent with being usually sufficient to cause low life expectancy. Conclusions: We were able to configurationally explore the cases and specify the combinations of potentially causal conditions which were usually sufficient to explain high or low life expectancy in different countries. As a result, particular cases were identified for further research. In addition, research may provide support for the CSDH's recommendations emphasizing the importance of intersectoral action for health.

Dental diseases are among the most prevalent conditions worldwide, with universal access to dental care being one key to tackling them. Systematic quantification of inequalities in dental service utilization is needed to identify where these are most pronounced, assess factors underlying the inequalities, and evaluate changes in inequalities with time. Objectives. To evaluate the presence and extent of inequalities in dental services utilization. Search Methods. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching 3 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Database), covering the period from January 2005 to April 2017. Selection Criteria. We included observational studies investigating the association between regular dental service utilization and sex, ethnicity, place of Living, educational or income or occupational position, or insurance coverage status. Two reviewers undertook independent screening of studies and made decisions by consensus. Data Collection and Analysis. Our primary outcome was the presence and extent of inequalities in dental service utilization, measured as relative estimates (usually odds ratios [ORs]) comparing different (high and Low utilization) groups. We performed random effects meta-analysis and subgroup analyses by region, and we used meta-regression to assess whether and how associations changed with time. Main Results. A total of 117 studies met the inclusion criteria. On the basis of 7 830 810 participants, dental services utilization was Lower in male than female participants (OR=0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74, 0.95; P<.001); ethnic minorities or immigrants than ethnic majorities or natives (OR=0.71; 95% CI = 0.59, 0.82; P<.001); those Living in rural than those Living in urban places (OR=0.87; 95% CI = 0.76, 0.97; P=.011); those with Lower than higher educational position (OR=0.61; 95% CI = 0.55, 0.68; P<.001) or income (OR=0.66; 95% CI = 0.54, 0.79; P<.001); and among those without insurance coverage status than those with such status (OR=0.58; 95% CI = 0.49, 0.68; P<.001). Occupational status (OR=0.95; 95% CI = 0.81, 1.09; P=.356) had no significant impact on utilization. The observed inequalities did not significantly change over the assessed 12-year period and were universally present. Authors' Conclusions. Inequalities in dental service utilization are both considerable and globally consistent. Public Health implications. The observed inequalities in dental services utilization can be assumed to significantly cause or aggravate existing dental health inequalities. Policymakers should address the physical, socioeconomic, or psychological causes underlying the inequalities in utilization.

They are written by European experts representing all disciplines involved in cancer care. ERQCC papers give oncology teams, patients, policymakers and managers an overview of the elements needed in any healthcare system to provide high quality of care throughout the patient journey. References are made to clinical guidelines and other resources where appropriate, and the focus is on care in Europe. Oesophageal and gastric: essential requirements for quality care: Oesophageal and gastric (OG) cancers are a challenging tumour group with a poor prognosis and wide variation in outcomes among European countries. Increasing numbers of older people are contracting the diseases, and treatments and care pathways are becoming more complex in both curative and palliative settings. High-quality care can only be a carried out in specialised OG cancer units or centres which have both a core multidisciplinary team and an extended team of allied professionals, and which are subject to quality and audit procedures. Such units or centres are far from universal in all European countries. It is essential that, to meet European aspirations for comprehensive cancer control, healthcare organisations implement the essential requirements in this paper, paying particular attention to multidisciplinarity and patient-centred pathways from diagnosis, to treatment, to survivorship. Conclusion: Taken together, the information presented in this paper provides a comprehensive description of the essential requirements for establishing a high-quality OG cancer service. The ERQCC expert group is aware that it is not possible to propose a one size fits all' system for all countries, but urges that access to multidisciplinary units or centres must be guaranteed for all those with OG cancer.

Clean cooking and the SDGs: Integrated analytical approaches to guide energy interventions for health and environment goals	ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							HOUSEHOLD AIR-POLLUTION; APPROVED COOKSTOVE INTERVENTION; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; SOLID-FUEL; EMISSION FACTORS; CLIMATE; STOVES; BIOMASS; INDIA; CHALLENGE	Development and implementation of clean cooking technology for households in low and middle income countries (LMICs) offer enormous promise to advance at least five Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 3. Good health and well-being; 5. Gender equality; 7. Affordable and clean energy; 13. Climate action; 15. Life on land. Programs are being implemented around the world to introduce alternative cooking technologies, and we are well on the way to achieving the goal set by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to reach 100 million homes with cleaner and more efficient cooking methods by 2020. Despite evidence that household air pollution (HAP) fromsolid fuel combustion is responsible for 3-4 million early deaths per year, many cookstove programs are motivated and/or financed by climate change mitigation schemes and deploy alternative stoves that use solid fuels such as wood and charcoal. However, recent studies have demonstrated that improved biomass-burning stoves typically only incrementally improve air quality and yield modest or minimal health benefits. Likewise, their contributions to climate change mitigation and other SDGs may be limited. Evidence indicates that cleaner fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol and biogas, offer greater potential benefits not only to health, but also greater progress towards climate goals and other relevant SDGs. We present a modeled estimate of these potential gains for a diverse group of 40 LMICs. Our model suggests that cookstove programs using LPG stoves and fuel will yield greater reductions in both Disability Adjusted Life Years and GlobalWarming Commitment in these countries than those using improved biomass stoves. Cost and infrastructure requirements for clean fuels such as LPG are widely recognized constraints. In view of these constraints we present an analytical method to simultaneously consider health and climate needs at the national level for the same 40 countries in the context of estimated LPG expansion potentials. Comparative analyses integrating priorities across SDGs at the national and regional levels may guide more practical and effective household energy development choices going forward.

In May 2017, world governments made a commitment to further invest in cancer control as a public health priority, passing the World Health Assembly Resolution 70.12 on cancer prevention and control within an integrated approach. In this manuscript, the 2016 European Society for Medical Oncology Leadership Generation Programme participants propose a strategic framework that is in line with the 2017 WHO Cancer Resolution and consistent with the principle of universal health coverage, which ensures access to optimal cancer care for all people because health is a basic human right. The time for action is now to reduce barriers and provide the highest possible quality cancer care to everyone regardless of circumstance, precondition or geographic location. The national actions and the policy recommendations in this paper set forth the vision of its authors for the future of global cancer control at the national level, where the WHO Cancer Resolution must be implemented if we are to reduce the cancer burden, avoid unnecessary suffering and save as many lives as possible.

PPD is the most common complication associated with childbirth and exerts harmful effects on children. Although hundreds of PPD studies have been published, we lack accurate global or national PPD prevalence estimates and have no clear account of why PPD appears to vary so dramatically between nations. Accordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the global and national prevalence of PPD and a meta-regression to identify economic, health, social, or policy factors associated with national PPD prevalence. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of all papers reporting PPD prevalence using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. PPD prevalence and methods were extracted from each study. Random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate global and national PPD prevalence. To test for country level predictors, we drew on data from UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank. Random effects meta-regression was used to test national predictors of PPD prevalence. Findings: 291 studies of 296284 women from 56 countries were identified. The global pooled prevalence of PPD was 17.7% (95% confidence interval: 16.6-18.8%), with significant heterogeneity across nations (Q = 16,823, p = 0.000, I-2 = 98%), ranging from 3% (2-5%) in Singapore to 38% (35-41%) in Chile. Nations with significantly higher rates of income inequality (R-2 = 41%), maternal mortality (R-2 = 19%), infant mortality (R-2 = 16%), or women of childbearing age working >= 40 h a week (R-2 = 31%) have higher rates of PPD. Together, these factors explain 73% of the national variation in PPD prevalence. Interpretation: The global prevalence of PPD is greater than previously thought and varies dramatically by nation. Disparities in wealth inequality and maternal-child-health factors explain much of the national variation in PPD prevalence.

This can be measured by the percentage of people in households whose out-of-pocket health expenditures are large relative to their income or consumption. We aimed to estimate the global incidence of catastrophic health spending, trends between 2000 and 2010, and associations between catastrophic health spending and macroeconomic and health system variables at the country level. Methods We did a retrospective observational study of health spending using data obtained from household surveys. Of 1566 potentially suitable household surveys, 553 passed quality checks, covering 133 countries between 1984 and 2015. We defined health spending as catastrophic when it exceeded 10% or 25% of household consumption. We estimated global incidence by aggregating up from every country, using a survey for the year in question when available, and interpolation and model-based estimates otherwise. We used multiple regression to explore the relation between a country's incidence of catastrophic spending and gross domestic product (GDP) per person, the Gini coefficient for income inequality, and the share of total health expenditure spent by social security funds, other government agencies, private insurance schemes, and non-profit institutions. Findings The global incidence of catastrophic spending at the 10% threshold was estimated as 9.7% in 2000, 11.4% in 2005, and 11.7% in 2010. Globally, 808 million people in 2010 incurred catastrophic health spending. Across 94 countries with two or more survey datapoints, the population-weighted median annual rate of change of catastrophic payment incidence was positive whatever catastrophic payment incidence measure was used. Incidence of catastrophic payments was correlated positively with GDP per person and the share of GDP spent on health, and incidence correlated negatively with the share of total health spending channelled through social security funds and other government agencies. Interpretation The proportion of the population that is supposed to be covered by health insurance schemes or by national or subnational health services is a poor indicator of financial protection. Increasing the share of GDP spent on health is not sufficient to reduce catastrophic payment incidence; rather, what is required is increasing the share of total health expenditure that is prepaid, particularly through taxes and mandatory contributions.

Methods: To assess human development, the Human Development Index was utilized continuously and according to four levels (low, medium, high, very high), where the low and very high categories include the least and most developed countries, respectively. All studies that assessed aspects of the global cancer burden using this measure were reviewed. Results: Although the present cancer incidence burden is greater in higher Human Development Index countries, a greater proportion of the global mortality burden is observed in less developed countries, with a higher mean fatality rate in the latter countries. Further, the future cancer burden is expected to disproportionally affect less developed regions; in particular, it has been estimated that low and medium Human Development Index countries will experience a 100% and 81% increase in cancer incidence from 2008 to 2030, respectively. Disparities were also observed in risk factors and average health outcomes, such as a greater number of years of life lost prematurely and fewer cancer-related gains in life expectancy observed in lower versus higher Human Development Index settings. Conclusions: From a global perspective, there remain clear disparities in the cancer burden according to national Human Development Index scores. International efforts are needed to aid countries in social and economic transition in order to efficiently plan, implement and evaluate cancer control initiatives as a means to reduce the widening gap in cancer occurrence and survival worldwide.

Design: Cross-sectional study used generalised estimating equations to investigate associations between supermarket density and proximity, vegetable and fruit intake and BMI at five geographic scales representing distances people travel to purchase food by varying transport modes. A stratified analysis by area-level disadvantage was conducted to detect optimal distances to supermarkets across socio-economic areas. Spatial distribution of supermarket and transport access was analysed using a geographic information system. Setting: Melbourne, Australia. Subjects: Adults (n 3128) from twelve local government areas (LGA) across Melbourne. Results: Supermarket access was protective of BMI for participants in high disadvantaged areas within 800m (P=0.040) and 1000m (P=0.032) road network buffers around the household but not for participants in less disadvantaged areas. In urban growth area LGA, only 26% of dwellings were within 1 km of a supermarket, far less than 80-90% of dwellings suggested in the local urban planning policy. Low public transport access compounded disadvantage. Conclusions: Rapid urbanisation is a global health challenge linked to increases in dietary risk factors and BMI. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying the most appropriate geographic scale to inform urban planning policy for optimal health outcomes across socio-economic strata. Urban planning policy implementation in disadvantaged areas within cities has potential for reducing health inequities.

Market failures include limited availability, low quality, lack of information, and high costs of access. We estimated the theoretical demand for one of the most common artemisinin-based combination therapies, artemether-lumefantrine (AL), and its determinants among caregivers of children with malaria seeking care at public health facilities, thus, entitled to receive drugs for free, in southern Mozambique (year 2012). The predicted theoretical demand was contrasted with international and local private market AL prices. Respondents stated high willingness to pay but lower ability to pay (ATP), which was defined as the theoretical demand. The ATP was on average of 0.94 USD for the treatment of a malaria episode. This implied an average gap of 1.04 USD between average local private prices and theoretical demand. Predicted ATP decreased by 14% for every additional malaria episode that the child had suffered during the malaria season. The market price was unaffordable for a large share of our sample, highlighting an unequal welfare distribution between suppliers and potential consumers, as well as issues of inequity in the private delivery of AL.

Despite a disproportionately large burden of burns in the developing world, the nature of social support among burn patients in this context remains elusive. We, therefore, seek to investigate social support and its biopsychosocial determinants among patients with burn injuries in Pakistan. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 343 patients presenting with burn injuries at four teaching hospitals in the Punjab province of Pakistan was conducted. Patient evaluation consisted of a multi-part survey of demographic status, clinical features, and social support as measured by the validated Urdu translation of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate associations between patient characteristics and MSPSS score. Results: Mean overall MSPSS score was 57.64 (std dev 13.57). Notable positive predictors of social support include male gender, Punjabi ethnicity, burn surface area, and ego resiliency. Conclusion: Our study reveals a troubling pattern of inadequate social support among certain subgroups of Pakistani burn patients. Addressing these inequities in the provision of social support must be prioritized as part of the global burn care agenda. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

Inequitable opportunities in reproductive and maternal health care services in armed conflict and forced displacement settings in Colombia	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Objectives This paper assesses inequalities in access to reproductive and maternal health services among females affected by forced displacement and sexual and gender-based violence in conflict settings in Colombia. This was accomplished through the following approaches: first, we assessed the gaps and gradients in three selected reproductive and maternal health care services. Second, we analyzed the patterns of inequalities in reproductive and maternal health care services and changes over time. And finally, we identified challenges and strategies for reaching girls and women who are the hardest to reach in conflict settings, in order to accelerate progress towards universal health coverage and to contribute to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals of good health and well-being and gender equality by 2030. Methods Three types of data were required: data about health outcomes (relating to rates of females affected by conflict), information about reproductive and maternal health care services to provide a social dimension to unmask inequalities (unmet needs in family planning, antenatal care and skilled births attendance); and data on the female population. Data sources used include the National Information System for Social Protection, the National Registry of Victims, the National Administrative Department of Statistics, and Demographic Health Survey at three specific time points: 2005, 2010 and 2015. We estimated the slope index of inequality to express absolute inequality (gaps) and the concentration index to expresses relative inequality (gradients), and to understand whether inequality was eliminated over time. Results Our findings show that even though absolute health care service-related inequalities dropped over time, relative inequalities worsened or remain unchanged. All summary measures still indicated the existence of inequalities as well as common patterns. Our findings suggest that there is a pattern of marginal exclusion and incremental patterns of inequality in the reproductive and maternal health care service provided to female affected by armed conflict. Conclusions Overall, the effects of conflict continue to threaten reproductive and maternal health in Colombia, impeding progress towards the realization of universal health care (UHC) and reinforcing already-existing inequities. Key messages and steps forward include the need to understand the two distinct patterns of inequalities identified in this study in order to prompt improved general policy responses. Addressing unmet needs in reproductive and maternal health requires supporting gender equality and prioritizing the girls and women in regions with the highest rates of victims of armed conflict, with the objective of leaving no girl or woman behind. This analysis represents the first attempt to analyze coverage-related inequality in reproductive and maternal health care services for female affected by armed conflict in Colombia. As the World Health Organization and global health systems leaders call for more inclusive engagement, this approach may serve as the key to shaping people-centred health systems. In this particular case, health care facilities must be located in close proximity to girls and women in conflict and post-conflict settings in order to deliver essential reproductive and maternal health care services. Finally, reducing inequalities in opportunities would not only promote equity, but also drive sustainable development.

Results from Immigrant Women from Southeast Asian Countries in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF IMMIGRANT AND MINORITY HEALTH			English	Article						Health immigrant effect; Acculturative stress; Depressive symptoms; Immigrant; Family functioning	SOCIAL SUPPORT; UNITED-STATES; NONREFERRED ADOLESCENTS; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; ENGLISH PROFICIENCY; MEXICAN-AMERICANS; MENTAL-DISORDERS; LATINO GROUPS; LIFE EVENTS	In this study we examine whether there is healthy immigrant effect among women immigrated to Taiwan through transnational marriage. A sample of immigrant women (N = 246) with original nativity of Southeast Asian countries and Taiwanese-born women sample (N = 201) was recruited from December 2008 to December 2009. Their depressive symptoms, acculturative stresses and family functioning were assessed by a series of questionnaires. Immigrant women had lower depressive scores than their native-born counterparts when other potential confounders were controlled for in the multiple regression model. Our findings suggest that the healthy immigrant effect exists among immigrant women in Taiwan. Although such effect may due to immigrant women is a highly selective population with hardy mental characteristics, it is crucial to improve immigrant women's mental health by helping them to enhance the ability of expressing emotions between family members as well as by mitigating socioeconomic inequality of cross-cultural immigrant families.

Exposures to ACEs make individuals more susceptible to conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers, and depression. Many of these conditions do not appear until sometime in adolescence or adulthood and have been linked to premature death. Objective: This study explores the association between the number and type of exposure to ACEs in women (mothers) who experienced intimate partner violence and health outcomes. Specifically, it explores the association between maternal ACEs and maternal perceived health and maternal mental and behavioral health. This study also explores the association between ACEs and child behavior. Methods: This analysis is part of a 7-year prospective study. A cohort of 300 mother-child pairs was assessed at baseline and every 4 months after reaching out for shelter or justice services for the very first time after being in an abusive intimate relationship. Results: Data document individual mothers' ACE scores and show a trend at 12 months, 24 months, and is most significant at 36 months. Additionally, at 36 months, higher ACE scores were significantly associated with all child behavioral subscales (anxiety, depression, aggressive behavior, attention problems, internalizing, externalizing). Conclusion: The women in this study reported ACE scores consistently higher than national rates. Our data highlight the added benefit of using ACE criteria as a global prevention strategy to identify those most at risk for delayed mental and behavioral health issues and to intervene with supportive strategies and guided referrals as indicated.

J	McMorrow, S; Saksena, J				McMorrow, Shannon; Saksena, Jyotika			Voices and Views of Congolese Refugee Women: A Qualitative Exploration to Inform Health Promotion and Reduce Inequities	HEALTH EDUCATION & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						community-based participatory research; global health; health disparities; immigration health; Midwestern United States; photovoice; qualitative methods; women's health	PHOTOVOICE	Refugees have recently been thrust into the spotlight worldwide. The strikingly negative rhetoric currently surrounding refugees calls for increased action from public health educators. In 2016, the largest proportion of refugees to the United States came from the Democratic Republic of Congo. This presents the opportunity to explore health needs as Congolese refugees resettle in the United States, with women taking priority due to health disparities linked to gender-based discrimination, trauma, sexual and gender-based violence, lower literacy rates, and less access to learning English. Insight into experiences of Congolese women in the United States is critical for the proactive development of socioculturally relevant health promotion rather than reaction interventions once health inequities are exacerbated. Therefore, to better understand perceptions and experiences of Congolese women in Indianapolis related to health and health care, a community-based participatory research study with an anthropological approach was conducted in collaboration with a refugee resettlement agency utilizing photovoice and semistructured interviews. Sixteen women participated in six photovoice sessions and home-based interviews. Selected photos, photo stories, and interview transcripts were analyzed using ethnographic content analysis. Major themes were health care system issues, social support, and daily experiences of health. Findings provide needed insight into the sociocultural context of health for Congolese refugees in the United States for both health educators and resettlement agencies. Findings also revealed specific priority areas for culturally tailoring health education and assets on which to build when promoting health for this population. Additionally, lessons were learned about the power of an anthropological, community-based participatory research approach to qualitative research for promoting health equity.

To further develop the largely conceptual framework, we tested its guidance against the experience of the Maternal and Neonatal Implementation for Equitable Health Systems (Manifest) project, which was performed in rural Uganda by researchers from Makerere University. We conducted 21 in-depth interviews with investigators and research implementers, directly observed study sites, and reviewed study-related documents. Our analysis identifies where alignment exists between the framework's guidance and the Manifest project, providing initial lessons on how that was achieved. It also identifies where nonalignment occurred and gaps in the framework's guidance. Suggestions are then made for revising and expanding "research for health justice."

J	Seymour, J				Seymour, Jane			The Impact of Public Health Awareness Campaigns on the Awareness and Quality of Palliative Care	JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						advance care planning; palliative care; public health campaigns; quality of care	OF-LIFE CARE; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT; SOCIAL MEDIA; HOME-CARE; END; KNOWLEDGE; POPULATION; PREFERENCES; DEATH; INTERVENTIONS	Objective: The right to health includes a right of access to good quality palliative care, but inequalities persist. Raising awareness is a key plank of the public health approach to palliative care, but involves consideration of subjects most of us prefer not to address. This review addresses the question: "do public health awareness campaigns effectively improve the awareness and quality of palliative care''? Background: The evidence shows that public awareness campaigns can improve awareness of palliative care and probably improve quality of care, but there is a lack of evidence about the latter. Methods: Rapid review and synthesis. Results: A comprehensive public awareness campaign about palliative care (including advance care planning and end-of-life decision making) should be based on clear and shared terminology, use well piloted materials, and the full range of mass media to suit different ages, cultures, and religious/spiritual perspectives. Arts and humanities have a role to play in allowing individuals and communities to express experiences of illness, death, and grief and encourage conversation and thoughtful reflection. There is evidence about key factors for success: targeting, networking, and use of specific, measurable, achievable, realistic time-bound objectives; continuous evaluation; and complementarity to national and international policy. Discussion: Campaigns should be located within the framework of public health promotion and the synergy between short national mass media campaigns and longer term local community action initiatives carefully considered. National and local projects to raise awareness should identify and address any barriers at the level of individuals, communities, and systems of care, for example, literacy skills and unequal access to resources.

The influence of the social and cultural environment on maternal mortality in Nigeria: Evidence from the 2013 demographic and health survey	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHILD HEALTH; SERVICES; DEATHS; CARE	Introduction Reducing maternal mortality remains a priority for global health. One in five maternal deaths, globally, are from Nigeria. Objective This study aimed to assess the sociocultural correlates of maternal mortality in Nigeria. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of nationally representative data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. The analysis was based on responses from the core women's questionnaire. Maternal mortality was categorized as 'yes' for any death while pregnant, during delivery or two months after delivery (as reported by the sibling), and 'no' for deaths of other or unknown causes. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to test for association between maternal mortality and predictor variables of sociocultural status (educational attainment, community women's education, region, type of residence, religion, and women's empowerment). Results Region, Religion, and the level of community women's education were independently associated with maternal mortality. Women in the North West were more than twice as likely to report maternal mortality (OR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.42-3.23) compared to those in the North Central region. Muslim women were 52% more likely to report maternal deaths (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.10-2.11) compared to Christian women. Respondents living in communities where a significant proportion of women have at least secondary schooling were 33% less likely to report that their sisters died of pregnancy-related causes (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.48-0.95). Conclusion Efforts to reduce maternal mortality should implement tailored programs that address barriers to health-seeking behavior influenced by cultural beliefs and attitudes, and low educational attainment. Strategies to improve women's agency should be at the core of these programs; they are essential for reducing maternal mortality and achieving sustainable development goals towards gender equality. Future studies should develop empirically evaluated measures which assess, and further investigate the association between women's empowerment and maternal health status and outcomes.

Linking the Governance of Research Consortia to Global Health Justice: A Case Study of Future Health Systems	JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS			English	Article							ETHICS; EQUITY	Global health research partnerships are increasingly taking the form of consortia. Recent scholarship has proposed what features of governance may be necessary for these consortia to advance justice in global health. That guidance purports three elements of global health research consortia are essential their research priorities, research capacity development strategies, research translation strategies and should be structured to promote the health of the worst-off globally. This paper adopted a reflective equilibrium approach, testing the proposed ethical guidance against the experience of a global health research consortium with equity objectives. Case study research was performed with Future Health Systems (FHS), a health systems research consortium funded over two phases. Data on FHS Phase-2 were gathered through in-depth interviews with steering committee members and junior researchers and collection of consortium-related documents. Thematic analysis of the data for consistency with the proposed guidance generated recommendations for how the guidance might be better articulated and identified areas where it could usefully be expanded. Factors facilitating FHS alignment with the ethical guidance were also identified, including early engagement and partnership with low and middle-income country stakeholders, the learning developed during FHS Phase-1, and aspects of the grant program funding it.

Our evaluation finds that governance of collaborative research partnerships, and in particular capacity building, in resource-constrained settings is limited but has improved with the implementation guidance of the International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Humans by The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) (2016). However, more clarity is needed in national legislation, industry and ethics guidelines, and regulatory provisions to address the structural inequities and power imbalances inherent in international health research partnerships. Most notably, ethical partnership governance is not supported by the principal industry ethics guidelines - the International Conference on Harmonization Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceutical for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). Given the strategic value of ICH-GCP guidelines in defining the role and responsibility of global health research partners, we conclude that such governance should stipulate the minimal requirements for creating an equitable environment of inclusion, mutual learning, transparency and accountability. Procedurally, this can be supported by i) shared research agenda setting with local leadership, ii) capacity assessments, and iii) construction of a memorandum of understanding (MoU). Moreover, the requirement of capacity building needs to be coordinated amongst partners to support good collaborative practice and deliver on the public health goals of the research enterprise; improving local conditions of health and reducing global health inequality. In this respect, and in order to develop consistency between sources of research governance, ICH-GCP should reference CIOMS ethical guidelines as the established standard for collaborative partnership. Moreover, greater commitment and support should be given to co-ordinate, strengthen and enforce local laws requiring equitable research partnerships and health system strengthening.

J	Harris, P; Viliani, F				Harris, Patrick; Viliani, Francesca			Strategic health assessment for large scale industry development activities: An introduction	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW			English	Article							IMPACT ASSESSMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; LOCAL-LEVEL; POLICY; NEED	Attention to the determinants of health and health equity in impact assessment remains under-utilised at the project, Environmental Impact Assessment, level. Determinants focussed health impact assessment has developed at an upstream, policy level, but tends to assess draft proposals rather than form the basis of policies and plans. Project level health (risk) impact assessment tends to focus on a project by project basis, and generally eschews a broad model of health. One answer to this 'health and impact assessment' problem is to shift attention to the strategic level, in a similar manner to, and learning from, the development of Strategic Environmental Assessment and its theoretical and practical derivatives. In this article we explain the need for this shift both conceptually and practically by navigating the literature. Our analysis derives specifically from developing the Strategic Health Impact Assessment section of new international industry HIA guidance, coupled with work in and around health impact assessment and policy analysis for the past decade. We develop characteristics of conducting strategic health assessments for multiple industry development activities at the supra national, national or regional level. Our intended audience are public administrators, industry planners and financial sector investors. A particular focus is low and middle income countries, now seen by industry as emerging markets.

The inclusion of sex-disaggregated targets and targets to combat gender inequality is important given the high disease burden among young women and adolescent girls in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet no comprehensive gender-focused analysis of NSP targets has been performed. This analysis quantitatively evaluates national HIV targets, included in NSPs from eighteen Sub-Saharan African countries, for sex-disaggregation. Additionally, NSP targets aimed at reducing gender-based inequality in health outcomes are compiled and inductively coded to report common themes. On average, in the eighteen countries included in this analysis, 31% of NSP targets include sex-disaggregation (range 0-92%). Three countries disaggregated a majority (> 50%) of their targets by sex. Sex-disaggregation in data reporting was more common for targets related to the early phases of the HIV care continuum: 83% of countries included any sex-disaggregated targets for HIV prevention, 56% for testing and linkage to care, 22% for improving antiretroviral treatment coverage, and 11% for retention in treatment. The most common target to reduce gender inequality was to prevent gender-based violence (present in 50% of countries). Other commonly incorporated target areas related to improving women's access to family planning, human and legal rights, and decision-making power. The inclusion of sex-disaggregated targets in national planning is vital to ensure that programmes make progress for all population groups. Improving the availability and quality of indicators to measure gender inequality, as well as evaluating programme outcomes by sex, is critical to tracking this progress. This analysis reveals an urgent need to set specific and separate targets for men and women in order to achieve an equitable and effective HIV response and align government planning with international priorities for gender equality.

A global map of travel time to cities to assess inequalities in accessibility in 2015	NATURE			English	Article							AFRICA	The economic and man-made resources that sustain human wellbeing are not distributed evenly across the world, but are instead heavily concentrated in cities. Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of 'leaving no one behind' established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations(1). This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago(2), predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9% of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7% of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity.	[Weiss, D.

Design Systematic review. Data sources Published and unpublished reports identified by searching seven electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus) and grey literature sources. Study selection Systematic search for and appraisal of cross-sectional or longitudinal studies that assessed e-cigarette awareness, ever use' or current use, and included subgroup analysis of 1 or more PROGRESS Plus sociodemographic groups. No geographical or time restrictions imposed. Assessment by multiple reviewers, with 17% of full articles screened meeting the selection criteria. Data extraction Data extracted and checked by multiple reviewers, with quality assessed using an adapted tool developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data synthesis Results of narrative synthesis suggest broadly that awareness, ever use' and current use of e-cigarettes may be particularly prevalent among older adolescents and younger adults, males, people of white ethnicity andparticularly in the case of awareness and ever use'those of intermediate or high levels of education. In some cases, results also varied within and between countries. Conclusions E-cigarette awareness, ever use' and current use appear to be patterned by a number of sociodemographic factors which vary between different countries and subnational localities. Care will therefore be required to ensure neither the potential benefits nor the potential risks of e-cigarettes exacerbate existing health inequalities.

Modifying a Risk Assessment Instrument for Youthful Offenders	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY			English	Article						youthful offenders; incarceration; risk assessment; adult corrections; measurement	COURT-INVOLVED YOUTH; PREDICTIVE-VALIDITY; JUVENILE JUSTICE; FAMILY PROCESSES; MENTAL-HEALTH; INDICATORS; LIVES; GENDER; NEED; ADOLESCENTS	High rates of incarceration in the United States are compounded by high rates of recidivism and prison return. One solution is more accurate identification of individual prisoner risks and needs to promote offender rehabilitation and successful community re-entry; this is particularly important for youthful offenders who developmentally are in late adolescence or early adulthood, and who struggle to reengage in education and/or employment after release. Thus, this study examined the feasibility of administration and initial psychometric properties of a risk and needs assessment instrument originally created for a juvenile justice population (the Global Risk Assessment Device or GRAD) with 895 male youthful offenders in one adult correctional system. Initial feasibility of implementation within the correctional system was demonstrated; confirmatory factor analyses support the invariance of the modified GRAD factor structure across age and race. Future studies are needed to examine the predictive validity and the sensitivity of the instrument.

The Option B+ strategy took the extraordinary step of treating many non-pregnant women living with HIV (those with CD4 cell counts >350 cells/mm(3)) in the absence of evidence that they themselves would benefit from ART. This example of so-called AIDS exceptionalism reflects an understanding that the global response to HIV demands a different set of morals. This philosophical article explores a retrospective analysis of the ethical arguments made in support of Option B+ incorporating utilitarian, feminist and equity-based frameworks. A number of inconsistencies were found in the arguments made for the introduction of Option B+ well before results were available from the START and TEMPRANO trials. Although some people think 'the ends justify the means', we conclude that erroneous justifications were initially given in support of Option B+. We identify tensions that remain in light of these results and argue that future strategies would benefit from a community-focused, human rights-based approach.

J	Goodwin, L; Hunter, B; Jones, A				Goodwin, Laura; Hunter, Billie; Jones, Aled			The midwife-woman relationship in a South Wales community: Experiences of midwives and migrant Pakistani women in early pregnancy	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						health-care relationships; immigration; inequality; maternity; midwifery; migrant women; pregnancy	MATERNITY CARE; INEQUALITIES; ATTITUDES; VIEWS; UK; PROFESSIONALS; EXPECTATIONS; MORBIDITY; PROVIDERS; SERVICES	BackgroundIn 2015, 27.5% of births in England and Wales were to mothers born outside of the UK. Compared to their White British peers, minority ethnic and migrant women are at a significantly higher risk of maternal and perinatal mortality, along with lower maternity care satisfaction. Existing literature highlights the importance of midwife-woman relationships in care satisfaction and pregnancy outcomes; however, little research has explored midwife-woman relationships for migrant and minority ethnic women in the UK. MethodsA focused ethnography was conducted in South Wales, UK, including semi-structured interviews with 9 migrant Pakistani participants and 11 practising midwives, fieldwork in the local migrant Pakistani community and local maternity services, observations of antenatal appointments, and reviews of relevant media. Thematic data analysis was undertaken concurrently with data collection. FindingsThe midwife-woman relationship was important for participants' experiences of care. Numerous social and ecological factors influenced this relationship, including family relationships, culture and religion, differing health-care systems, authoritative knowledge and communication of information. Marked differences were seen between midwives and women in the perceived importance of these factors. ConclusionsFindings provide new theoretical insights into the complex factors contributing to the health-care expectations of pregnant migrant Pakistani women in the UK. These findings may be used to create meaningful dialogue between women and midwives, encourage women's involvement in decisions about their health care and facilitate future midwifery education and research. Conclusions are relevant to a broad international audience, as achieving better outcomes for migrant and ethnic minority communities is of global concern.

J	Yadav, SS; Lal, R				Yadav, S.

The geographic coverage of the literature is global but with specific examples from India. The information presented in this paper is derived from diverse sources including journal articles and thematic books, and indicates severe adverse impacts not only on women's livelihood opportunities but also on exacerbating the workload and fatigue while decreasing their self esteem and forcing them to undertake some high risks and hazardous activities. The literature indicates that poverty, gender inequality, insecure land rights, heavy reliance on agriculture, less access to education and information are among the principal reasons for their vulnerability to climate change. The vulnerability is also confounded by the meager asset base, social marginalization, lack of mobility and exclusion from the decision-making processes in response to a disaster. However, the literature also shows that women are not only the passive victims of climate change but are also pro-active and agents of hope for adaptation to and mitigation of abrupt climate change. They utilize their experience and expertise to reduce the adverse impacts by adopting prudent strategies. They are also concerned about environmental issues, and are highly supportive of policies regarding environmental restoration. Large knowledge gaps exist regarding the vulnerability of women to changing and uncertain climate especially in arid regions. Authors of this article suggest some action plans and strategies to minimize vulnerability to climate change such as empowering women economically and educationally, organizing training and outreach programmes, and involving them in formal climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and programmes. Authors also outline research needed in order to identify and implement strategies regarding climate change. Collective and continuous efforts are critical to finding the sustainable solutions for this global phenomenon which is adversely impacting the most vulnerable but critically important members of the society.

BackgroundThere is international evidence to support the case that LGBT patients with cancer are less likely to report poor health or self-disclose sexual orientation. Gender-specific cancers, such as prostate cancer, require particular interventions in terms of supportive care. These may include advice about side-effect management (such as incontinence or erectile dysfunction), treatment choices and social and emotional issues. In this paper, we discuss and analyse the heteronormative assumptions and culture that exist around this cancer. We argue that this situation may act as a barrier to effective supportive care for all Lesbian women, Gay, Transgender and Bisexual patients, in this case men who have sex with men.[Correction added on 21 September 2017, after first online publication: The first sentence of the Background section has been revised for clarity in this current version.] DesignTheoretical exploration of heteronormativity considered against the clinical context of prostate cancer. MethodsIdentification and inclusion of relevant international evidence combined with clinical discussion. ResultsThis paper posits a number of questions around heteronormativity in relation to prostate cancer information provision, supportive care and male sexuality. While assumptions regarding sexual orientation should be avoided in clinical encounters, this may be difficult when heteronormative assumptions dominate. Existing research supports the assertion that patient experience, including the needs of LGBT patients, should be central to service developments. ConclusionAssumptions about sexual orientation should be avoided and recorded accurately and sensitively, and relational models of care should be promoted at the start of cancer treatment in an appropriate manner. These may assist in reducing the risks of embarrassment or offence to nonheterosexual patients, or to professionals who may adopt heteronormative assumptions. Relevance to clinical practiceHaving an awareness of the risks of making heteronormative assumptions in clinical practice will be useful for all health professionals engaged in prostate cancer care. This awareness can prevent embarrassment or upset for patients and ensure a more equitable provision of service, including men with prostate cancer who do not identify as heterosexual.

J	de Andrade, EA; Franceschini, MCT				de Andrade, Elisabete Agrela; Trousdell Franceschini, Maria Cristina			The right to the city and International Urban Agendas: a document analysis	CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA			English	Article						City planning; Health promotion; Equity; Public policies; Healthy cities		Considering social, economic and demographic issues, living in the city implies inadequate living conditions, social exclusion, inequities and other problems to the population. At the same time, the city is a setting of cultural, social and affective production. As a result, there is a need to reflect on the right to the city and its relationship with promoting the health of its inhabitants. To that effect, urban agendas have been developed to address the city's ambiguity. This paper aims to analyze four of these agendas through the lenses of Health Promotion. A qualitative document review approach was conducted on urban agendas proposed by international organizations and applied to the Brazilian context: Healthy Cities, Sustainable Cities, Smart Cities and Educating Cities. Results indicate some level of effort by the analyzed agendas to assume social participation, intersectoriality and the territory as central to addressing exclusion and inequities. However, more in-depth discussions are required on each of these concepts. We conclude that urban agendas can contribute greatly toward consolidating the right to the city, provided that their underpinning concepts are critically comprehended.

CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA			English	Article						Poverty; Social vulnerability; Sustainable development; Equity; Health promotion		The right to a dignified life for all requires overcoming the challenges imposed on the most vulnerable groups, and poverty is one of the oldest and most devastating phenomena. Listening to them is essential to create remediating opportunities. This study aims to identify characteristics of this listening in the context of health promotion and the Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs, an international effort to support the fight against poverty, among others. In an integrative review of literature, conducted through the search terms of Poverty, Right to the City, Equity Policy and Identification of Poverty, 86 studies that listened to vulnerable groups, such as women, children, adolescents, adults, the elderly, families and drug users, all poor and low-skilled workers were analyzed. Each strategy shown was related to one or more SDGs. The recurrent strategies in the studies analyzed were increased social protection and spaces to listen to vulnerable groups, as well as public policies that enabled the fight against poverty. Equity must be thought of in the context of comprehensive and universalizing rights policies, overcoming fragmented and focal policies that fail to address the structural causes of poverty and human exploitation.

This study aimed to broaden listening methods to facilitate dialogue with people in situations of physical frailty and removal from their work activities, using Photovoice, a participatory research-action method, as a tool and Health Promotion's theoretical framework. Images captured and reports that accompanied them consisted of the material of this study. Two thematic categories stood out: the expert decision; and physical condition: vanity, power and hope. Labor activity is perceived as a determinant of individuals' introduction in their environment and defines their role in the family and in the social field.

Brucellosis remains a neglected disease in the developing world: a call for interdisciplinary action	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Brucellosis; Brucella; One health; Zoonosis; Infectious disease; Global health (10 maximum)	RISK-FACTORS; BOVINE BRUCELLOSIS; INCOME COUNTRIES; HEALTH; LIVESTOCK; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRANSMISSION; ANIMALS; HUMANS; IMPACT	Background: Brucellosis is an endemic zoonotic disease in most of the developing world that causes devastating losses to the livestock industry and small-scale livestock holders. Infected animals exhibit clinical signs that are of economic significance to stakeholders and include reduced fertility, abortion, poor weight gain, lost draught power, and a substantial decline in milk production. In humans, brucellosis typically manifests as a variety of non-specific clinical signs. Chronicity and recurring febrile conditions, as well as devastating complications in pregnant women are common sequelae. Discussion: In regions where the disease is endemic, brucellosis has far-reaching and deleterious effects on humans and animals alike. Deeply entrenched social misconceptions and fear of government intervention contribute to this disease continuing to smolder unchecked in most of the developing world, thereby limiting economic growth and inhibiting access to international markets. The losses in livestock productivity compromise food security and lead to shifts in the cognitive competency of the working generation, influence the propagation of gender inequality, and cause profound emotional suffering in farmers whose herds are affected. The acute and chronic symptoms of the disease in humans can result in a significant loss of workdays and a decline in the socioeconomic status of infected persons and their families from the associated loss of income. The burden of the disease to society includes significant human healthcare costs for diagnosis and treatment, and non-healthcare costs such as public education efforts to reduce disease transmission. Conclusion: Brucellosis places significant burdens on the human healthcare system and limits the economic growth of individuals, communities, and nations where such development is especially important to diminish the prevalence of poverty. The implementation of public policy focused on mitigating the socioeconomic effects of brucellosis in human and animal populations is desperately needed. When developing a plan to mitigate the associated consequences, it is vital to consider both the abstract and quantifiable effects. This requires an interdisciplinary and collaborative, or One Health, approach that consists of public education, the development of an infrastructure for disease surveillance and reporting in both veterinary and medical fields, and campaigns for control in livestock and wildlife species.

We assess whether residents in a sub-tropical Australian city perceive green infrastructure as an effective climate adaptation response for reducing vulnerability to heat stress. Gold Coast City has pursued urban densification policies, such as reducing block sizes and increasing building heights, to accommodate rapid population growth. Little attention has been given to the combined impact of local heat island effects and global climate change upon lower-income residents in the city's suburban fringe, including rising energy costs associated with cooling homes. The study has three aims: to assess whether social disadvantage is associated with (1) concern about climate change impacts; (2) perceptions about the potential of green infrastructure to offer potential climate adaptive benefits; and (3) the desire for more urban greening in a working class suburb. We used a mail-back survey to elicit information related to cooling dwellings, awareness of, and concern about, climate change impacts, perceptions of the benefits of green infrastructure, and desire for more urban greening. Results indicate that despite their vulnerability to heat stress, comparatively disadvantaged residents are no more concerned about climate change; nor are they any more inclined to encourage local government to enhance neighbourhood greenery. These residents are, if anything, less likely to perceive benefits of urban greening. Our findings indicate that cultivating support for green infrastructure in disadvantaged neighbourhoods will require parallel efforts to redress inequality.

By examining gendered roles, responsibilities and norms through the lens of gender analysis, we can develop an in-depth understanding of social power differentials, and be better able to address gender inequalities and inequities within institutions and between men and women. When conducting gender analysis, tools and frameworks may help to aid community engagement and to provide a framework to ensure that relevant gendered nuances are assessed. The capacities and vulnerabilities approach (CVA) is one such gender analysis framework that critically considers gender and its associated roles, responsibilities and power dynamics in a particular community and seeks to meet a social need of that particular community. Although the original intent of the CVA was to guide humanitarian intervention and disaster preparedness, we adapted this framework to a different context, which focuses on identifying and addressing emerging problems and social issues in a particular community or area that affect their specific needs, such as an infectious disease outbreak or difficulty accessing health information and resources. We provide an example of our CVA adaptation, which served to facilitate a better understanding of how health-related disparities affect Maasai women in a remote, resource-poor setting in Northern Tanzania.

Toward consensus on self-management support: the international chronic condition self-management support framework	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						chronic illness; framework; collaboration; disease management	CHRONIC DISEASE; PROGRAMS; CARE; ETHICS	Self-management support (SMS) initiatives have been hampered by insufficient attention to underserved and disadvantaged populations, a lack of integration between health, personal and social domains, over emphasis on individual responsibility and insufficient attention to ethical issues. This paper describes a SMS framework that provides guidance in developing comprehensive and coordinated approaches to SMS that may address these gaps and provides direction for decision makers in developing and implementing SMS initiatives in key areas at local levels. The framework was developed by researchers, policy-makers, practitioners and consumers from 5 English-speaking countries and reviewed by 203 individuals in 16 countries using an e-survey process. While developments in SMS will inevitably reflect local and regional contexts and needs, the strategic framework provides an emerging consensus on how we need to move SMS conceptualization, planning and development forward. The framework provides definitions of self-management (SM) and SMS, a collective vision, eight guiding principles and seven strategic directions. The framework combines important and relevant SM issues into a strategic document that provides potential value to the SMS field by helping decision-makers plan SMS initiatives that reflect local and regional needs and by catalyzing and expanding our thinking about the SMS field in relation to system thinking; shared responsibility; health equity and ethical issues. The framework was developed with the understanding that our knowledge and experience of SMS is continually evolving and that it should be modified and adapted as more evidence is available, and approaches in SMS advance.

This paper provides a framework to examine the ethical and content quality of parenting resources. The ethical criteria were based on "the Health on the Net" (HON) framework whereas the content criteria were based on the Positive Parenting framework and the effectiveness of the learning materials used. The criteria were applied to a survey of international websites (n=100) for Spanish-speaking parents. Chi-square analyses showed that websites from Spain, official companies sites and information sites, as compared to South American, parents' and interactive sites, scored higher in the ethical criteria of privacy, authority, justifiability and financial disclosure. Hierarchical cluster analysis applied to content criteria showed that the High quality websites, unlike the Low quality ones, valued gender equality, a positive parental role, modeled a variety of parenting practices, educational contents with multimedia formats, and made use of experiential, academic and technical information. Privacy, financial disclosure and justifiability were more likely to be found in the High and Medium quality content clusters. In conclusion, the study illustrates some of the challenges of open knowledge and sets out the priority areas for quality improvement for website designers and for professionals who want to help parents develop effective skills for searching for trustworthy sources.

Persons suffering from musculoskeletal disorders benefit from early physiotherapy services. However, access to publicly funded physiotherapy services has been shown to be compromised by long waiting times and limited availability of resources in many countries around the world. Decisions on resource allocation may create geographic disparities in provision and access to services, which may result in inequity in access. Aims and objectivesThis study aimed to assess variations in demand and provision of publicly funded outpatient physiotherapy services across the province of Quebec, Canada, as well as to assess the demand to provision relationship. MethodsWe conducted a secondary analysis of data retrieved from the 2008 Quebec Health Survey and data obtained from a survey of hospitals in the province of Quebec in 2015. We used geographic information systems analyses and descriptive analyses to assess geographic variations and the relationship between demand and provision. ResultsOur results indicate substantial variations in the provision and demand for physiotherapy services in the province of Quebec. The variations in service provision did not follow the variations in demand. Long waiting times and insufficient provision of services were found in many regions. ConclusionsThe variations in provision of physiotherapy services between regions reported in our study did not correspond to the variations in demand. Such geographic variations and demand to provision mismatches may create inequity in access to services, especially for those unable to afford private services.

Thus, we must expand our knowledge on how city characteristics affect health and well-being. Perceptions about cities' resources and functioning might be related with health, as they capture subjective experiences of the residents. We characterized the health status of 74 European cities, using all-cause mortality as indicator, and investigated the association of mortality with residents' dissatisfaction with key domains of urban living. Methods: We considered 74 European cities from 29 countries. Aggregated data on residents' dissatisfaction was obtained from the Flash Eurobarometer, Quality of life in European cities (2004-2015). For each city a global dissatisfaction score and a dissatisfaction score by domain (environment, social, economic, healthcare, and infrastructures/services) were calculated. Data on mortality and population was obtained from the Eurostat. Standardized Mortality Ratios, SMR, and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% Cl) were calculated. The association between dissatisfaction scores and SMR was estimated using Generalized Linear Models. Results: SMR varied markedly (range: 73.2-146,5), being highest in Eastern Europe and lowest in the South and Western European cities. Residents' dissatisfaction levels also varied greatly. We found a significant association between city SMR and residents' dissatisfaction with healthcare (beta = 0.334; IC 95% 0.030-0.639) and social environment (beta = 0.239; IC 95% 0.015-0.464), No significant association was found with the dissatisfaction scores related with the physical and economic environment and the infrastructures/services. Conclusions: We found a significant association between city levels of mortality and residents' dissatisfaction with certain urban features, suggesting subjective assessments can be also used to comprehend urban health.

Income, egalitarianism and attitudes towards healthcare policy: a study on public attitudes in 29 countries	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						ISSP; Public attitude; Healthcare policy; Cross-national comparisons; Public funding	SOCIAL-WELFARE; UNITED-STATES; PREFERENCES; SUPPORT; EUROPE; REDISTRIBUTION; INEQUALITY; GOVERNMENT; PROVISION; SYSTEMS	Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between income and egalitarian values and attitudes towards healthcare policy. Study design: Cross-sectional and cross-national study. Methods: Data for 29 countries from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) 2011 were used. The dependent variables are a general attitude towards government involvement in healthcare provision and two attitudes regarding specific policies (taxes and public funding). Income and egalitarianism were also measured by using ISSP. Data were analysed using regression models that account for individual and country-level characteristics, and country-fixed effects. Results: The effect of income is small and non-significant for attitudes towards government involvement and public funding. For willingness to pay (WTP) taxes to improve healthcare services, we find a positive association with income. Results for egalitarianism suggest a positive association with government involvement in healthcare provision and significant interactions with WTP taxes. Conclusions: The distinction of dimensions and mechanisms underlying policy attitudes appears as relevant. Citizens across socioeconomic groups are motivated to support state-funded healthcare, favouring the design of non-selfish policies. These findings suggest that there is space for policymakers who seek to increase healthcare spending encouraging either policies for specific groups or broader institutional changes.

Many of these interventions foster positive parenting practices to improve children's chances of fulfilling their developmental potential. The practices are derived from attachment theory and presented as the universal standard of good care. But attachment-based parenting is typical primarily of people living Western lifestyles and runs counter to the different ways many people with other lifestyles care for their children given what they want for them. Thus, such parenting interventions involve encouraging caregivers to change their practices and views, usually with little understanding of how such changes affect child, family, and community. This undermines researchers' and practitioners' ability to honor promises to uphold ethic codes of respect and beneficence. Support for this claim is provided by comparing positive parenting practices advocated by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF; with the world health organization [WHO]) Care for Child Development (CCD) intervention with parenting practices typical of communities with rural, subsistence lifestylesthe most common of lifestyles worldwide and largely observed in LMICs. As UNICEF has a considerable presence in these countries, the CCD intervention was selected as a case study. In addition, parenting interventions typically target people who are poor, and the issues this raises regarding ethics of fairness and justice are considered. Recommendations are made for ways change agents can be sensitive to the living conditions and worldviews of communities, and, thus, be appropriately effective and ethically sensitive to the diverse needs of different communities.

Research investments for UK infectious disease research 1997-2013: A systematic analysis of awards to UK institutions alongside national burden of disease	JOURNAL OF INFECTION			English	Article						Funding; Investments; UK; Infection; Infectious disease; Financing		Introduction: Infectious disease remains a significant burden in the UK and the focus of significant amounts of research investment each year. The Research Investments in Global Health study has systematically assessed levels of funding for infection research, and here considers investment alongside UK burden of individual infectious diseases. Methods: The study included awards to UK institutions between 1997 and 2013 that were related to infectious disease. Awards related to global health projects were excluded here. UK burden data (mortality, years lived with disability, and disability adjusted life years) was sourced from the Global Burden of Disease study (IHME, USA). Awards were categorised by pathogen, disease, disease area and by type of science along the research pipeline (pre-clinical, phase I-III trials, product development, public health, cross-disciplinary research). New metrics present relative levels of funding by comparing sum investment with measures of disease burden. Results: There were 5685 relevant awards comprising investment of 2.4 pound billion. By disease, HIV received most funding (369.7m; pound 15.6% of the total investment). Pre-clinical science was the predominant type of science (1.6 pound billion, 68.7%), with the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) the largest funder (714.8 pound million, 30.1%). There is a broad temporal trend to increased fundingper annum. Antimicrobial resistance received (102.8 pound million, 4.2%), whilst sepsis received 23.6 pound million (1.0%). Compared alongside disease burden, acute hepatitis C and measles typically were relatively well-funded, whilst pneumonia, syphilis and gonorrhoea were poorly-funded. Conclusions: The UK has a broad research portfolio across a wide range of infectious diseases and disciplines. There are notable strengths including HIV, some respiratory infections and in pre-clinical science, though there was less funding for UK-relevant trials and public health research. Compared to the UK burden of disease, syphilis, gonorrhoea and pneumonia appear relatively neglected. Investment analyses can assist support policymakers to increase the equity of the UK R&D landscape. (C) 2017 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our objective was to survey the literature on informed consent in paediatric LMIC research, assessing for practical guidance for culturally and linguistically appropriate procedures. Methods We conducted a scoping review on informed consent in paediatric LMIC research searching the PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases. Eligible articles were published in English, from any date range, of any study design or format. Results The search identified 2027 references, of which 50 were included in the analysis following full-text review. Reviewed guidelines emphasised individual, informed and voluntary consent from parents and caregivers. Reviewed articles provided detailed practical guidance on adapting these guiding principles to LMIC settings, including considerations for community engagement, verbal or other alternative consent procedures for low-literacy settings or less commonly spoken languages and guarding against therapeutic misconception by caregivers. There was uncertainty, however, on how to best protect individual autonomy, especially when influenced by gender dynamics, leadership hierarchies or the social status of researchers themselves. There was, furthermore, limited research discussing the special case of research involving adolescents or of procedures for documenting assent by participating children. Conclusions A scoping review of paediatric research in LMICs revealed substantial guidance on several features of culturally appropriate informed consent. However, additional research and guidance is needed, especially in the areas of gender imbalances, research with adolescents and children's own assent to participate in research.

It represents a contract between the government and an NGP, detailing themechanisms and conditions by which the latter should provide health care on behalf of the government. Contracting out is intended to improve the delivery and use of healthcare services. This Review updates a Cochrane Review first published in 2009. Objectives To assess effects of contracting out governmental clinical health services to non-governmental service provider/ s, on (i) utilisation of clinical health services; (ii) improvement in population health outcomes; (iii) improvement in equity of utilisation of these services; (iv) costs and cost-effectiveness of delivering the services; and (v) improvement in health systems performance. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, ProQuest, and Global Health on 07 April 2017, along with two trials registers -ClinicalTrials. gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform -on 17 November 2017. Selection criteria Individually randomised and cluster-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series, and repeated measures studies, comparing government-delivered clinical health services versus those contracted out to NGPs, or comparing different models of non-governmental-delivered clinical health services. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened all records, extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias. We calculated the net effect for all outcomes. A positive value favours the intervention whilst a negative value favours the control. Effect estimates are presented with 95% confidence intervals. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and we prepared a Summary of Findings table. Main results We included two studies, a cluster-randomised trial conducted in Cambodia, and a controlled before-after study conducted in Guatemala. Both studies reported that contracting out over 12 months probably makes little or no difference in (i) immunisation uptake of children 12 to 24 months old (moderate-certainty evidence), (ii) the number of women who had more than two antenatal care visits (moderate-certainty evidence), and (iii) female use of contraceptives (moderate-certainty evidence). The Cambodia trial reported that contracting out may make little or no difference in the mortality over 12 months of children younger than one year of age (net effect = -4.3%, intervention effect P = 0.36, clustered standard error (SE) = 3.0%; low-certainty evidence), nor to the incidence of childhood diarrhoea (net effect = -16.2%, intervention effect P = 0.07, clustered SE = 19.0%; low-certainty evidence). The Cambodia study found that contracting out probably reduces individual out-of-pocket spending over 12 months on curative care (net effect = $ -19.25 (2003 USD), intervention effect P = 0.01, clustered SE = $ 5.12; moderate-certainty evidence). The included studies did not report equity in the use of clinical health services and in adverse effects.

The current global goals are: 1) World without poverty, 2) World without hunger, 3) Health and well-being, 4) Quality education, 5) Gender equality, 6) Clean water and sanitation, 7) Affordable and clean energy, 8) Decent work and economic growth, 9) Industry, innovation and infrastructure, 10) Reduced inequalities, 11) Sustainable cities and communities, 12) Responsible consumption and production, 13) Climate protection, 14) Preservation of life below water, 15) Preservation of life on land, 16) Peace, justice and strong institutions, and 17) Strengthening the global partnership for sustainable development. These goals are the guiding principles of today's globalized world. The issues associated with sustainable development are not exclusively related to a single scientific area or one group of scientific disciplines. The universal issues presented through the millennium and global goals are also the issues dealt with by kinesiology and all its applied sciences. Particular focus is on the issues pertaining to the formation of environmental awareness connected with a positive attitude toward health benefits of physical exercise. Kinesiology contents, aside from health benefits, the impact on the quality of education, and confirmed economic values are not in collision with other proclaimed goals of sustainable development, which is the only option that guarantees survival.

Early diagnosis and treatment can be achieved through screening, mainly mammographic; however, international experience has shown that women do not attend mammographic screening adequately. The aim of the present study was to investigate and assess the factors that affect demand for mammography by women to improve and enhance the use of mammography by women in Greece, especially those in the 50-70 age group. The data used in the analysis were extracted from the National Health Survey of 2009, conducted by the Hellenic Statistical Authority. The sample for the analysis included 2294 women aged 30-70 years. To investigate the factors that affect mammography use, binary logistic regression models were constructed for women in the 30-39, 40-49 and 50-70 age groups. 61.70% of the sample had ever undergone a mammogram, 46.80% of which were during the last 12 months. Factors associated with mammography use in at least one of the binary logistic regression models were pap-test, blood cholesterol test, level of education, income level and country of birth. In the 50-70 age group, income level [odds ratio (OR)=1.164; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.038, 1.305], blood cholesterol test ever (OR=6.096; 95% CI=2.498, 14.872) and pap-test (OR=20.148; 95% CI=11.264, 36.040) were found to be statistically significant predictors of mammography uptake. As mammography utilization in Greece is mostly opportunistic, it is necessary to organize screening provision to cover the majority of the population through nationally organized screening programmes, with a focus on women 50-70 years of age.

J	Marks, AK; McKenna, JL; Coll, CG				Marks, Amy K.; McKenna, John L.; Coll, Cynthia Garcia			National Immigration Receiving Contexts	EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article						national; policy; discrimination; immigrant; children; youth; well-being	MENTAL-HEALTH; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; INTEGRATIVE MODEL; REFUGEE YOUTH; DISCRIMINATION; CHILDREN; PARADOX; ORIGIN; ACCULTURATION; ASSOCIATIONS	Extraordinary increases in refugee and voluntary migration have recently been observed in many European and North American countries. At the same time, negative attitudes toward immigrants and unfavorable immigration-related policy changes are promoting national climates of increased discrimination, fear of deportation, and experiences of income and education inequality among many immigrant origin youth and families. This paper considers how national receiving contexts, in particular the efficacy of national immigration integration policies and markers of national attitudes toward immigrants, can shape both native-born youth and immigrant and refugee youth well-being. Using an ecological framework, we draw from the recent empirical literature and three sources of international policy and child well-being data, to assess how national receiving contexts matter for native-born children and immigrant youth adaptation. Results indicate strong linkages among the macro-level contexts of multicultural policies and positive integration approaches with overall child well-being. More favorable immigrant national attitudes, and the more micro-level perceptions of discrimination and xenophobia, also matter tremendously for immigrant and refugee youth adaptation and health outcomes.

The World Health Organization recognizes that viral hepatitis is not only a massive public health issue but also a huge opportunity to improve quality of life and equity at a global level. Viral hepatitis causes about 1.5 million deaths each year and significantly affects the quality of life of hundreds of millions of people. To date, frail individuals in high-income countries and people living in low-income settings are paying the heaviest tool.Areas covered. Here we present a broad discussion on current knowledge and topical issues about the hepatitis pandemic. The report includes a structured overview of global epidemiology, including the definition of specific local epidemic profiles for each hepatitis agents (HAV, HBV, HCV, and HEV), and a perspective about the critical actions needed for achieving a complete control.Expert commentary. The control of viral hepatitis is currently, ethically urgent and even economically convenient. There is a wide consensus that viral hepatitis can be controlled through comprehensive intervention tailored on local needs addressing the issue of viral hepatitis as a unique public health issue. These strategies should include: (1) primary prevention (including vaccination and improved infection control), (2) improving diagnosis rate, and (3) management of existing cases of infections.

J	Malta, M				Malta, Monica			Human rights and political crisis in Brazil: Public health impacts and challenges	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Brazil; human rights; public health; policy; gender	CONTEXT; POLICY; HARM; CARE	In 31 August 2016, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff was impeached and replaced by her vice president Michel Temer. Herein, we examine how the conservative agenda of Mr Temer and his supporters is influencing key decisions in the human rights and public health arena in Brazil. The government's austerity agenda includes severe cuts in critical areas such as health, education and science, jeopardising well-known strategies such as the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) and nationwide cash transfer program, Bolsa Familia' - both benefited millions and were the largest of their kind in the world. Mr Temer's decisions show not only severe cuts in critical areas but also a political agenda that clearly demonstrates a broad shift away from the progressivism and social agenda presented and supported by its predecessors. Most vulnerable groups such as the LGBTQ community, women, people who use drugs and disenfranchised communities have been severely affected. Mr Temer's administration is putting Brazil far from its once nationwide goal to foster free and universal health care access and social equity for all its citizens. The near future for Brazil is unknown, but both national and international communities anticipate severe problems within the national human rights arena, if nothing changes.Abbreviations: CCT: Conditional Cash Transfer; LGBTQ: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (and/or Questioning); SUS: Brazilian Public Health System	[Malta, Monica] Fiocruz MS, ENSP, Sergio Arouca Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Social Sci Dept, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Malta, Monica] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav & Soc, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA	Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health	Malta, M (corresponding author), Fiocruz MS, ENSP, Sergio Arouca Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Social Sci Dept, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.; Malta, M (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav & Soc, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.	mmalta2@alumni.jh.edu	Malta, Monica/AAE-2537-2020; Malta, Monica/F-2312-2013	Malta, Monica/0000-0001-7634-6671					44	7	7	1	4	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	1744-1692	1744-1706		GLOB PUBLIC HEALTH	Glob.

However, the health care system has often been neglected in this area of study. The current study promotes a health care regime approach that is influenced by WRT and incorporates analysis of the level of health care de-commodification and health equity. Three types of health care regimes were identified in the development of the health care system in urban China: the State Medical Security Model, the Selective Medical Security Model and the Selective + Residual Medical Security Model. This approach provides useful policy implications for the health care reform currently taking place in China. In addition, this analysis contributes to theories in the comparative health policy literature.

The World Health Organization has been especially important in driving the age-friendly agenda, notably through its global network of age-friendly cities and communities. Despite the expansion and achievements of the network, challenges remain in responding to the growth of inequality and the impact of economic austerity on aging policies. Against the background of these limitations, this article sets out a manifesto for the age-friendly movement aimed at raising the aspirations of what is now a worldwide movement. The areas covered in the manifesto are challenging social inequality, widening participation, coproducing and codesigning age-friendly communities, encouraging multisectorial and multidisciplinary collaboration, and integrating research with policy. The article concludes with a discussion on developing age-friendly work as a contribution to a new agenda for urban aging.

ContextThis paper presents a conceptual synthesis of current efforts in medical education to incorporate national health priorities as a reflection on how the field has evolved since the Edinburgh Declaration. Considering that health needs vary from country to country, our paper focuses on three broad and cross-cutting themes: health equity, health systems strengthening, and changing patterns of disease. MethodsConsidering the complexity of this topic, we conducted a targeted search to broadly sample and critically review the literature in two phases. Phase 1: within each theme, we assessed the current challenges in the field of medical education to meet the health priority. Phase 2: a search for various strategies in undergraduate and postgraduate education that have been tested in an effort to address the identified challenges. We conducted a qualitative synthesis of the literature followed by mapping of the identified challenges within each of the three themes with targeted efforts. FindingsWe identified six important challenges: (i) mismatch between the need for generalist models of health care and medical education curricula's specialist focus; (ii) attitudes of health care providers contributing to disparities in health care; (iii) the lack of a universal approach in preparing medical students for 21st century health systems; (iv) the inability of medical education to keep up with the abundance of new health care technologies; (v) a mismatch between educational requirements for integrated care and poorly integrated, specialised health care systems; and (vi) development of a globally interdependent education system to meet global health challenges. Examples of efforts being made to address these challenges are offered. DiscussionAlthough strategies for combatting these challenges exist, the effectiveness of educational models depends on them being locally adaptable and applicable. Curricular reform must go hand-in-hand with research and evaluation to develop comprehensive futuristic models of teaching and learning that will adequately prepare health professionals to address the challenges. As a reflection on the Edinburgh Declaration, this conceptual synthesis presents six important challenges in relation to the role of medical education in meeting current national health priorities	[Nair, Manisha] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Richard Doll Bldg,Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Fellmeth, Gracia] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford, England	University of Oxford; University of Oxford	Nair, M (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Richard Doll Bldg,Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England.	manisha.nair@npeu.ox.ac.uk		Nair, Manisha/0000-0003-0660-5054					39	11	12	1	9	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0308-0110	1365-2923		MED EDUC	Med.

This need for veterinarians trained in global health is reflected by the demand among students for greater exposure and education. At the same time, many students are held back from on-site training in global health due to constraints of cost, time, or family obligations. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of a telemedicine approach to educating veterinary students at Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. This approach simultaneously provides expert consultation and support for a pro bono hospital in the developing world. The development of a telemedicine teaching service is discussed, from initial ad hoc email consultation among friends and associates to a more formal use of store-and-forward delivery of data along with real-time videoconferencing on a regular basis, termed tele-rounds. The practicalities of data delivery and exchange and best use of available bandwidth are also discussed, as this very mundane information is critical to efficient and useful tele-rounds. Students are able to participate in discussion of cases that they would never see in their usual clinical sphere and to become familiar with diagnostic and treatment approaches to these cases. By having the patient "virtually" brought to us, tele-rounds also decrease the usual carbon footprint of global health delivery.

Contrary to traditional approaches (i.e., use of product and difference-in-coefficients), we recognize the role of confounders in the estimation of total, direct, and indirect effects of parental education on respondents' psychological well-being. Method: Drawing from the first wave (2007-2010) of the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) and adopting a counterfactual approach, we estimate both natural direct and indirect effects of parental education through individual educational attainment (secondarily, through household assets as an additional mediator) on respondents' life-satisfaction and quality of life (QOL). Results: Findings document a statistically not significant positive total effect of parental education on life satisfaction and QOL. While lower for women, significant indirect effects suggest that the positive influence of parental education operates primarily through the individual's education. Notably, we found negative direct effect of parental education on psychological well-being outcomes. Discussion: Contrary to prior literature, we found no positive direct influence of parental education on later life psychological well-being, but established its influence through socioeconomic positioning over the life course.

J	Henderson, G; Jones, C; Woods, R				Henderson, Gillian; Jones, Christine; Woods, Ruth			Sibling birth order, use of statutory measures and patterns of placement for children in public care: Implications for international child protection systems and research	CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW			English	Article						Siblings; Birth order; Adoption; Permanence; Children's Hearings System; Looked-after children	ABUSE; RISK; MALTREATMENT; METAANALYSIS; EXPERIENCES; PREVALENCE; IDENTIFY; HEALTH	Public care of abused and neglected children is one important element of statutory intervention which aims to address the major global challenge of protecting children from abuse and neglect. Where a child is part of a sibling group, this introduces particular challenges with regard to meeting the needs of all those affected. This paper presents findings from one of the first studies examining birth order effects on statutory intervention patterns for looked-after siblings. The experiences and outcomes of children were compared depending on maternal birth order at the time of data collection. We found strong evidence that the length of time from first referral of a child deemed at risk to first statutory intervention is greater for first-born than for last-born children and first-born children are significantly older than last-born children when they are first placed on statutory measures. The study concludes that first-born siblings may be particularly vulnerable to delayed statutory intervention and the cumulative effects of harm and certain routes to permanence may be less available to them. We argue for increased focus within international child welfare policy and practice on timely and intensive assessment of first-born children, where risk of maltreatment is identified, in order to address potential inequalities of access to protection. A focus on risk introduced by systemic factors within legal and welfare systems in addition to risk introduced by perpetrators of abuse is needed. We also argue for greater research attention to, and more precise measurement of, birth order as a variable in studies of the looked-after population.

We compare the findings with participation (yes/no) in physical exercise/workouts. A survey (N = 780) was conducted in the Norwegian town Moss. We used linear regression models to assess the potential links between the frequency of walks from home and the following self-reported indicators: income, education, housing type, employment, age, gender, raised in Norway or not, years of residence in Moss, number of financial household providers, household with/without children, exerciser or not, activity level at work, perceived health status, sedentary minutes per week, and dog ownership. The study reveals that neighbourhood walking appeals to all adults regardless of demographic situation or socio-economic position. Furthermore, owning a dog seems to be a successful factor for getting people to walk. Our results show a higher frequency of walks from home for transport than for the walk itself (usually called recreational walks). Given the global political health goal of encouraging people to be more physically active, this study demonstrates the potential of walking from a public health perspective. The study argues for the importance of health promoting urban planning, with attractive and walkable friendly urban environments. Furthermore, the study acknowledges the importance of promoting a broader understanding of outdoor recreation in urban settings, where neighbourhood walking, both for recreation and for transport, should be regarded as an activity within the frame of urban recreation. Management implications: Neighbourhood walking appeals to all adults regardless of demographic situation or socio-economic position. Young adults and people who are better economically situated favour physical exercise more than other adults do. In a world dominated by inactive adults, a moderate physical activity such as neighbourhood walking has great potential to improve public health. Public health policy and management should facilitate efficient measures to stimulate neighbourhood walking. Neighbourhood walking, both for recreation and for transport, should be regarded as an activity within the frame of urban recreation; both types are mostly performed in people's leisure time. It is important to base urban planning on the principle of developing a walkable city.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS			English	Article						Edge effect; Potential spatial accessibility of healthcare professionals; E2SFCA algorithm; Geographic information systems; Spatial analyses; Pregnant women	ACCESS; NEIGHBORHOODS; INEQUALITIES; AGGREGATION; ASSOCIATION; ENVIRONMENT; SERVICES; EQUITY; AREA	Background: Spatial accessibility indices are increasingly applied when investigating inequalities in health. Although most studies are making mentions of potential errors caused by the edge effect, many acknowledge having neglected to consider this concern by establishing spatial analyses within a finite region, settling for hypothesizing that accessibility to facilities will be under-reported. Our study seeks to assess the effect of edge on the accuracy of defining healthcare provider access by comparing healthcare provider accessibility accounting or not for the edge effect, in a real-world application. Methods: This study was carried out in the department of Nord, France. The statistical unit we use is the French census block known as 'IRIS' (Ilot Regroupe pour l'Information Statistique), defined by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. The geographical accessibility indicator used is the "Index of Spatial Accessibility" (ISA), based on the E2SFCA algorithm. We calculated ISA for the pregnant women population by selecting three types of healthcare providers: general practitioners, gynecologists and midwives. We compared ISA variation when accounting or not edge effect in urban and rural zones. The GIS method was then employed to determine global and local autocor-relation. Lastly, we compared the relationship between socioeconomic distress index and ISA, when accounting or not for the edge effect, to fully evaluate its impact. Results: The results revealed that on average ISA when offer and demand beyond the boundary were included is slightly below ISA when not accounting for the edge effect, and we found that the IRIS value was more likely to deteriorate than improve. Moreover, edge effect impact can vary widely by health provider type. There is greater variability within the rural IRIS group than within the urban IRIS group. We found a positive correlation between socioeconomic distress variables and composite ISA. Spatial analysis results (such as Moran's spatial autocorrelation index and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation) are not really impacted. Conclusion: Our research has revealed minor accessibility variation when edge effect has been considered in a French context. No general statement can be set up because intensity of impact varies according to healthcare provider type, territorial organization and methodology used to measure the accessibility to healthcare. Additional researches are required in order to distinguish what findings are specific to a territory and others common to different countries. It constitute a promising direction to determine more precisely healthcare shortage areas and then to fight against social health inequalities.

A population-level investigation of cancer clinical trials participation in a UK region	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION			English	Article						cancer research; clinical trial availability; clinical trials participation; treatment equity	INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY; OLDER PATIENTS; DISPARITIES; ENROLLMENT; AGE	The aim of this study was to document cancer trial participation since establishment of the Northern Ireland Cancer Trials Network and investigate population and disease factors associated with trial participation. An independent cohort of over 51 000 cancer patients from the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry covering the same population (2007-2012) was linked to a database of 1316 interventional cancer trial participants in a UK region. The primary outcome measure was participation in an intervention clinical trial. Patients were followed up until 31 March 2013. Kaplan-Meier tests and Cox proportional hazard models using person days at risk to allow for death were used to investigate factors associated with trial participation. Multivariate analysis assessed the impact of age, cancer type and stage, distance from the cancer centre (radiotherapy), marital status, deprivation quintile and rurality. Participation was analysed separately for children (< 15 years) and young individuals (15-24 years). Trial recruitment increased three-fold with establishment of a network. Participation was the highest for children at 21%, but relatively low at 2.05% for adults, although higher for haematological malignancies (4.5%). Lower likelihood of trial participation in adults was associated with female sex, older age, distance from regional Cancer Centre and stage 1 disease. The introduction of a regional Cancer Trials Network was associated with increased participation; however, trial participation remains relatively low at the population level especially among elderly patients. Linkage of clinical trials and cancer registry database provide an easy mechanism to monitor trial representativeness at the population level. Copyright (c) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Zika virus epidemic in Puerto Rico: Health justice too long delayed	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							MALE SEXUAL TRANSMISSION; CONDOM-USE; ACCESS; WOMEN	Over the course of 16 months, more than 35 400 cases of Zika virus infection have been confirmed in Puerto Rico. This represents 85% of all cases reported in the USA and its territories. The Zika epidemic is exposing the profound failure of socioeconomic policies, as well as the failure to protect sexual and reproductive health rights in Puerto Rico. Considering the high poverty rates, high levels of sexualityrelated stigma, poor quality sex education, limited access to contraception, and limited participation in the allocation of resources for prevention, it is unreasonable to focus public health efforts to prevent Zika virus infection on vector control. The allocation and equitable management of resources for research and intervention are required in order to understand and address the barriers to and facilitators of prevention at the individual, social, and structural levels. Further, the impact of efforts to tackle the social determinants of the Zika virus epidemic on the island should be assessed. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Mapping actions to improve access to medicines for mental disorders in low and middle income countries	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRIC SCIENCES			English	Article						mental disorders; medicines; access; guidelines; low and middle income countries	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; HEALTH-SERVICES; PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICINES; GLOBAL BURDEN; BARRIERS; POVERTY; AVAILABILITY; MEDICATIONS; INEQUALITY; DISEASES	Aims. In recent years a number of intergovernmental initiatives have been activated in order to enhance the capacity of countries to improve access to essential medicines, particularly for mental disorders. In May 2013 the 66th World Health Assembly adopted the World Health Organization (WHO) Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020, which builds upon the work of WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme. Within this programme, evidence-based guidelines for mental disorders were developed, including recommendations on appropriate use of medicines. Subsequently, the 67th World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on access to essential medicines, which urged Member States to improve national policies for the selection of essential medicines and to promote their availability, affordability and appropriate use. Methods. Following the precedent set by these important initiatives, this article presents eleven actions for improving access and appropriate use of psychotropic medicines. Results. A 4 x 4 framework mapping actions as a function of the four components of access - selection, availability, affordability and appropriate use - and across four different health care levels, three of which belong to the supply side and one to the demand side, was developed. The actions are: developing a medicine selection process; promoting information and education activities for staff and end-users; developing a medicine regulation process; implementing a reliable supply system; implementing a reliable quality-control system; developing a community-based system of mental health care and promoting help-seeking behaviours; developing international agreements on medicine affordability; developing pricing policies and a sustainable financing system; developing or adopting evidence-based guidelines; monitoring the use of psychotropic medicines; promoting training initiatives for staff and end-users on critical appraisal of scientific evidence and appropriate use of psychotropic medicines. Conclusions. Activating these actions offers an unique opportunity to address the broader issue of increasing access to treatments and care for mental disorders, as current lack of attention to mental disorders is a central barrier across all domains of the 4 x 4 access framework.

The comparison focuses on children from two groups: North Africans in France and Mexicans in the United States. By using two longitudinal datasets, the French Educational Panel Survey and Add Health, we examine aspirations, expectations, and secondary attainment in the two contexts. We explore in particular the role of parental education on attainment. Immigrant families have high educational aspirations in both contexts. North-African families express higher aspirations than native French with similar background, while there are no significant differences between second-generation Mexicans and the majority group net of parental education. Second-generation children are disadvantaged in school in both countries; they are more likely to drop out and less likely to graduate from high school, but most of the disadvantage is related to their social background. Net of social background, the Mexican second generation does not differ from the majority group while the North African second generation is more likely to get the French high school diploma than their peers of French origins, in line with their high aspirations. However, North Africans are more likely to receive the technological baccalaureat than the general baccalaureat.

Equity implications for sanitation from recent health and nutrition evidence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Sanitation; Health impact; Equity; SDG target 6; Wash; Indonesia	CHILD GROWTH; DRINKING-WATER; HYGIENE; DIARRHEA; BURDEN; ODISHA; ACCESS	Recent evidence points to the possible underestimation of the health and nutrition impact of sanitation. Community sanitation coverage may first need to reach thresholds in the order of 60% or higher, to optimize health and nutrition gains. Increasing coverage of sanitation to levels below 60% of community coverage may not result in substantial gains. For example, moving Indonesia from 60% to 100% improved sanitation coverage could significantly reduce diarrhoea in children under 5 years old (by an estimated 24% reduction in odds ratio for child diarrhoea morbidity) with gains split equally by reaching underserved communities and the unserved within communities. We review the implications of these results across three levels of program implementation - from micro level approaches (that support communities to achieve open defecation-free status), to meso level (sub-national implementation) to macro level approaches for the national enabling environment and the global push to the Sustainable Development Goals. We found significant equity implications and recommend that future studies focus more extensively on community coverage levels and verified community open defecation free status rather than household access alone. Sanitation practitioners may consider developing phased approaches to improving water, sanitation and hygiene in communities while prioritizing the unserved or underserved.	[Cronin, A.

J	Palmer, JJ; Robert, O; Kansiime, F				Palmer, Jennifer J.; Robert, Okello; Kansiime, Freddie			Including refugees in disease elimination: challenges observed from a sleeping sickness programme in Uganda	CONFLICT AND HEALTH			English	Article						Sleeping sickness; Human African trypanosomiasis; Refugees; Uganda; South Sudan; Elimination; Integration; Ethnography; Displacement; Rapid diagnostic tests	HUMAN AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS; CONFLICT; KENYA	Background: Ensuring equity between forcibly-displaced and host area populations is a key challenge for global elimination programmes. We studied Uganda's response to the recent refugee influx from South Sudan to identify key governance and operational lessons for national sleeping sickness programmes working with displaced populations today. A refugee policy which favours integration of primary healthcare services for refugee and host populations and the availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to detect sleeping sickness at this health system level makes Uganda well-placed to include refugees in sleeping sickness surveillance. Methods: Using ethnographic observations of coordination meetings, review of programme data, interviews with sleeping sickness and refugee authorities and group discussions with health staff and refugees (2013-2016), we nevertheless identified some key challenges to equitably integrating refugees into government sleeping sickness surveillance. Results: Despite fears that refugees were at risk of disease and posed a threat to elimination, six months into the response, programme coordinators progressed to a sentinel surveillance strategy in districts hosting the highest concentrations of refugees. This meant that RDTs, the programme's primary surveillance tool, were removed from most refugee-serving facilities, exacerbating existing inequitable access to surveillance and leading refugees to claim that their access to sleeping sickness tests had been better in South Sudan. This was not intentionally done to exclude refugees from care, rather, four key governance challenges made it difficult for the programme to recognise and correct inequities affecting refugees: (a) perceived donor pressure to reduce the sleeping sickness programme's scope without clear international elimination guidance on surveillance quality; (b) a problematic history of programme relations with refugee-hosting districts which strained supervision of surveillance quality; (c) difficulties that government health workers faced to produce good quality surveillance in a crisis; and (d) reluctant engagement between the sleeping sickness programme and humanitarian structures. Conclusions: Despite progressive policy intentions, several entrenched governance norms and practices worked against integration of refugees into the national sleeping sickness surveillance system. Elimination programmes which marginalise forced migrants risk unwittingly contributing to disease spread and reinforce social inequities, so new norms urgently need to be established at local, national and international levels.

Sexual and reproductive health, as with the greater issues of health and well-being for adolescents displaced from this crisis remain largely unknown and neglected. In 2013, the Women's Refugee Commission, Johns Hopkins University, and International Medical Corps in Ethiopia, implemented qualitative and quantitative research to explore the factors and risks that impact the health of very young adolescents (VYAs), those 10-14 years of age, in this setting. This paper presents findings from the qualitative effort. Methods: Focus group discussions (FGD), incorporating community mapping and photo elicitation activities, were conducted with 10-12 and 13-14 year-olds to obtain information about their own perspectives, experiences and values. FGDs were also implemented with 15-16 year-olds and adults, to consider their perspectives on the sexual and reproductive health needs and risks of VYAs. Results: This research identified several factors that were found to influence the health and well-being of VYAs in Kobe refugee camp, including newfound access to education and security, combined with gender divisions and parental communication around early SRH and puberty that remained intact from traditional Somali culture. Girls were found to face an additional risk of child marriage and early pregnancy exacerbated since displacement, which significantly limited their ability to access education and achieve future aspirations. Conclusion: Findings from this study could help to inform future programs in Kobe and similar contexts involving long-term displacement from conflict, focusing on the health and development needs of VYAs. Future programs should consider the determinants of positive VYA health and development, including access to education, gender equity, and safety. By better understanding the unique experiences, perspectives and needs of VYAs, practitioners, policy makers and donors can invest in the individual and community assets that reinforce positive behaviors established in early adolescence, in order to achieve long-term SRH impacts.

In the two decades since, ARVs have become the subject of intense political debate and social justice mobilization. In particular, ARV intellectual property patent protections have become a high-profile trade and diplomacy issue, while major philanthropic organizations have entered the fray to support large-scale treatment programs. This article maps 21years of HIV/AIDS medicines coverage in mainstream newspapers to illustrate these developments and contestations. It demonstrates two main processes: first, where civil society mobilization successfully promoted ARVs onto the media and policy agenda, and second, where issue fragmentation and a changing political and media context saw ARVs dramatically exit the news coverage, despite the continuing catastrophic scale of the global HIV/AIDS medicines crisis.

Fuel optimization strategy for hydrogen fuel cell range extender vehicles applying genetic algorithms	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Electric vehicle; Fuel cell; Extended range; Genetic algorithm; Simulation; Optimization	ELECTRIC VEHICLES; ATTITUDES; HEALTH	Whether or not alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) will finally find a place in the global mass-market or even will dominate the vehicle segment will depend on several success factors: reduction of customer anxiety, fast recharging, better charging infrastructure, environmental justice policies and some others. Current technological advances in battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuelled electric vehicles could represent a hopefully option in the near future. Nevertheless, and until electric/hydrogen technological barriers are not torn down, both power architecture do not have an opportunity to be fully introduced in the vehicle market. In this paper, the authors present a powertrain architecture concept based in current fossil fuel extender range, but changing it to a hydrogen fuel cell stack system that works as range extender. The objective is to probe how optimization techniques, by the inclusion of genetic algorithms, could be a crucial help when planning the fuel consumption/selection. The paper ambition is to highlight the possibilities of this powertrain and its appropriated management to allow hydrogen become an energy carrier feasible today in the automotive world.

This volume of the Journal of Social Issues integrates theoretical and empirical research to examine police violence (i.e., disproportionate physical and psychological injury and maltreatment) against racial and ethnic minorities and provides policy recommendations directed at reducing this violence from a multidisciplinary perspective. Organized across two substantive sections, one section is devoted to evidence of and factors contributing to police violence against racial and ethnic minorities, including racial stereotyping, implicit bias, and contextual factors. The other section focuses on societal-level, downstream consequences of exposure to this violence for both individual targets and their community, including attitudinal, physical, and mental health consequences. A concluding chapter integrates the special issue articles' findings and provides new perspectives on policing and race. This opening article to the special issue reviews existing literature and outlines the unique contributions of the included articles on this topic.

J	de Soysa, I; de Soysa, AK				de Soysa, Indra; de Soysa, Ann Kristin			Do Globalization and Free Markets Drive Obesity among Children and Youth? An Empirical Analysis, 1990-2013	INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Globalization; obesity; trade and FDI; economic freedom	RESOURCE CURSE; HEALTH; OVERWEIGHT; WORLD; DIET; FOOD	Scholars of public health identify globalization as a major cause of obesity. Free markets are blamed for spreading high calorie, nutrient-poor diets, and sedentary lifestyles across the globe. Global trade and investment agreements apparently curtail government action in the interest of public health. Globalization is also blamed for raising income inequality and social insecurities, which contribute to obesogenic environments. Contrary to recent empirical studies, this study demonstrates that globalization and several component parts, such as trade openness, FDI flows, and an index of economic freedom, reduce weight gain and obesity among children and youth, the most likely age cohort to be affected by the past three decades of globalization and attendant lifestyle changes. The results suggest strongly that local-level factors possibly matter much more than do global-level factors for explaining why some people remain thin and others put on weight. The proposition that globalization is homogenizing cultures across the globe in terms of diets and lifestyles is possibly exaggerated. The results support the proposition that globalized countries prioritize health because of the importance of labor productivity and human capital due to heightened market competition, ceteris paribus, even if rising incomes might drive high consumption.

Population-based cancer survival in the United States: Data, quality control, and s<SUP>t</SUP>atistical methods	CANCER			English	Article						cancer; National Program for Cancer Registries (NPCR); population-based survival; statistical methods; Surveillance; Epidemiology; and End Results (SEER)	STAGE 2001-2009 FINDINGS; GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE; REGISTRY DATA; FUNNEL PLOTS; LIFE-TABLES; RACE; DISPARITIES; IMPACT; AGE	BACKGROUNDRobust comparisons of population-based cancer survival estimates require tight adherence to the study protocol, standardized quality control, appropriate life tables of background mortality, and centralized analysis. The CONCORD program established worldwide surveillance of population-based cancer survival in 2015, analyzing individual data on 26 million patients (including 10 million US patients) diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 with 1 of 10 common malignancies. METHODSIn this Cancer supplement, we analyzed data from 37 state cancer registries that participated in the second cycle of the CONCORD program (CONCORD-2), covering approximately 80% of the US population. Data quality checks were performed in 3 consecutive phases: protocol adherence, exclusions, and editorial checks. One-, 3-, and 5-year age-standardized net survival was estimated using the Pohar Perme estimator and state- and race-specific life tables of all-cause mortality for each year. The cohort approach was adopted for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003, and the complete approach for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. RESULTSArticles in this supplement report population coverage, data quality indicators, and age-standardized 5-year net survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis. Examples of tables, bar charts, and funnel plots are provided in this article. CONCLUSIONSPopulation-based cancer survival is a key measure of the overall effectiveness of services in providing equitable health care. The high quality of US cancer registry data, 80% population coverage, and use of an unbiased net survival estimator ensure that the survival trends reported in this supplement are robustly comparable by race and state. The results can be used by policymakers to identify and address inequities in cancer survival in each state and for the United States nationally. Cancer 2017;123:4982-93. Published 2017. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Population-based cancer survival is a key measure of the overall effectiveness of health systems in managing the cancer burden. The high quality of US cancer registry data, 80% population coverage in the CONCORD-2 study, and the use of an unbiased estimator of net survival ensure that the survival trends reported in this supplement are robustly comparable by race and state. These results can be used to plan and evaluate the cancer control strategy in each state and for the United States nationally.

J	Madiba, S; Ngwenya, N				Madiba, Sphiwe; Ngwenya, Nomsa			Cultural practices, gender inequality and inconsistent condom use increase vulnerability to HIV infection: narratives from married and cohabiting women in rural communities in Mpumalanga province, South Africa	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						Sexual violence; HIV transmission; social norms; safe sex; gender roles; patriarchy	RISK; ACCEPTABILITY; PREVENTION; BARRIERS; HEALTH; ROLES; SEX	Background: Women in sub-Saharan Africa bear the brunt of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, and older married women and those in cohabiting relationships are regarded as the largest HIV risk group. Although preventing HIV infection in married or stable relationships is an international HIV prevention priority, little is known about the influence of sociocultural contexts on safe-sex practice by women, particularly older women in rural communities in South Africa. Objectives: This study aimed to examine how older women in a rural patriarchal society negotiate safer sex within marital and long-term cohabitation relationships, and their perceptions and experiences of barriers that influence condom use. Methods: Focus group discussions were conducted with married and cohabiting women aged 40-60 years recruited from primary health facilities in a rural district in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyse the data. Results: We found that although women reported negotiating safe sex in their relationships, they dreaded the possible consequences of suggesting condom use with their partners. Many factors made negotiating safe sex complex for these women: living in a patriarchal society where women play no part in sexual decision making, the fear of possible consequences of insisting on condom use, women's inferior social position in marital relationships, cultural practices such as bride price, and gender inequality were the main barriers to practising safer sex. Conclusions: Older married and cohabiting women dreadednegotiating safer sex in this patriarchal society where women's subordination is legitimized. The fin dings suggest that the women were at high risk of HIV infection because of their inability to negotiate condomuse, or to reject forced sex and non-consensual sex. There is a need for interventions targeting older married and cohabiting couples and key stakeholders within communities to create awareness about cultural practices and beliefs that undermine women and HIV prevention efforts.

J	Rossouw, L; Smith, A				Rossouw, Laura; Smith, Anja			A comparable yardstick: adjusting for education bias in South African health system responsiveness ratings	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Health system responsiveness; vignettes; reporting behaviour; reporting heterogeneity; socio-economic determinants; South Africa	ANCHORING VIGNETTES; INEQUALITIES; CARE; ADULTS; LEVEL	Health-system responsiveness (HSR) measures the experience of health-system users in terms of the non-clinical aspects of the health system. This has been operationalized as a measurable construct in multiple surveys and studies. According to the literature, reporting behaviour may vary systematically across socio-demographic characteristics. In this study we explore the association between education levels and reporting behaviour in terms of HSR in South Africa using data from the World Health Organization Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health for South Africa (WHO SAGE) conducted in 2007 and 2008. We consider the reporting behaviour of 1499 adults aged 50 and older in terms of the reported HSR for their most recent outpatient provider visit during the preceding 12 months. More specifically, we explore whether there are systematic biases in reporting behaviour by education levels and other socio-economic covariates through the use of data from anchoring vignettes. These are questions depicting hypothetical HSR scenarios which provide a fixed benchmark for comparing individuals' own HSR ratings and identifying potential reporting biases. Using a hierarchical-ordered probit model in regression analysis, we found large differences in HSR ratings between the lowest and highest education groups after adjusting for reporting bias using the anchoring vignettes. This finding holds across all seven HSR domains captured in the WHO SAGE dataset. In the most extreme case, individuals with no education are likely to underreport poor HSR by between 2.6 and 9.4% percentage points compared with individuals with secondary schooling or higher. Policy-makers need to take cognizance of potential reporting biases in HSR ratings and make the necessary adjustments to obtain data that are as true and accurate as possible. The need for this is especially acute in a country such as South Africa with large socio-economic inequalities and disparities in access to healthcare.

This commentary is the outcome of a panel discussion at the symposium in which the resilience discourse and its use in health systems development was critically interrogated. The 2014-15 Ebola outbreak in West-Africa added momentum for the wider adoption of resilient health systems as a crucial element to prepare for and effectively respond to crisis. The growing salience of resilience in development and health systems debates can be attributed in part to development actors and philanthropies such as the Rockefeller Foundation. Three concerns regarding the application of resilience to health systems development are discussed: (1) the resilience narrative overrules certain democratic procedures and priority setting in public health agendas by 'claiming' an exceptional policy space; (2) resilience compels accepting and maintaining the status quo and excludes alternative imaginations of just and equitable health systems including the socio-political struggles required to attain those; and (3) an empirical case study from Gaza makes the case that resilience and vulnerability are symbiotic with each other rather than providing a solution for developing a strong health system. In conclusion, if the normative aim of health policies is to build sustainable, universally accessible, health systems then resilience is not the answer. The current threats that health systems face demand us to imagine beyond and explore possibilities for global solidarity and justice in health.

Monitoring breast cancer survival can help evaluate the effectiveness of health services, quantify inequities in outcomes between states or population subgroups, and inform efforts to improve the effectiveness of cancer management and treatment. METHODSWe analyzed breast cancer survival using individual patient records from 37 statewide registries that participated in the CONCORD-2 study, covering approximately 80% of the US population. Females were diagnosed between 2001 and 2009 and were followed through December 31, 2009. Age-standardized net survival at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after diagnosis was estimated by state, race (white, black), stage at diagnosis, and calendar period (2001-2003 and 2004-2009). RESULTSOverall, 5-year breast cancer net survival was very high (88.2%). Survival remained remarkably high from 2001 through 2009. Between 2001 and 2003, survival was 89.1% for white females and 76.9% for black females. Between 2004 and 2009, survival was 89.6% for white females and 78.4% for black females. CONCLUSIONSBreast cancer survival was more than 10 percentage points lower for black females than for white females, and this difference persisted over time. Reducing racial disparities in survival remains a challenge that requires broad, coordinated efforts at the federal, state, and local levels. Monitoring trends in breast cancer survival can highlight populations in need of improved cancer management and treatment. Cancer 2017;123:5100-18. Published 2017. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Breast cancer survival remained high between 2001 and 2009, but there were wide and persistent disparities in survival between black and white women. Reducing racial disparities in breast cancer survival remains a challenge that requires broad, coordinated efforts at the federal, state, and local levels.

J	Mora, C; Monteiro, S; Moreira, COF				Mora, Claudia; Monteiro, Simone; Fiuza Moreira, Carlos Otavio			Institutional context and VCT practitioner narratives: possibilities and limitations for HIV prevention in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						HIV; Counseling; Testing; Health providers; Sociology; Vulnerability; Qualitative study	TESTING SERVICES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; CHALLENGES; COUNSELORS; WORKING	Background: Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) is an HIV prevention strategy that promotes the principles of confidentiality and informed consent. International research has highlighted VCT counselors' isolation from service planning and the contradictions they negotiate between local values and global testing recommendations. In Brazil, studies have identified many limitations, including counselors' difficulties to implement a vulnerability approach to HIV prevention as recommended in the country's national guidelines. These studies, however, have not considered the particularities of the institutional contexts where counselors work. This research addresses these gaps in the VCT literature by exploring how VCT services are organized and how counselors perceive and perform their practices in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: This is a case study of VCT services in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The research design included individual structured interviews with seven VCT service coordinators and twenty individual semi-structured interviews with VCT counselors. Participants were sampled according to gender, undergraduate degree and work trajectory to capture a diverse range counselor narratives. Results: The VCT services were relatively homogenous in terms of functioning and had a similar restricted roll of activities including individual counseling and occasional external prevention activities with groups vulnerable to HIV. All VCT services reported reductions in staff size. Some counselors used dialogical practices to build trust, guarantee confidentiality and adjust their practices in accordance with their clients' values and practices. Others emphasized imperative messages or focused on risk and individual responsibility. Connections between how counselors perceive their practices and the organization of their work environment were observed. Conclusions: Due to the importance of counseling as a prevention strategy we recommend rethinking the relationship between counselors' practices and the organization of VCT services. The challenges brought about by the expansion of "test and treat" programs globally and other social and symbolic aspects of the HIV epidemic, such as gender inequalities, must also be taken into account. Further reflection is also needed on the relationship between counseling guidelines and practices within the vulnerability approach to HIV prevention.

J	Lysaght, T				Lysaght, Tamra			Accelerating regenerative medicine: the Japanese experiment in ethics and regulation	REGENERATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						cost-effectiveness; distributive justice; ethics; health policy; medical tourism; regenerative medicine; regulation/legal; stem cells	STEM-CELL THERAPIES; INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS; INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS; HEART-FAILURE; APPROVAL; ACCESS; REIMBURSEMENT; INTERVENTIONS; CHALLENGES; INNOVATION	In 2014, the Japanese National Diet introduced new laws aimed at promoting the clinical translation of stem cells and regenerative medicine. The basic action of these laws is to allow the early introduction of regenerative medicine products into the Japanese market through an accelerated approval process, while providing patients with access to certain types of stem cell and cell-based therapies in the context of private clinical practice. While this framework appears to offer enormous opportunities for the translation of stem cell science, it raises ethical challenges that have not yet been fully explored. This paper critically analyzes this framework with respect to the prioritization of safety over clinical benefit, distributive justice and public trust in science and medicine. It is argued that the framework unfairly burdens patients and strained healthcare systems without any clear benefits, and may undermine the credibility of the regenerative medicine field as it emerges.

The current study aims to identify variables associated with the arrest and imprisonment of regular crack cocaine users. Methods: Interviewees were recruited from open drug scenes in the city of Rio de Janeiro and Greater Metropolitan Area from September 2011 to June 2013. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to the data. Results: Most of the recruited crack cocaine users were male (78.2% [95%Cl: 76.3-79.4]), 18-30 years old (64.7% [95%0: 62.5-66.2]), non-white (92.9% [95%0: 91.2-93.4]), single (68.9% [95%Cl: 66.8-703]), and with 0-7 years of schooling (70.6% [95%0: 68.5-71.9]). Factors independently associated with arrest were history of inpatient addiction treatment (adjOR 4.31 [95%0: 1.70-11.32]); male gender (adjOR 2.05 [95%CI: 1.40-3.04); polydrug use (adjOR 1.82 [95%Cl: 132-2.51]); and 0 to 7 years of schooling (adjOR 1.64 [95%Cl: 1.17-2.32]). As for the outcome variable lifetime history of incarceration, the independently associated factors were: male gender (adjOR 2.47 [95%Cl: 1.74-3.55]) and longer use of crack cocaine and related substances (e.g., free base and local varieties/denominations of coca products) (adjOR 105 [95%CI: 1.01-1.10]). Conclusion: The study's findings support the use of comprehensive multisector interventions, integrating health promotion and mental health rehabilitation, access to quality education, and management of combined/concomitant use of different substances to reduce and/or prevent criminal involvement by individuals that use crack cocaine and other substances, as well as to prevent/manage relapse.

PIAAC data, available for 30 upper-middle and high-income countries and nationally representative for the working-age population, allow us to construct a multidimensional measure for the stock of human capital in each country, taking into account years of schooling, job experience, cognitive skills, on-the-job-training, and health. Individual level PIAAC data for the US are then used to estimate the weight of each dimension in the human capital composite by running Mincerian wage regressions. We find that differences in physical capital together with our broad measure of human capital account for 42% of the variance in output per worker, compared to only 27% when proxying human capital by average years of schooling only. Differences in cognitive skills play the largest role while experience and health are of lesser importance.

Phytochemical and nutritional properties of underutilised fruits in the southern African region	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Review						Bioactive compounds; Fruit chemical composition; Traditional fruits; Health benefits; Functional properties	APPLE DOVYALIS-CAFFRA; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; MARULA FRUIT; QUALITY; ORANGE; ACID; CROP	The underutilised fruits including kei apple, cape gooseberry, marula and monkey orange are fruits widely found in the southern African region. These fruits have the potential to cut to the heart of Africa's great problems in rural development, hunger, malnutrition, and gender inequality. Kei apple, cape gooseberry, marula and monkey orange trees are drought resistant or tolerant plants. Therefore, the domestication of the underutilised fruits found in the southern African region could be considered to be a sustainable solution to enhance the fruit availability, thereby increasing the food security since the global warming currently affects the food production. The fruits are rich in macronutrients, micronutrients, and dietary phytochemicals and have several health benefits. Despite this and the existence of a broad and unlimited niche in terms of the use of these fruits in new product development (food products, medicinal products, etc.), they are mainly processed on a small scale for the production of a few food products. This review also covers food product development from these fruits based on their functional characteristics. (C) 2017 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ngemakwe, P. H.

A multivariate analysis of CalEnviroScreen: comparing environmental and socioeconomic stressors versus chronic disease	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Health hazard; Spatial regression; Environmental exposure; Socioeconomic status; Vulnerable populations; Multivariate analysis; Principal component analysis; Census; Environmental justice; CalEnviroScreen	NEIGHBORHOOD DEPRIVATION; GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; DISABILITY WEIGHTS; HEALTH IMPACTS; AIR-POLLUTION; GLOBAL BURDEN; JUSTICE; VULNERABILITY; CANCER	Background: The health-risk assessment paradigm is shifting from single stressor evaluation towards cumulative assessments of multiple stressors. Recent efforts to develop broad-scale public health hazard datasets provide an opportunity to develop and evaluate multiple exposure hazards in combination. Methods: We performed a multivariate study of the spatial relationship between 12 indicators of environmental hazard, 5 indicators of socioeconomic hardship, and 3 health outcomes. Indicators were obtained from CalEnviroScreen (version 3.0), a publicly available environmental justice screening tool developed by the State of California Environmental Protection Agency. The indicators were compared to the total rate of hospitalization for 14 ICD-9 disease categories (a measure of disease burden) at the zip code tabulation area population level. We performed principal component analysis to visualize and reduce the CalEnviroScreen data and spatial autoregression to evaluate associations with disease burden. Results: CalEnviroScreen was strongly associated with the first principal component (PC) from a principal component analysis (PCA) of all 20 variables (Spearman rho = 0.95). In a PCA of the 12 environmental variables, two PC axes explained 43% of variance, with the first axis indicating industrial activity and air pollution, and the second associated with ground-level ozone, drinking water contamination and PM2.5. Mass of pesticides used in agriculture was poorly or negatively correlated with all other environmental indicators, and with the CalEnviroScreen calculation method, suggesting a limited ability of the method to capture agricultural exposures. In a PCA of the 5 socioeconomic variables, the first PC explained 66% of variance, representing overall socioeconomic hardship. In simultaneous autoregressive models, the first environmental and socioeconomic PCs were both significantly associated with the disease burden measure, but more model variation was explained by the socioeconomic PCs. Conclusions: This study supports the use of CalEnviroScreen for its intended purpose of screening California regions for areas with high environmental exposure and population vulnerability. Study results further suggest a hypothesis that, compared to environmental pollutant exposure, socioeconomic status has greater impact on overall burden of disease.

Studies in high-income countries have shown that obesity is more prevalent among the poor. In contrast, obesity is more prevalent among the rich in low-and middle-income countries, hence requiring different focal points to design public health policies in the latter contexts. We examined socioeconomic inequalities in abdominal obesity in Purworejo District, Central Java, Indonesia and identified factors contributing to the inequalities. Methods: We utilised data from the WHO-INDEPTH Study on global AGEing and adult health (WHO-INDEPTH SAGE) conducted in the Purworejo Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in Purworejo District, Indonesia in 2010. The study included 14,235 individuals aged 50 years and older. Inequalities in abdominal obesity across wealth groups were assessed separately for men and women using concentration indexes. Decomposition analysis was conducted to assess the determinants of socioeconomic inequalities in abdominal obesity. Results: Abdominal obesity was five-fold more prevalent among women than in men (30% vs. 6.1%; p < 0.001). The concentration index (CI) analysis showed that socioeconomic inequalities in abdominal obesity were less prominent among women (CI = 0.26, SE = 0.02, p < 0.001) compared to men (CI = 0.49, SE = 0.04, p < 0.001). Decomposition analysis showed that physical labour was the major determinant of socioeconomic inequalities in abdominal obesity among men, explaining 47% of the inequalities, followed by poor socioeconomic status (31%), = 6 years of education (15%) and current smoking (11%). The three major determinants of socioeconomic inequalities in abdominal obesity among women were poor socio-economic status (48%), physical labour (17%) and no formal education (16%). Conclusion: Abdominal obesity was more prevalent among older women in a rural Indonesian setting. Socioeconomic inequality in abdominal obesity exists and concentrates more among the rich population in both sexes. The inequality gap is less prominent among women, indicating a trend towards obesity being more common in poor women. Policies to address social determinants of health need to be developed to address the socioeconomic inequality gaps in obesity, with particular focus on addressing the existing burden of obesity among the better-off population group, while preventing the imminent burden of obesity among the worst-off group, particularly among women.

The United Nations Refugee Convention clearly addresses to guarantee healthcare rights to refugees at the same level as those provided to citizens. In Korea, the number of refugee applicants has surged since the enactment of the Refugee Act in 2012. Regarding human dignity and human rights, however, there are serious concerns that Korea's healthcare laws and policies would not fully protect the right of foreigners who are suffering from financial hardship. This paper proposes the ways to improve healthcare equity by comparing the UNAIDS Guidelines to Korean policies on HIV-positive refugee applicants.

Health Expenditures and Global Inequalities in Longevity	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						health expenditures; life expectancy; quantile regression	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES; LIFE EXPECTANCY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; CARE; DETERMINANTS; REGRESSION; OUTCOMES; GROWTH	Longevity is a key health and development indicator used for cross-country comparisons. Evidence on the effects of country health expenditures on longevity is mixed. We evaluate the heterogeneity in country health expenditure effects throughout the life expectancy distribution worldwide during 2006-11 using quantile regression and an assembled dataset on 175 countries that includes both historic as well as recent data on life expectancy. Our goal is to evaluate the effects of health expenditures across quantiles of the country-level life expectancy distribution to understand whether increasing expenditures are associated with changes in longevity disparities between countries. We find significant heterogeneity in expenditure effects on life expectancy. The largest returns from increased spending are at the left margin of the life expectancy distribution. The results suggest that increasing health spending in countries with low life expectancy may have important returns to life expectancy and significantly diminish global inequalities in longevity and development by reducing the spread of the world's life expectancy distribution.

The present study examined the prevalence of severe obesity and its association with elevated blood pressure (BP) among children and adolescents in Shandong, China.Patients and methodsA total of 44630 (22404 boys and 22226 girls) students aged 7-18 years participated in the study. BMI cut-off points recommended by the International Obesity Task Force were used to define class I-III obesity. Relatively high BP status was defined as systolic BP and/or diastolic BP of at least 95th percentile for age and sex.ResultsThe prevalence rates of class I, class II, and class III obesity were 6.67, 1.47, and 0.42% for boys and 2.88, 0.64, and 0.18% for girls, respectively; boys had a higher prevalence than girls (P<0.01). Substantial urban-rural disparities exist in childhood obesity; urban boys and girls had a higher prevalence of class I and class II obesity than their rural peers (P<0.05). Severe obesity is associated with elevated BP; the prevalence of relatively high BP increased from 39.93% (boys) and 39.53% (girls) in the class I obese group to 50.54% (boys) and 53.66% (girls) in the class III obese group (P<0.05).ConclusionAlthough the current prevalence of severe obesity was at a relatively low level, but we should not relax our vigilance to the obesity epidemic. Our findings also emphasize the importance of the prevention of severe obesity to prevent future-related problems such as hypertension in children and adolescents.

It shows that nighttime lighting is an important variable for estimating carbon dioxide emissions that is superior to other existing indicators and covers all countries in the world, finding evidence of an inverted-U shaped relationship between light and, thus, greenhouse gas emissions and income, with a turning point at approximately US$50,000. However, the relationship is primarily driven by changes in the structure of international trade, implying strong carbon leakage effects. Consequently, environmental regulations that become operative in only one part of the world may fail without global coordination.

This scoping review assesses the state of empirical social work research on global environmental change to identify an agenda for advancing social work research and practice in this area. Method: We searched 5 electronic databases and selected issues/articles for social work plus a list of global environmental change topics. Inclusion criteria were: (a) published since January 1, 1985; (b) published in a peer-reviewed journal; (c) empirical; (d) is social work research; and (e) examines at least one topic related to global environmental change. From included studies, we extracted publication year, country setting, global environmental change topic(s), explicit/implicit examination of global environmental change, research design, and study focus. We extracted practice/policy implications as a subgroup. Descriptive statistics and cross tabulations were run in SPSS 23. Results: We identified 112 studies for inclusion. About 1/3 of studies examined hurricanes and typhoons, and most were conducted in U.S., Canadian, or Asian contexts. Many described consequences or coping with change, and although more than 1/3 of studies examined a formal response/intervention, rigorous outcomes-focused research is lacking. Conclusions: Scholars should diversify the topics and global settings that they study, and they should proactively engage with populations and systems before a crisis. There is a need for intervention research on global environmental changewith more rigorous methods of outcome measurementby social work scholars.

However, the question of whether these research projects target major health priorities, vulnerable populations and geographic locations at risk remains to be answered. The aim of this paper is to describe the state of biomedical research in Cameroon which is a key determinant that would guide future health care policies and promote equitable access to healthcare. Methods: A documentary review of all approved protocols (proposals) of biomedical research projects, from 1997 through 2012, at the Cameroon National Ethics Committee. Protocols were reviewed systematically by independent reviewers and data were extracted on a grid. Data were analyzed by calculating proportions at 95% confidence interval, chi-square test (chi2) and p-values. Results: Two thousand one hundred seventy two protocols were reviewed for data extraction. One thousand three hundred ninety-five (64.7%) were student projects, 369 (17.0%) projects had international sponsors, and 1528 (72.4%) were hospital-based studies. The most targeted domain was the fight against diseases 1323 (61.3%); mostly HIV 342 (25.8%) and Malaria 136 (10.3%). Over half of the studies were concentrated in the Centre region 1242 (57.2%), with the least projects conducted in the Northern region 15 (0.7%). There was strong evidence that international and local sponsors would influence the research site (p-value = 0.01) and population targets (p-value = 0.00). Conclusion: Although biomedical research targets some important diseases that pose a great burden to Cameroonians, the most vulnerable populations are excluded from research. Biomedical research scarcely addresses other components of the health system and emerging diseases of vital public health importance. We recommend that the government should play a central role, between researchers from academic institutions, sponsors, NGOs and research institutions, to ensure that biomedical research addresses the health priorities of Cameroonians. It should include vulnerable populations, and address other components of the health system for a balance. These recommendations are critical to ensuring that future research informed health policies reflect the health needs of the populations and promote equity in healthcare access.

However, criteria, priorities and procedures for decision-making are sometimes non-transparent, frequently vary considerably across equivalent decision-bodies, do not always consider the broader benefits of new health-measures, and therefore do not necessarily adequately represent the relevant stakeholder-spectrum.Areas covered: To address these issues in the context of the evaluation of new vaccines, we have proposed a first baseline set of core evaluation criteria, primarily selected by members of the vaccine research community, and suggested their implementation in vaccine evaluation procedures. In this communication, we review the consequences and utility of stakeholder-centered core considerations to increase transparency in and accountability of decision-making procedures, in general, and of the benefits gained by their inclusion in Multi-Criteria-Decision-Analysis tools, exemplified by SMART Vaccines, specifically.Expert commentary: To increase effectiveness and comparability of health decision outcomes, decision procedures should be properly standardized across equivalent (national) decision bodies. To this end, including stakeholder-centered criteria in decision procedures would significantly increase their transparency and accountability, support international capacity building to improve health, and reduce societal costs and inequity resulting from suboptimal health decision-making.

The concurrent validity of the Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) substance use/abuse subscale in adolescent patients in an urban federally qualified health center	SUBSTANCE ABUSE			English	Article						Adolescents; DSM-5; screening; substance use disorder	DSM-IV NICOTINE; ALCOHOL-USE; PRIMARY-CARE; TEST ASSIST; USE DISORDERS; VALIDATION; VERSION; RISK; CONCORDANCE; PERFORMANCE	Background: The Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) substance use/abuse subscale has been validated with high school students, adolescents with criminal justice involvement, and adolescent substance use treatment samples using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-III-R and DSM-IV. This study examines the concurrent validity of the POSIT's standard 17-item substance use/abuse subscale and a revised, shorter 11-item version using DSM-5 substance use disorder diagnoses. Methods: Adolescents (N = 525; 93% African American, 55% female) 12-17years of age awaiting primary care appointments at a Federally Qualified Health Center in Baltimore, Maryland completed the 17-item POSIT substance use/abuse subscale and items from a modified World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview corresponding to DSM-5 alcohol use disorder (AUD) and cannabis use disorder (CUD). Receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivities, and specificities were examined with DSM-5 AUD, CUD, and a diagnosis of either or both disorders for the standard and revised subscales using risk cutoffs of either 1 or 2 POSIT yes responses. Results: For the 17-item subscale, sensitivities were generally high using either cutoff (range: 0.79-1.00), although a cutoff of 1 was superior (sensitivities were 1.00 for AUD, CUD, and for either disorder). Specificities were also high using either cutoff (range: 0.81-0.95) but were higher using a cutoff of 2. For the 11-item subscale, a cutoff of 1 yielded higher sensitivities than a cutoff of 2 (ranges for 1 and 2: 0.96-1.00 and 0.79-0.86, respectively). Specificities for this subscale were higher using a cutoff of 2 (ranges for 1 and 2: 0.82-0.89 and 0.89-0.96, respectively). Conclusions: Findings suggest that the POSIT's substance use/abuse subscale is a potentially useful tool for screening adolescents in primary care for AUD or CUD using a cutoff of 1 or 2. The briefer, revised subscale may be preferable to the standard subscale in busy pediatric practices.

With the development of a relevant framework and methods, the Campbell and Cochrane Equity Methods Group has encouraged the application of an 'equity lens' to systematic reviews, and many organizations publish reviews intended to address health equity. The purpose of the Evidence for Equity (E4E) project was to conduct a priority-setting exercise and apply an equity lens by developing a knowledge translation product comprising summaries of systematic reviews from the Cochrane Library. E4E translates evidence from systematic reviews into ` friendly front end' summaries for policy makers. Methods: The following topic areas with high burdens of disease globally, were selected for the pilot: diabetes/obesity, HIV/AIDS, malaria, nutrition, and mental health/depression. For each topic area, a "stakeholder panel" was assembled that included policymakers and researchers. A systematic search of Cochrane reviews was conducted for each area to identify equity-relevant interventions with a meaningful impact. Panel chairs developed a rating sheet which was used by all panels to rank the importance of these interventions by: 1) Ease of Implementation; 2) Health System Requirements; 3) Universality/Generalizability/Share of Burden; and 4) Impact on Inequities/Effect on equity. The ratings of panel members were averaged for each intervention and criterion, and interventions were ordered according to the average overall ratings. Results: Stakeholder panels identified the top 10 interventions from their respective topic areas. The evidence on these interventions is being summarized with an equity focus and the results posted online, at http://methods. cochrane. org/equity/e4e-series. Conclusions: This method provides an explicit approach to setting priorities by systematic review groups and funders for providing decision makers with evidence for the most important equity-relevant interventions.

Action to effectively improve population health in India requires availability of reliable and comprehensive state-level estimates of disease burden and risk factors over time. Such comprehensive estimates have not been available so far for all major diseases and risk factors. Thus, we aimed to estimate the disease burden and risk factors in every state of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016. Methods Using all available data sources, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative estimated burden (metrics were deaths, disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs], prevalence, incidence, and life expectancy) from 333 disease conditions and injuries and 84 risk factors for each state of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of GBD 2016. We divided the states of India into four epidemiological transition level (ETL) groups on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs) to those from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries combined in 2016. We assessed variations in the burden of diseases and risk factors between ETL state groups and between states to inform a more specific health-system response in the states and for India as a whole. Findings DALYs due to NCDs and injuries exceeded those due to CMNNDs in 2003 for India, but this transition had a range of 24 years for the four ETL state groups. The age-standardised DALY rate dropped by 36.2% in India from 1990 to 2016. The numbers of DALYs and DALY rates dropped substantially for most CMNNDs between 1990 and 2016 across all ETL groups, but rates of reduction for CMNNDs were slowest in the low ETL state group. By contrast, numbers of DALYs increased substantially for NCDs in all ETL state groups, and increased significantly for injuries in all ETL state groups except the highest. The all-age prevalence of most leading NCDs increased substantially in India from 1990 to 2016, and a modest decrease was recorded in the age-standardised NCD DALY rates. The major risk factors for NCDs, including high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and high body-mass index, increased from 1990 to 2016, with generally higher levels in higher ETL states; ambient air pollution also increased and was highest in the low ETL group. The incidence rate of the leading causes of injuries also increased from 1990 to 2016. The five leading individual causes of DALYs in India in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and cerebrovascular disease; and the five leading risk factors for DALYs in 2016 were child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. Behind these broad trends many variations existed between the ETL state groups and between states within the ETL groups. Of the ten leading causes of disease burden in India in 2016, five causes had at least a five-times difference between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for individual causes. Interpretation Per capita disease burden measured as DALY rate has dropped by about a third in India over the past 26 years. However, the magnitude and causes of disease burden and the risk factors vary greatly between the states. The change to dominance of NCDs and injuries over CMNNDs occurred about a quarter century apart in the four ETL state groups. Nevertheless, the burden of some of the leading CMNNDs continues to be very high, especially in the lowest ETL states. This comprehensive mapping of inequalities in disease burden and its causes across the states of India can be a crucial input for more specific health planning for each state as is envisioned by the Government of India's premier think tank, the National Institution for Transforming India, and the National Health Policy 2017.

With direct and repeated targeting of health workers, health facilities, and ambulances, Syria has become the most dangerous place on earth for health-care providers. The weaponisation of health care-a strategy of using people's need for health care as a weapon against them by violently depriving them of it-has translated into hundreds of health workers killed, hundreds more incarcerated or tortured, and hundreds of health facilities deliberately and systematically attacked. Evidence shows use of this strategy on an unprecedented scale by the Syrian Government and allied forces, in what human rights organisations described as a war-crime strategy, although all parties seem to have committed violations. Attacks on health care have sparked a large-scale exodus of experienced health workers. Formidable challenges face health workers who have stayed behind, and with no health care a major factor in the flight of refugees, the effect extends well beyond Syria. The international community has left these violations of international humanitarian and human rights law largely unanswered, despite their enormous consequences. There have been repudiated denunciations, but little action on bringing the perpetrators to justice. This inadequate response challenges the foundation of medical neutrality needed to sustain the operations of global health and humanitarian agencies in situations of armed conflict. In this Health Policy, we analyse the situation of health workers facing such systematic and serious violations of international humanitarian law.

J	Migliorini, P; Wezel, A				Migliorini, Paola; Wezel, Alexander			Converging and diverging principles and practices of organic agriculture regulations and agroecology. A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						Agroecological practices; Animal production practices; Food system; Sustainable cropping practices; Organic farming	FOOD; MOVEMENT; ECOLOGY	There is ongoing debate among stakeholders about the future development of agricultural and food systems to meet the global challenges of food supply, biological and cultural diversity, climate change, and social justice. Among other options, agroecology and organic agriculture are discussed. Both have similar goals and use a systems approach; however, they are recognised and received differently by stakeholders. Here we review and compare principles and practices defined and described in EU organic agriculture regulations, International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movement (IFOAM) norms, and agroecology scientific literature. The main finding are as follows: (1) Regarding principles, EU organic regulations mainly focus on appropriate design and management of biological processes based on ecological systems, restriction of external inputs, and strict limitation of chemical inputs. IFOAM principles are very broad and more complete, and include a holistic and systemic vision of sustainability. Agroecology has a defined set of principles for the ecological management of agri-food systems, which also includes some socio-economic principles. (2) Many proposed cropping practices are similar for EU organic, IFOAM, and agroecology, e.g. soil tillage, soil fertility and fertilisation, crop and cultivar choice, crop rotation, as well as pest, disease and weed management. In contrast, the origin and quantity of products potentially used for soil fertilisation and pest, disease, and weed management are different. Additionally, some practices are only mentioned for one of the three sources. (3) In animal production, only a few proposed practices are similar for EU organic, IFOAM, and agroecology. These include integration of cropping and animal systems and breed choice. In contrast, practices for animal management, prevention methods in animal health, animal housing, animal welfare, animal nutrition, and veterinary management are defined or described differently. (4) Related to food systems, organic agriculture focusses on technical aspects, such as food processing, while in agroecology there is a prominent debate between a transformative and conformative agenda. Both agroecology and organic agriculture offer promising contributions for the future development of sustainable agricultural production and food systems, especially if their principles and practices converge to a transformative approach and that impedes the conventionalisation of agro-food systems.

From blockchain technology to global health equity: can cryptocurrencies finance universal health coverage?	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article								Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies could remake global health financing and usher in an era global health equity and universal health coverage. We outline and provide examples for at least four important ways in which this potential disruption of traditional global health funding mechanisms could occur: universal access to financing through direct transactions without third parties; novel new multilateral financing mechanisms; increased security and reduced fraud and corruption; and the opportunity for open markets for healthcare data that drive discovery and innovation. We see these issues as a paramount to the delivery of healthcare worldwide and relevant for payers and providers of healthcare at state, national and global levels; for government and non-governmental organisations; and for global aid organisations, including the WHO, International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group.

Is governance, gross domestic product, inequality, population size or country surface area associated with coverage and equity of health interventions? Ecological analyses of cross-sectional surveys from 80 countries	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							CHILD HEALTH; INCOME INEQUALITY; ARMED CONFLICT; PUBLIC-HEALTH; GLOBAL HEALTH; WEALTH	Objective To assess associations between national characteristics, including governance indicators, with a proxy for universal health coverage in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH). Design Ecological analysis based on data from national standardised cross-sectional surveys. Setting Low-income and middle-income countries with a Demographic and Health Survey or a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey since 2005. Participants 1 246 710 mothers and 2 129 212 children from 80 national surveys. Exposures of interest Gross domestic product (GDP), country surface area, population, Gini index and six governance indicators (control of corruption, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and voice and accountability). Main outcomes Levels and inequality in the composite coverage index (CCI), a weighted average of eight RMNCH interventions. Relative and absolute inequalities were measured through the concentration index (CIX) and slope index of inequality (SII) for CCI, respectively. Results The average values of CCI (70.5% (SD=13.3)), CIX (5.3 (SD=5.1)) and mean slope index (19.8 (SD=14.7)) were calculated. In the unadjusted analysis, all governance variables and GDP were positively associated with the CCI and negatively with inequalities. Country surface showed inverse associations with both inequality indices. After adjustment, among the governance indicators, only political stability and absence of violence was directly related to CCI (beta=6.3; 95% CI 3.6 to 9.1; p<0.001) and inversely associated with relative (CIX; beta=-1.4; 95% CI -2.4 to -0.4; p=0.007) and absolute (SII; beta=-5.3; 95% CI -8.9 to -1.7; p=0.005) inequalities. The strongest associations with governance indicators were found in the poorest wealth quintile. Similar patterns were observed for GDP. Country surface area was inversely related to inequalities on CCI. Conclusions Levels and equity in RMNCH interventions are positively associated with political stability and absence of violence, and with GDP, and inversely associated with country surface area.

In Europe, ethnic inequalities in health have been observed in relatively small studies, with limited possibilities to explore underlying causes. The aim of the Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) study is to investigate the causes of (the unequal burden of) diseases across ethnic groups, focusing on three disease categories: cardiovascular diseases, mental health and infectious diseases. Participants The HELIUS study is a prospective cohort study among six large ethnic groups living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Between 2011 and 2015, a total 24 789 participants (aged 18-70 years) were included at baseline. Similar-sized samples of individuals of Dutch, African Surinamese, South-Asian Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish and Moroccan origin were included. Participants filled in an extensive questionnaire and underwent a physical examination that included the collection of biological samples (biobank). Findings to date Data on physical, behavioural, psychosocial and biological risk factors, and also ethnicityspecific characteristics (eg, culture, migration history, ethnic identity, socioeconomic factors and discrimination) were collected, as were measures of health outcomes (cardiovascular, mental health and infections). The first results have confirmed large inequalities in health between ethnic groups, such as diabetes and depressive symptoms, and also early markers of disease such as arterial wave reflection and chronic kidney disease, which can only just partially be explained by inequalities in traditional risk factors, such as obesity and socioeconomic status. In addition, the first results provided important clues for targeting prevention and healthcare. Future plans HELIUS will be used for further research on the underlying causes of ethnic differences in health. Follow-up data will be obtained by repeated measurements and by linkages with existing registries (eg, hospital data, pharmacy data and insurance data).

Chang; Kohler, Jillian Clare; Hoffmann, Julia; Mungala, Lucy			No More Broken Promises: Challenges and Opportunities for Key Populations in Demanding More Transparency, Accountability, and Participation in the Global Response Against the HIV and AIDS Epidemic	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							PATIENT; HEALTH; CARE	The global fight against HIV/AIDS continues to pose challenges: infection rates are on the rise in many settings, stigma and discrimination remain rampant, and the global response is under increasing financial pressure. There is a high risk of losing what has been achieved so far in the fight against HIV and AIDS, but also the momentum to meet the so-called Fast Track targets for 2030. In light of these trends, it is fundamental to focus on the human rights of key populations (KPs)-especially to health, non-discrimination, access to information, and to equal and meaningful participation in political and public affairs-by placing them at the center of the global HIV response. Such rights, and the demand for more transparency, accountability, and participation (TAP), have been recognized as both a necessary social justice imperative, and as a way to build more responsive, inclusive, and sustainable health systems. This article will argue that embracing TAP as key guiding principles of the global HIV response (especially in low-and middle-income countries) could have the potential to create the conditions for KPs to have their human rights fulfilled, and to expand their participation in the decision-making processes that guide the efforts against the epidemic. It will then propose a number of avenues for further engagement between different communities of practice in terms of research, agendas, and policy and practices that could be beneficial in maximizing the impact of the global efforts to end HIV/AIDS.

J	Degtiar, I				Degtiar, Irina			A review of international coverage and pricing strategies for personalized medicine and orphan drugs	HEALTH POLICY			English	Review						Precision medicine[MeSH]; Orphan drug production[MeSH]; Insurance, health, reimbursement[MeSH]; Pricing	REIMBURSEMENT DECISIONS; PAYER PERSPECTIVES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; POLICY DEVELOPMENT; PATIENT ACCESS; RARE DISEASES; MARKET ACCESS; UNITED-STATES; HEALTH-CARE; CHALLENGES	Background: Personalized medicine and orphan drugs share many characteristics both target small patient populations, have uncertainties regarding efficacy and safety at payer submission, and frequently have high prices. Given personalized medicine's rising importance, this review summarizes international coverage and pricing strategies for personalized medicine and orphan drugs as well as their impact on therapy development incentives, payer budgets, and therapy access and utilization. Methods: PubMed, Health Policy Reference Center, EconLit, Google Scholar, and references were searched through February 2017 for articles presenting primary data. Results: Sixty-nine articles summarizing 42 countries' strategies were included. Therapy evaluation criteria varied between countries, as did patient cost-share. Payers primarily valued clinical effectiveness; cost was only considered by some. These differences result in inequities in orphan drug access, particularly in smaller and lower-income countries. The uncertain reimbursement process hinders diagnostic testing. Payer surveys identified lack of comparative effectiveness evidence as a chief complaint, while manufacturers sought more clarity on payer evidence requirements. Despite lack of strong evidence, orphan drugs largely receive positive coverage decisions, while personalized medicine diagnostics do not. Conclusions: As more personalized medicine and orphan drugs enter the market, registries can provide better quality evidence on their efficacy and safety. Payers need systematic assessment strategies that are communicated with more transparency. Further studies are necessary to compare the implications of different payer approaches.

Data from a nationally-representative cross-sectional Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE) (N = 3646) conducted in South Africa from 2007-2008 was analyzed. The primary outcome was self-reported cataract, and exposures included socio-demographics, self-reported co-morbidities, and behavioral factors. Linearized multivariate logistic regression models were used. The weighted prevalence of self-reported diagnosed cataract was 4.4% (95% CI: 3.4-5.8). Prevalence was greater among individuals with advancing age (10.2%), higher quality of life (QoL) (5.9%), education (5.2%), and wealth (5.8%) than their counterparts.

Methods In this study we demonstrate a measurable framework for assessing health facility capacity to provide newborn care using open access, nationally-representative Service Provision Assessment (SPA) data from the Demographic Health Surveys Program. In particular, we examine whether key newborn-related services are available at the facility (ie, service availability, measured by the availability of basic emergency obstetric care (BEmOC) signal functions, newborn signal functions, and routine perinatal services), and whether the facility has the equipment, medications, training and knowledge necessary to provide those services (ie, service readiness, measured by general facility requirements, equipment, medicines and commodities, and guidelines and staffing) in five countries with high levels of neonatal mortality and recent SPA data: Bangladesh, Haiti, Malawi, Senegal, and Tanzania. Findings In each country, we find that key services and commodities needed for comprehensive delivery and newborn care are missing from a large percentage of facilities with delivery services. Of three domains of service availability examined, scores for routine care availability are highest, while scores for newborn signal function availability are lowest. Of four domains of service readiness examined, scores for general requirements and equipment are highest, while scores for guidelines and staffing are lowest. Conclusions Both service availability and readiness tend to be highest in hospitals and facilities in urban areas, pointing to substantial equity gaps in the availability of essential newborn care services for rural areas and for people accessing lower-level facilities. Together, the low levels of both service availability and readiness across the five countries reinforce the vital importance of monitoring health facility capacity to provide care. In order to save newborn lives and improve equity in child survival, not only does women's use of services need to increase, but facility capacity to provide those services must also be enhanced.

Within-person analysis of welfare transitions in a longitudinal panel survey reveals change in mental health service use	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						health service research; longitudinal; mental health; social inequalities; unemployment	SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; DISORDERS; PREVALENCE; RECIPIENTS; OUTCOMES; INCOME; LIFE	Background While international research shows that receipt of welfare benefits is associated with poor mental health, less is known about the relationship between welfare receipt and mental health service use. We investigate whether within-person change in welfare recipient status is associated with change in mental health service use. Methods Analysis of two waves of data from an Australian national household survey. Random- and fixed-effect models considered the effect of change in welfare receipt status, and assessed whether change in mental health service use differed by type of welfare benefit or the direction of welfare transition. Results Individuals were more likely to report greater mental health service use at times of welfare receipt. These associations were attenuated, but remained significant, after adjusting for mental health. Increased health service use was not tied to specific types of welfare benefits. The increase in mental health service use associated with a transition onto welfare benefits was much greater than the decline in service use associated with the transition off benefits. Conclusions Within individuals, welfare receipt is associated with greater mental health service use. While this does reflect poorer mental health at the time of welfare receipt, other factors seem to facilitate health service use.

PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Article							UNMET NEED	CONTEXTThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to achieve health equity, and they apply to all countries. SDG contraceptive use estimates for the United States are needed to contextualize U.S. performance in relation to that of other countries. METHODSData from the 2011-2013 and 2013-2015 waves of the National Survey of Family Growth were used to calculate three SDG indicators of contraceptive use for U.S. women aged 15-44: contraceptive prevalence, unmet need for family planning and demand for family planning satisfied by modern methods. These measures were calculated separately for married or cohabiting women and for unmarried, sexually active women; differences by sociodemographic characteristics were assessed using t tests from logistic regression analysis. Estimates for married women were compared with 2010-2015 estimates from 94 other countries, most of which were low- or middle-income. RESULTSFor married or cohabiting women, U.S. estimates for contraceptive prevalence, unmet need and demand satisfied by modern methods were 74%, 9% and 80%, respectively; for unmarried, sexually active women, they were 85%, 11% and 82%, respectively. Estimates varied by sociodemographic characteristics, particularly among married or cohabiting women. Five countries performed better than the United States on contraceptive prevalence, 12 on unmet need and four on both measures; seven performed better on demand satisfied by modern methods. CONCLUSIONSThere is a need to continue efforts to expand access to contraceptive care in the United States, and to monitor the SDG indicators so that improvement can be tracked over time.

Guided by community voices, feminist theories, and qualitative empirical research, we reviewed two decades of global quantitative research on sexuality among women living with HIV. In the 32 studies we found, conducted in 25 countries and composed mostly of cis-gender heterosexual women, sexuality was narrowly constructed as sexual behaviours involving risk (namely, penetration) and physiological dysfunctions relating to HIV illness, with far less attention given to the fullness of sexual lives in context, including more positive and rewarding experiences such as satisfaction and pleasure. Findings suggest that women experience declines in sexual activity, function, satisfaction, and pleasure following HIV diagnosis, at least for some period. The extent of such declines, however, is varied, with numerous contextual forces shaping women's sexual well-being. Clinical markers of HIV (e.g., viral load, CD4 cell count) poorly predicted sexual outcomes, interrupting widely held assumptions about sexuality for women with HIV. Instead, the effects of HIV-related stigma intersecting with inequities related to trauma, violence, intimate relations, substance use, poverty, aging, and other social and cultural conditions primarily influenced the ways in which women experienced and enacted their sexuality. However, studies framed through a medical lens tended to pathologize outcomes as individual "problems," whereas others driven by a public health agenda remained primarily preoccupied with protecting the public from HIV. In light of these findings, we present a new feminist approach for research, policy, and practice toward understanding and enhancing women's sexual lives-one that affirms sexual diversity; engages deeply with society, politics, and history; and is grounded in women's sexual rights.

This study examined perceptions of the relationship between severe storms, sea level rise, climate change and ecological barriers by a vulnerable environmental justice population in New Jersey. Patients using New Jersey's Federally Qualified Health Centers were interviewed after Hurricane [Superstorm] Sandy because it is essential to understand the perceptions of uninsured, underinsured, and economically challenged people to better develop a resiliency strategy for the most vulnerable people. Patients (N = 355) using 6 centers were interviewed using a structured interview form. Patients were interviewed in the order they entered the reception area, in either English or Spanish. Respondents were asked to rate their agreement with environmental statements. Respondents 1) agreed with experts that "severe storms were due to climate change", "storms will come more often", and that "flooding was due to sea level rise", 2) did not agree as strongly that "climate change was due to human activity", 3) were neutral for statements that "Sandy damages were due to loss of dunes or salt marshes". 4) did not differ as a function of ethnic/racial categories, and 5) showed few gender differences. It is imperative that the public understand that climate change and sea level rise are occurring so that they support community programs (and funding) to prepare for increased frequency of storms and coastal flooding. The lack of high ratings for the role of dunes and marshes in preventing flooding indicates a lack of understanding that ecological structures protect coasts, and suggests a lack of support for management actions to restore dunes as part of a coastal preparedness strategy. Perceptions that do not support a public policy of coastal zone management to protect coastlines can lead to increased flooding, extensive property damages, and injuries or loss of life.

J	Susuman, AS				Susuman, A. Sathiya			Is Swaziland on Track with the 2015 Millennium Development Goals?	JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						Povery; primary education; child mortality; maternal health; Swaziland		According to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) agreement, each participating country has to periodically provide a report that will show the progress on their achievement towards the goals. This article's aim is to evaluate Swaziland's prospects of achieving eight MDGs by 2015. This article is an analysis of the current situation of Swaziland, and the aim of this analysis is to look beyond the statistical values to see if the achievements (including lifetime achievements) are on track and whether what is yet to be achieved can really be achieved. Secondary information was collected from various sources. Several countries and organizations have committed themselves to the following eight development goals: (1) eradicate extreme poverty; (2) achieve universal primary education; (3) promote gender equality and empower women; (4) reduce child mortality; (5) improve maternal health; (6) combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; (7) ensure environmental sustainability; and (8) develop a global partnership for development. National development is dependent on many factors; therefore, different countries across the world have adopted the MDGs as means of alleviating many of the social ills hindering progress and development. Based on different sources, Swaziland is on track with its MDGs, and there is no doubt that Swaziland will continue to work hard to these ends. It has been argued that there has been progress made that has resulted in significant changes to people's lives, but the question that has to be asked is how long these achievements can realistically last. A reduction of the rate of child mortality, maternal mortality and HIV/AIDS in Swaziland are needed.	[Susuman, A.

J	Brenner, MH				Brenner, M. Harvey			Small networks, evolution of knowledge and species longevity: Theoretical integration and empirical test	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article						Small group behavior; Evolutionary theory; Networks; Innovation; Cardiovascular disease; Economic development	ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; HEALTH; CONFLICT; ORIGINS	How do small groups play pivotal roles of invention and innovation in (human) organizations and cultures? Economic theories of human capital, i.e., knowledge-skills-provide classic formulations. The economic theories of human capital as intrinsic to societal development and physical survival have direct connections to small group theory of learning through communication and socioemotional interaction. These theories have important parallels in biological theories of the evolution of human intelligence. They are supplemented by social exchange theory and the ecological dominance-social-competition model. These theoretical approaches are common to the overlapping disciplines of social anthropology, sociology and the social psychology of small group behavior. However, even these theories, while plausible and mutually reinforcing, do not fully account for the extraordinary influence of small groups in the invention and innovation process. A crucial moment of invention and innovation is the psychological stress involved in expression/presentation (even to oneself) of a new idea (on an important subject) that is contrary to accepted (i.e., conventional) wisdom. In this article the argument is made that the social support function of small groups, discussed extensively in the epidemiological literature, facilitates that presentation by: (1) reality testing, i.e., confirmation of the validity (truth value), significance and usefulness of abstract or empirical discovery/creation; (2) emotional support moderating the effects of anxiety or threat; and (3) material support of the discoverer/discovery through financing or provision of significant social contacts. Thus, we observe trends in human knowledge and consequent economic development: (1) continuous enlargement of the base of knowledge through specialization and differentiation of disciplines and employment, where disciplinary knowledge is embedded in the structure of employment. (2) Sustainable economic development results in expanded human longevity-minus the losses through employment and income inequality. The impact of economic growth on species survival, engendered by small-group-mediated innovation, can be observed in a statistical model over the beneficial impact of economic development on global cardiovascular mortality.

Methods: The study was located in two disadvantaged urban communities in Delhi, India and Shanghai, China and was part of the multicountry (15) Global Early Adolescent Study. Qualitative methodologies were used with boys and girls aged 11-13 years, including 16 group-based timeline exercises and 65 narrative interviews. In addition, 58 parents of participating adolescents were interviewed. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated, and uploaded into Atlas.ti for coding and thematic analysis. Results: Boys and girls growing up in the same community were directed onto different pathways during their transition from early to late adolescence. Adolescents and parents in both sites identified mothers as the primary actor, socializing adolescents into how to dress and behave and what gender roles to play, although fathers were also mentioned as influential. Opposite-sex interactions were restricted, and violations enforced by physical violence. In Delhi, gender roles and mobility were more strictly enforced for girls than boys. Restrictions on opposite-sex interactions were rigid for both boys and girls in Delhi and Shanghai. Sanctions, including beating, for violating norms about boy-girl relationships were more punitive than those related to dress and demeanor, especially in Delhi. Education and career expectations were notably more equitable in Shanghai. Conclusions: Parents teach their children to adhere to inequitable gender norms in both Delhi and Shanghai. However, education and career expectations for boys and girls in the two sites differed. Although gender norms varied by site according to the particular cultural and historical context, similar patterns of gender inequity reflect the underlying patriarchal systemin both settings. The tendency of parents to pass on the norms they grew up with is evident, yet these results illustrate the social construction of gender through children's interaction with the social ecology, including evolving political and economic systems. Efforts to bend gender norms toward greater equality can build on these results by empowering children and parents to reflect critically on inequitable gender norms and roles and by mobilizing economic and social support at key turning points in adolescents' lives.

There are growing concerns about legalization of marijuana use and its related public health effects. We performed an interrupted time series analysis to evaluate these effects. METHODS: We collected a representative sample of hospital discharge data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, from January 1993 to December 2014. We divided the data in to 3 groups: the prelegalization period (1993-2008), the legalization period (2009), and the postlegalization period (2010-2014). The disease variables were International Classification of Disease-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification 304.30 cannabinoid dependency unspecified (CDU), 536.2 persistent vomiting, and an aggregate of CDU and persistent vomiting. We performed interrupted time series and Poisson-Gamma regression analysis to calculate each year's incidence rate of unspecified and persistent vomiting and CDU per 100,000 hospital discharges. CDU, persistent vomiting, and aggregate of CDU and persistent vomiting were modeled separately to estimate average incidence rate ratio and 95% confidence interval for each study phase. RESULTS: We observed an increasing trend of CDU or an aggregate of CDU and persistent vomiting during the prelegalization period. The legalization of marijuana significantly increased the incidence rate during the legalization period (by 17.9%) and the yearly average increase in rate by 6% after policy implementation, compared to the prelegalization period. The increase in rate of persistent vomiting after policy implementation increased significantly (by about 8%), although there were no significant trends in increase prior to or during marijuana legalization in 2009. CONCLUSIONS: In an interrupted time series analysis of before, during, and after medical marijuana legalization, we estimated levels and rate changes in CDU and persistent vomiting. We found persistent increases in rates of CDU and persistent vomiting during and after legalization of marijuana.

Methods: A cross-sectional study using data from the National Oral Health Survey conducted in 2010. All individuals answered a structured questionnaire containing questions on their use of dental care and socioeconomic conditions and underwent a clinical oral examination by a dentist. Concentration indices were decomposed to determine the contribution of socioeconomic factors to inequalities. Results: Being in the fifth wealth, quintile was associated with higher odds of having recently visited a dentist (reference: 1st quintile, odds-ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51-3.38). In addition, being in the top two quintiles of wealth was negatively associated with the use of public dental services. Having eight or more years of schooling was associated with higher odds of both having a recent dental visit and receiving preventive care (relative to having 0-3 years of education), and negatively associated with using public dental services. Results indicate pro-rich inequalities in recent dental visits and preventive dental care. Further, there was a pro-poor inequality in the use of public dental care services. Conclusions: The recent use of dental care and the use of preventive care are disproportionately concentrated among wealthier older adults, whereas the use of public services is more common among poorer individuals. Wealth inequalities in dental care use were mainly explained by socioeconomic factors, such as wealth and education, rather than oral health factors, such as needing treatment or a dental prosthesis.

J	Clermont, A				Clermont, Adrienne			The impact of eliminating within-country inequality in health coverage on maternal and child mortality: a Lives Saved Tool analysis	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Equity; Inequality; Lives Saved Tool; MNCH; Intervention coverage	INTERVENTIONS; COUNTDOWN; EQUITY	Background: Inequality in healthcare across population groups in low-income countries is a growing topic of interest in global health. The Lives Saved Tool (LiST), which uses health intervention coverage to model maternal, neonatal, and child health outcomes such as mortality rates, can be used to analyze the impact of within-country inequality. Methods: Data from nationally representative household surveys (98 surveys conducted between 1998 and 2014), disaggregated by wealth quintile, were used to create a LiST analysis that models the impact of scaling up health intervention coverage for the entire country from the national average to the rate of the top wealth quintile (richest 20% of the population). Interventions for which household survey data are available were used as proxies for other interventions that are not measured in surveys, based on co-delivery of intervention packages. Results: For the 98 countries included in the analysis, 24-32% of child deaths (including 34-47% of neonatal deaths and 16-19% of post-neonatal deaths) could be prevented by scaling up national coverage of key health interventions to the level of the top wealth quintile. On average, the interventions with most unequal coverage rates across wealth quintiles were those related to childbirth in health facilities and to water and sanitation infrastructure; the most equally distributed were those delivered through community-based mass campaigns, such as vaccines, vitamin A supplementation, and bednet distribution. Conclusions: LiST is a powerful tool for exploring the policy and programmatic implications of within-country inequality in low-income, high-mortality-burden countries. An "Equity Tool" app has been developed within the software to make this type of analysis easily accessible to users.

Using the last wave of the Spanish National Health Survey, we find that 1710 adults out of the original sample of 36,087 have diabetes, reporting higher rates of unemployment. Our empirical results suggest that persons with diabetes, compared with non-diabetic persons, have poorer labor outcomes in terms of length of unemployment and lower income. However, diabetes is not significantly associated with unemployment probabilities, suggesting that the burden of diabetes on employment is mediated by lifestyle factors and clinical and functional complications. In addition, there are mixed outcomes to this econometric approach, depending on age and gender, among other factors. This interesting finding has several implications for research and policy on strategies to get lower health inequalities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is also the case in Italy, where there has been a flow of immigrant nurses out of the country that has been documented over the past several years. In a short time, it has become a donor country to other developed European countries, such as the United Kingdom. Aims: To advance knowledge in the context of human rights conflicts and ethical implications of the decision-making process of nurses who migrate between developed countries, such as from Italy to the United Kingdom, during times of recession. Research design: A case study based on the descriptive phenomenological approach was undertaken in 2014. Participants and research context: A total of 26 Italian newly graduated nurses finding a job in the United Kingdom were interviewed via Skype and telephone. Ethical considerations: The Internal Review Board of the University approved the project. Findings: In accordance with the descriptive phenomenological approach undertaken, three main themes emerged: (1) escaping from the feeling of being refused/rejected in order to be desired, (2) perceiving themselves respected, as a person and as a nurse, in a growth project and (3) returning if the country changes its strategy regarding nurses. Discussion: Ethical implications in the context of human rights, such as autonomy of the decision, social justice and reciprocal obligation, non-maleficence and double effect, have been discussed. Conclusion: The call for investing in nurses and nurses' care in developed countries facing recession is urgent. Investing in nurses means respecting individuals and citizens who are at risk of developing health problems during the recession.

J	Snyder, J; Crooks, VA				Snyder, Jeremy; Crooks, Valorie A.			Can We Care for Aging Persons without Worsening Global Inequities? The Case of Long-Term Care Worker Migration from the Anglophone Caribbean	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL RETIREMENT MIGRATION; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; BRAIN-DRAIN; HEALTH; NURSES; MALAYSIA; TOURISM; IMPACT	The international migration of health workers, including long-term care workers (LCWs) for aging populations, contributes to a shortage of these workers in many parts of the world. In the Anglophone Caribbean, LCW shortages and the migration of nurses to take on LCW positions abroad threaten the health of local populations and widen global inequities in health. Many responses have been proposed to address the international migration of health workers generally, including making it more difficult for these workers to emigrate and increasing and improving local employment opportunities. In this article, we suggest an additional means of ethically reducing health worker migration, targeting the Anglophone Caribbean specifically. Countries in this region can take advantage of their warmer climate and well-trained work force to encourage aging populations in the global north to emigrate temporarily or permanently through international retirement migration. As a result, countries in the Anglophone Caribbean can not only decrease the international migration of trained health workers through the provision of well-paying, local jobs, but potentially reverse this flow by drawing on the international diaspora of their workers. International retirement migration, if carefully managed, can reduce global inequities in health while treating both retirees and LCWs ethically.

While the region has seen a decline in child mortality due to injuries over the years, inequality persists between the low-and middle-income countries and high-income countries in the region. The gap in child mortality due to unintentional injuries has widened over the years between these two socioeconomic regions, particularly in terms of road injuries. In contrast, mortality rate ratios due to intentional injuries have narrowed between 2000 and 2015. The low-and middle-income countries need to scale up their efforts in injury prevention by adopting stricter regulations and higher safety practices to narrow the East-West gap in unintentional injuries.

Correlates of Program Success and Recidivism among Participants in an Adult Pre-Arrest Diversion Program	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE			English	Article						Civil citation; Pre-arrest diversion; Deflection; Adult; Recidivism	MENTAL-HEALTH; ARREST; COURT; RISK; COMPLETION; PREVALENCE; VALIDATION; PREDICTORS; DISORDERS; OFFENDERS	Adult pre-arrest diversion, also known as "deflection," programs have great potential to change the way the criminal justice system currently operates. One defining feature of these programs is that they offer eligible adults the opportunity to avoid a formal criminal arrest record and all of the negative consequences that are associated with an arrest. The current study provides an assessment of factors related to successful program completion and post-program recidivism for participants in the Pre-Arrest Diversion/Adult Civil Citation (PAD/ACC) program in Leon County, Florida. Behavioral assessment and formal arrest data were drawn from 854 adults who participated in the program between March 2013 and June 2016. Adults undergo a comprehensive behavioral health assessment which utilizes the Global Assessment of Individual Needs (GAIN-SS). Several behavioral health indicators were associated with program outcome measures, which included successful program completion and post-program arrest. Participants with greater propensity for crime or violence, elevated levels of behavioral problems, and symptoms of a substance use disorder, including a positive drug screen, were more likely to fail to complete the program. Greater indications of behavioral problems and positive drug screen results were also significantly associated with a higher probability of post-program arrest. These results contribute to the lean knowledge related to the performance of these expanding programs, and they also have direct implications for the refinement of the PAD/ACC program.

J	Antonini, K; Langer, M; Farid, A; Walter, U				Antonini, Kelly; Langer, Martin; Farid, Ahmed; Walter, Ulrich			SWEET CubeSat - Water detection and water quality monitoring for the 21st century	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						CubeSat; Hyperspectral; Africa; Water quality; Mission design; Constellation	MERIS; CYANOBACTERIA; VALIDATION; RETRIEVAL; ENVISAT; LAKES; IOP	Water scarcity and contamination of clean water have been identified as major challenges of the 21st century, in particular for developing countries. According to the International Water Management Institute, about 30% of the world's population does not have reliable access to clean water. Consequently, contaminated water contributes to the death of about 3 million people every year, mostly children. Access to potable water has been proven to boost education, equality and health, reduce hunger, as well as help the economy of the developing world. Currently used in-situ water monitoring techniques are sparse, and often difficult to execute. Space-based instruments will help to overcome these challenges by providing means for water level and water quality monitoring of medium to-large sweet (fresh) water reservoirs. Data from hyperspectral imaging instruments on past and present governmental missions, such as Envisat and Aqua, has been used for this purpose. However, the high cost of large multi-purpose space vessels, and the lack of dedicated missions limits the continuous monitoring of inland and coastal water quality. The proposed CubeSat mission SWEET (Sweet Water Earth Education Technologies) will try to fill this gap. The SWEET concept is a joint effort between the Technical University of Munich, the German Space Operations Center and the African Steering Committee of the IAF. By using a novel Fabry-Perot interferometer based hyperspectral imager, the mission will deliver critical data directly to national water resource centers in Africa with an unmatched cost per pixel ratio and high temporal resolution. Additionally, SWEET will incorporate education of students in CubeSat design and water management. Although the aim of the mission is to deliver local water quality and water level data to African countries, further coverage could be achieved with subsequent satellites. Finally, a constellation of SWEET-like CubeSats would extend the coverage to the whole planet, delivering daily data to ensure reliable access to clean water for millions of people worldwide.

The association between alcohol consumption, risk taking behavior and a range of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS is well established. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS as well as harmful alcohol use in low and middle income countries is high. Alcohol has been identified as a modifiable risk factor in the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. The objective of this paper is to define research priorities for the interaction of alcohol and HIV/AIDS in low and middle income countries. The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) priority setting methodology was applied in order to assess research priorities of the interaction of alcohol and HIV/AIDS. A group of 171 global and local experts in the field of alcohol and or HIV/AIDS related research were identified and invited to generate research questions. This resulted in 205 research questions which have been categorized and refined by senior researchers into 48 research questions to be evaluated using five criteria: answerability, effectiveness, feasibility, applicability and impact, as well as equity. A total of 59 experts participated independently in the voluntary scoring exercise (a 34% response rate). There was substantial consensus among experts on priorities for research on alcohol and HIV. These tended to break down into two categories, those focusing on better understanding the nexus between alcohol and HIV and those directed towards informing practical interventions to reduce the impact of alcohol use on HIV treatment outcomes, which replicates what Bryant (Subst Use Misuse 41:1465-1507, 2006) and Parry et al. (Addiction 108:1-2, 2012) found. Responses from experts were stratified by location in order to determine any differences between groups. On average experts in the LMIC gave higher scores than the HIC experts. Recent research has shown the causal link between alcohol consumption and the incidence of HIV/AIDS including a better understanding of the pathways through which alcohol use affects ARV adherence (and other medications to treat opportunistic infections) and CD4 counts. The results of this process clearly indicated that the important priorities for future research related to the development and assessment of interventions focusing on addressing alcohol and HIV/AIDS, addressing and exploring the impact of HIV risk and comorbid alcohol use, as well as exploring the risk and protective factors in the field of alcohol and HIV/AIDS. The findings from this priority setting exercise could guide international research agenda and make research funding more effective in addressing the research on intersection of alcohol and HIV/AIDS.

DesignQualitative interview study. SettingThree public maternity units in the Paris region. PopulationWomen born in SSA or in France of French parents and treated for hypertension or pre-eclampsia during their pregnancy. MethodsA sociologist conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews of 33 women during their postpartum hospitalisation and collected data from their medical files. n'vivo 10 (QSR International) was used for line-by-line coding of the transcriptions, to identify emerging themes. Strauss's concept of illness trajectories was then applied to these data. Main outcome measuresThemes derived from interviews. ResultsWomen reported during the interviews that the blood pressure measurement procedures used by hospital staff varied between the two groups, and their medical records supported this finding. Repeated urinary dipstick testing of proteinuria before laboratory testing was more frequent for African women, as was the failure to further test proteinuria levels requiring additional action. The two groups received similar standardised care after severe complications. Other findings showed that African women were less likely to rely on healthcare services. ConclusionsThese results suggest non-medically justified differential prenatal care between African and native women that may have helped delay the diagnosis of hypertension or pre-eclampsia. This study suggests hypotheses for further quantitative studies to explore the potential involvement of this differential care in the higher frequency of severe complications in this subgroup, concordantly reported in European countries hosting SSA migrants. Tweetable abstractDifferential prenatal care may delay diagnosis of pre-eclampsia among African compared with native French women.

Costs and savings of parenting interventions: results of a systematic review	CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						cost-effectiveness analysis; decision makers; health economics; parent-infant interaction; resource allocation; systematic review		BackgroundThis systematic review of economic evaluations of universal preventative or targeted treatment parenting interventions that aim to enhance parent-infant interaction is primarily intended to inform decision makers who have to make difficult spending decisions, especially at a time of reduced spending allocations. A synthesis of available costs and savings about parenting interventions that set out to enhance parent-infant interaction is presented. This topic is important specifically in view of the UK Governments' emphasis on the equalities agenda and the early years. The benefits of positive early life experiences, which include good parent-infant interaction, are far reaching and may be positively correlated with improved educational, health and well-being outcomes and reduced criminality. MethodsA literature search was undertaken using on-line indexing databases between 2004 and 2014 that included the search terms parent', infant', interaction', cost benefit analysis' and their synonyms. ResultsDespite existing economic studies generally focusing upon targeted short-run outcomes, significant savings were observed in the included studies. Parenting interventions could save the health service around 2.5k per family over 25years and could save the criminal justice system over 145k pound per person over the life course. In light of the escalating costs of remedial services, these potential savings may provide the UK and other governments with a robust incentive to invest in early years parenting interventions. ConclusionsParenting interventions can be economically efficient and return savings on investment. Moreover, and one might argue as a moral imperative of democratic societies, population health can be improved and health inequalities reduced. An important debate is needed about early years policy, to include acknowledgement of the differences between UK and international healthcare systems and the potential savings from the synergistic and spin-off effects of early years interventions to inform decision-making to fund and implement appropriate action.

Postcolonial feminist and Indigenous feminist perspectives provided a critical analytical lens to this qualitative inquiry. The study was undertaken with AIDPs based in diverse community organisations located in off-reserve urban municipalities throughout the province of BC. From September 2013 to March 2014, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with: Indigenous primary caregivers (n=10), Indigenous Elders (n=4), AIDP workers (n=18) and administrative leaders (n=3). The purpose of this article is to examine and analyse the findings that focus on how AIDP workers supported family and children's health and well-being by transforming their routine policies and practices in ways that fostered caregivers' active engagement in their programmes. Findings centre on three main themes: (i) overcoming mistrust; (ii) being willing to move a step forward' and (iii) resisting what's taken-for-granted. These inter-related themes are examined and discussed in relation to the concept of cultural safety. The findings have international relevancy for social and healthcare community-based programmes that are questioning how to engage with parents who may be hard to reach as a result of multi-faceted social and structural factors.

Breastfeeding Support: A Geographic Perspective on Access and Equity	JOURNAL OF HUMAN LACTATION			English	Article						breastfeeding; breastfeeding support; health services research; lactation counseling; La Leche League International; social support	INFANT-DEATH-SYNDROME; SLEEP LOCATION; BED; RISK; POSITION	Background: Clinical lactation professionals, breastfeeding peer counseling, and mother-to-mother support are important sources of information and guidance for helping mothers initiate and maintain breastfeeding in the early weeks, months, and years postpartum. However, there is limited information concerning the geographic barriers that mothers face when seeking this support. Research aim: This study aimed to identify the geographic barriers to breastfeeding support, delineate gaps in access, assess inequities in the distribution of local support, and highlight the underlying differences in access and equity for different demographic and socioeconomic groups. Methods: The locations of formal breastfeeding support resources were collected for the state of Ohio for 2016 and were combined with demographic and socioeconomic estimates and derived transportation catchment areas to conduct an analysis of spatial access and equity. Results: Significant geographic gaps in formal breastfeeding support exist within the state of Ohio. Although urban areas benefit from a higher density of support options, including a wide variety of clinical experts and mother-to-mother support groups, inequities in exurban and rural areas were more strongly aligned with socioeconomic status than geography. In particular, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children offices in rural Ohio offer breastfeeding support to income-qualifying mothers but cannot address the needs of mothers who do not qualify. Conclusion: Spatial analytical approaches facilitate a more nuanced view of access and equity to breastfeeding support options, helping to both decompose important structural differences in the state of Ohio and identify locations that could benefit from additional breastfeeding support resources.

As health providers, scientists, educators, and leaders, nurses have an obligation to prepare for climate change and other impacts of ecosystem strain on human health. Design and MethodsReview of literature relevant to a planetary health framework. FindingsPopulation displacement, new disease patterns and health needs, stresses on air quality, food production and water systems, and equity concerns, as well as the generation of sustainable energy, are all intimately related to health. ConclusionsNurses are key to achieving the sustainable development goals that, like the planetary health framework, focus on environmental sustainability and human well-being. Nurses contribute to resilient health systems, as trusted leaders and providers of health care, and as advocates and change makers impacting the world. Clinical RelevanceIt is critical that nurses and other health professionals consider the multiple effects of ecosystem strain on human health, and anticipate population health and health system planning and response.

NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH			English	Article							GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS; AGED CHILDREN HBSC; HEALTH INEQUALITIES; ECONOMIC-CONDITIONS; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; FAMILY AFFLUENCE; ALCOHOL-PROBLEMS; BEHAVIOR; MORTALITY; TIMES	Introduction: Conflicting evidence has been reported on smoking behavior among adults during times of economic downturn. No study has yet investigated young people's smoking and inequalities in smoking during economic recessions. This study examines the association between country-level youth unemployment due to the economic recession and adolescent smoking and smoking inequalities in Europe. Methods: The WHO collaborative "Health Behaviour in School-aged Children" study in 2009/2010 included 15-year-old adolescents from 24 European countries (N = 43 093). Socioeconomic position (SEP) was measured by the Family Affluence Scale. Logistic multilevel models were conducted. The absolute rate of youth unemployment in 2010 (during the recession) and the relative change rate in youth unemployment (2005/2006-2009/2010) were regressed on smoking and SEP inequalities in smoking in 2010, respectively. Results: Youth unemployment rates were not significantly associated with overall smoking in adolescents. A higher absolute youth unemployment rate in 2010 related to lower likelihoods of smoking among middle (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99) and low affluent adolescents (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99) compared to high affluent adolescents. In contrast, an increase in youth unemployment (2005/2006-2009/2010) was not associated with overall likelihoods of smoking and inequalities in smoking. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that an increase in youth unemployment was not related to smoking and smoking inequalities. However, higher absolute levels of youth unemployment are related to lower likelihoods of smoking in lower SEP adolescents. Thus, smoking among vulnerable groups is more linked to the overall insecure circumstances and the affordability of cigarettes rather than to the economic recession itself. Implications: Economic recessions have often led to increases in adult and youth unemployment rates. Conflicting evidence has been reported on smoking behavior among adults during times of economic downturn. This study examines for the first time the impact of the economic recession on young people's smoking and socioeconomic inequalities in smoking. Findings highlight that rather than an increase in youth unemployment, the overall country-level youth unemployment rate is related to young people's tobacco use and particularly to lower odds in smoking among less affluent adolescents across Europe, a finding which is likely to be linked to the affordability of tobacco use.

J	Kamin-Friedman, S				Kamin-Friedman, Shelly			Would it be legally justified to impose vaccination in Israel? Examining the issue in light of the 2013 detection of polio in Israeli sewage	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH			English	Article						Polio; Public health law; Autonomy	PUBLIC-HEALTH ETHICS; CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION; JUSTICE; LAWS	Background: The detection of wild poliovirus in Israeli sewage in May 2013 led the health authorities to decide that children who had been vaccinated with IPV would also be vaccinated with OPV. The decision sought to protect vulnerable Israeli individuals who were either not vaccinated with IPV or who suffered from an immune deficiency, to preserve Israel's status as a polio-free country, to prevent the virus' "exportation" into vulnerable polio-free countries, and to participate in the global efforts toward the eradication of polio. After a massive public persuasion campaign, 79% of the children born after 2004 were vaccinated as well as 69% of the children residing in central Israel. A 2014 State Comptroller Report stated that the Ministry of Health should draw conclusions from the low compliance rates in certain Israeli regions. Goals: The article seeks to examine the legal legitimacy of mandatory vaccination in the service of eradicating a contagious disease (as opposed to preventing a pandemic outbreak), which was one of the objectives in the 2013 Polio case. It more specifically relates to current Israeli law as well as to a hypothetical new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination and enforce this through the use of criminal sanctions. Method: Qualitative content analysis through the interpretation of court judgements, laws, legislative protocols, health ministry guidelines and documented discussions of the Advisory Committee on Infectious Diseases and Immunization. Main findings and conclusion: A mandatory vaccination backed by criminal sanctions in the service of the eradication of contagious diseases would probably be perceived as infringing on the constitutional right to autonomy to a greater extent than necessary according to Israeli law and case law precedents. There may be some added value inherent in a new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination where nonrestrictive measures have been ineffective. However, the law should also specify a variety of sanctions to accompany the enforcement of mandatory vaccinations which would be formulated from least to most restrictive according to the "intervention ladder" concept. The law should also describe the circumstances which would justify the implementation of each and every sanction as well as the procedural safeguards designed for established decisions and fairness toward the individual(s) whose rights are infringed by the application of these sanctions.

J	Brondeel, R; Kestens, Y; Chaix, B				Brondeel, Ruben; Kestens, Yan; Chaix, Basile			An evaluation of transport mode shift policies on transport-related physical activity through simulations based on random forests	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY			English	Article						Active transport; Transport; Simulation study; Machine learning; Data integration; Health inequalities; RECORD cohort study; France	ACCELEROMETER DATA; INTERVENTIONS; WALKING; HEALTH; ASSOCIATIONS; NEIGHBORHOOD; INEQUALITIES; EXPOSURE; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT	Background: Physical inactivity is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of mortality, and transport accounts for a large part of people's daily physical activity. This study develops a simulation approach to evaluate the impact of the Ile-de-France Urban Mobility Plan (2010-2020) on physical activity, under the hypothesis that the intended transport mode shifts are realized. Methods: Based on the Global Transport Survey (2010, n = 21,332) and on the RECORD GPS Study (2012-2013, n = 229) from the French capital region of Paris (Ile-de-France), a simulation method was designed and tested. The simulation method used accelerometer data and random forest models to predict the impact of the transport mode shifts anticipated in the Mobility Plan on transport-related moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (T-MVPA). The transport mode shifts include less private motorized trips in favor of more public transport, walking, and biking trips. Results: The simulation model indicated a mean predicted increase of 2 min per day of T-MVPA, in case the intended transport mode shifts in the Ile-de-France Urban Mobility Plan were realized. The positive effect of the transport mode shifts on T-MVPA would, however, be larger for people with a higher level of education. This heterogeneity in the positive effect would further increase the existing inequality in transport-related physical activity by educational level. Conclusions: The method presented in this paper showed a significant increase in transport-related physical activity in case the intended mode shifts in the Ile-de-France Urban Mobility Plan were realized. This simulation method could be applied on other important health outcomes, such as exposure to noise or air pollution, making it a useful tool to anticipate the health impact of transport interventions or policies.

Measuring facility capability to provide routine and emergency childbirth care to mothers and newborns: An appeal to adjust for delivery caseload of facilities	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; OBSTETRIC CARE; COVERAGE; QUALITY; AVAILABILITY; INDICATORS; MORTALITY; COUNT	Background Measurement of Emergency Obstetric Care capability is common, and measurement of newborn and overall routine childbirth care has begun in recent years. These assessments of facility capabilities can be used to identify geographic inequalities in access to functional health services and to monitor improvements over time. This paper develops an approach for monitoring the childbirth environment that accounts for the delivery caseload of the facility. Methods We used data from the Kenya Service Provision Assessment to examine facility capability to provide quality childbirth care, including infrastructure, routine maternal and newborn care, and emergency obstetric and newborn care. A facility was considered capable of providing a function if necessary tracer items were present and, for emergency functions, if the function had been performed in the previous three months. We weighted facility capability by delivery caseload, and compared results with those generated using traditional "survey weights". Results Of the 403 facilities providing childbirth care, the proportion meeting criteria for capability were: 13% for general infrastructure, 6% for basic emergency obstetric care, 3% for basic emergency newborn care, 13% and 11% for routine maternal and newborn care, respectively. When the new caseload weights accounting for delivery volume were applied, capability improved and the proportions of deliveries occurring in a facility meeting capability criteria were: 51% for general infrastructure, 46% for basic emergency obstetric care, 12% for basic emergency newborn care, 36% and 18% for routine maternal and newborn care, respectively. This is because most of the caseload was in hospitals, which generally had better capability. Despite these findings, fewer than 2% of deliveries occurred in a facility capable of providing all functions. Conclusion Reporting on the percentage of facilities capable of providing certain functions misrepresents the capacity to provide care at the national level. Delivery caseload weights allow adjustment for patient volume, and shift the denominator of measurement from facilities to individual deliveries, leading to a better representation of the context in which facility births take place. These methods could lead to more standardized national datasets, enhancing their ability to inform policy at a national and international level.

As Belgium is a federal state with many responsibilities in health policies being transferred to the regional levels, regional breakdown of health indicators is becoming increasingly relevant for policy-makers, as a tool for planning and evaluation. We analyzed the educational disparities by region for all-cause and cause-specific premature mortality in the Belgian population. Methods: Residents with Belgian nationality at birth registered in the census 2001 aged 25-64 were included, and followed up for 10 years though a linkage with the cause-of-death database. The role of 3 socio-economic variables (education, employment and housing) in explaining the regional mortality difference was explored through a Poisson regression. Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) by educational level (EL), rate differences (RD), rate ratios (RR), and population attributable fractions (PAF) were computed in the 3 regions of Belgium and compared with pairwise regional ratios. The global PAFs were also decomposed into the main causes of death. Results: Regional health gaps are observed within each EL, with ASMRs in Brussels and Wallonia exceeding those of Flanders by about 50% in males and 40% in females among Belgian. Individual SE variables only explained up to half of the regional differences. Educational inequalities were also larger in Brussels and Wallonia than in Flanders, with RDs ratios reaching 1.8 and 1.6 for Brussels versus Flanders, and Wallonia versus Flanders respectively; regional ratios in relative inequalities (RRs and PAFs) were smaller. This pattern was observed for all-cause and most specific causes of premature mortality. Ranking the cause-specific PAFs revealed a higher health impact of inequalities in causes combining high mortality rate and relative inequality, with lung cancer and ischemic heart disease on top for all regions and both sexes. The ranking showed few regional differences. Conclusions: For the first time in Belgium, educational inequalities were studied by region. Among the Belgian, educational inequalities were higher in Brussels, followed by Wallonia and Flanders. The region-specific PAF decomposition, leading to a ranking of causes according to their population-level impact on overall inequality, is useful for regional policy-making processes.

Methods The birth certificates of 4,805 individuals born 1914-1916 in 16 districts of the Paris region were retrieved. The handwritten information provided the occupation of parents, the legitimacy status, life events (e.g. marriage, divorce), and the precise date of death when after 1945 (i.e. age 31 years (y) in the cohort). We used the median age at death (MAD) as a global measure of mortality, then studied separately survival to and after 31 y. Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and mixed effect Cox models were used. Results MAD showed large variations according to paternal occupation. The lowest MAD in both sexes was that of workers' children: it was 56.3 y (95% CI: [48.6-62.7]) in men and 67.4 y (95% CI: [60.8-72.7]) in women, respectively (95% CI: 13.4 y [5.7-21.3]) and 12.3 y (95% CI: [4.0-19.2]) below the highest MAD attained. MAD experienced by illegitimate children was 18.9 y (95% CI: [13.3-32.3]) shorter than of legitimate children. The multivariate analysis revealed that in both sexes survival to age 31 y was predicted independently by legitimacy and paternal occupation. Paternal occupation was found significantly associated with mortality after age 31 y in females only: accordingly difference in life expectancy at age 31 y was 4.4 y (95% CI: [1.2-7.6]) between upper class and workers' daughters. Conclusions Paternal occupation and legitimacy status were strong predictors of offspring longevity in this one-century historical cohort born during World War One.

The aim was to identify geographical areas which have shown progress in terms of equity (of income, schooling and urban occupancy) and test its effect on mortality from TB in a municipality of southeast Brazil. Methods: It is an ecological study considering TB as the basic cause for deaths registered between 2006 and 2013 on the Mortality Information System and other variables obtained through the Demographic Census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (2010). The geographical area for analysis comprised the areas of coverage of the health services. Social indicators have been constructed through the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The cases were geocoded and the annual mortality rate from TB was calculated with smoothing using the local empirical Bayesian method. Multiple linear regression was then performed. There was confirmation of the existence of spatial dependence of residue through the application of the Global Moran I test, and application of the Models with Global Spatial Effects, to identify the best standard of spatial regression. Results: The mortality rates ranged from 0.00 to 2.8 deaths per 100,000 people, per year. In the PCA, three indicators were constructed, and designated as indicators of income, social inequality, and social equity. In multiple linear regression, the indicator of social equity was statistically significant (P < 0.0001) but had a negative association, an adjusted R-2 of 28.36% and with spatial dependence (Moran I = 0.21, P = 0.003455). The best model to deal with existing spatial dependence was the Spatial Lag Model. Conclusions: The better social conditions have shown progress in reducing mortality from TB, thereby reinforcing the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, cartography was also applied, which can be replicated in other scenarios throughout the world, using a scope distinct from that of works traditionally produced in that it places the emphasis on social equity.

'Knowledge for better health' revisited the increasing significance of health research systems: a review by departing Editors-in-Chief	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Review						Agenda setting; Allocating funding; Capacity building; Equity; Health research systems; Health policies; Improved health; Knowledge production and translation; Research evaluation; Research impact assessment	RESEARCH IMPACT; GLOBAL HEALTH; BIOMEDICAL-RESEARCH; MEDICAL-RESEARCH; POLICY; CAPACITY; CARE; LONG; TRANSLATION; SERVICE	How can nations organise research investments to obtain the best bundle of knowledge and the maximum level of improved health, spread as equitably as possible? This question was the central focus of a major initiative from WHO led by Prof Tikki Pang, which resulted in a range of developments, including the publication of a conceptual framework for national health research systems - Knowledge for better health - in 2003, and in the founding of the journal Health Research Policy and Systems (HARPS). As Editors-in-Chief of the journal since 2006, we mark our retirement by tracking both the progress of the journal and the development of national health research systems. HARPS has maintained its focus on a range of central themes that are key components of a national health research system in any country. These include building capacity to conduct and use health research, identifying appropriate priorities, securing funds and allocating them accountably, producing scientifically valid research outputs, promoting the use of research in polices and practice in order to improve health, and monitoring and evaluating the health research system. Some of the themes covered in HARPS are now receiving increased attention and, for example, with the assessment of research impact and development of knowledge translation platforms, the journal has covered their progress throughout that expansion of interest. In addition, there is increasing recognition of new imperatives, including the importance of promoting gender equality in health research if benefits are to be maximised. In this Editorial, we outline some of the diverse and developing perspectives considered within each theme, as well as considering how they are held together by the growing desire to build effective health research systems in all countries. From 2003 until mid-June 2017, HARPS published 590 articles on the above and related themes, with authors being located in 76 countries. We present quantitative data tracing the journal's growth and the increasing external recognition of its role. We thank the many colleagues who have kindly contributed to the journal's success, and finish on an exciting note by welcoming the new Editors-in-Chief who will take HARPS forward.

J	Binns, C; Lee, MK; Low, WY; Zerfas, A				Binns, Colin; Lee, Mi Kyung; Low, Wah Yun; Zerfas, Alfred			The Role of Public Health Nutrition in Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Asia Pacific Region	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); public health nutrition; Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health (APACPH)		The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDCs) in 2015, which included several goals and targets primarily related to nutrition: to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger and to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health. In the Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health (APACPH) member countries as a group, infant and child mortality were reduced by more than 65% between 1990 and 2015, achieving the MDG target of two-thirds reduction, although these goals were not achieved by several smaller countries. The SDGs are broader in focus than the MDGs, but include several goals that relate directly to nutrition: 2 (zero hungerfood), 3 (good health and well-beinghealthy life), and 12 (responsible consumption and productionsustainability). Other SDGs that are closely related to nutrition are 4 and 5 (quality education and equality in gendereducation and health for girls and mothers, which is very important for infant health) and 13 (climate action). Goal 3 is good health and well-being, which includes targets for child mortality, maternal mortality, and reducing chronic disease. The Global Burden of Disease Project has confirmed that the majority of risk for these targets can be attributed to nutrition-related targets. Dietary Guidelines were developed to address public health nutrition risk in the Asia Pacific region at the 48th APACPH 2016 conference and they are relevant to the achievement of the SDGs. Iron deficiency increases the risk of maternal death from haemorrhage, a cause of 300000 deaths world-wide each year. Improving diets and iron supplementation are important public health interventions in the APACPH region. Chronic disease and obesity rates in the APACPH region are now a major challenge and healthy life course nutrition is a major public health priority in answering this challenge. This article discusses the role of public health nutrition in achieving the SDGs. It also examines the role of APACPH in education and advocacy and in fulfilling the educational needs of public health students in public health nutrition. [GRAPHICS] .

M.; Schroder-Back, Peter			Ethics in public health: call for shared moral public health literacy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article								Public Health (PH) in Europe has become much more vocal about its moral understandings since 1992. The rising awareness that PH issues were inseparable from issues of human rights and social justice almost self-evidently directed the agenda of EUPHA and the European Public Health (EPH)-conferences. Problems of cultural and behavioural change, and environmental issues on a global scale were also added. The Section Ethics in PH invited the EPH community to join in 'arm chair thinking': coming together at conferences not only to share the 'how' and 'what' of PH research, practices and policies but also the 'why'. Time has been reserved to genuinely discuss what moral values are at stake in the work of PH and to actively develop a moral language and framework for PH Ethics. The challenge for the next decades is to find ways to involve the general public in the cultivation of a shared moral PH literacy.	[Maeckelberghe, Els L.

The objective of our study-involving key informant discussions, participant observations and linked literature reviews-was to analyse how tuberculosis (TB) control strategies in Myanmar are influenced by the broader political, economic, epidemiological and health systems context using the Systemic Rapid Assessment conceptual and analytical framework. Our findings indicate that the substantial influx of donor funding, in the order of one billion dollars over a 5-year period, may be too rapid for the country's infrastructure to effectively utilize. TB control strategies thus far have tended to favour medical or technological approaches rather than infrastructure development, and appear to be driven more by perceived urgency to 'do something' rather informed by evidence of cost-effectiveness and sustainable long-term impact. Progress has been made towards ambitious targets for scaling up treatment of drug-resistant TB, although there are concerns about ensuring quality of care. We also find substantial disparities in health and funding allocation between regions and ethnic groups, which are related to the political context and health system infrastructure. Our situational assessment of emerging TB control strategies in this transitioning health system indicates that large investments by international donors may be pushing Myanmar to scale up TB and drug-resistant TB services too quickly, without due consideration given to the health system (service delivery infrastructure, human resource capacity, quality of care, equity) and epidemiological (evidence of effectiveness of interventions, prevention of new cases) context.

Although this problem was recognized over 100 years ago, insufficient action has been taken to address this issue. Under current policy, such infected children only receive their first antiparasitic treatment (praziquantel - PZQ) upon entry into primary school as current mass drug administration programmes typically target school-aged children. For many infected children, they will wait up to 6 years before receiving their first medication and significant schistosomiasis-related morbidity may have already established. This inequity would not be accepted for other diseases. To unveil some of the reasons behind this neglect, it is paramount to understand the intricate historical relationship between schistosomiasis and British Imperial medicine, to underline its lasting influence on today's public health priorities. This review presents a perspective on the historical neglect of paediatric schistosomiasis, focusing on important gaps that persist from the early days after discovery of this parasite. Looking to end this inequity, we address several issues that need to be overcome to move forward towards the lasting success of schistosomiasis control and elimination efforts.

J	Bremer, D; Inhestern, L; Knesebeck, OV				Bremer, Daniel; Inhestern, Laura; Knesebeck, Olaf von dem			Social relationships and physician utilization among older adults-A systematic review	PLOS ONE			English	Review							HEALTH-SERVICES UTILIZATION; PRIMARY-CARE; LIFE EVENTS; VISITS; SUPPORT; PEOPLE; ACCESS; DETERMINANTS; INEQUALITY; CHINESE	Background In older age health needs and demand for health services utilization increase. Individual's social relationships can play a decisive role regarding the utilization of outpatient health care services. This systematic review examines the associations of structural and functional dimensions of social relationships with outpatient health services use of older adults. Methods The databases PubMed, CINAHL, SocINDEX, PsycINFO, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), Sociological Abstracts, and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) were searched in February 2016. The methodological and reporting quality of the articles was assessed and the results were synthesized descriptively and systematically. Results Out of 1.392 hits, 36 articles (35 studies) were included in the systematic review. The methodological and reporting quality of the included articles was reasonable. Various structural and functional characteristics of social relationships were associated with the use (yes/no) and the frequency of using outpatient care among older adults. The majority of the associations between structural dimensions of social relationships and the use of physicians were positive and moderate in strength. The associations between functional dimensions of social relationships and the probability of using physician services were inconsistent and varied in strength. For the most part, social relationship variables assigned to the structural dimension were positively and weakly to moderately associated with the frequency of physician visits. Functional aspects of social relationships also tended to have positive associations with the frequency of physician utilization. The associations were weak to moderate in strength. Conclusions Measuring social relationships and their influence on health services use is a challenging methodological endeavor indicated by the inconclusive results. The results suggest that the outpatient care utilization behavior of older individuals being structurally and functionally integrated in social relationships is different to older adults being socially isolated or having no social support. All in all, the current status of quantitative data was insufficient.

J	Bonander, C; Jernbro, C				Bonander, Carl; Jernbro, Carolina			Does gender moderate the association between intellectual ability and accidental injuries? Evidence from the 1953 Stockholm Birth Cohort study	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Sweden; Gender; Health inequalities; Cognitive ability; Unintentional injury; Safety; Socioeconomic status; Accidents	ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS; LABOR-MARKET; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; RECURRENT EVENTS; EARLY ADULTHOOD; GLOBAL BURDEN; INTELLIGENCE; MORTALITY	In this paper, we test for gender differences in the effects of intellectual ability on accidental injury risks using longitudinal data from the 1953 Stockholm Birth Cohort study (n = 14,294). Intellectual ability was measured using IQ tests issued during a school survey at age similar to 13, and outcome and covariate data was collected via record linkage to population and health registers, following the cohort from childhood to 55 years of age. We used ICD codes to identify accidental injuries resulting in hospital admissions and deaths, and shared frailty models to quantify the effects of IQ, while allowing for within-individual dependencies and recurrent events. The models included tests for the moderating effects of gender, as well as childhood family variables (parental socioeconomic status), and cohort member mediators (highest achieved education, socioeconomic status and income at the time of the event). The results indicate an inverse association between childhood IQ and subsequent accidental injury events, where 1 SD decrease in IQ implies a 17.8% increase in injury risk. We also found evidence that gender moderates this relationship, where the effect size was twice as large for men than for women (21.8% vs 9.3% per 1 SD decrease). Adult socioeconomic status can explain roughly half of the observed association. Potential explanations for these results are discussed.

We interviewed CHWs, supervisors, and high-level officials (n = 95) in 6 study sites across sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia in early 2012 about the per diems given to them by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. These per diems for CHWs ranged from $1.50 to $ 2.40 per day. International officials defended per diems for CHWs with an arrayof arguments, primarily that they were necessary to defray the expenses that workers incurred during campaigns. But high-level ministry of health officials inmany countries were concerned that even small per diems were unsustainable. By contrast, CHWs saw per diems as a wage; the very small size of this wage led many to describe per diems as unjust. Per diem polio work existed in the larger context of limited and mostly exploitative options for female labor. Taking the perspectives of CHWs seriously would shift the international conversation about per diems toward questions of labor rights and justice in global health pay structures.

J	Leider, JP; DeBruin, D; Reynolds, N; Koch, A; Seaberg, J				Leider, Jonathon P.; DeBruin, Debra; Reynolds, Nicole; Koch, Angelica; Seaberg, Judy			Ethical Guidance for Disaster Response, Specifically Around Crisis Standards of Care: A Systematic Review	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review							SCARCE RESOURCES; LEGAL CHALLENGES; TRIAGE; STRATEGIES; ALLOCATION; MEDICINE; ISSUES; TIME; WAR	Background. Terrorism, disease outbreaks, and other natural disasters and mass casualty events have pushed health care and public health systems to identify and refine emergency preparedness protocols for disaster response. Ethical guidance, alongside legal and medical frameworks, are increasingly common components of disaster response plans. Objectives. To systematically review the prevalence and content of ethical guidance offered for disaster response, specifically around crisis standards of care (CSCs). Search methods. We systematically indexed academic literature from PubMed, Google Scholar, and ISI Web of Science from 2012 to 2016. Selection criteria. We searched for peer-reviewed articles that substantively engaged in discussion of ethical guidance for CSCs. Data collection and analysis. Researchers screened potential articles for identification and discussion of ethical issues in CSC planning. We categorized and cataloged ethical concepts and principles. Main results. Of 580 peer-reviewed articles mentioning ethics and CSCs or disaster planning, 38 (6%) met selection criteria. The systematic review of the CSC ethics literature since 2012 showed that authors were primarily focused on the ethical justifications for CSC (n = 20) as well as a need for ethics guidelines for implementing CSCs; the ethical justifications for triage (n = 19), both as to which criteria to use and the appropriate processes by which to employ triage; and international issues (n = 17). In addition to these areas of focus, the scholarly literature included discussion of a number of other ethical issues, including duty to care (n = 11), concepts of a duty to plan (n = 8), utilitarianism (n = 5), moral distress (n = 4), professional norms (n = 3), reciprocity (n = 2), allocation criteria (n= 4), equity (n = 4), research ethics (n = 2), duty to steward resources (n = 2), social utility and social worth (n = 2), and a number of others (n = 20). Although public health preparedness efforts have paid increasing attention to CSCs in recent years, CSC plans have rarely been implemented within the United States to date, although some components are common (e.g., triage is used in US emergency departments regularly). Conversely, countries outside the United States more commonly implement CSCs within a natural disaster or humanitarian crisis response, and may offer significant insight into ethics and disaster response for US-based practitioners. Conclusions. This systematic review identifies the most oft-used and -discussed ethical concepts and principles used in disaster planning around CSCs. Although discussion ofmore nuanced issues (e.g., health equity) are present, the majority of items substantively engaging in ethical discussion around disaster planning do so regarding triage and why ethics is needed in disaster response generally. Public health implications. A significant evolution in disaster planning has occurred within the past decade; ethical theories and frameworks have been put to work. For ethical guidance to be useful, it must be practical and implementable. Although high-level, abstract frameworks were once prevalent in disaster planning-especially in the early days of pandemic planning-concerns about the ethically difficult concept of CSCs pervade scholarly articles. Ethical norms must be clearly stated and justified and practical guidelines ought to follow from them. Ethical frameworks should guide clinical protocols, but this requires that ethical analysis clarifies what strategies to use to honor ethical commitments and achieve ethical objectives. Such implementation issues must be considered well ahead of a disaster. As governments and health care systems plan for mass casualty events, ethical guidance that is theoretically sound and practically useful can-and should-form an important foundation from which to build practical guidance for responding to disasters with morally appropriate means.

The anticipated demographic shift provides governments the opportunity to proactively align policies with the estimated demands for housing, transportation, social protection, and health and well-being. Oral health is a fundamental component of health and physical and mental well-being, and is influenced by the individual's changing experience, perceptions, expectations and ability to adapt to circumstances. As such, prevention of oral disease and maintenance of oral health contributes to the systemic health, well-being, and quality of life of older adults. Dental caries, periodontal disease, and tooth loss in older adults are global health concerns because they are highly prevalent worldwide, socio-economic inequalities contribute to these diseases, many of the risk factors are modifiable, and these diseases result in compromised oral health-related quality of life. Oral care must be tailored to the needs and level of dependency of older adults through the use of evidence-based approaches and inter-professional collaboration. The persistence of between countries and within countries oral health disparities indicate that population-based policies are also needed to address the underlying social, environmental, and economic causes of oral diseases.

This study evaluated the care processes of skilled birth attendants and women's satisfaction with the care in a public hospital in the Dominican Republic. The purpose of the assessment was to establish a baseline to build quality improvements. Methods: A cross-sectional, mixed-methods, observational study was conducted by an international team. Eighty-four participants were included in the Intrapartum Data Set (American College of Nurse-Midwives), and 55 participants completed the Chilean MaternalWell-Being Scale. The data set was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Three focus groups were conducted with health providers, and 4 focus groups were conducted with postpartum women. Themes were derived using content analysis. Results: Nurses were the skilled birth attendants (SBAs) for 54% of women; 46% were attended by either obstetricians or familymedicine residents. Ninety-one percent of newborns with nurse attendants had immediate skin-to-skin contact, compared to 79% of newborns with physician attendants. Newborns breastfed within the first hour of life for 67% of the dyads with nurse SBAs, whereas 24% of newborns attended by physicians did so. The well-being survey indicated most women perceived care was adequate or better, irrespective of attending provider. Nevertheless, 67% of rural women perceived care negatively. Qualitative findings indicated that some women felt neither respected nor heard. Discussion: When nurses managed the labor and birth, their care was comparable to that of physicians. Moreover, women were more likely to receive evidence-based newborn care, including skin-to-skin contact, immediate breastfeeding, and discharge instructions. Qualitative findings highlighted the discrepancy between health care providers' perception of the care they provided and patients' perceptions of that care. Reflexive practice and frequent communication with patients about their experience of care should be a part of every practitioner's toolkit, wherever that care is provided.

The paper argues that the capability approach, incorporating development ethics, provides a useful framework for considering the ethics of cloud computing in Africa. Coupled with global and intercultural ethics perspectives, both provide a rich human-centred view of the technology's benefits, drawbacks and ethical risks. Focussing on the transformational benefits and features of cloud computing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the health sector, the paper highlights potential ethical risks that are cause for concern. The paper concludes that while cloud computing has considerable potential for advancing development through the enhancement of capabilities, there remain huge challenges in its efficient, effective and ethical use. As a result, ethical risks related to equity, ownership, dependency, privacy, trust and security that reflect `unfreedoms' and 'capability deprivations' may consequently have an impact on the technology's potential as an information communication technology for development.

These interventions are regularly made in contexts where the target population is captive, for example, in health centres. In Chile, there are no oral health interventions delivered at home. Methods and analysis This community trial covers two disadvantaged urban areas in the province of Concepcicn. Both sectors have public preschool education coverage with a traditional programme (TP) to promote oral health. The intervention will comprise four to six visits by dental hygienists trained in the delivery of a standardised oral health promotion programme using motivational interviewing (MI) at home. The experimental group will receive TP and MI, while the control group will receive only TP. If a positive and significant effect of MI is found, this will be administered to the control group. For a 50% reduction in the incidence of caries, a sample size of 120 preschoolers per group is estimated. Data will be gathered on demographic and socioeconomic variables; oral health outcomes using WHO oral health indicators (the prevalence and severity of caries, periodontal disease, dentofacial anomalies and oral hygiene); the oral health literacy of caregivers, measured by the Rapid Estimation of Adult Literacy in Dentistry and the Oral Health Literacy Instrument, both validated for the Chilean population. Assessments will take place at baseline and at 12-month follow-up. Ethics and dissemination The university bioethics committee approved this study (EI/21/2014). We will submit the trial's results for presentation at international scientific meetings and to peer-reviewed journals.

J	Lopes, ACS; de Menezes, MC; de Araújo, ML				Souza Lopes, Aline Cristine; de Menezes, Mariana Carvalho; de Araujo, Melissa Luciana			Food environment and access to fruits and vegetables: "A metropolis into perspective"	SAUDE E SOCIEDADE			English	Article						Food Environment; Food and Nutritional Security; Fruits; Vegetables; Public Policy; Nutrition in Public Health	NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS; LOCATION	This study aimed to explore the food environment, according to the access to fruits and vegetables (FV), from the perspective of a great Brazilian metropolis, which is an international reference for public policies on food and nutritional security (SAN). We reviewed the literature and the official website that showed SAN and urban planning policies of Belo Horizonte-MG; we also built maps. In this city, SAN programs serve more than 1 million people a day, including initiatives to encourage food production, protection and promotion of food consumption, subsidized marketing of foods and meals, and food training. We found a concentration of shops selling FV - including those with public subsidies (open air markets and public farmers' markets) - in the richest region of the city, limiting the access of those living in the outskirts of the city. We also found territories with health promotion services (Health Academy Program). However, the increase in public and private farmers' markets, open air markets and supermarkets would be able to promote the access to healthy foods in the disadvantaged territories. These data show that civil society and government representatives must watch public policies, aiming to reduce inequities, and contribute to improve the quality of life and social well-being of the population, in addition to collaborate for sustainable food systems. We suggest that SAN public policies should dialogue with other policies, such as those ofurban planning, social welfare, and agriculture, to promote fairness and intersectorally meet the needs of more vulnerable communities.

In a rapidly urbanising world, now is the time for Urban HIA. This article describes the development of robust and easy-to-use HIA tools to identify and address health inequalities from new urban policies. Methods: Rapid reviews and consultation with experts identified existing HIA screening tools and methodologies which were then analyzed against predefined selection criteria. A draft Urban HIA Screening Tool (UrHIST) and Urban HIA methodology (UrHIA) were synthesised. The draft tools were tested and refined using a modified Delphi approach that included input from urban and public health experts, practitioners and policy makers. Results: The outputs were two easy-to-use stand-alone urban HIA tools. The reviews and consultations identified an underpinning conceptual framework. The screening tool is used to determine whether a full HIA is required, or for a brief assessment. Urban health indicators are a readily available and efficient means of identifying variations in the health of populations potentially affected by policies. Indicators are, however, currently underutilised in HIA practice. This may limit the identification of health inequalities by HIA and production of recommendations. The new tools utilise health indicator data more fully. UrHIA also incorporates a hierarchy of evidence for use during impact analysis. Conclusion: The new urban HIA tools have the potential to enhance the rigour of HIAs and improve the identification and amelioration of health inequalities generated by urban policies.

Evidence to inform resource allocation for tuberculosis control in Myanmar: a systematic review based on the SYSRA framework	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Review						Asia; Myanmar; policy; resource allocation; review; tuberculosis	ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUG-RESISTANCE; PRIVATE GPS; TB; YANGON; ACCESS; SURVEILLANCE; PREVALENCE; EQUITY; GRANTS; CARE	Myanmar represents an extreme example of the difficulties in optimally allocating resources for maximum public health benefit, on the basis of limited information. At the recent Myanmar Health Forum ` Investing in Health' much of the discussion revolved around what to invest in, how health systems could be strengthened, and what research and capacity building areas the international donor community should prioritise for support. Funding for infectious disease control, particularly HIV and tuberculosis, is being channelled to the country at an unprecedented rate, but very little research has been conducted in recent years, and existing information has not yet been synthesised. This paper presents findings of the first systematic literature review on tuberculosis control and the health system in Myanmar, with the aim of informing the development of optimal research priorities and strategies. Medline and grey literature were searched for relevant papers. Inclusion criteria and analyses were structured to capture data on the Myanmar health system, healthcare delivery, financing, tuberculosis control indicators and information systems. A total of 77 papers were included in the analysis. The results indicate that there has been a large increase in the number of peer-reviewed articles published on tuberculosis in Myanmar over the past decade, although the absolute number of studies remains small. We identified several areas in which evidence to inform policy and resource allocation decisions is lacking, including research focused on rural and/ or vulnerable populations, analyses of risk factors for TB and drug resistance that can inform prevention strategies and economic analyses for optimising resource allocation. The gaps in research to inform policy identified through this study may be relevant to other low resource settings with extremely limited research capacity.	[Khan, Mishal S.; Khilji, Sara U.

J	Matheson, D; Park, K; Soakai, TS				Matheson, Don; Park, Kunhee; Soakai, Taniela Sunia			Pacific island health inequities forecast to grow unless profound changes are made to health systems in the region	AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW			English	Article						health promotion; health system evaluation; health system strengthening; Healthy Islands; Pacific island health development; settings approach; sustainable development goals	TRADE-POLICY	Objective Twenty years ago the Pacific's health ministers developed a Healthy Islands' vision to lead health development in the subregion. This paper reports on a review of health development over this period and discusses the implications for the attainment of the health related Sustainable Development Goals. Methods The review used qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative review included conducting semi-structured interviews with Pacific Island Government Ministers and officials, regional agencies, health workers and community members. A document review was also conducted. The quantitative review consisted of examining secondary data from regional and global data collections. Results The review found improvement in health indicators, but increasing health inequality between the Pacific and the rest of the world. Many of the larger island populations were unable to reach the health Millennium Development Goals. The Healthy Islands' vision remained an inspiration to health ministers and senior officials in the region. However, implementation of the Healthy Islands' approach was patchy, under-resourced and un-sustained. Communicable and Maternal and Child Health challenges persist alongside unprecedented levels of non-communicable diseases, inadequate levels of health finance and few skilled health workers as the major impediments to health development for many of the Pacific's countries. Conclusions The current trajectory for health in the Pacific will lead to increasing health inequity with the rest of the world. The challenges to health in the region include persisting communicable disease and maternal and child health threats, unprecedented levels of NCDs, climate change and instability, as well as low economic growth. In order to change the fortunes of this region in the age of the SDGs, a substantial investment in health is required, including in the health workforce, by countries and donors alike. That investment requires a nuanced response that takes into account the contextual differences between and within Pacific islands, adherence to aid effectiveness principles and interventions designed to strengthen local health systems. What is known about the topic? It is well established that the Pacific island countries are experiencing the double disease burden, and that the non-communicable disease epidemic is more advanced. What does this paper add? This paper discusses the review of 20 years of health development in the Pacific. It reveals that although progress is being made, health development in the region is falling behind that of the rest of the world. It also describes the progress made by the Pacific countries in pursuit of the Healthy Islands' concept. What are the implications for practitioners? This paper has significant implications for Pacific countries, donor partners and development partners operating across and within Pacific countries. It calls for a substantial increase in health resourcing and the way development assistance is organised to arrest the increasing inequities in health outcomes between Pacific people and those of the rest of the world.

However, there is evidence of a positive association between income inequality and adolescent fertility across countries. Nevertheless, this key finding is not focused on low-income countries. This study applies a multilevel logistic regression of country-level adolescent fertility on country-level income inequality plus individual-level income and controls to the Demographic and Health Surveys data. A negative association between income inequality and adolescent fertility was found among low-income countries, controlling for income (OR = 0.981; 95%CI: 0.963-0.999). Different measures and different subsamples of countries show the same results. Therefore, the international association between income inequality and adolescent fertility seems more complex than previously thought.

In recent years there have been significant strides with improving the public health system, and addressing current inequalities, with the right to health a constitutional provision in South Africa. Initiatives include the introduction of National Health Insurance, programmes to enhance access to medicines for patients with chronic diseases, as well as activities to improve care in hospitals, including improving pharmacovigilance. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to review ongoing initiatives within the public healthcare sector in South Africa and their influence to provide future direction. Method : Principally a structured review of current and planned activities. Results : There have been a number of major activities and initiatives surrounding the availability and access to medicines in the public system in recent years in South Africa. This includes a National Surveillance Centre and an innovative early warning system for the supply of medicines as well as the development of a National Health Care Pricing Authority and initiatives to improve contracting. There have also been developments to improve the supply chain including instigating Medicine Procurement Units in the provinces and enhancing forecasting capabilities. Access to medicines is improving though the instigation of stable chronic disease management initiatives to increase the number of external pick-up points for medicines. There are also ongoing programmes to enhance adherence to medicines as well as enhance adherence to the Standard Treatment Guidelines and the Essential Medicines List with their increasing availability. In addition, there is a movement to enhance the role of health technology assessment in future decision making. Hospital initiatives include increased focus on reducing antimicrobial resistance through instigating stewardship programmes as well as improving adverse drug reaction reporting and associated activities. Conclusion : Overall, there are an appreciable number of ongoing activities within the public healthcare system in South Africa attempting to ensure and sustain universal healthcare. It is too early to assess their impact, which will be the subject of future research.

A large body of research has examined the relationship between family structure and youth developmental outcomes and few studies have reported the gender differentials in the effect of changing family structure on these outcomes. In an increasingly knowledge-based globalized world, educational achievement is critical for the development of youth. This exploratory study examines the gender differences in the effect of family structure on educational outcomes of youth in Nigeria. We used the 2010 Nigeria General Household Survey which is available through Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS)-International, consisting of 14,178 males and 13,858 females. Family structure was a significant predictor of youth educational outcomes, and there were significant gender differentials. There was a negative relationship between living with neither parent and ever enrolling among males and females, but the effect was much stronger for females. Interventions should focus on improving existing resources and place youth who are living with neither parents and are unmarried in stable and friendly environments through mentorship programs and community caregiver support. Programs should also engage community leaders continuously about the consequences of early marriages among female youth.

Many policies have the potential to entrench or even expand inequities during implementation. At present little attention has been given to this in the social determinants of health literature. There is an international trend in the personalisation of funding for care services, from the National Health Service in the England to the Brukerstyrt Personlig Assistanse in Norway. Part of this trend is the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The NDIS has the potential to secure gains in health for hundreds of thousands of Australians living with a disability. However, policies are only as good as their implementation. Methods: As part of a longitudinal study on the implementation of the Australian NDIS, we conducted a systematic document search of policy documents pertaining to the Scheme on the websites of government departments with auspice over the design and implementation of the scheme with the aim of examining issues of equity. Results and discussion: Scheme architects have argued that the NDIS has the potential to replace a piecemeal and fragmented set of state-determined services with an empowering model of user choice and control. However, without careful attention to both existing inequities and, diversity and difference across populations (e.g. different disability types and different localities), market based approaches such as the NDIS have the serious potential to entrench or even widen inequities. Conclusions: The research concluded that 'personalisation' approaches can widen inequities and inequalities unless careful consideration is given at both policy design and implementation stages.

Frail health research systems in low-and middle-income countries can be an obstacle to achieve the goal of knowledge generation and the search for health equity before, during and after infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted to identify the challenges and opportunities facing the Dominican Republic with regards to developing international collaborative research partnerships in the context of the Zika outbreak and its ethical implications. Researchers conducted 34 interviews (n = 30 individual; n = 4 group) with 39 participants (n = 23 males; n = 16 females) representing the government, universities, international donor agencies, non-governmental organisations, community-based organisations and medical societies, in two metropolitan cities. Results: Five international collaborative research projects related to the Zika virus were identified. Major ethical challenges were linked to the governance of health research, training of human resources, the institutionalisation of scientific activity, access to research funds and cultural aspects. Capacity-building was not necessarily a component of some partnership agreements. With few exceptions, local researchers were merely participating in data collection and less on defining the problem. Opportunities for collaborative work included the possibility of participation in international research consortiums through calls for proposals. Conclusions: The Dominican government and research stakeholders can contribute to the international response to the Zika virus through active participation in international collaborative research partnerships; however, public recognition of the need to embrace health research as part of public policy efforts is warranted. A working group led by the government and formed by national and international research stakeholders will be key to identify ways in which the country could respond to the ethical demand of generating new knowledge in times of outbreaks.

On the one hand, they risk worsening power dynamics that perpetuate health disparities; on the other, they form an essential response to the need for healthcare resources to reach marginalized populations across the globe. Objectives: This study characterizes the broader landscape of global health academic partnerships, including challenges to developing ethical, equitable, and sustainable models. It then lays out guiding principles of the specific partnership approach, and considers how lessons learned might be applied in other resource-limited settings. Methods: The experience of a partnership between the Ministry of Health in Nepal, the nonprofit healthcare provider Possible, and the Health Equity Action and Leadership Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine was reviewed. The quality and effectiveness of the partnership was assessed using the Tropical Health and Education Trust Principles of Partnership framework. Results: Various strategies can be taken by partnerships to better align the perspectives of patients and public sector providers with those of expatriate physicians. Actions can also be taken to bring greater equity to the wealth and power gaps inherent within global health academic partnerships. Conclusions: This study provides recommendations gleaned from the analysis, with an aim towards both future refinement of the partnership and broader applications of its lessons and principles. It specifically highlights the importance of targeted engagements with academic medical centers and the need for efficient organizational work-flow practices. It considers how to both prioritize national and host institution goals, and meet the career development needs of global health clinicians.

The Case for Resource Sensitivity: Why It Is Ethical to Provide Cheaper, Less Effective Treatments in Global Health	HASTINGS CENTER REPORT			English	Article							HUMAN-RIGHTS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; RETHINKING HEALTH; DONATIONS; POLICY	When Dr. Hortense screens her patients in Chicago for cervical dysplasia and cancer, she conducts a pelvic exam, takes a sample of cervical cells, and sends them for Pap cytology and human papilloma virus DNA co-testing. But when she conducts cervical cancer screening in Botswana, she employs a much simpler diagnostic strategy. She applies acetic acid to highlight precancerous lesions and visually inspects the cervixa technique known as the VIA (visual inspection with acetic acid) method. She treats suspicious lesions with cryotherapy.There are multiple reasons that Dr. Hortense uses VIA in developing countries. It requires no specialized laboratory facilities or highly trained personnel. With immediate results, there is no delay in diagnosis and treatment, ensuring that patients are not lost to follow-up. Most importantly, VIA is considerably cheaper than Pap and HPV co-testing. This difference in care between Chicago and Botswana presents an ethical dilemma in global health: is it ethically acceptable to provide some patients cheaper treatments that are less effective or more toxic than the treatments other patients receive? We argue that it is ethical to consider local resource constraints when deciding what interventions to provide. The provision of cheaper, less effective health care is frequently the most effective way of promoting health and realizing the ethical values of utility, equality, and priority to the worst off.

We explored the role of behavioral and structural determinants of these variations, by using a dataset covering 17 European countries in the period 1970-2010, and by conducting multilevel multivariate regression analyses. Our results suggest that between-country variations in inequalities in current mortality can partly be understood from variations in inequalities in smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and poverty. Also, countries with higher national income, higher quality of government, higher social transfers, higher health care expenditure and more self-expression values have smaller inequalities in mortality. Finally, trends in behavioral risk factors, particularly smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, appear to partly explain variations in inequalities in mortality trends. This study shows that analyses of variations in health inequalities between countries can help to identify entry-points for policy.

This study examined the effectiveness of two educational courses for freshmen and sophomores that were designed to improve students' global health competencies. Design and SampleA trend study was conducted for all undergraduate nursing students enrolled in a 4-year undergraduate nursing program in 2013 and 2014. MeasuresWe assessed students' global health competencies (1-knowledge and interests in global health and health equity, 2-global health skills, and 3-learning needs) in 2013 and 2014 and analyzed variance between mean scores by year and by course exposure, using 95% confidence intervals. ResultsStudents who took both global health courses (sophomores in both years) reported higher global health-related knowledge and interests than did freshmen (p<.01); these scores were not sustained a year later. ConclusionsThe two courses may have improved students' global health competencies. Reinforcement of knowledge in later courses may be needed to build on the global competencies.

IFPMA Influenza Vaccine Supply I	Survey of distribution of seasonal influenza vaccine doses in 201 countries (2004-2015): The 2003 World Health Assembly resolution on seasonal influenza vaccination coverage and the 2009 influenza pandemic have had very little impact on improving influenza control and pandemic preparedness	VACCINE			English	Article						Seasonal influenza; Vaccination policy; Vaccination coverage rates; Pandemic preparedness; Vaccine recommendations; Monitoring and evaluation	IMMUNIZATION; PREVENTION; PROGRESS; RISK	There is no global monitoring system for influenza vaccination coverage, making it difficult to assess progress towards the 2003 World Health Assembly (WHA) vaccination coverage target. In 2008, the IFPMA Influenza Vaccine Supply International Task Force (IVS) developed a survey method to assess the global distribution of influenza vaccine doses as a proxy for vaccination coverage rates. The latest dose distribution data for 2014 and 2015 was used to update previous analyses. Data were confidentially collected and aggregated by the IFPMA Secretariat, and combined with previous IFPMA IVS survey data (2004-2013). Data were available from 201 countries over the 2004-2015 period. A "hurdle" rate was defined as the number of doses required to reach 15.9% of the population in 2008. Overall, the number of distributed doses progressively increased between 2004 and 2011, driven by a 150% increase in AMRO, then plateaued. One percent fewer doses were distributed in 2015 than in 2011. Twenty-three countries were above the hurdle rate in 2015, compared to 15 in 2004, but distribution was highly uneven in and across all WHO regions. Three WHO regions (AMRO, EURO and WPRO) accounted for about 95% of doses distributed. But in EURO and WPRO, distribution rates in 2015 were only marginally higher than in 2004, and in EURO there was an overall downward trend in dose distribution. The vast majority of countries cannot meet the 2003 WHA coverage targets and are inadequately prepared for a global influenza pandemic. With only 5% of influenza vaccine doses being distributed to 50% of the world's population, there is urgency to redress the gross inequities in disease prevention and in pandemic preparedness.

Global disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality	SEMINARS IN PERINATOLOGY			English	Review						Global disparities; Maternal mortality; Race/ethnicity	HEALTH; BRAZIL; WOMEN; RACE	The disparity in maternal mortality for African American women remains one of the greatest public health inequities in the United States (US). To better understand approaches toward amelioration of these differences, we examine settings with similar disparities in maternal mortality and "near misses" based on race/ethnicity. This global analysis of disparities in maternal mortality/morbidity will focus on middle- and high-income countries (based on World Bank definitions) with multiethnic populations. Many countries with similar histories of slavery and forced migration demonstrate disparities in health outcomes based on social determinants such as race/ethnicity. We highlight comparisons in the Americas between the US and Brazil two countries with the largest populations of African descent brought to the Americas primarily through the transatlantic slave trade. We also address the need to capture race/ethnicity/country of origin in a meaningful way in order to facilitate transnational comparisons and potential translatable solutions. Race, class, and gender-based inequities are pervasive, global themes. This approach is human rights based and consistent with the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and post 2015 sustainable development goals' aim to place women's health the context of health equity/women's rights. Solutions to these issues of inequity in maternal mortality are nation-specific and global. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The impact of socially-accountable, community-engaged medical education on graduates in the Central Philippines: Implications for the global rural medical workforce	MEDICAL TEACHER			English	Article							HEALTH-PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION; STUDENTS; PERFORMANCE; SERVICE	Introduction: Developing and retaining a high quality medical workforce, especially within low-resource countries has been a world-wide challenge exacerbated by a lack of medical schools, the maldistribution of doctors towards urban practice, health system inequities, and training doctors in tertiary centers rather than in rural communities.Aim: To describe the impact of socially-accountable health professional education on graduates; specifically: their motivation towards community-based service, preparation for addressing local priority health issues, career choices, and practice location.Methods: Cross-sectional survey of graduates from two medical schools in the Philippines: the University of Manila-School of Health Sciences (SHS-Palo) and a medical school with a more conventional curriculum.Results: SHS-Palo graduates had significantly (p<0.05) more positive attitudes to community service. SHS-Palo graduates were also more likely to work in rural and remote areas (p<0.001) either at district or provincial hospitals (p=0.032) or in rural government health services (p<0.001) as Municipal or Public Health Officers (p<0.001). Graduates also stayed longer in both their first medical position (p=0.028) and their current position (p<0.001).Conclusions: SHS-Palo medical graduates fulfilled a key aim of their socially-accountable institution to develop a health professional workforce willing and able, and have a commitment to work in underserved rural communties.

J	Meerow, S				Meerow, Sara			Double exposure, infrastructure planning, and urban climate resilience in coastal megacities: A case study of Manila	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE			English	Review						Climate change adaptation; globalization; megacities; urban infrastructure planning; urban resilience	GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; CITIES; SPACE; ADAPTATION; NETWORKS; CITY; GEOGRAPHY; IMPACTS; HEALTH	Coastal megacities pose a particular challenge for climate change adaptation and resilience planning. These dense concentrations of population, economic activity, and consumptionthe majority of which are in the Global Southare often extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea level rise and extreme weather. This paper unpacks these complexities through a case study of Metropolitan Manila, the capital of the Philippines, which represents an example of double exposure to climate change impacts and globalization. The city is experiencing tremendous population and economic growth, yet Manila is plagued by frequent natural disasters, congestion, inadequate infrastructure, poverty, and income inequality. The need for metro-wide planning and infrastructure transformations to address these problems is widely recognized, but governance challenges are a major barrier. Drawing on fieldwork, interviews, and other primary and secondary sources, I argue that climate change and globalization, in combination with Manila's historical and physical context, critically shape metro-wide infrastructure planning. Focusing on electricity and green infrastructure, I find that the largely decentralized and privatized urban governance regime is perpetuating a fragmented and unequal city, which may undermine urban climate resilience. This study extends the double exposure framework to examine how global processes interact with contextual factors to critically shape urban infrastructure planning, and how the resulting system conforms to theorized characteristics of urban climate resilience. In doing so, I help to connect emerging literatures on double exposure, urban infrastructure planning, and urban climate resilience.

European Respiratory Society statement: diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary disease in α<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency	EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL			English	Article							LUNG-VOLUME REDUCTION; SEVERE ALPHA-1-ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY; ALPHA-1 PROTEINASE-INHIBITOR; PI-ASTERISK-S; AUGMENTATION THERAPY; HEALTH-STATUS; ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY; REPLACEMENT THERAPY; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; SURVIVAL BENEFIT	alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common hereditary disorder in adults. It is associated with an increased risk of developing pulmonary emphysema and liver disease. The pulmonary emphysema in AATD is strongly linked to smoking, but even a proportion of never-smokers develop progressive lung disease. A large proportion of individuals affected remain undiagnosed and therefore without access to appropriate care and treatment. The most recent international statement on AATD was published by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society in 2003. Since then there has been a continuous development of novel, more accurate and less expensive genetic diagnostic methods. Furthermore, new outcome parameters have been developed and validated for use in clinical trials and a new series of observational and randomised clinical trials have provided more evidence concerning the efficacy and safety of augmentation therapy, the only specific treatment available for the pulmonary disease associated with AATD. As AATD is a rare disease, it is crucial to organise national and international registries and collect information prospectively about the natural history of the disease. Management of AATD patients must be supervised by national or regional expert centres and inequalities in access to therapies across Europe should be addressed.

Typically, these challenges are believed to involve a trade-off, especially in farming landscapes of the Global South. We conducted a multivariate analysis of social-ecological data from 110 landscapes in the Global South, and found that different system characteristics lead to partly predictable outcomes, resulting either in trade-offs or, unexpectedly, in synergies (mutual benefits) between food security and biodiversity. Specifically, these synergies are fostered by social equity, by reliable access to local land, and by increasing social capital (eg maintenance of traditions) and human capital (eg health). In contrast, we also found high degrees of food security in landscapes with adequate infrastructure, market access, and financial capital, but this increased security came at the expense of biodiversity. Our findings demonstrate that a social-ecological systems perspective can help to identify previously unrecognized synergies between food security and biodiversity conservation.

Defining the research agenda to measure and reduce tuberculosis stigmas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Article						discrimination; human rights; social justice; respect; equity	TB-RELATED STIGMA; MENTAL-ILLNESS; CARE-SEEKING; SOUTH-AFRICA; HIV STIGMA; DIRTY WORK; HEALTH; COMMUNITY; INTERVENTIONS; VULNERABILITY	Crucial to finding and treating the 4 million tuberculosis (TB) patients currently missed by national TB programmes, TB stigma is receiving well-deserved and long-delayed attention at the global level. However, the ability to measure and evaluate the success of TB stigma-reduction efforts is limited by the need for additional tools. At a 2016 TB stigma-measurement meeting held in The Hague, The Netherlands, stigma experts discussed and proposed a research agenda around four themes: 1) drivers: what are the main drivers and domains of TB stigma(s)?; 2) consequences: how consequential are TB stigmas and how are negative impacts most felt?; 3) burden: what is the global prevalence and distribution of TB stigma(s) and what explains any variation? 4): intervention: what can be done to reduce the extent and impact of TB stigma(s)? Each theme was further subdivided into research topics to be addressed to move the agenda forward. These include greater clarity on what causes TB stigmas to emerge and thrive, the difficulty of measuring the complexity of stigma, and the improbability of a universal stigma 'cure'. Nevertheless, these challenges should not hinder investments in the measurement and reduction of TB stigma. We believe it is time to focus on how, and not whether, the global community should measure and reduce TB stigma.	[Macintyre, K.] Oxford Hlth Evaluat, Oxford, England; [Bakker, M.

This article addresses the social justice issues associated with climate change and human health and discussion of climate justice. Organizing ConstructDiscussion paper. MethodsA literature search of electronic databases was conducted for articles, texts, and documents related to climate change, climate justice, and human health. FindingsThe literature suggests that those who contribute least to global warming are those who will disproportionately be affected by the negative health outcomes of climate change. The concept of climate justice and the role of the Mary Robinson FoundationClimate Justice are discussed within a framework of nursing's professional responsibility and the importance of social justice for the world's people. The nursing profession must take a leadership role in engaging in policy and advocacy discussions in addressing the looming problems associated with climate change. ConclusionsNursing organizations have adopted resolutions and engaged in leadership roles to address climate change at the local, regional, national, and global level. It is essential that nurses embrace concepts related to social justice and engage in the policy debate regarding the deleterious effects on human health related to global warming and climate change. Nursing's commitment to social justice offers an opportunity to offer significant global leadership in addressing the health implications related to climate change. Clinical RelevanceRecognizing the negative impacts of climate change on well-being and the underlying socioeconomic reasons for their disproportionate and inequitable distribution can expand and optimize the profession's role in education, practice, research, and policy-making efforts to address climate change.

Routine viral load monitoring represents the gold standard for assessing treatment response at the individual and programme levels; at the population-level, community viral load is a metric of HIV programme effectiveness and can identify hotspots of HIV transmission. Nevertheless, there are specific implementation and ethical challenges to effectively operationalize and meaningfully interpret viral load data at the community level among these often marginalized populations. DiscussionViral load monitoring enhances HIV treatment, and programme evaluation, and offers a better understanding of HIV surveillance and epidemic trends. Programmatically, viral load monitoring can provide data related to HIV service delivery coverage and quality, as well as inequities in treatment access and uptake. From a population perspective, community viral load data provides information on HIV transmission risk. Furthermore, viral load data can be used as an advocacy tool to demonstrate differences in service delivery and to promote allocation of resources to disproportionately affected key populations and communities with suboptimal health outcomes. However, in order to perform viral load monitoring for individual and programme benefit, health surveillance and advocacy purposes, careful consideration must be given to how such key population programmes are designed and implemented. For example, HIV risk factors, such as particular sex practices, sex work and drug use, are stigmatized or even criminalized in many contexts. Consequently, efforts must be taken so that routine viral load monitoring among marginalized populations does not cause inadvertent harm. Furthermore, given the challenges of reaching representative samples of key populations, significant attention to meaningful recruitment, decentralization of care and interpretation of results is needed. Finally, improving the interoperability of health systems through judicious use of biometrics or identifiers when confidentiality can be maintained is important to generate more valuable data to inform monitoring programmes. ConclusionsOpportunities for expanded viral load monitoring could and should benefit all those affected by HIV, including key populations. The promise of the increasing routinization of viral load monitoring as a tool to advance HIV treatment equity is great and should be prioritized and appropriately implemented within key population programmatic and research agendas.

J	White, JT; Bunn, C				White, James T.; Bunn, Christopher			Growing in Glasgow: Innovative practices and emerging policy pathways for urban agriculture	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Urban agriculture; Community gardening; Local food; Legislation; Scotland	COMMUNITY; PARTICIPATION; RISE	Driven by shared concerns about climate change, social justice and health and wellbeing, Urban Agriculture (UA) is an emergent global movement. In this paper, we present an exploratory case study of UA practice on the Southside of Glasgow, UK that traced the emergence and development of four UA projects. Data from the four projects revealed a diversity of practices, including temporary gardening projects organised by local volunteers, a community and market garden operated by a charity, a food shop and vegetable distribution service run by a social enterprise, and a permanent growing space for charities and schools provided by local government. UA practitioners in Glasgow have sought to re-purpose vacant and derelict land, build social cohesion, contribute to environmental and food sustainability and provide participation space for marginalised groups. Reflecting on future avenues for research on UA in Glasgow, we have identified two broad policy pathways that are emerging both at the local level and through national legislation in Scotland to harness local urban food growing and support UA. We conclude by pointing to a need to preserve the self-organising spirit of UA in Scotland as new legislation comes into force.

WHO and countries are setting ambitious goals for reducing the burden and eliminating malaria through the "Global Technical Strategy" and 21 countries are aiming to eliminate malaria by 2020. The commitment to achieve these targets should be celebrated. However, the need for innovation to achieve these goals, sustain elimination, and free the world of malaria is greater than ever. Over 180 experts across multiple disciplines are engaged in the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) Refresh process to address problems that need to be solved. The result is a research and development agenda to accelerate malaria elimination and, in the longer term, transform the malaria community's ability to eradicate it globally.

We assessed the association of educational and occupational levels with CKD in a multi-ethnic population. Furthermore, we assessed to what extent ethnic inequalities in the prevalence of CKD were accounted for by educational and occupational levels. Methods Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) study of 21,433 adults (4,525 Dutch, 3,027 South-Asian Surinamese, 4,105 African Surinamese, 2,314 Ghanaians, 3,579 Turks, and 3,883 Moroccans) aged 18 to 70 years living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Three CKD outcomes were considered using the 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) severity of CKD classification. Comparisons between educational and occupational levels were made using logistic regression analyses. Results After adjustment for sex and age, low-level and middle-level education were significantly associated with higher odds of high to very high-risk of CKD in Dutch (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.10, 95% C.I., 1.37-2.95; OR 1.55, 95% C.I., 1.03-2.34). Among ethnic minority groups, low-level education was significantly associated with higher odds of high to very-high-risk CKD but only in South -Asian Surinamese (OR 1.58, 95% C.I., 1.06-2.34). Similar results were found for the occupational level in relation to CKD risk. Conclusion The lower educational and occupational levels of ethnic minority groups partly accounted for the observed ethnic inequalities in CKD. Reducing CKD risk in ethnic minority populations with low educational and occupational levels may help to reduce ethnic inequalities in CKD and its related complications.

A systematic review of allostatic load in relation to socioeconomic position: Poor fidelity and major inconsistencies in biomarkers employed	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Review						Allostatic load; Chronic stress; Biomarkers; Socioeconomic position	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; CUMULATIVE BIOLOGICAL RISK; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; NATIONAL SAMPLE; SOCIAL GRADIENT; HEALTH; LIFE; INEQUALITIES; CHILDHOOD; DISADVANTAGE	Background: The association between disease and socioeconomic position (SEP) is well established. Allostatic load (AL), or physiological 'wear and tear', is a concept that aims to elucidate the biological consequences of stress that may underlie these associations. The primary objective of this paper is to review the biomarkers and methods used to operationalise the concept of AL in studies analysing the association between AL and SEP. Methods: Four databases (Embase, Global Health, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO) were searched using terms related to AL, biomarkers and SEP. Data extraction focused on the methods used to calculate AL indices. The frequency of pair-wise combinations of biomarkers were used to assess the level of overlap in AL definition between studies. Results: Twenty-six studies analysing the association between AL and SEP were included. There was no consistent method of operationalizing AL across studies. Individual biomarkers and biological systems included in the AL index differed widely across studies, as did the method of calculating the AL index. All studies included at least one cardiovascular-and metabolic-related biomarker in AL indices, while only half of studies included at least one hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis biomarker and approximately one third an immune response-related biomarker. All but three studies found evidence of an association between lower SEP and higher AL. Conclusions: Many studies lacked fidelity to the original concept of AL in which stress was considered central. The considerable variation in biomarkers used makes studies in this review difficult to compare. A more critical approach should be taken in the calculation of AL indices in particular to how far it captures the biological effects of psychosocial stress that may underlie socioeconomic differences in health.

Estimating the full public health value of vaccination	VACCINE			English	Article						Full public health value; Global health; Health policy; Immunization programs; Public health; Vaccination	RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS THRESHOLDS; PENTAVALENT ROTAVIRUS VACCINE; PREVENTABLE DISEASE INCIDENCE; CONJUGATE VACCINE; OLDER CHILDREN; PREGNANT-WOMEN; DOUBLE-BLIND; EFFICACY; INFANTS	There is an enhanced focus on considering the full public health value (FPHV) of vaccination when setting priorities, making regulatory decisions and establishing implementation policy for public health activities. Historically, a therapeutic paradigm has been applied to the evaluation of prophylactic vaccines and focuses on an individual benefit-risk assessment in prospective and individually-randomized phase III trials to assess safety and efficacy against etiologically-confirmed clinical outcomes. By contrast, a public health paradigm considers the population impact and encompasses measures of community benefits against a range of outcomes. For example, measurement of the FPHV of vaccination may incorporate health inequity, social and political disruption, disruption of household integrity, school absenteeism and work loss, health care utilization, long-term/on-going disability, the development of antibiotic resistance, and a range of non-etiologically and etiologically defined clinical outcomes. Following an initial conference at the Fondation Merieux in mid-2015, a second conference (December 2016) was held to further describe the efficacy of using the FPHV of vaccination on a variety of prophylactic vaccines. The wider scope of vaccine benefits, improvement in risk assessment, and the need for partnership and coalition building across interventions has also been discussed during the 2014 and 2016 Global Vaccine and Immunization Research Forums and the 2016 Geneva Health Forum, as well as in numerous publications including a special issue of Health Affairs in February 2016. The December 2016 expert panel concluded that while progress has been made, additional efforts will be necessary to have a more fully formulated assessment of the FPHV of vaccines included into the evidence-base for the value proposition and analysis of unmet medical need to prioritize vaccine development, vaccine licensure, implementation policies and financing decisions. The desired outcomes of these efforts to establish an alternative framework for vaccine evaluation are a more robust vaccine pipeline, improved appreciation of vaccine value and hence of its relative affordability, and greater public access and acceptance of vaccines.

J	Savage, V; Castro, A				Savage, Virginia; Castro, Arachu			Measuring mistreatment of women during childbirth: a review of terminology and methodological approaches	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Review						Mistreatment; Violence; Obstetric violence; Gender-based violence; Disrespect and abuse; Dehumanization of care; Maternal health care; Medicalization; Measurement; Latin America and the Caribbean	HEALTH-CARE; ABUSE; DISRESPECT; VIOLENCE; QUALITY; FACILITIES; TANZANIA; DELIVERY	Background: Although mistreatment of women during facility-based childbirth has received increasing recognition as a critical issue throughout the world, there remains a lack of consensus on operational definitions of mistreatment and best practices to assess the issue. Moreover, only minimal research has focused on mistreatment in Latin America and the Caribbean, a region notable for social inequalities and inequitable access to maternal health care. Methods: In this article, we discuss the results of a literature review that sought to contribute to the determination of best practices in defining and measuring the mistreatment of women during childbirth, particularly within Latin America and the Caribbean. The review includes a total of 57 English, Spanish, and Portuguese-language research publications and eight legal documents that were published between 2000 and 2017. Results: While the typologies of "disrespect and abuse" and "mistreatment during facility-based childbirth" are most frequently employed in global studies, "obstetric violence" remains the most commonly operationalized term in Latin America and the Caribbean in both research and policy contexts. Various researchers have advocated for the use of those three different typologies, yet the terms all share commonalities in highlighting the medicalization of natural processes of childbirth, roots in gender inequalities, parallels with violence against women, the potential for harm, and the threat to women's rights. For measuring mistreatment, half of the research publications in this review use qualitative methods, such as in-depth interviews and focus groups. After analyzing the strengths and limitations of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches to assessing mistreatment, we recommend mixed methods designs as the optimal strategy to evaluate mistreatment and advocate for the inclusion of direct observations that may help bridge the gap between observed measures and participants' self-reported experiences of mistreatment. Conclusions: No matter the conceptual framework used in future investigations, we recommend that studies seek to accomplish three objectives: (1) to measure the perceived and observed frequencies of mistreatment in maternal health settings, (2) to examine the macro and micro level factors that drive mistreatment, and ( 3) to assess the impact of mistreatment on the health outcomes of women and their newborns.

Tuberculosis, human rights and ethics considerations along the route of a highly vulnerable migrant from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Article						communicable disease; global health justice; migration; stigma; discrimination	LOW-INCIDENCE COUNTRIES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; IMMIGRATION; CARE; STIGMA; IMPACT	Migrant health is a critical public health issue, and in many countries attention to this topic has focused on the link between migration and communicable diseases, including tuberculosis (TB). When creating public health policies to address the complex challenges posed by TB and migration, countries should focus these policies on evidence, ethics, and human rights. This paper traces a commonly used migration route from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe, identifying situations at each stage in which human rights and ethical values might be affected in relation to TB care. This illustration provides the basis for discussing TB and migration from the perspective of human rights, with a focus on the right to health. We then highlight three strands of discussion in the ethics and justice literature in an effort to develop more comprehensive ethics of migrant health. These strands include theories of global justice and global health ethics, the creation of 'firewalls' to separate enforcement of immigration law from protection of human rights, and the importance of non-stigmatization to health justice. The paper closes by reflecting briefly on how TB programs can better incorporate human rights and ethical principles and values into public health practice.

Institutional partnerships are the cornerstone of sustainable education, research, clinical service, and advocacy for GCH. When successful, partnerships can become self-sustaining and support development of much-needed training programs in resource-constrained settings. Conversely, poorly conceptualized, constructed, or maintained partnerships may inadvertently contribute to the deterioration of health systems. In this comprehensive, literature-based, expert consensus review we present a definition of partnerships for GCH, review their genesis, evolution, and scope, describe participating organizations, and highlight benefits and challenges associated with GCH partnerships. Additionally, we suggest a framework for applying sound ethical and public health principles for GCH that includes 7 guiding principles and 4 core practices along with a structure for evaluating GCH partnerships. Finally, we highlight current knowledge gaps to stimulate further work in these areas. With awareness of the potential benefits and challenges of GCH partnerships, as well as shared dedication to guiding principles and core practices, GCH partnerships hold vast potential to positively impact child health.

J	Mumtaz, S; Bahk, J; Khang, YH				Mumtaz, Sarwat; Bahk, Jinwook; Khang, Young-Ho			Rising trends and inequalities in cesarean section rates in Pakistan: Evidence from Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys, 1990-2013	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; MATERNITY CARE; DELIVERY; BIRTH; DEMAND; ASIA	Despite global efforts to improve maternal health, many developing countries including Pakistan have failed to achieve the target of a 75% reduction in maternal deaths by 2015. Addressing socioeconomic inequalities in access to emergency obstetric care is crucial for reducing the maternal mortality rate. This study was done to examine the time trends and socioeconomic inequalities in the utilization of cesarean section (C-section) in Pakistan during 1990 -2013.We used data from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys (PDHS) conducted during 1990 to 2013. All these surveys are nationally representative surveys of ever-married women aged 15-49 years with a sample size of 6611, 10,023, and 13,558 women in 1990-1991, 2006-2007, and 2012-2013, respectively, with an overall response rate of over 90%. The unit of analysis for this study was women with their most recent live birth in the five years preceding the surveys. Bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression models were employed to investigate the prevalence of cesarean sections according to selected sociodemographic characteristics of women. C-section rates were found to have increased during this period, with an especially significant rise from 2.7% in 1990-1991 to 15.8% in 2012-2013 with lower utilization among the non-educated women (7.5%), compared with the women with higher education (40.3%). C-section rates ranged from 5.5% in the poorest women to 35.3% in the richest women. Only 11.5% of the rural women had a C-section compared to 25.6% of the urban women. A greater likelihood of having a cesarean section was observed in the richest, highly educated, and urban-living women while there was no significant difference observed in cesarean section rates between the private and public sectors in all three surveys. To improve maternal health, routine monitoring and evaluation of the provision of emergency obstetric services are needed to address the underuse of C-section in poor and rural areas and overuse in rich and urban areas.

Whilst most of these consortia promise to transform the way international health research is done in Africa, few have articulated exactly how they propose to go about this. In this paper, we report on a qualitative interviewing study in which we involved 17 genomics researchers in Africa. We describe their perceptions and expectations of international genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa. Results All interviewees were of the view that externally funded genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa, have played a critical role in building capacity for genomics research and biobanking in Africa and in providing an opportunity for researchers in Africa to collaborate and network with other researchers. Whilst the opportunity to collaborate was seen as a benefit, some interviewees stressed the importance of recognizing that these collaborations carry mutual benefits for all partners, including their collaborators in HICs. They also voiced two major concerns of being part of these collaborative initiatives: the possibility of exploitation of African researchers and the non-sustainability of research capacity building efforts. As a way of minimising exploitation, researchers in Africa recommended that genuine efforts be made to create transparent and equitable international health research partnerships. They suggested that this could be achieved through,: having rules of engagement, enabling African researchers to contribute to the design and conduct of international health projects in Africa, and mutual and respectful exchange of experience and capacity between research collaborators. These were identified as hallmarks to equitable international health research collaborations in Africa. Conclusion Genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa such as H3Africa have gone some way in defining aspects of fair and equitable research collaborations in Africa. However, they will need to strive at achieving equitable health research collaborations if they truly aim at setting a gold standard for how international health research should be conducted in Africa.

Beyond the huge health consequence of malaria, policymakers need to be informed about the economic burden of the disease to the households. However, evidence on the economic burden of malaria in Ethiopia is scanty. The aims of this study were to estimate the economic burden of malaria episode and to identify predictors of cost variability to the rural households. Methods A prospective costing approach from a household perspective was employed. A total of 190 malaria patients were enrolled to the study from three health centers and nine health posts in Adami Tullu district in south-central Ethiopia, in 2015. Primary data were collected on expenditures due to malaria, forgone working days because of illness, socioeconomic and demographic situation, and households' assets. Quantile regression was applied to predict factors associated with the cost variation. Socioeconomic related inequality was measured using concentration index and concentration curve. Results The median cost of malaria per episode to the household was USD 5.06 (IQR: 2.98-8.10). The direct cost accounted for 39%, while the indirect counterpart accounted for 61%. The history of malaria in the last six months and the level of the facility visited in the health system predominantly influenced the direct cost. The indirect cost was mainly influenced by the availability of antimalarial drugs in the health facility. The concentration curve and the concentration index for direct cost indicate significant pro-rich inequality. Plasmodium falciparum is significantly more costly for households compared to Plasmodium vivax. Conclusion The economic burden of malaria to the rural households in Ethiopia was substantial-mainly to the poor-indicating that reducing malaria burden could contribute to the poverty reduction as well.

J	Henz, GP; Porpino, G				Henz, Gilmar Paulo; Porpino, Gustavo			Food losses and waste: how Brazil is facing this global challenge?	HORTICULTURA BRASILEIRA			English	Article						food security; national policies; legal framework; wastage; food waste		By 2017, Brazil seems to have finally awakened to the problem of food loss and waste. In this article, we resume the topic started in the article "Postharvest losses of perishables in Brazil: what do we know so far?" published earlier this year, but now with an emphasis on food losses and waste (FLW). We divided this article into four sections: (a) search for scientific publications on postharvest losses (PHL) and food waste (FW) in Portuguese; (b) social classes and food consumption in Brazil and household food waste; (c) the national legal framework on FLW; and (d) current food security policies and civil society actions on FLW. Google Scholar searches yielded 46,100 records for FW and 16,100 for PHL, but only 37 and 19 records, respectively, when the searches were restricted to the title of the papers. There is a clear division of subjects: PHL is more related to Agriculture and Economy and FW to Health, Nutrition and the Environment, and reasons and consequences are discussed. Food consumption and waste in Brazil must take into account the great social heterogeneity and high income inequality, as well as some unexpected driving cultural reasons. About 30 bills related to food waste have been discussed in the Brazilian Congress since 1997, with a low expectation of approval in the short term. In the absence of a regulatory framework to reduce losses and facilitate the donation of food, society has found its own way of dealing with the problem. Some initiatives are presented here, along with some governmental food security policies which had positive impacts in reducing FLW, such as National School Feeding Program (PNAE), food banks and popular restaurants. Some international movements are also beginning to gain strength in Brazil, e.g., the purchase of fruits and vegetables outside of aesthetic standards, "SaveFood Brasil", "Slow Food", among others. These are all put in perspective.

Where there is no policy: governing the posting and transfer of primary health care workers in Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						human resources for health; governance; primary health care; community health committees; Nigeria		The posting and transfer of health workers and managers receives little policy and research attention in global health. In Nigeria, there is no national policy on posting and transfer in the health sector. We sought to examine how the posting and transfer of frontline primary health care (PHC) workers is conducted in four states (Lagos, Benue, Nasarawa and Kaduna) across Nigeria, where public sector PHC facilities are usually the only form of formal health care service providers available in many communities. We conducted in-depth interviews with PHC workers and managers, and group discussions with community health committee members. The results revealed three mechanisms by which PHC managers conduct posting and transfer: (1) periodically moving PHC workers around as a routine exercise aimed at enhancing their professional experience and preventing them from being corrupted; (2) as a tool for improving health service delivery by assigning high-performing PHC workers to PHC facilities perceived to be in need, or posting PHC workers nearer their place of residence; and (3) as a response to requests for punishment or favour from PHC workers, political office holders, global health agencies and community health committees. Given that posting and transfer is conducted by discretion, with multiple influences and sometimes competing interests, we identified practices that may lead to unfair treatment and inequities in the distribution of PHC workers. The posting and transfer of PHC workers therefore requires policy measures to codify what is right about existing informal practices and to avert their negative potential.

Methods: Data were collected as part of the Global Early Adolescent Study. The current research analyzed data from interviews with 30 EAs (aged 11-13 years) living in five poor urban sites: Baltimore, Cuenca, Edinburgh, Ghent, and Nairobi. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed in English using Atlas.ti, focusing on how EAs experience and perceive gender norms in romantic relationships. Results: Across the five sites, only a few respondents described having been in love, the majority of whom were boys. Findings indicate that stereotypical gender norms about romantic relationships prevail across these cultural settings, depicting boys as romantically/sexually active and dominant, and girls as innocent with less (romantic) agency. In spite of the similarities, Nairobi was unique in that respondents referred to how sexual behavior and violence can occur within EA relationships. In all countries, heterosexuality was perceived to be the norm. Nevertheless, there were examples of EAs accepting homosexuality and expressing supportive attitudes toward equality between the sexes. Conclusions: While EAs across five different cultural settings seem to endorse stereotypical gender norms in romantic relationships, a few stories also illustrate more gender-equal attitudes. As stereotypical gender norms have a demonstrated negative effect on adolescent sexual and reproductive health and well-being, additional research is needed to understand which factors-at the interpersonal and structural level-contribute to the construction of these norms among EAs.

Neighborhood-level inequalities create barriers to care and treatment for many vulnerable populations. We seek to characterize citywide trends in HCV mortality rates over time and identify and describe neighborhoods in New York City (NYC) with disproportionately high rates and associated factors. We used a multiple cause of death (MCOD) definition for HCV mortality. Cases identified between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014, were geocoded to NYC census tracts (CT). We calculated age-adjusted HCV mortality rates and identified spatial clustering using a local Moran's I test. Temporal trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression. A multistep global and local Poisson modeling approach was used to test for neighborhood associations with sociodemographic indicators. During the study period, 3697 HCV-related deaths occurred in NYC, with an average annual percent increase of 2.6% (p = 0.02). The HCV mortality rates ranged from 0 to 373.6 per 100,000 by CT, and cluster analysis identified significant clustering of HCV mortality (I = 0.23). Regression identified positive associations between HCV mortality and the proportion of non-Hispanic black or Hispanic residents, neighborhood poverty, education, and non-English-speaking households. Local regression estimates identified spatially varying patterns in these associations. The rates of HCV mortality in NYC are increasing and vary by neighborhood. HCV mortality is associated with many indicators of geographic inequality. Results identified neighborhoods in greatest need for place-based interventions to address social determinants that may perpetuate inequalities in HCV mortality.

Systematic global analysis of early antenatal care visits has not been done previously. This study reports on regional and global estimates of the coverage of early antenatal care visits from 1990 to 2013. Methods Data were obtained from nationally representative surveys and national health information systems. Estimates of coverage of early antenatal care visits were generated with linear regression analysis and based on 516 logit-transformed observations from 132 countries. The model accounted for differences by data sources in reporting the cutoff for the early antenatal care visit. Findings The estimated worldwide coverage of early antenatal care visits increased from 40.9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 34.6-46.7) in 1990 to 58.6% (52.1-64.3) in 2013, corresponding to a 43.3% increase. Overall coverage in the developing regions was 48.1% (95% UI 43.4-52.4) in 2013 compared with 84.8% (81.6-87.7) in the developed regions. In 2013, the estimated coverage of early antenatal care visits was 24.0% (95% UI 21.7-26.5) in low-income countries compared with 81.9% (76.5-87.1) in high-income countries. Interpretation Progress in the coverage of early antenatal care visits has been achieved but coverage is still far from universal. Substantial inequity exists in coverage both within regions and between income groups. The absence of data in many countries is of concern and efforts should be made to collect and report coverage of early antenatal care visits to enable better monitoring and evaluation.

METHODS: We carried out a spatial aggregated study in 2007, considering the weighting areas (census tracts contiguous sets) of Salvador, of which the center and north present low life conditions. Data were obtained from national vital statistics systems and the 2010 Census. Addresses of live births and stillbirths were geocoded by weighting area. The spatial distribution of the perinatal mortality rate was analyzed from thematic maps. Spatial dependence was evaluated by the Global and Local Geary's and Moran's Indexes. RESULTS: Crude and smoothed perinatal mortality rates were high in areas situated to the north, west, and in center of Salvador. The smoothed rates in weighting areas ranged from 4.9/1,000 to 22.3/1,000 births. Of all perinatal deaths, 92.1% could have been prevented. We identified spatial dependence for preventable perinatal mortality for care in pregnancy, with neighboring areas with high risk in the north of the city. CONCLUSIONS: The preventability potential of perinatal mortality was high in Salvador, in 2007. The spatial distribution pattern with higher rates in disadvantaged areas of the city suggests the existence of social inequalities in health. The characteristics of the process of urban development of Salvador, which has inadequate prenatal care, possibly influenced the magnitude and spatial distribution pattern of this mortality.

The divide between profit generation and improvements in local well-being could be especially vivid when international commercial clinical trials are conducted in new, non-traditional locations outside of North America and Western Europe. This article focuses on how this divide is managed in the everyday work of conducting trials in a research centre in Russia. It explores how investigators and research participants engage in the work of translating trials into academic capacity- building, development of local medical expertise and provision of public health benefits. That is, research value is being multiply configured in clinical, scientific and economic domains. We view the conduct of clinical trials as a boundary process which, through enabling multiplication of value, bridges the realms of health and wealth. This reading of the process of conducting trials opens up opportunities to think about ways to maximise the value of medical experimentation and to (re) link clinical research and public good.

Design: Cross-sectional analysis from the World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health, collected between 2007 and 2010. Setting: Six middle-income countries: China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. Participants: Nationally representative sample of adults aged 50 years and older. Main outcome measures: We present achievement against key indicators of health system performance across effectiveness, cost, access, patient-centredness and equity domains. Results: We found areas of poor performance in prevention and management of chronic conditions, such as hypertension control and cancer screening coverage. We also found that cost remains a barrier to healthcare access in spite of insurance schemes. Finally, we found evidence of disparities across many indicators, particularly in the effectiveness and patient centredness domains. Conclusions: These findings identify important focus areas for action and shared learning as these countries move towards achieving universal health coverage.

(Hans)			How multi-lane, one-way street design shapes neighbourhood life: collisions, crime and community	LOCAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Street design; two-way; community development; health and safety; traffic calming	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; URBAN; DISPARITIES; BEHAVIOR; SAFETY; HEALTH; POLICY; TRAVEL	Global recognition of the need for more liveable and "complete" streets has allowed for increased funding to bicycle and pedestrian projects. That said, many streets in urban neighbourhoods remain unsafe. This study hypothesises that some of these issues related to safety issues are tied to multi-lane, one-way streets, which exist primarily in urban business districts and historic neighbourhoods, often occupied by poor and minority residents. There has been little research in this area to test how one-way street configurations relate to collisions, crime and community. To examine this, we use three principal strategies: (1) a cross-sectional citywide evaluation using descriptive and inferential statistics on all collisions occurring within a five-year period in a midsized city; (2) a focused assessment of traffic collision data, crime data, counts of trees, housing valuation data, foreclosure and vacant and abandoned structures on a 13-block street segment with both one-and two-way streets and (3) a qualitative broken windows assessment, using photography to evaluate signs of visual distress on one-way versus twoway segments. Our results show a higher incidence of collisions and injuries on multi-lane streets than on their two-way counterparts - for motorists, bikes and pedestrians. Our photographic assessment suggests that these street typologies contribute to degradation and erosion of community. Our results show that neighbourhoods with one-way multi-lane streets experience greater abandonment, lower housing values and slower increases in property values. This research supports expanded thinking about one-to two-way street conversion as a method to improve safety, connectivity, community and sustainability.

Trends in Visual Health Inequalities in Childhood Through Associations of Visual Function With Sex and Social Position Across 3 UK Birth Cohorts	JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							BLINDNESS; VISION; IMPAIRMENT; EYE; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN; AGE; EDUCATION; GLAUCOMA	IMPORTANCE Despite the existing country-specific strategies tackling social inequalities in visual health in adults, little is known about trends in visual function in childhood and its association with social position. OBJECTIVE To investigate the distribution of childhood visual function in the United Kingdom and associations with early-life social position between 1961 and 1986, a period of significant social change. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Longitudinal cohort study using harmonized data sets from the British 1946, 1958, and 1970 national birth cohorts. In total, 14 283 cohort members with complete data on visual acuity at age 15 or 16 years, measured in 1961, 1974, and 1986, respectively, for each cohort, and social position were assessed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Using habitual distance visual acuity (with correction if prescribed), participants were assigned to a visual function category ranging from bilateral normal to visual impairment/severe visual impairment/blindness (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification). Distribution of visual function over time and associations with social position (risk ratios [RRs] and 95% confidence intervals) were analyzed. RESULTS Complete data were available for 3152 participants (aged 15 years; 53% boys [n = 1660]) in the 1946 Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, 6683 participants (aged 16 years; 51% boys [n = 3420]) in the 1958 National Child Development Study, and 4448 participants (aged 16 years; 48% boys [n = 2156]) in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study. The proportion of children with bilateral normal vision decreased by 1.3%(95% CI, -5.1% to 2.7%) in 1974 and 1.7%(95% CI, -5.9% to 2.7%) in 1986. The risk of overall impaired vision increased by 1.20 times (95% CI, 1.01-1.43) and the risk of visual impairment/severe visual impairment/blindness by 1.75 times (95% CI, 1.03-2.98) during this period. Girls were consistently at increased risk of all vision impairment categories. Higher social position at birth and in childhood was associated with reduced risk of visual impairment/severe visual impairment/blindness (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.20-1.68) and unilateral impairment (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.11), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our study provides evidence of temporal decline in childhood visual function between 1961 and 1986. Despite the limited power of the analysis owing to the small sample size of those with impaired vision, we found an emergence of a contribution of sociodemographic status to the cohort effect that may be the antecedent of the current picture of childhood blindness. Equally, early-life social position may also have contributed to the current social patterning in visual function in older adults in the United Kingdom. These findings highlight the potential value of targeting children in national ophthalmic public policies tackling inequalities.

In this context, research regarding their health and well-being has overemphasised physical illnesses with limited exploration of a diverse range of dimensions and determinants, particularly those based on Indigenous holistic understandings of health and well-being. This deficit-based approach has thus missed many strengths and assets of Indigenous children. This research aimed to gain insight into the perspectives of Indigenous children about their health and well-being in an urban setting in Australia. It joins a limited international literature examining views and experiences of non-majority children.Design: Participatory and qualitative child-friendly research methods were utilised. The project was developed in partnership with Indigenous community organisations and members. Photo-elicitation activities and focus groups were conducted with 31 Indigenous children aged 8-12 years. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, combining focus group and interview data.Results: It was evident an urban Indigenous child perspective of health and well-being includes rich understandings of the interconnectedness of physical, social-emotional and cultural dimensions of holism, as well as the integral importance of family and community relationships. The study also found that specific worries regarding loss of loved ones and racism were highly salient in Indigenous children's lives.Conclusion: The overwhelming conclusion to be drawn from this research is that Indigenous children in urban areas need ongoing recognition of both their agency and resilience in the face of adversity, within a wider context of historical and contemporary racialisation and racism.

Given that Brexit cannot be undone without a second referendum, it opens up opportunities to elude European constraints for reform along the lines of equity, employment rights and patient choice. Brexit deepens the financial crisis of the National Health Service (NHS) by increasing hiring costs and imposing new transaction costs to accommodate patient cross-border mobility and international public health needs. Given the weak sustainability of the NHS, it could lead to major system reform.

Universal "social" media is defining features of modern professional life that provide powerful modes of knowledge acquisition/sharing to that end. Altmetric and other measurements stratify academic communications according to this alternate, online media presence (not academic penetrance). Are they meaningless, self-absorbed integers, or reliable yardsticks of scientific and educational prowess? Far beyond this trite, patronizing question from the minds of outdated, terrified technophobes, the real impact of "social" media is not narcissistic solipsism. Instant dissemination of contemporary surgical controversies on a truly global level drives improved (or at least reflective) health care for all. While a numerical assignment of value according to views, "likes," impressions, or "retweets" may seem meaningless to cynical, established academics, the impetus for universal improvement is self-evident. Electronic data and opinion sharing may not balance the inequity between low- and high-income countries, but it keeps it in perspective. The best way to shift desert sands is to blow on them constantly.

J	Mulenga, A; Ataguba, JEO				Mulenga, Arnold; Ataguba, John Ele-Ojo			Assessing income redistributive effect of health financing in Zambia	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Zambia; Redistributive effect; Health financing; Vertical effect; Horizontal effect; Reranking	GINI INDEXES; CARE FINANCE; SOUTH-AFRICA; DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS; UNIVERSAL COVERAGE; RERANKING; INEQUALITY; EQUITY; PROGRESSIVITY; COUNTRIES	Ensuring an equitable health financing system is a major concern particularly in many developing countries. Internationally, there is a strong debate to move away from excessive reliance on direct out-of-pocket (OOP) spending towards a system that incorporates a greater element of risk pooling and thus affords greater protection for the poor. This is a major focus of the move towards universal health coverage (UHC). Currently, Zambia with high levels of poverty and income inequality is implementing health sector reforms for UHC through a social health insurance scheme. However, the way to identify the health financing mechanisms that are best suited to achieving this goal is to conduct empirical analysis and consider international evidence on funding universal health systems. This study assesses, for the first time, the progressivity of health financing and how it impacts on income inequality in Zambia. Three broad health financing mechanisms (general tax, a health levy and OOP spending) were considered. Data come from the 2010 nationally representative Zambian Living Conditions and Monitoring Survey with a sample size of 19,397 households. Applying standard methodologies, the findings show that total health financing in Zambia is progressive. It also leads to a statistically significant reduction in income inequality (i.e. a pro -poor redistributive effect estimated at 0.0110 (p < 0.01)). Similar significant pro-poor redistribution was reported for general taxes (0.0101 (p < 0.01)) and a health levy (0.0002 (p < 0.01)). However, the redistributive effect was not significant for OOP spending (0.0006). These results further imply that health financing redistributes income from the rich to the poor with a greater potential via general taxes. This points to areas where government policy may focus in attempting to reduce the high level of income, inequality and" to improve equity in health financing towards UHC in Zambia.

J	Molla, AA; Chi, CH				Molla, Azaher Ali; Chi, Chunhuei			Who pays for healthcare in Bangladesh? An analysis of progressivity in health systems financing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Progressivity; Ability-to-pay; Household healthcare expenditure; Health equity; Out-of-pocket payments	OF-POCKET PAYMENTS; INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; EQUITY	Background: The relationship between payments towards healthcare and ability to pay is a measure of financial fairness. Analysis of progressivity is important from an equity perspective as well as for macroeconomic and political analysis of healthcare systems. Bangladesh health systems financing is characterized by high out-of-pocket payments (63.3%), which is increasing. Hence, we aimed to see who pays what part of this high out-of-pocket expenditure. To our knowledge, this was the first progressivity analysis of health systems financing in Bangladesh. Methods: We used data from Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2010. This was a cross sectional and nationally representative sample of 12,240 households consisting of 55,580 individuals. For quantification of progressivity, we adopted the 'ability-to-pay' principle developed by O'Donnell, van Doorslaer, Wagstaff, and Lindelow (2008). We used the Kakwani index to measure the magnitude of progressivity. Results: Health systems financing in Bangladesh is regressive. Inequality increases due to healthcare payments. The differences between the Gini coefficient and the Kakwani index for all sources of finance are negative, which indicates regressivity, and that financing is more concentrated among the poor. Income inequality increases due to high out-of-pocket payments. The increase in income inequality caused by out-of-pocket payments is 89% due to negative vertical effect and 11% due to horizontal inequity. Conclusions: Our findings add substantial evidence of health systems financing impact on inequitable financial burden of healthcare and income. The heavy reliance on out-of-pocket payments may affect household living standards. If the government and people of Bangladesh are concerned about equitable financing burden, our study suggests that Bangladesh needs to reform the health systems financing scheme.

The present study analyzed infant mortality trends according to the causes of death and the inequalities in specific causes of infant mortality between different parental social classes. We analyzed 8,209,836 births from the Statistics Korea between 1995 and 2009. The trends of disparity for cause-specific infant mortality according to parental education and employment were examined using the Cox proportional hazard model for the birth-year intervals of 1995-1999, 2000-2004, and 2005-2009. Adjusted hazard ratios were calculated after adjusting for infants' gender, parents' age, maternal obstetrical history, gestational age, and birth weight. An increasing trend in social inequalities in all-cause infant mortality according to paternal education was evident. Social inequalities in infant mortality were greater for "Not classified symptoms, signs and findings" (International Classification of Diseases 10th revision [ICD-10]: R00-R99) and "Injury, poisoning and of external causes" (S00-T98), particularly for "Ill-defined and unspecified causes" (R990) and "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)" (R950); and increased overtime for "Not classified symptoms, signs and findings" (R00-R99), "Injury, poisoning and of external causes" (S00-T98) and "Conditions in perinatal period" (P00P96), particularly for "SIDS" (R950) and "Respiratory distress syndrome of newborns (RDS)" (P220). The specific causes of infant mortality, in particular the "Not classified causes" (R00-R99 coded deaths) should be investigated more thoroughly to reduce inequality in health.

Our aim was to obtain a reliable estimate of the effect of SES on discharge prescription of medications following an ACS through systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Medline, EMBASE and Global Health were searched systematically on 6th April 2016. Studies were eligible if the participants had ACS and reported the rate/odds of guideline-recommended ACS medications prescription (aspirin, antiplatelet, beta blocker, angiotensin co-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and statin) at discharge stratified by SES. A meta-analysis was performed to pool the estimates, comparing the prescription ratio (PR) between the lowest and the highest SES groups. Results: Of 252 articles found from the search, seven met the eligibility criteria and it included 41,462 (20,986 from the lowest SES group) patients. We found that the individual/neighbourhood level SES did not affect the prescription of aspirin (PR (95% CI): 0.97 (0.91, 1.03)), but for beta blocker and statin, the lowest SES group were disadvantaged (0.84 (0.73, 0.94), 0.80 (0.62, 0.98), respectively). In contrast, ACEi were prescribed more often to the lowest individual/neighbourhood level SES group than the highest (1.13 (1.05, 1.22)). Although the risk of bias was low, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies. Conclusions: Despite the recommendations to close the treatment gap, the rate of prescription of guideline-recommended medications in managing ACS is significantly different between patients with the lowest and the highest groups. A solution is needed to provide equitable care across the SES groups.

Autonomy is fundamental to bioethics, but its emphasis on self-determination and individuality hardly supports public health policies to eat and drink less and take more exercise. Autonomy rejects a 'nanny' state. Yet, the cost of non-communicable diseases is increasing to individuals personally and to public health systems generally. Health care systems are under mounting and unsustainable pressure. What is the proper responsibility of individuals, governments and corporate interests working within a global trading environment? When public health care resources are unlikely to increase, we cannot afford to be so diffident to the cost of avoidable diseases.

The leading drivers of death-pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria-are preventable and treatable. However, these illnesses are exacerbated by a lack of accessible nutrition, water, basic and preventive health services, and sanitary living conditions-all factors which are more likely to disproportionately impact the poor. We examine whether Kenya's largest social protection impacts children's incidence of upper respiratory illness. The Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children was designed to support orphans affected by HIV/AIDS and has covered over 240,000 households as of 2014. Using longitudinal, cluster-randomized program data from 2007 to 2009, we run a generalized linear latent and mixed method estimation model on a sample of children 0-7 years and under-5 years of age. We find that the program is associated with a decrease in illness in children 0-7 years of age (P<0.05), but found no effects on a stratified sample of under-5 children. Furthermore, no impacts on health care seeking in the event of illness were detected. This study is one of few examining children's health using data from a large scale unconditional cash transfer program. With the widespread adoption of over 123 cash transfer programs across sub-Saharan Africa, these findings suggest social cash transfer programs are capable of promoting the multidimensional well-being for the world's most vulnerable populations.

Trends and socioeconomic inequalities in amenable mortality in Switzerland with international comparisons	SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY			English	Article						amenable mortality; population health; healthcare; cross-national comparison; socioeconomic inequalities; Switzerland		BACKGROUND: Amenable mortality is a composite measure of deaths from conditions that might be avoided by timely and effective healthcare. It was developed as an indicator to study health care quality. METHODS: We calculated mortality rates for the population aged 0-74 years for the time-period 1996-2010 and the following groups of causes of death: amenable conditions, ischaemic heart diseases (IHD, defined as partly amenable) and remaining conditions. We compared the Swiss results with those published for 16 other high-income countries. To examine the association between amenable mortality and socioeconomic position, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) by using Cox regression. RESULTS: Amenable mortality fell from 49.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.2-51.0) to 35.7 (34.6-36.9) in males and from 55.0 (53.6-56.4) to 43.4 (42.2-44.6) per 100 000 person-years in females, when 1996-1998 was compared with 2008-2010. IHD mortality declined from 64.7 (95% CI 63.1-66.3) to 33.8 (32.8-34.8) in males and from 18.0 (17.2-18.7) to 8.5 (8.0-9.0) in females. However, between 1996-1998 and 2008-2010 the proportion of all-cause mortality attributed to amenable causes remained stable in both sexes (around 12% in males and 26% in females). Compared with 16 other high-income countries, Switzerland had the lowest rates of amenable mortality and ranked among the top five with the lowest ischaemic heart disease mortality. HRs of amenable causes in the lowest socioeconomic position quintile were 1.77 (95% CI 1.66-1.90) for males and 1.78 (1.47-2.16) for females compared with 1.62 (1.58-1.66) and 1.38 (1.33-1.43) for unamenable mortality. For ischaemic heart disease, HRs in the lowest socioeconomic position quintile were 1.76 (95% CI 1.66-1.87) for males and 2.33 (2.07-2.62) for females. CONCLUSIONS: Amenable mortality declined substantially in Switzerland with comparably low death rates for amenable causes. Similar to previous international studies, these Swiss results showed substantial socioeconom-ic inequalities in amenable mortality. Proportions of amenable mortality remained constant over time and patterns of inequalities observed for amenable causes in men did not substantially differ from those observed for nonamenable causes of death. Additional amenable mortality research is needed to better understand the factors contributing to mortality changes and social inequalities including information on disease characteristics and health care supply measures.

Today, China is a major player in the global market of asbestos production and consumption. Therefore, a large number of Chinese workers are employed in the asbestos industries and an even larger number of individuals are exposed to asbestos for non-occupational reasons. Although there is no official data on the numbers of asbestos-related diseases in China, it is estimated that a significant part of the population developed asbestos-related diseases and that there will be an augmentation of those diseases in the future. This article examines the Chinese legal provisions on the prevention, control, and compensation of asbestos related diseases; both in cases of environmental and occupational exposures, and analyzes if and when those provisions are applied. This research shows that although the laws and the regulations enacted by the Chinese government provide protection for those exposed to asbestos dust, and entitle them to some compensation or indemnity where those exposures caused damages, the implementation of those rules is actually very difficult, due to a variety of different reasons. Those reasons can vary from problems in the interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations, to difficulties in the access to justice and in the adjudication by the courts, regarding occupational and environmental damages. In most of these cases, the consequences of these problems are a poor and inefficient protection of the victims of the asbestos exposures for the damages suffered.

Ethical issues in education: Medical trainees and the global health experience	BEST PRACTICE & RESEARCH CLINICAL OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY			English	Article						medical education; global health; global health experience; medical student; resident	ELECTIVES	With interest in global health experiences (GHEs) by medical trainees remaining high, the number of global health programs offering educational experiences in resource limited settings has proliferated. Development and implementation of GHEs has outpaced the critical evaluation of ethical considerations inherent in these programs. Global health programs must adhere to the four principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, respect of autonomy, and justice in crafting a GHE focused on maximizing the experience of the learners, host country, and patients. The four ethical principles provide a guideline for the development and implementation of highly ethical GHEs for medical trainees. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Complete prevention requires addition of a skill set for maternal care teams that is a magnitude greater than what we have today. As universities, individuals, institutions and NGO's engage in initiatives to end preventable maternal and neonatal mortality, an expanded context of ethical imperatives becomes increasingly important. Besides the traditional principles of non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy, and social justice, imbalances between high and low income countries and cultural relativity give rise to broader ethical imperatives: mutual respect, trust, open communication, accountability, transparency, leadership capacity building and sustainability. The elimination of disparities in other women's issues, HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, chronic non-infectious diseases, can all be more effectively addressed through a lens of ethical global health engagement.

GBD 2016 Mortality Collaborators	Global, regional, and national under-5 mortality, adult mortality, age-specific mortality, and life expectancy, 1970-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016	LANCET			English	Article							RUSSIAN MORTALITY; CHILD-MORTALITY; HEALTH; COUNTRIES; HIV; INCOME; ASSOCIATION; SANITATION; FERTILITY; EDUCATION	Background Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. Methods We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0.5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. Findings Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86.9 years (95% UI 86.7-87.2), and for men in Singapore, at 81.3 years (78.8-83.7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

Telephone nursing in Sweden: A narrative literature review	NURSING & HEALTH SCIENCES			English	Review						literature review; Sweden nursing; telephone communication; telephone nursing	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; HOURS PRIMARY-CARE; HEALTH-CARE; NHS DIRECT; SWEDISH TELENURSES; PATIENT SATISFACTION; MALPRACTICE CLAIMS; ADVICE; EXPERIENCES; NURSES	Telephone nursing services are expanding globally. Swedish Healthcare Direct is the largest healthcare provider in Sweden. This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of telephone nursing, as reflected by research on Swedish national telephone nursing, and discusses the findings in relation to international literature. A descriptive, mixed-studies literature review was conducted. Twenty-four articles from January 2003 to April 2015 were identified from PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL, and included. The issues explored in this study are how telephone nursing is perceived by callers, telephone nurses, and managers, and what characterizes such calls. Callers value reassurance, support, respect and satisfaction and involvement in decisions can increase their adherence. The telephone nurses' perspective focused on problems and ethical dilemmas, communication, the decision support tool, and working tasks. The managers' perspective focused on nursing work goals and malpractice claims. Concerning call characteristics, authentic calls, incident reports, and threats to patient safety were considered. Telephone nursing seems safe, but gender can play a role in calls. Future research on caller access, equity, and efficiency, healthcare cost-effectiveness, distribution, and patient safety is needed.

Few contemporary studies have studied its effect on perinatal indicators with long-lasting influence on adult health. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the impact of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis on low birth weight (LBW) in Portugal. Methods: Data on 2 045 155 singleton births of 1995-2014 were obtained from Statistics Portugal. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to identify the years in which changes in LBW trends occurred, and to estimate the annual per cent changes (APC). LBW risk by time period expressed as prevalence ratios were computed using the Poisson regression. Contextual changes in sociodemographic and economic factors were provided by their trends. Results: The joinpoint analysis identified 3 distinct periods (2 jointpoints) with different APC in LBW, corresponding to 1995-1999 (APC=4.4; 95% CI 3.2 to 5.6), 2000-2006 (APC=0.1; 95% CI -050 to 0.7) and 2007-2014 (APC=1.6; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.0). For non-Portuguese, it was, respectively, 1995-1999 (APC=1.4; 95% CI -3.9 to 7.0%), 2000-2007 (APC=-4.2; 95% CI -6.4 to -2.0) and 2008-2014 (APC=3.1; 95% CI 0.8 to 5.5). Compared with 1995-1999, all specific maternal characteristics had a 10-15% increase in LBW risk in 2000-2006 and a 20-25% increase in 2007-2014, except among migrants, for which LBW risk remained lower than in 1995-1999 but increased after the crisis. The increasing LBW risk coincides with a deceleration in gross domestic product growth rate, reduction in health expenditure, social protection allocation on family/children support and sickness. Conclusions: The 2007-2008 global financial crisis was associated with a significant increase in LBW, particularly among infants of non-Portuguese mothers. We recommend strengthening social policies aimed at maternity protection for vulnerable mothers and health system maintenance of social equity in perinatal healthcare.

The National Forum on Surgery and Anaesthesia in South Africa brought together various stakeholders, including government, societies, academic clinicians and the biomedical industry, to define the core strategy for a national surgical plan. During the forum, presentations and breakaway workshops explored and reported the challenges and opportunities these stakeholders may have in sustaining and improving surgical provision in South Africa. We present the recommendations of these reports with a literature review and other recent reports from organisations involved in healthcare systems in South Africa. We acknowledge the importance of access to safe and affordable surgery for all as a core component of healthcare provision for South Africa. The proposed core strategies for a South African National Surgical Plan to achieve these goals are the following. First, research will focus on high-quality interdisciplinary collaborative research and audit, which addresses the Global Surgery indices, adopts internationally consistent data points and focuses particularly on maternal mortality and the 'Bellwether procedures'. Second, workforce and training must be tailored to the country's specific surgical needs, based on a primary healthcare and district hospital model, which is supported by government and academic organisations. Third, the surgical infrastructure and service delivery needs to be strengthened by the district hospital. Finally, strong leadership with appropriate financial support by healthcare managers who partner with clinicians both locally and nationally is needed to achieve these objectives.

Levels and trends of childhood undernutrition by wealth and education according to a Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure: evidence from 146 Demographic and Health Surveys from 39 countries	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							ECONOMIC-INEQUALITY; NUTRITION; MALNUTRITION	Background Governments have endorsed global targets to reduce childhood undernutrition as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Understanding the socioeconomic differences in childhood undernutrition has the potential to be helpful for targeting policy to reach these goals. Methods We specify a logistic regression model with the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) as the outcome and indicator variables for wealth quartiles, maternal education categories and a set of covariates as explanatory variables. Wealth and education variables are interacted with a period indicator for 1990-2000 compared with 2001-2014 to observe differences over time. Based on these regressions we calculate predicted CIAF prevalence by wealth and education categories and over time. Results The sample included 146 surveys from 39 low-income and lower-middle-income countries with an overall sample size of 533 217 children. CIAF prevalence was 47.5% in 1990-2000, and it declined to 42.6% in 2001-2014. In 1990-2000 the CIAF prevalence of children with mothers with less than primary education was 31 percentage points higher than for mothers with secondary or higher education. This difference slightly decreased to 27 percentage points in 2001-2014. The difference in predicted CIAF prevalence of children from the highest and lowest wealth quartiles was 21 percentage points and did not change over time. Conclusions We find evidence for persistent and even increasing socioeconomic inequalities in childhood undernutrition, which underlines the importance of previous calls for equity-driven approaches targeting the most vulnerable to reduce childhood malnutrition.

Access to medicines and hepatitis C in Africa: can tiered pricing and voluntary licencing assure universal access, health equity and fairness?	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Hepatitis C; Access to medicine; Tiered pricing; Voluntary licensing; Universal access; Health equity; Africa		Background: The recent introduction of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) for treating Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) can significantly assist in the world reaching the international target of elimination by 2030. Yet, the challenge facing many individuals and countries today lies with their ability to access these treatments due to their relatively high prices. Gilead Sciences applies differential pricing and licensing strategies arguing that this provides fairer and more equitable access to these life-saving medicines. This paper analyses the implications of Gilead's tiered pricing and voluntary licencing strategy for access to the DAAs. Methods: We examined seven countries in Africa (Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Rwanda and South Africa) to assess their financial capacity to provide DAAs for the treatment of HCV under present voluntary licensing and tiered-pricing arrangements. These countries have been selected to explore the experience of countries with a range of different burdens of HCV and shared eligibility for supply by licensed generic producers or from discounted Gilead prices. Results: The cost of 12-weeks of generic DAA varies from $684 per patient treated in Egypt to $750 per patient treated in other countries. These countries can also procure the same DAA for 12-weeks of treatment from the originator, Gilead, at a cost of $1200 per patient. The current prices of DAAs (both from generic and originator manufacturers) are much more than the median annual income per capita and the annual health budget of most of these countries. If governments alone were to bear the costs of universal treatment coverage, then the required additional health expenditure from present rates would range from a 4% increase in South Africa to a staggering 403% in Cameroon. Conclusion: The current arrangements for increasing access to DAAs, towards elimination of HCV, are facing challenges that would require increases in expenditure that are either too burdensome to governments or potentially so to individuals and families. Countries need to implement the flexibilities in the Doha Declaration on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights agreement, including compulsory licensing and patent opposition. This also requires political commitment, financial will, global solidarity and civil society activism.

J	Aareleid, T; Zimmermann, ML; Baburin, A; Innos, K				Aareleid, Tiiu; Zimmermann, Mari-Liis; Baburin, Aleksei; Innos, Kaire			Divergent trends in lung cancer incidence by gender, age and histological type in Estonia: a nationwide population-based study	BMC CANCER			English	Article						Lung cancer; Population-based; Incidence; Mortality; Gender; Age; Histology; Time trends; Predictions	EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES; EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; DATA QUALITY; TIME TRENDS; SMOKING; WOMEN; ADENOCARCINOMA; MORTALITY; SURVIVAL; DEATH	Background: Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men and the second most frequent cause of cancer deaths in women in Estonia. The study aimed to analyze time trends in LC incidence and mortality in Estonia over the 30-year period, which included major social, economic and health care transition. The results are discussed in the context of changes in tobacco control and smoking prevalence. Long-term predictions of incidence and mortality are provided. Methods: Data for calculating the incidence and mortality rates in 1985-2014 were obtained from the nationwide population-based Estonian Cancer Registry and the Causes of Death Registry. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze trends and estimate annual percentage change (APC) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Nordpred model was used to project future incidence and mortality trends for 2015-2034. Results: Incidence peaked among men in 1991 and decreased thereafter (APC: -1.5, 95% CI: -1.8; -1.3). A decline was seen for all age groups, except age >= 75 years, and for all histological types, except adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. Incidence among women increased overall (APC: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1; 2.0) and in all age groups and histological types, except small cell carcinoma. Age-standardized incidence rate (world) per 100,000 was 54.2 in men and 12.9 in women in 2014. Changes in mortality closely followed those in incidence. According to our predictions, the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates will continue to decrease in men and reach a plateau in women. Conclusions: The study revealed divergent LC trends by gender, age and histological type, which were generally consistent with main international findings. Growing public awareness and stricter tobacco control have stimulated overall favorable changes in men, but not yet in women. Large increase in incidence was observed for adenocarcinoma, which in men showed a trend opposite to the overall decline. LC will remain a serious public health issue in Estonia due to a high number of cases during the next decades, related to aging population, and previous and current smoking patterns. National tobacco control policy in Estonia should prioritize preventing smoking initiation and promoting smoking cessation, particularly among women.

Relationships Between Integration and Drug Use Among Deported Migrants in Tijuana, Mexico	JOURNAL OF IMMIGRANT AND MINORITY HEALTH			English	Article						Migration; Deportation; Integration; Illicit drug use; Mexico	SUBSTANCE USE; HEALTH-STATUS; HIV RISK; DEPORTATION POLICY; ILLICIT DRUGS; GLOBAL BURDEN; UNITED-STATES; USE DISORDERS; MIGRATION; STIGMA	Deported migrants face numerous challenges which may elevate their risk for drug use. We examined relationships between integration and drug use among deported migrants in Tijuana, Mexico. A cross-sectional survey conducted at a free health clinic included 255 deported Mexican-born migrants residing in Tijuana >= 6 months. Multivariable logistic regression examined associations between variables across four integration domains (public participation, social connections, macro-level facilitators and foundations) and recent (past 6-month) drug use. The prevalence of recent drug use was 46 %. Having sought work in Tijuana in the past 6 months, greater household affluence, lifetime history of incarceration in both US and Mexico, and lacking health insurance were independently associated with recent drug use. Policies that support access to employment, adequate housing and healthcare in Mexico, particularly for justice-involved deportees, may facilitate successful integration and reduce potential stressors that may contribute to drug use.

The 2010 Haiti earthquake caused great destruction and prompted a massive humanitarian response. The widespread needs experienced by the population and the scale of the response inevitably rendered priority-setting difficult, and gave rise to ethical challenges. Purpose This paper presents four ethical questions identified in the analysis of a study on vulnerability and equity in the humanitarian response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Methods Using interpretive description methodology, the interdisciplinary research team analysed 24 semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted with expatriate and Haitian health workers and decision-makers involved in the response. Results Ethical questions identified through the analysis were: (1) How should limited resources be allocated in situations of widespread vulnerability and elevated needs? (2) At what point does it become ethically problematic to expend (considerable) resources to sustain expatriate disaster responders? (3) How ought rapid and reactive interventions be balanced with more deliberated and coordinated approaches? (4) What trade-offs are justified when interventions to address acute needs could contribute to long-term vulnerabilities? Discussion The questions arise in light of an immense gap between available resources and widespread and elevated needs. This gap is likely unavoidable in large-scale crises and may be a source of ethical distress for both local and international responders. The analysis of ethical questions associated with crisis response can advance discussions about how relief efforts can best be designed and implemented to minimise ethical distress and improve assistance to local populations.

A realist synthesis of cross-border patient movement from low and middle income countries to similar or higher income countries	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Review						Patient mobility; Cross-border medical travel; Capital	HEALTH-CARE; MEDICAL TOURISM; SYSTEMS THINKING; ACCESS; FRAMEWORK; DEMAND; INTERVENTIONS; OPPORTUNITIES; SOCIOLOGY; SERVICES	Patient travel across borders to access healthcare is becoming increasingly common and widespread. Patients moving from high income to middle income countries for healthcare is well documented, with patients seeking treatments that are cheaper or more readily available than at home. Less well understood is when patients move from one low income country to another or from a low income country to a higher income country. In this paper, a realist review was undertaken to explore why, in what contexts and how patients from lower income countries travel to countries with the same, or more advanced, economies for planned healthcare. Based on an initial scoping of the literature and discussions with key informants, we generated an initial theory and set of propositions about why, how, who and in what contexts people cross international borders for planned healthcare. We then systematically located and synthesized (1) peer-reviewed studies from the Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and Econlit databases; (2) non-indexed reports using key informants and Google; and (3) papers from the reference lists of included documents, to glean supportive or contradictory evidence for our initial propositions. As we reviewed the literature and extracted our data, we drew on the work of Pierre Bourdieu to understand the interplay between material and non-material capital and cognitive processes in decisions to cross borders for healthcare. Patient travel was largely undertaken due to a lack of services in the home country and/or unacceptability of local services, with decisions on when, and where, to travel, usually made within the patient's social networks. They were able to travel via use of multiple resources, including social networks, economic and cultural capital, and habitus. Those patients with greater volumes of the aforementioned factors had greater healthcare options; however, even those with limited resources engaged in patient travel. Patient movement challenges traditional ways of thinking about public health and the notion of health systems contained within the nation state. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of patient travel, and how to harness the benefits of patient travel without exacerbating existing health inequalities.

J	Plamondon, K; Walters, D; Campbell, S; Hatfield, J				Plamondon, Katrina; Walters, Dylan; Campbell, Sandy; Hatfield, Jennifer			Promoting equitable global health research: a policy analysis of the Canadian funding landscape	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Global health research; Funding; Research policy; Canada	REFLEXIVITY; COMPETENCES; EXCHANGE	Background: Recognising radical shifts in the global health research (GHR) environment, participants in a 2013 deliberative dialogue called for careful consideration of equity-centred principles that should inform Canadian funding polices. This study examined the existing funding structures and policies of Canadian and international funders to inform the future design of a responsive GHR funding landscape. Methods: We used a three-pronged analytical framework to review the ideas, interests and institutions implicated in publically accessible documents relevant to GHR funding. These data included published literature and organisational documents (e.g. strategic plans, progress reports, granting policies) from Canadian and other comparator funders. We then used a deliberative approach to develop recommendations with the research team, advisors, industry informants and low- and middle-income country (LMIC) partners. Results: In Canada, major GHR funders invest an estimated CA$90 M per annum; however, the post-2008 re-organization of funding structures and policies resulted in an uncoordinated and inefficient Canadian strategy. Australia, Denmark, the European Union, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America invest proportionately more in GHR than Canada. Each of these countries has a national strategic plan for global health, some of which have dedicated benchmarks for GHR funding and policy to allow funds to be held by partners outside of Canada. Key constraints to equitable GHR funding included (1) funding policies that restrict financial and cost burden aspects of partnering for GHR in LMICs; and (2) challenges associated with the development of effective governance mechanisms. There were, however, some Canadian innovations in funding research that demonstrated both unconventional and equitable approaches to supporting GHR in Canada and abroad. Among the most promising were found in the International Development Research Centre and the (no longer active) Global Health Research Initiative. Conclusion: Promoting equitable GHR funding policies and practices in Canada requires cooperation and actions by multiple stakeholders, including government, funding agencies, academic institutions and researchers. Greater cooperation and collaboration among these stakeholders in the context of recent political shifts present important opportunities for advancing funding policies that enable and encourage more equitable investments in GHR.

J	Banerjee, S; Firtell, J				Banerjee, Srikanta; Firtell, Jill			Pedagogical models for enhancing the cross-cultural online public health learning environment	HEALTH EDUCATION JOURNAL			English	Article						Cross-cultural; distance learning; e-learning; higher education; online education; public health	INDIVIDUALISM; COLLECTIVISM; PROGRAM; COURSES; AFRICA	Background: Online distance learning (e-learning) is an established method for providing higher education on a global scale due to its potential to reduce inequalities particularly in the area of public health education. Simultaneously, multicultural education is a key component of health education and can be achieved by fostering cultural pluralism and mutual respect within the teaching and learning environment. Objective: Online learning in public health has the potential to bring together practitioners in various fields within a unified forum. Given that undergraduate and graduate education and student interest in the field of public health has grown worldwide over the past decade, exploring the unique features of distance learning becomes a priority area. Consequently, the need for cross-cultural collaborative learning has been on the rise. Methods: The Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched using the keywords 'e-learning', 'multicultural online education', 'cultural sensitivity', 'transcultural', 'cultural diversity', 'multicultural education theory', 'distance learning', 'public health' and 'cultural competence'. The quality of each study was rated against set inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Employing different sociological models, this paper (1) describes the historical development of the theories of cultural diversity, (2) describes a cohesive and novel theoretical framework for addressing a cross-cultural approach to public health education and (3) reviews the literature on online education as a means to suggesting different ways in which cross-cultural education can be more fully integrated. Conclusion: Implementation of this theoretical framework proposed here may lead to a better understanding of how best to enhance online public health education and how different forms of peer support can foster cross-cultural educational uptake.

J	Turner, B				Turner, B.			The new system of health accounts in Ireland: what does it all mean?	IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE			English	Review						Health spending; Funding sources; Health services; Ireland	INSURANCE	Background The Central Statistics Office released new figures on Ireland's health spending in December 2015, based on the System of Health Accounts (SHA2011). These figures differ from previous figures, by virtue of an expanded definition of what constitutes health care. The new figures also provide more detail on health expenditure than the previous figures allowed. Aims This article examines the new figures, drawing out findings of note and discussing the implications of these for the Irish health care system. It also compares Ireland with international health systems, highlighting where Ireland is unusual or comparable to international norms. Findings Healthcare spending in Ireland as a percentage of GDP is higher than in many other countries, having increased during the economic downturn, although this was due more to the contraction in GDP than an increase in spending. While the majority of healthcare expenditure in Ireland comes from the Government, the share of private expenditure on healthcare in Ireland has increased, with implications for equity in the system. Over half of the expenditure is on curative and rehabilitative services, broadly in line with other countries. The proportion of spending going to long-term care facilities is relatively high by international standards. Conclusion Suggestions that Ireland is over-spending on health need to be tempered by cognisance that the Irish health system is under-resourced in a number of areas (particularly the number of doctors and the number of hospital beds) and has not fully recovered from cutbacks in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The Guatemala-Penn Partners: An Innovative Inter-Institutional Model for Scientific Capacity Building, Healthcare Education, and Public Health	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Guatemala; global health; capacity building; scientific diplomacy; partnership		Population health outcomes are directly related to robust public health programs, access to basic health services, and a well trained health-care workforce. Effective health services need to systematically identify solutions, scientifically test these solutions, and share generated knowledge. The World Health Organization (WHO)'s Global Healthcare Workforce Alliance states that the capacity to perform research is an essential factor for well-functioning public health systems. Low- and middle-income countries have greater health-care worker shortages and lower research capacity than higher-income countries. International global health partnerships between higher-income countries and low-middle-income countries aim to directly address such inequalities through capacity building, a process by which human and institutional resources are strengthened and developed, allowing them to perform high-level functions, solve complex problems, and achieve important objectives. The Guatemala-Penn Partners (GPP) is a collaboration among academic centers in Guatemala and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that echoes the vision of the WHO's Global Healthcare Workforce Alliance. This article describes the historical development and present organization of the GPP according to its three guiding principles: university-to-university connections, dual autonomies with locally led capacity building, and mutually beneficial exchanges. It describes the GPP activities within the domains of science, health-care education, and public health, emphasizing implementation factors, such as sustainability and scalability, in relation to the guiding principles. Successes and limitations of this innovative model are also analyzed in the hope that the lessons learned may be applied to similar partnerships across the globe.

Inequalities in birth certificate coverage among children under five years in 94 countries using nationally representative household surveys	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Birth certificates; Vital statistics; Health equity; Child health surveys; Global health; Socioeconomic factors	REGISTRATION; HEALTH; STATISTICS; MORTALITY; STATES; GHANA	Background: Birth registration, and the possession of a birth certificate as proof of registration, has long been recognized as a fundamental human right. Data from a functioning civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system allows governments to benefit from accurate and universal data on birth and death rates. However, access to birth certificates remains challenging and unequal in many low and middle-income countries. This paper examines wealth, urban/rural and gender inequalities in birth certificate coverage. Methods: We analyzed nationally representative household surveys from 94 countries between 2000 and 2014 using Demographic Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Birth certificate coverage among children under five was examined at the national and regional level. Absolute measures of inequality were used to measure inequalities in birth certificate coverage by wealth quintile, urban/rural residence and sex of the child. Results: Over four million children were included in the analysis. Birth certificate coverage was over 90% in 29 countries and below 50% in 36 countries, indicating that more than half the children under five surveyed in these countries did not have a birth certificate. Eastern & Southern Africa had the lowest average birth certificate coverage (26.9%) with important variability among countries. Significant wealth inequalities in birth certificate coverage were observed in 74 countries and in most UNICEF regions, and urban/rural inequalities were present in 60 countries. Differences in birth certificate coverage between girls and boys tended to be small. Conclusions: We show that wealth and urban/rural inequalities in birth certificate coverage persist in most low and middle income countries, including countries where national birth certificate coverage is between 60 and 80%. Weak CRVS systems, particularly in South Asia and Africa lead rural and poor children to be systematically excluded from the benefits tied to a birth certificate, and prevent these children from being counted in national health data. Greater funding and attention is needed to strengthen CRVS systems and equity analyses should inform such efforts, especially as data needs for the Sustainable Development Goals expand. Monitoring disaggregated data on birth certificate coverage is essential to reducing inequalities in who is counted and registered. Strengthening CRVS systems can enable a child's right to identity, improve health data and promote equity.

A scoping review of the international literature	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Review						Health system strengthening; Challenges; Health service delivery; Human resources; Governance; Leadership; Health innovation	CARE-SYSTEM; MENTAL-HEALTH; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE; AFRICA; EQUITY	Background: While there is an extensive literature on Health System (HS) strengthening and on the performance of specific HSs, there are few exhaustive syntheses of the challenges HSs are facing worldwide. This paper reports the findings of a scoping review aiming to classify the challenges of HSs investigated in the scientific literature. Specifically, it determines the kind of research conducted on HS challenges, where it was performed, in which health sectors and on which populations. It also identifies the types of challenge described the most and how they varied across countries. Methods: We searched 8 databases to identify scientific papers published in English, French and Italian between January 2000 and April 2016 that addressed HS needs and challenges. The challenges reported in the articles were classified using van Olmen et al.'s dynamic HS framework. Countries were classified using the Human Development Index (HDI). Our analyses relied on descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. Results: 292 articles were included in our scoping review. 33.6% of these articles were empirical studies and 60.1% were specific to countries falling within the very high HDI category, in particular the United States. The most frequently researched sectors were mental health (41%), infectious diseases (12%) and primary care (11%). The most frequently studied target populations included elderly people (23%), people living in remote or poor areas (21%), visible or ethnic minorities (15%), and children and adolescents (15%). The most frequently reported challenges related to human resources (22%), leadership and governance (21%) and health service delivery (24%). While health service delivery challenges were more often examined in countries within the very high HDI category, human resources challenges attracted more attention within the low HDI category. Conclusions: This scoping review provides a quantitative description of the available evidence on HS challenges and a qualitative exploration of the dynamic relationships that HS components entertain. While health services research is increasingly concerned about the way HSs can adopt innovations, little is known about the system-level challenges that innovations should address in the first place. Within this perspective, four key lessons are drawn as well as three knowledge gaps.

Collaborating with Communities and Higher Education to Address the Health-care Needs of Individuals with Disabilities in Ecuador	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						community-based rehabilitation; individuals with disabilities; health care; international collaborations; global health	REHABILITATION	Individuals with disabilities experience inequities in access to health care, education, employment, and social inclusion. Causes for Change International (CCI), a non-governmental Organization (NGO), using a community-based rehabilitation approach has worked for 20 years to build self-sufficiency, improve health-care services, and education for women, children, and persons with disabilities in Ecuador. CCI initially addressed health; advocacy for individuals with disabilities; and promoted educational opportunities for children with disabilities, starting in one rural community. CCI's outreach has expanded through Ecuador's coastal provinces, Andean provinces, and Galapagos Islands. CCI also focused on local health-care workforce development, developing employment skills for individuals with disabilities and social inclusion for this population. CCI collaborated with local organizations, government, and universities to provide resources, managed by local leadership. Key program elements of the CCI approach include (1) develop trust between CCI, local communities, local agencies, and government; (2) empower local groups to assume leadership and sustain programs; (3) support communities and groups invested in developing self-sufficiency; and (4) strengthen collaborations and partnerships between local and international organizations, universities, and government agencies. Key lessons learned by CCI are to be supportive of cultural differences; understand that limited financial and material resources may limit the program development; recognize that it is difficult not to foster dependent relationships with communities and appreciate the importance of working with and within the host country's governmental systems. CCI is expanding its service base to other regions of Ecuador and is focusing on development of the Ecuadorian health-care workforce and social inclusion opportunities for individuals with disability. The efforts of a small NGO have helped build community self-sufficiency in meeting the health care and rehabilitation needs of all Ecuadorian citizens and a greater awareness of the abilities and potential contributions of individuals with disabilities.

Model-Based Policymaking: A Framework to Promote ethical "Good Practice" in Mathematical Modeling for Public Health Policymaking	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						mathematical models; ethics; policymaking; justice; independence; beneficence; transparency	DISEASE; SCIENCE	Mathematical models are increasingly relied upon as decision support tools, which estimate risks and generate recommendations to underpin public health policies. However, there are no formal agreements about what constitutes professional competencies or duties in mathematical modeling for public health. In this article, we propose a framework to evaluate whether mathematical models that assess human and animal disease risks and control strategies meet standards consistent with ethical "good practice" and are thus "fit for purpose" as evidence in support of policy. This framework is derived from principles of biomedical ethics: independence, transparency (autonomy), beneficence/non-maleficence, and justice. We identify ethical risks associated with model development and implementation and consider the extent to which scientists are accountable for the translation and communication of model results to policymakers so that the strengths and weaknesses of the scientific evidence base and any socioeconomic and ethical impacts of biased or uncertain predictions are clearly understood. We propose principles to operationalize a framework for ethically sound model development and risk communication between scientists and policymakers. These include the creation of science-policy partnerships to mutually define policy questions and communicate results; development of harmonized international standards for model development; and data stewardship and improvement of the traceability and transparency of models via a searchable archive of policy-relevant models. Finally, we suggest that bespoke ethical advisory groups, with relevant expertise and access to these resources, would be beneficial as a bridge between science and policy, advising modelers of potential ethical risks and providing overview of the translation of modeling advice into policy.

J	Sawleshwarkar, S; Negin, J				Sawleshwarkar, Shailendra; Negin, Joel			A Review of Global Health Competencies for Postgraduate Public Health Education	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						global health; competencies; international health; postgraduate education; public health	INTERNATIONAL HEALTH; CORE COMPETENCES; STUDENTS; MASTER	During the last decade, the literature about global health has grown exponentially. Academic institutions are also exploring the scope of their public health educational programs to meet the demand for a global health professional. This has become more relevant in the context of the sustainable development goals. There have been attempts to describe global health competencies for specific professional groups. The focus of these competencies has been variable with a variety of different themes being described ranging from globalization and health care, analysis and program management, as well as equity and capacity strengthening. This review aims to describe global health competencies and attempts to distill common competency domains to assist in curriculum development and integration in postgraduate public health education programs. A literature search was conducted using relevant keywords with a focus on public health education. This resulted in identification of 13 articles that described global health competencies. All these articles were published between 2005 and 2015 with six from the USA, two each from Canada and Australia, and one each from UK, Europe, and Americas. A range of methods used to describe competency domains included literature review, interviews with experts and employers, surveys of staff and students, and description or review of an academic program. Eleven competency domains were distilled from the selected articles. These competency domains primarily referred to three main aspects, one that focuses on burden of disease and the determinants of health. A second set focuses on core public health skills including policy development, analysis, and program management. Another set of competency domains could be classified as "soft skills" and includes collaboration, partnering, communication, professionalism, capacity building, and political awareness. This review presents the landscape of defined global health competencies for postgraduate public health education. The discussion about use of "global health," "international health," and "global public health" will continue, and academic institutions need to explore ways to integrate these competencies in postgraduate public health programs. This is critical in the post-MDG era that we prepare global public health workforce for the challenges of improving health of the "global" population in the context of sustainable development goals.

Many studies contend that gender inequalities are likely to greatly shape the global distribution of solid fuel use and its negative health consequences. We conduct an analysis of 91 developing nations using structural equation models on the prevalence of female indoor air pollution deaths among women and the ratio of female to male indoor air pollution deaths. The results illustrate that women's status is a robust predictor of solid fuel use, and that improved women's status also correlates directly with lower female to male indoor air pollution deaths ratios and indirectly with reduced female death prevalence through lower solid fuel dependence. Women's status additionally mediates the effects of some other notable predictors, such as economic development. Overall, the results bring attention to a "silent killer" in less-developed nations and illustrate that greater female empowerment is an important avenue in addressing this global pandemic.

J	Adams, K; Snyder, J; Crooks, VA; Johnston, R				Adams, Krystyna; Snyder, Jeremy; Crooks, Valorie A.; Johnston, Rory			Developing an informational tool for ethical engagement in medical tourism	PHILOSOPHY ETHICS AND HUMANITIES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Medical tourism; International medical travel; Guideline; Ethics; Equity	SUSTAINABLE TOURISM; PUBLIC-HEALTH; TRAVEL; IMPACT	Background: Medical tourism, the practice of persons intentionally travelling across international boundaries to access medical care, has drawn increasing attention from researchers, particularly in relation to potential ethical concerns of this practice. Researchers have expressed concern for potential negative impacts to individual safety, public health within both countries of origin for medical tourists and destination countries, and global health equity. However, these ethical concerns are not discussed within the sources of information commonly provided to medical tourists, and as such, medical tourists may not be aware of these concerns when engaging in medical tourism. This paper describes the methodology utilized to develop an information sheet intended to be disseminated to Canadian medical tourists to encourage contemplation and further public discussion of the ethical concerns in medical tourism. Methods: The methodology for developing the information sheet drew on an iterative process to consider stakeholder feedback on the content and use of the information sheet as it might inform prospective medical tourists' decision making. This methodology includes a literature review as well as formative research with Canadian public health professionals and former medical tourists. Results: The final information sheet underwent numerous revisions throughout the formative research process according to feedback from medical tourism stakeholders. These revisions focused primarily on making the information sheet concise with points that encourage individuals considering travelling for medical tourism to do further research regarding their safety both within the destination country, while travelling, and once returning to Canada, and the potential impacts of their trip on third parties. This methodology may be replicated for the development of information sheets intending to communicate ethical concerns of other practices to providers or consumers of a certain service.

Ability of modern day welfare states to compensate an impaired work ability and absenteeism arising from incapacity is very diverse. The aims of this study were to establish and explain intercountry differences among selected European OECD countries and to provide forecasts of future work absenteeism and expenditures on wage replacement benefits. Methods: Two major public registries, European health for all database and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development database (OECD Health Data), were coupled to form a joint database on 12 core indicators. These were related to disability, work absenteeism, and sickness benefits in European OECD countries. Time horizon 1989-2013 was observed. Forecasting analysis was done on mean values of all data for each single variable for all observed countries in a single year. Trends were predicted on a selected time horizon based on the mean value, in our case, 7 years up to 2020. For this purpose, ARIMA prediction model was applied, and its significance was assessed using Ljung-Box Q test. Results: Our forecasts based on ARIMA modeling of available data indicate that up to 2020, most European countries will experience downfall of absenteeism from work due to illness. The number of citizens receiving social/disability benefits and the number being compensated due to health-related absence from work will decline. As opposed to these trends, cancer morbidity may become the top ranked disability driver as hospital discharge diagnoses. Concerning development is the anticipated bold growth of hospital discharge frequencies due to cancer across the region. This effectively means that part of these savings on social support expenditure shall effectively be spent to combat strong cancer morbidity as the major driver of disability. Conclusion: We have clearly growing work load for the national health systems attributable to the clinical oncology acting as the major disability contributor. This effectively means that large share of these savings on public expenditure shall effectively be spent to combat strong cancer morbidity. On another side, we have all signs of falling societal responsibility toward the citizens suffering from diverse kinds of incapacity or impaired working ability and independence. Citizens suffering from any of these causes are likely to experience progressively less social support and publicly funded care and work support compared to the golden welfare era of previous decades.

Relevancy also remains elusive in the chemistry classroom, where real-world issues of social justice, health, and the environment are largely missing from chemistry curricula. As a result, students struggle to understand their role as change agents and global citizens with leadership responsibility toward developing solutions to these justice issues, particularly as they relate to chemistry and manufacturing industries. Green chemistry curriculum developed by groups such as the Molecular Design Research Network, Beyond Benign, Greener Education Materials for Chemists, and others is available for faculty to seamlessly integrate topics of social, health, and environmental justice problem-solving into their classes, with a focus on educating future chemists who recognize their role in solving (or preventing) global justice issues. The purpose of this paper is to share new instructional strategies needed to add relevancy to the life of chemistry students.

The objective of the GATE program is to improve access to high quality, affordable assistive technology for people with varying disabilities, diseases, and age-related conditions. As a first step, GATE has developed the assistive products list, a list of priority assistive products based on addressing the greatest need at population level. A specific group of people who can benefit from user appropriate assistive technology are people with intellectual disabilities. However, the use of assistive products by people with intellectual disabilities is a neglected area of research and practice, and offers considerable opportunities for the advancement of population health and the realization of basic human rights. It is unknown how many people with intellectual disabilities globally have access to appropriate assistive products and which factors influence their access. We call for a much greater focus on people with intellectual disabilities within the GATE program. We present a framework for understanding the complex interaction between intellectual disability, health and wellbeing, and assistive technology.

The main objective of this study is to analyse the development of standardised mortality rates for cerebrovascular disease, which is one of the most common causes of deaths, in relation to income inequality in individual regions of the Slovak Republic. Direct standardisation was applied using data from the Slovak mortality database, covering the time period from 1996 to 2013. The standardised mortality rate declined by 4.23% in the Slovak Republic. However, since 1996, the rate has been higher by almost 33% in men than in women. Standardised mortality rates were lower in the northern part of the Slovak Republic than in the southern part. The regression models demonstrated an impact of the observed income-related dimensions on these rates. The income quintile ratio and Gini coefficient appeared to be the most influencing variables. The results of the analysis highlight valuable baseline information for creating new support programmes aimed at eliminating health inequalities in relation to health and social policy.

Evaluating the Trade-off and Institutional Hypotheses on Health Inequalities in the Global South	JOURNAL OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						child health; developing nations; health inequality; institutions; population health	MATERNAL EDUCATION; POPULATION HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CHILD-MORTALITY; TECHNOLOGICAL-INNOVATION; FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES; INFANT-MORTALITY; WELFARE-STATE; DISPARITIES	It has been suggested that as medicine advances and mortality declines, socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes will grow. Yet, most research on this topic uses data from affluent Western democracies, where mortality is declining in small increments. We argue that the Global South represents the ideal setting to study this issue in a context of rapid mortality decline. We evaluate two competing hypotheses: (1) there is a trade-off between population health and health inequality such that reductions in under-five mortality are linked to higher levels of social inequality in health; and (2) institutional interventions that improve under-five mortality, like the expansion of educational systems and public health expenditure, are associated with reductions in inequalities. We test these hypotheses using data on 1,369,050 births in 34 low-income countries in the Demographic and Health Surveys from 1995 to 2012. The results show little evidence of a health-for-equality trade-off and instead support the institutional hypothesis.

Collaborating With Community-Based Services to Promote Evidence-Based Practice: Process Description of a National Initiative to Improve Services for Youth With Mental Health and Substance Use Problems	PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES			English	Article						implementation process; cross-sectoral collaboration; youth screening; community services; stakeholder-informed research	PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; PRACTICE GAP; KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION; IMPLEMENTATION; COMORBIDITY; PREVALENCE; CARE; ADOLESCENTS; PREDICTORS; ALCOHOL	Many youth with significant mental health (MH) and/or substance use (SU) difficulties do not receive specialized services. Collaboration between service providers, researchers, and other stakeholders is essential to improve youth service system capacity to provide evidence-based services to meet the complex array of needs of youth. Facilitators and barriers of implementing evidence-based practice have been identified, but few studies provide examples of the processes of collaboration and implementation for youth MH services. This study explicates the design features and implementation processes of a project to improve screening activities in youth services. These processes supported the building of 16 collaborative networks of service providers from diverse youth-serving sectors (e.g., MH, youth justice, child welfare) in urban, rural, suburban, and remote Canadian communities. These cross-sectoral networks implemented an evidence-based practice (screening youth aged 12-24 years for MH and SU problems using the Global Assessment of Individual Needs-Short Screener [GAIN-SS]) across their services. Materials and resources were provided by a centralized research team. Core project components were standardized and adherence to these components was monitored. Over 800 service providers participated in cross-sectoral networks, capacity-building events, joint data analysis, or interpretation and recommendation sessions. Across the 89 participating agencies, service providers for 84% of participating youth implemented the evidence-based practice accurately in accordance with project protocols, with 98% of positive screens reviewed and addressed according to organizational protocols. Service provider feedback is reported. Facilitators, barriers, and implications of promoting implementation of evidence-based practices across sites and sectors are discussed.

J	Vural, IE				Vural, Ipek Eren			Financialisation in health care: An analysis of private equity fund investments in Turkey	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Turkey; Financialisation; Neoliberalism; Marketisation; Health care; Private equity funds; Private hospitals	SYSTEM	The 2007-2008 global financial crisis revived interest in the impacts of financial markets and actors on our social and economic life. Nevertheless, research on health care financialisation remains scant. This article presents findings from research on one modality of financial investments in health care: global private equity funds' investments in private hospitals. Adopting a political economy approach, it analyses the drivers and impacts of the upsurge of global private equity investments in the Turkish private hospital sector amid the global financial crisis. The analysis derives from review of research and archival literature, as well as six in-depth interviews held with owners/executive board directors/general managers of the largest private hospital chains in Turkey and the general partners of their PE investors. The interviewing process took place between January and November 2016. All interviews were conducted by the author in Istanbul. The findings point to a mutually reinforcing relationship between neoliberal policies and financialisation processes in health care. The article shows that neoliberal healthcare reforms, introduced under consecutive Justice and Development Party (JDP) governments in Turkey, have been important precursors of private equity investments in healthcare services. These private equity investments, in turn, intensified and broadened the process of marketisation in health care services. Four impacts are identified, through which private equity investments hasten the marketisation of health care services. These relate to the impacts of private equity investments on a) advancing the process of chain formation by large hospital groups, b) spreading financial imperatives into the operations of private hospitals c) fostering internationalisation of capital, and d) augmenting inequities in access to health care services and standards.

In doing so, it first locates the origins of austerity within the 40 year history of neoliberal economic orthodoxy. It then describes the global diffusion of austerity since 2008, and its key policy tenets. It next describes the already visible impacts of austerity-driven welfare reform on trends in health equity, and documents how austerity has exacerbated health inequities in countries with weak social protection policies. We finally identify the components of an alternative policy response to the financial crisis than that of austerity, with specific reference to the need for shifts in national and global taxation policies and public social protection policies and spending. We conclude with a call for a reorientation of public policy towards making human health an overarching global policy goal, and how this aligns with the multilaterally agreed upon Sustainable Development Goals.

When is a randomised controlled trial health equity relevant? Development and validation of a conceptual framework	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							INEQUALITIES; PROTOCOL	Background Randomised controlled trials can provide evidence relevant to assessing the equity impact of an intervention, but such information is often poorly reported. We describe a conceptual framework to identify health equity-relevant randomised trials with the aim of improving the design and reporting of such trials. Methods An interdisciplinary and international research team engaged in an iterative consensus building process to develop and refine the conceptual framework via face-to-face meetings, teleconferences and email correspondence, including findings from a validation exercise whereby two independent reviewers used the emerging framework to classify a sample of randomised trials. Results A randomised trial can usefully be classified as 'health equity relevant' if it assesses the effects of an intervention on the health or its determinants of either individuals or a population who experience ill health due to disadvantage defined across one or more social determinants of health. Health equity-relevant randomised trials can either exclusively focus on a single population or collect data potentially useful for assessing differential effects of the intervention across multiple populations experiencing different levels or types of social disadvantage. Trials that are not classified as 'health equity relevant' may nevertheless provide information that is indirectly relevant to assessing equity impact, including information about individual level variation unrelated to social disadvantage and potentially useful in secondary modelling studies. Conclusion The conceptual framework may be used to design and report randomised trials. The framework could also be used for other study designs to contribute to the evidence base for improved health equity.

We also conduct a risk management analysis at the sector level for commodity-Islamic stock sector index portfolios, using different risk exposure measures. For comparison purposes, we add the aggregate conventional Dow Jones global index and the Dow Jones sistainability world index. The results show evidence of time-varying risk spillovers between these markets. Moreover, there are increases in the correlations among the markets in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 GFC. Further, the oil, gold, energy, financial, technology and telecommunications sectors are net receivers of risk spillovers, while the sustainability and conventional aggregate DJIM indexes as well as the remaining Islamic stock sectors are net contributors of risk spillovers. Finally, we provide evidence that gold offers better portfolio diversification benefits and downside risk reductions than oil. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for MDD, but access can be impaired due to numerous barriers. Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) can be utilised to overcome treatment barriers and is an effective treatment for depression, but has never been compared to bibliotherapy. This Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) included participants meeting diagnostic criteria for MDD (n = 270) being randomised to either: iCBT (n = 61), a CBT self-help book (bCBT) (n = 77), a meditation self-help book (bMED) (n = 64) or wait-list control (WLC) (n = 68). The primary outcome was the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale (PHQ-9) at 12-weeks (post-treatment). All three active interventions were significantly more effective than WLC in reducing depression at post-treatment, but there were no significant differences between the groups. All three interventions led to large within-group reductions in PHQ-9 scores at post-treatment (g = 0.88-1.69), which were maintained at 3-month follow-up, although there was some evidence of relapse in the bMED group (within-group g [post to follow-up] = 0.09-1.04). Self-help based interventions could be beneficial in treating depression, however vigilance needs to be applied when selecting from the range of materials available. Replication of this study with a larger sample is required.

OBJECTIVE To investigate progress toward universal health coverage in 5 South Asian countries and assess inequalities in health services and financial risk protection indicators. DESIGN AND SETTINGS In a population-based study, nationally representative household (335 373 households) survey data from Afghanistan (2014 and 2015), Bangladesh (2010 and 2014), India (2012 and 2014), Nepal (2014 and 2015), and Pakistan (2014) were used to calculate relative indices of health coverage, financial risk protection, and inequality in coverage among wealth quintiles. The study was conducted from June 2012 to February 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three dimensions of universal health coveragewere assessed: access to basic services, financial risk protection, and equity. Composite and indicator-specific coverage rates, stratified by wealth quintiles, were then estimated. Slope and relative index of inequality were used to assess inequalities in service and financial indicators. RESULTS Access to basic care varied substantially across all South Asian countries, with mean rates of overall prevention coverage and treatment coverage of 53.0%(95% CI, 42.2%-63.6%) and 51.2%(95% CI, 45.2%-57.1%) in Afghanistan, 76.5%(95% CI, 61.0%-89.0%) and 44.8% (95% CI, 37.1%-52.5%) in Bangladesh, 74.2%(95% CI, 57.0%-88.1%) and 83.5%(95% CI, 54.4%-99.1%) in India, 76.8%(95% CI, 66.5%-85.7%) and 57.8%(95% CI, 50.1%-65.4%) in Nepal, and 69.8%(95% CI, 58.3%-80.2%) and 50.4%(95% CI, 37.1%-63.6%) in Pakistan. Financial risk protectionwas generally low, with 15.3%(95% CI, 14.7%-16.0%) of respondents in Afghanistan, 15.8% (95% CI, 14.9%-16.8%) in Bangladesh, 17.9%(95% CI, 17.7%-18.2%) in India, 11.8%(95% CI, 11.8%-11.9%) in Nepal, and 4.4%(95% CI, 4.0%-4.9%) in Pakistan reporting incurred catastrophic payments due to health care costs. Access to at least 4 antenatal care visits, institutional delivery, and presence of skilled attendant during deliverywere at least 3 times higher among thewealthiest mothers in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan compared with the rates among poor mothers. Access to institutional deliverywas 60 to 65 percentage points higher amongwealthy than poor mothers in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan compared with 21 percentage points higher in India. Coveragewas least equitable among the countries for adequate sanitation, institutional delivery, and the presence of skilled birth attendants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Health coverage and financial risk protection was low, and inequality in access to health care remains a serious issue for these South Asian countries. Greater progress is needed to improve treatment and preventive services and financial security.	[Rahman, Md. Mizanur; Rahman, Md.

Study Design and Setting: Research, guidance, and examples of search strategies were identified by searching a range of databases, key guidance documents, selected reviews, conference proceedings, and personal communication. Current practice and research evidence were summarized. Results: Four thousand nine hundred twenty-four records were retrieved by database searches, and additional documents were obtained by other searches. QE studies are challenging to identify efficiently because they have no standardized nomenclature and may be indexed in various ways. Reliable search filters are not available. There is a lack of specific resources devoted to collecting QE studies and little evidence on where best to search. Conclusion: Searches to identify QE studies should search a range of resources and, until indexing improves, use strategies that focus on the topic rather than the study design. Better definitions, better indexing in databases, prospective registers, and reporting guidance are required to improve the retrieval of QE studies and promote systematic reviews of what works based on the evidence from such studies.

The number of older adults is rapidly growing, leading to an increase in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases associated with aging, such as cancer. Worldwide, older adults account for approximately half of all cancer cases, and this proportion is projected to increase globally. Furthermore, the majority of older adults live in less developed regions, where health systems are generally ill-equipped to provide care for complex chronic conditions. Worldwide, there is paucity of geriatric training, and most of the oncology workforce lacks the skills and knowledge to provide comprehensive care for older patients. Various initiatives aimed at providing adequate clinical. care for older adults, increasing the geriatric skills and knowledge of healthcare professionals, and developing geriatric oncology research, have been successfully implemented. However, most developments in geriatric oncology have taken place in high-income countries, and there are still large inequalities in the availability of clinical, educational, and research initiatives across different regions of the world. This article provides an overview of geriatric oncology initiatives in Asia, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Latin America, and the United States and Canada. Understanding the achievements and challenges of geriatric oncology around the world, and fostering international collaboration in research and training are essential for improving the care of all older adults with cancer.

Economic evaluation studies have been used to assess the cost-effectiveness of national health programs, or to propose efficient strategies for health care delivery. Aims of the Study: The current study is intended to test the cost-effectiveness of an Aftercare Service when compared with Treatment-As-Usual for patients with severe mental disorders in Iran. Methods: This study was a parallel group randomized controlled trial. A total of 160 post-discharge eligible patients were randomized into two equal patient groups, Aftercare Service (that includes either Home Visiting Care, or Telephone Follow-up for outpatient treatment) vs Treatment-As-Usual, using stratified balanced block randomization method. All patients were followed for 12 months after discharge. The perspective of the present study was the societal perspective. The outcome measures were the rate of readmission at the hospitals after discharge, psychotic symptoms, manic symptoms, depressive symptoms, illness severity, global functioning, quality of life, and patients' satisfaction with the services. The costs included the intervention costs and the patient and family costs in the evaluation period. Results: There was no significant difference in effectiveness measures between the two groups. The Aftercare Service arm was about 66,000 US$ cheaper than Treatment-As-Usual arm. The average total cost per patient in the Treatment-As-Usual group was about 4651 US$, while it was reduced to 3823 US$ in the Aftercare Service group; equivalent to a cost reduction of about 800 US$ per patient per year. Discussion and Limitations: Given that there was no significant difference in effectiveness measures between the two groups (slightly in favor of the intervention), the Aftercare Service was cost-effective. The most important limitation of the study was the relatively small sample size due to limited budget for the implementation of the study. A larger sample size and longer follow-ups are warranted. Implications for Health Care Provision, Use and Policies: Considering the limited resources and equity concerns for health systems, the importance of making decisions about healthcare interventions based on cost-effectiveness evidence is increasing. Our results suggest that the aftercare service can be recommended as an efficient service delivery mode, especially when psychiatric bed requirements are insufficient for a population. Implications for Further Research: Further research should continue the work done with a larger sample size and longer followups to further establish the cost-effectiveness analysis of an aftercare service program compared with routine conventional care.

Variation in life expectancy and mortality by cause among neighbourhoods in King County, WA, USA, 1990-2014: a census tract-level analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015	LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; POPULATION HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; TRENDS; MIGRATION	Background Health outcomes are known to vary at both the country and local levels, but trends in mortality across a detailed and comprehensive set of causes have not been previously described at a very local level. Life expectancy in King County, WA, USA, is in the 95th percentile among all counties in the USA. However, little is known about how life expectancy and mortality from different causes of death vary at a local, neighbourhood level within this county. In this analysis, we estimated life expectancy and cause-specific mortality within King County to describe spatial trends, quantify disparities in mortality, and assess the contribution of each cause of death to overall disparities in all-cause mortality. Methods We applied established so-called garbage code redistribution algorithms and small area estimation methods to death registration data for King County to estimate life expectancy, cause-specific mortality rates, and years of life lost (YLL) rates from 152 causes of death for 397 census tracts from Jan 1, 1990, to Dec 31, 2014. We used the cause list developed for the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study for this analysis. Deaths were tabulated by age group, sex, census tract, and cause of death. We used Bayesian mixed-effects regression models to estimate mortality overall and from each cause. Findings Between 1990 and 2014, life expectancy in King County increased by 5.4 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5.0-5.7) among men (from 74.0 years [73.7-74.3] to 79.3 years [79.1-79.6]) and by 3.4 years (3.0-3.7) among women (from 80.0 years [79.7-80.2] to 83.3 years [83.1-83.5]). In 2014, life expectancy ranged from 68.4 years (95% UI 66.9-70.1) to 86.7 years (85.0-88.2) for men and from 73.6 years (71.6-75.5) to 88.4 years (86.9-89.9) for women among census tracts within King County. Rates of YLL by cause also varied substantially among census tracts for each cause of death. Geographical areas with relatively high and relatively low YLL rates differed by cause. In general, causes of death responsible for more YLLs overall also contributed more significantly to geographical inequality within King County. However, certain causes contributed more to inequality than to overall YLLs. Interpretation This census tract-level analysis of life expectancy and cause-specific YLL rates highlights important differences in health among neighbourhoods in King County that are masked by county-level estimates. Efforts to improve population health in King County should focus on reducing geographical inequality, by targeting those health conditions that contribute the most to overall YLLs and to inequality. This analysis should be replicated in other locations to more fully describe fine-grained local-level variation in population health and contribute to efforts to improve health while reducing inequalities.

Understanding the relationships among community deprivation, walkability, and health outcomes will provide insights into appropriate land use planning that supports public health promotion. This paper develops a revised Walk Score tool for measuring community walkability in China. Under the original Walk Score methodological framework, (1) 6 principle amenities (19 items) and their weight (utilization frequency) are first selected by expert panel evaluation and questionnaire survey; (2) a tolerance time approach is then employed to determine the decay function, and the walking travel time from community to each amenity is calculated by using the Baidu Map; and (3) three pedestrian characteristic factors (intersection density, block length, and slope) are considered to adjust the score. We apply the proposed methodology to the case of Shenzhen and discover great variations in walkability among the 8117 communities within it. The high high clusters are located in the central blocks, while the low low clusters emerge in the outskirts. Using spatial regression, we observe significant negative associations between community walkability and three health indicators (cardiopathy, hypertension, and liver cancer). It suggests that better health outcomes would be observed in more walkable communities. We further find that children concentrated and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities exhibit lower walkability. These results evidence the significant social inequalities in walkability among the communities of Shenzhen. Path analysis identifies complex linkages among community deprivation, walkability, and public health. For cadiopathy and hypertension, three categories of significant paths are identified: (1) residents in deprived community have worse health outcomes due to lower walkability; (2) poorer health outcomes occur in deprived communities as a result of higher PM2.5 exposure; and (3) less walkable communities are exposed to greater PM2.5 concentration and deprived communities are generally characterized by lower walkability and consequently have worse health outcomes. We argue that social inequalities in walkability should attract the attention of land use planners. In order to address this pressing issue, three areas should be given priorities in future land use planning: (1) adopting urban form-based zoning schemes; (2) economic inputs for streetscape improvements; and (3) formulating affordable and low-renting housing policies. Findings of this case should generate more generalized knowledge that enhances public health promotion within the land use planning context.

The prevalence of stroke in women is predicted to rise rapidly, owing to the increasing average age of the global female population. Vascular risk factors differ between women and men in terms of prevalence, and evidence increasingly supports the clinical importance of sex differences in stroke. The influence of some risk factors for stroke - including diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation - are stronger in women, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy also affect the risk of stroke decades after pregnancy. However, in an era of evidence-based medicine, women are notably under-represented in clinical trials - despite governmental actions highlighting the need to include both men and women in clinical trials - resulting in a reduced generalizability of study results to women. The aim of this Review is to highlight new insights into specificities of stroke in women, to plan future research priorities, and to influence public health policies to decrease the worldwide burden of stroke in women.

J	Hobson, C				Hobson, Christopher			Democratic Peace: Progress and Crisis	PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS			English	Article							LIBERAL DEMOCRACY; INEQUALITY; POLITICS; TURNOUT	When work on the democratic peace first emerged it contributed to the revitalization of liberal thought and represented an important contribution to International Relations (IR). Yet innovation has been replaced by stagnation. Coding and correlation are debated ad infinitum, while little attention is given to growing economic inequality, voter alienation, a decline in traditional parties, rising populism and a wide array of related trends that raise serious doubts about the health of democracies at the center of the zone of peace. Yet if democratic institutions are not functioning as they are meant to, and norms of compromise are disappearing domestically, what hope can there be that these will facilitate cooperative behavior between democracies? Rather than promoting peace, could it be that capitalism in its contemporary neoliberal form is undermining or hollowing out democracy? The static understanding of democracy adopted by this research means that such questions have been largely overlooked. In response, I focus on two major changes impacting established democracies and consider their significance for democratic peace arguments: the decline of democratic institutions and culture, as well as how neoliberalism is reshaping the relationship between democracy and capitalism. In developing this argument, I propose that the template that the democratic peace research program offers for studying the world is emblematic of-and contributing to-a troubling contracting of our political vision. An excessive concern with methodological rigor, combined with a narrow understanding of what qualifies as valid research, has resulted in a body of scholarship that is remarkably sophisticated but has surprisingly little to say about democracy and its place in the world.

Health-Related Resource-Use Measurement Instruments for Intersectoral Costs and Benefits in the Education and Criminal Justice Sectors	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Review							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; ECONOMIC EVALUATIONS; INFORMAL CARE; PRODUCTIVITY COSTS; IMPACT; IDENTIFICATION; INTERVENTIONS; VALIDATION; COLLECTION; INCLUSION	Background Intersectoral costs and benefits (ICBs), i.e. costs and benefits of healthcare interventions outside the healthcare sector, can be a crucial component in economic evaluations from the societal perspective. Pivotal to their estimation is the existence of sound resource-use measurement (RUM) instruments; however, RUM instruments for ICBs in the education or criminal justice sectors have not yet been systematically collated or their psychometric quality assessed. This review aims to fill this gap. Methods To identify relevant instruments, the Database of Instruments for Resource Use Measurement (DIRUM) was searched. Additionally, a systematic literature review was conducted in seven electronic databases to detect instruments containing ICB items used in economic evaluations. Finally, studies evaluating the psychometric quality of these instruments were searched. Results Twenty-six unique instruments were included. Most frequently, ICB items measured school absenteeism, tutoring, classroom assistance or contacts with legal representatives, police custody/prison detainment and court appearances, with the highest number of items listed in the Client Service Receipt Inventory/Client Sociodemographic and Service Receipt Inventory/Client Service Receipt Inventory-Children's Version (CSRI/CSSRI/CSRI-C), Studying the Scope of Parental Expenditures (SCOPE) and Self-Harm Intervention, Family Therapy (SHIFT) instruments. ICBs in the education sector were especially relevant for age-related developmental disorders and chronic diseases, while criminal justice resource use seems more important in mental health, including alcohol-related disorders or substance abuse. Evidence on the validity or reliability of ICB items was published for two instruments only. Conclusion With a heterogeneous variety of ICBs found to be relevant for several disease areas but many ICB instruments applied in one study only (21/26 instruments), setting-up an international task force to, for example, develop an internationally adaptable instrument is recommended.

Evidence of associations between income and HRQOL among patients with prostate cancer (PCa) is sparse and their explanations still remain unclear. 246 males of two German hospitals filled out a questionnaire at the time of acute treatment, 6 and 12 months later. Age, partnership status, baseline disease and treatment factors, physical and psychological comorbidities, as well as treatment factors and adverse effects at follow-up were additionally included in the analyses to explain potential disparities. HRQOL was assessed with the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30 core questionnaire and the prostate-specific QLQ-PR25. A linear mixed model for repeated measures was calculated. The fixed effects showed highly significant income-related inequalities regarding the majority of HRQOL scales. Less affluent PCa patients reported lower HRQOL in terms of global quality of life, all functional scales and urinary symptoms. After introducing relevant covariates, some associations became insignificant (physical, cognitive and sexual function), while others only showed reduced estimates (global quality of life, urinary symptoms, role, emotional and social function). In particular, mental disorders/psychological comorbidity played a relevant role in the explanation of income-related disparities. One year after surgery, income-related disparities in various dimensions of HRQOL persist. With respect to economically disadvantaged PCa patients, the findings emphasize the importance of continuous psychosocial screening and tailored interventions, of patients' empowerment and improved access to supportive care.

Cross-sectional cross-country instrumental variable analysis	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Willingness to pay taxes; Public healthcare; Health policy; Generalized trust; Interpersonal trust; Social capital	INCOME INEQUALITY; SATISFACTION; SYSTEMS; DIVERSITY; SUPPORT; WELFARE; STATE; LIFE	The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of social trust on the willingness to pay more taxes to improve public healthcare in post -communist countries. The well-documented association between higher levels of social trust and better health has traditionally been assumed to reflect the notion that social trust is positively associated with support for public healthcare system through its encouragement of cooperative behaviour, social cohesion, social solidarity, and collective action. Hence, in this paper, we have explicitly tested the notion that social trust contributes to an increase in willingness to financially support public healthcare. We use micro data from the 2010 Life-in-Transition survey (N = 29,526). Classic binomial probit and instrumental variables ivprobit regressions are estimated to model the relationship between social trust and paying more taxes to improve public healthcare. We found that an increase in social trust is associated with a greater willingness to pay more taxes to improve public healthcare. From the perspective of policy-making, healthcare administrators, policy-makers, and international donors should be aware that social trust is an important factor in determining the willingness of the population to provide much-needed financial resources to supporting public healthcare. From a theoretical perspective, we found that estimating the effect of trust on support for healthcare without taking confounding and measurement error problems into consideration will likely lead to an underestimation of the true effect of trust.

This paper draws on our theory-driven interdisciplinary studies in the built environment to analyse the outcomes and possible policy pathways to address fuel poverty. Insights are drawn from our own fuel poverty research using community-based mixed methods research to explore both the outcomes of interventions and the behaviour of people in indoor environments. Finally, we suggest future directions for mixed methods policy-focused fuel poverty research to leverage growing national and international political interest and policy recognition of the problem.

Comprehensive review of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of community-based primary health care in improving maternal, neonatal and child health: 1. rationale, methods and database description	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Review							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ALMA-ATA; INTERVENTIONS; MORTALITY; NEWBORN; PREVENT; DEATHS	Background Community-based primary health care (CBPHC) is an approach used by health programs to extend preventive and curative health services beyond health facilities into communities and even down to households. Evidence of the effectiveness of CBPHC in improving maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH) has been summarized by others, but our review gives gives particular attention to not only the effectiveness of specific interventions but also their delivery strategies at the community level along with their equity effects. This is the first article in a series that summarizes and analyzes the assessments of programs, projects, and research studies (referred to collectively as projects) that used CBPHC to improve MNCH in low-and middle-income countries. The review addresses the following questions: (1) What kinds of projects were implemented? (2) What were the outcomes of these projects? (3) What kinds of implementation strategies were used? (4) What are the implications of these findings? Methods 12 166 reports were identified through a search of articles in the National Library of Medicine database (PubMed). In addition, reports in the gray literature (available online but not published in a peer-reviewed journal) were also reviewed. Reports that describe the implementation of one or more community-based interventions or an integrated project in which an assessment of the effectiveness of the project was carried out qualified for inclusion in the review. Outcome measures that qualified for inclusion in the review were population-based indicators that defined some aspect of health status: changes in population coverage of evidence-based interventions or changes in serious morbidity, in nutritional status, or in mortality. Results 700 assessments qualified for inclusion in the review. Two independent reviewers completed a data extraction form for each assessment. A third reviewer compared the two data extraction forms and resolved any differences. The maternal interventions assessed concerned education about warning signs of pregnancy and safe delivery; promotion and/or provision of antenatal care; promotion and/or provision of safe delivery by a trained birth attendant, screening and treatment for HIV infection and other maternal infections; family planning, and; HIV prevention and treatment. The neonatal and child health interventions that were assessed concerned promotion or provision of good nutrition and immunizations; promotion of healthy household behaviors and appropriate utilization of health services, diagnosis and treatment of acute neonatal and child illness; and provision and/or promotion of safe water, sanitation and hygiene. Two-thirds of assessments (63.0%) were for projects implementing three or fewer interventions in relatively small populations for relatively brief periods; half of the assessments involved fewer than 5000 women or children, and 62.9% of the assessments were for projects lasting less than 3 years. One-quarter (26.6%) of the projects were from three countries in South Asia: India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The number of reports has grown markedly during the past decade. A small number of funders supported most of the assessments, led by the United States Agency for International Development. The reviewers judged the methodology for 90% of the assessments to be adequate. Conclusions The evidence regarding the effectiveness of community-based interventions to improve the health of mothers, neonates, and children younger than 5 years of age is growing rapidly. The database created for this review serves as the basis for a series of articles that follow this one on the effectiveness of CBPHC in improving MNCH published in the Journal of Global Health. These findings, guide this review, that are included as the last paper in this series, will help to provide the rationale for building stronger community-based platforms for delivering evidence-based interventions in high-mortality, resource-constrained settings.

Prioritizing research for integrated implementation of early childhood development and maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and nutrition platforms	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							SETTING PRIORITIES; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; RESEARCH INVESTMENTS; INTERVENTIONS; UNDERNUTRITION; COUNTRIES; INCOME	Background Existing health and nutrition services present potential platforms for scaling up delivery of early childhood development (ECD) interventions within sensitive windows across the life course, especially in the first 1000 days from conception to age 2 years. However, there is insufficient knowledge on how to optimize implementation for such strategies in an integrated manner. In light of this knowledge gap, we aimed to systematically identify a set of integrated implementation research priorities for health, nutrition and early child development within the 2015 to 2030 timeframe of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Methods We applied the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative method, and consulted a diverse group of global health experts to develop and score 57 research questions against five criteria: answerability, effectiveness, deliverability, impact, and effect on equity. These questions were ranked using a research priority score, and the average expert agreement score was calculated for each question. Findings The research priority scores ranged from 61.01 to 93.52, with a median of 82.87. The average expert agreement scores ranged from 0.50 to 0.90, with a median of 0.75. The top-ranked research question were: i) "How can interventions and packages to reduce neonatal mortality be expanded to include ECD and stimulation interventions?"; ii) "How does the integration of ECD and MNCAH&N interventions affect human resource requirements and capacity development in resource-poor settings?"; and iii) "How can integrated interventions be tailored to vulnerable refugee and migrant populations to protect against poor ECD and MNCAH&N outcomes?". Most highly-ranked research priorities varied across the life course and highlighted key aspects of scaling up coverage of integrated interventions in resource-limited settings, including: workforce and capacity development, cost-effectiveness and strategies to reduce financial barriers, and quality assessment of programs. Conclusions Investing in ECD is critical to achieving several of the SDGs, including SDG 2 on ending all forms of malnutrition, SDG 3 on ensuring health and well-being for all, and SDG 4 on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promotion of life-long learning opportunities for all. The generated research agenda is expected to drive action and investment on priority approaches to integrating ECD interventions within existing health and nutrition services.

J	Williams, JS; Norström, F; Ng, N				Williams, Jennifer Stewart; Norstrom, Fredrik; Ng, Nawi			Disability and ageing in China and India - decomposing the effects of gender and residence. Results from the WHO study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE)	BMC GERIATRICS			English	Article						Inequalities; Residence; Rural; Developing countries; Oaxaca-Blinder; Decomposition	LOW-INCOME; INEQUALITY; POPULATIONS; COUNTRIES; EDUCATION; WOMEN; LIFE; MEN	Background: China and India are the world's two most populous countries. Although their populations are growing in number and life expectancies are extending they have different trajectories of economic growth, epidemiological transition and social change. Cross-country comparisons can allow national and global insights and provide evidence for policy and decision-making. The aim of this study is to measure and compare disability in men and women, and in urban and rural dwellers in China and India, and assess the extent to which social and other factors contribute to the inequalities. Methods: National samples of adults aged 50 to 79 years in China (n = 11,694) and India (n = 6187) from the World Health Organization (WHO) longitudinal Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 1 were analysed. Stratified multiple linear regressions were undertaken to assess disability differences by sex and residence, controlling for other biological and socioeconomic determinants of disability. Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition partitioned the two-group inequalities into explained and unexplained components. Results: In both countries women and rural residents reported more disability. In India, the gender inequality is attributed to the distribution of the determinants (employment, education and chronic conditions) but in China about half the inequality is attributed to the same. In India, more than half of the urban rural inequality is attributed to the distribution of the determinants (education, household wealth) compared with under 20% in China. Conclusions: Education and employment were important drivers of these measured inequalities. Overall inequalities in disability among older adults in China and India were shaped by gender and residence, suggesting the need for policies that target women and rural residents. There is a need for further research, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, to question and challenge entrenched practices and institutions and grasp the implications of global economic and social changes that are impacting on population health and ageing in China and India.

Nevertheless, there is a gap between global rhetoric of human rights and ongoing health reform efforts. This debate article seeks to fill part of that gap by setting out principles of human rights-based approaches (HRBAs), and then applying those principles to questions that countries undertaking efforts toward UHC and promoting women's, children's and adolescents' health, will need to face, focusing in particular on ensuring enabling legal and policy frameworks, establishing fair financing; priority-setting processes, and meaningful oversight and accountability mechanisms. In a region where democratic institutions are notoriously weak, we argue that the explicit application of a meaningful human rights framework could enhance equity, participation and accountability, and in turn the democratic legitimacy of health reform initiatives being undertaken in the region.

Biometeorology for cities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Urban; Climate; Weather; Ecology; Health; Comfort	OUTDOOR THERMAL COMFORT; LOCAL CLIMATE ZONES; URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; BIOCLIMATIC CONDITIONS; TEMPERATURE; MORTALITY; CITY; PHENOLOGY; TRENDS; SUMMER	Improvements in global sustainability, health, and equity will largely be determined by the extent to which cities are able to become more efficient, hospitable, and productive places. The development and evolution of urban areas has a significant impact on local and regional weather and climate, which subsequently affect people and other organisms that live in and near cities. Biometeorologists, researchers who study the impact of weather and climate on living creatures, are well positioned to help evaluate and anticipate the consequences of urbanization on the biosphere. Motivated by the 60th anniversary of the International Society of Biometeorology, we reviewed articles published in the Society's International Journal of Biometeorology over the period 1974-2017 to understand if and how biometeorologists have directed attention to urban areas. We found that interest in urban areas has rapidly accelerated; urban-oriented articles accounted for more than 20% of all articles published in the journal in the most recent decade. Urban-focused articles in the journal span five themes: measuring urban climate, theoretical foundations and models, human thermal comfort, human morbidity and mortality, and ecosystem impacts. Within these themes, articles published in the journal represent a sizeable share of the total academic literature. More explicit attention from urban biometeorologists publishing in the journal to low- and middle-income countries, indoor environments, animals, and the impacts of climate change on human health would help ensure that the distinctive perspectives of biometeorology reach the places, people, and processes that are the foci of global sustainability, health, and equity goals.

The Social Patterning of Hypertension in Six Low- and Middle-Income Countries	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						health; hypertension; equity; older people; policy	NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES; RISK-FACTORS; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; GLOBAL BURDEN; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; PREVENTION; MORTALITY; INEQUALITIES; ASSOCIATION	This paper identifies a general perception among development policymakers that health conditions such as hypertension and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) disproportionately affect privileged socioeconomic groups. The paper argues that this framing of the issue is derived more from established discourses and institutional dynamics than from evidence. The paper then assesses the validity of this view, with reference to the social patterning of hypertension in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation and South Africa. Using data for adults aged 50+ from the WHO Survey of Ageing and Adult Health, it finds the social patterning of hypertension prevalence varies markedly between the study countries, but that hypertension awareness and control rates are generally lower for less-advantaged groups. This reveals a need to challenge misleading representations of NCD pandemics and for interventions that specifically target the poor.

A paradigm shift for socioeconomic justice and health: from focusing on inequalities to aiming at sustainable equity	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health equity; Benchmarking; International cooperation; Life expectancy; Sustainability; Gross domestic product	AID	Objectives: To measure the 'best possible health for all', incorporating sustainability, and to establish the magnitude of global health inequity. Study design: Observational, retrospective. Methods: We identified countries with three criteria: (1) a healthy population-life expectancy above world average; (2) living conditions feasible to replicate worldwide-per-capita gross domestic product (GDP-pc) below the world average; and (3) sustainability-per-capita carbon dioxide emissions lower than the planetary pollution boundary. Using these healthy, feasible, and sustainable (HFS) countries as the gold standard, we estimated the burden of global health inequity (BGHiE) in terms of excess deaths, analyzing time-trends (1950-2012) by age, sex, and geographic location. Finally, we defined a global income 'equity zone' and quantified the economic gap needed to achieve global sustainable health equity. Results: A total of 14 countries worldwide met the HFS criteria. Since 1970, there has been a BGHiE of similar to 17 million avoidable deaths per year (similar to 40% of all deaths), with 36 life-years-lost per excess death. Young children and women bore a higher BGHiE, and, in recent years, the highest proportion of avoidable deaths occurred in Africa, India, and the Russian Federation. By 2012, the most efficient HFS countries had a GDP-pc/year of USD$2,165, which we proposed as the lower equity zone threshold. The estimated USD$2.58 trillion economic gap represents 3.6% of the world's GDP twenty times larger than current total global foreign aid. Conclusions: Sustainable health equity metrics provide a benchmark tool to guide efforts toward transforming overall living conditions, as a means to achieve the 'best possible health for all.'

Despite numerous national frameworks and agenda-setting documents to coordinate prevention efforts, Australia, like many countries internationally, is yet to substantively impact the burden from chronic disease. Improved evidence on effective strategies for the prevention of chronic disease is required. This research sought to articulate a priority set of important and feasible action domains to inform future discussion and debate regarding priority areas for chronic disease prevention policy and strategy. Methods: Using concept mapping, a mixed-methods approach to making use of the best available tacit knowledge of recognised, diverse and well-experienced actors, and national actions to improve the prevention of chronic disease in Australia were identified and then mapped. Participants (ranging from 58 to 78 in the various stages of the research) included a national sample of academics, policymakers and practitioners. Data collection involved the generation and sorting of statements by participants. A series of visual representations of the data were then developed. Results: A total of 95 statements were distilled into 12 clusters for action, namely Inter-Sectoral Partnerships; Systems Perspective/Action; Governance; Roles and Responsibilities; Evidence, Feedback and Learning; Funding and Incentive; Creating Demand; Primary Prevention; Social Determinants and Equity; Healthy Environments; Food and Nutrition; and Regulation and Policy. Specific areas for more immediate national action included refocusing the health system to prevention over cure, raising the profile of public health with health decision-makers, funding policy- and practice-relevant research, improving communication about prevention, learning from both global best-practice and domestic successes and failures, increasing the focus on primary prevention, and developing a long-term prevention strategy with an explicit funding commitment. Conclusions: Preventing chronic diseases and their risk factors will require at-scale, multi-component, multi-stakeholder action and cooperation. The concept mapping procedures used in this research have enabled the synthesis of views across different stakeholders, bringing both divergent and convergent perspectives to light, and collectively creating signals for where to prioritise national action. Previous national strategies for chronic disease prevention have not collated the tacit knowledge of diverse actors in the prevention of chronic disease in this structured way.

Mapping healthcare systems: a policy relevant analytic tool	INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						Health financing; Health policy; Health systems; Health systems frameworks; Health systems research	COVERAGE; SECTOR; EXPENDITURE; EQUITY; INDIA	Background: In the past decade, an international consensus on the value of well-functioning systems has driven considerable health systems research. This research falls into two broad categories. The first provides conceptual frameworks that take complex healthcare systems and create simplified constructs of interactions and functions. The second focuses on granular inputs and outputs. This paper presents a novel translational mapping tool - the University of California, San Francisco mapping tool (the Tool) - which bridges the gap between these two areas of research, creating a platform for multi-country comparative analysis. Methods: Using the Murray-Frenk framework, we create a macro-level representation of a country's structure, focusing on how it finances and delivers healthcare. The map visually depicts the fundamental policy questions in healthcare system design: funding sources and amount spent through each source, purchasers, populations covered, provider categories; and the relationship between these entities. Results: We use the Tool to provide a macro-level comparative analysis of the structure of India's and Thailand's healthcare systems. Conclusions: As part of the systems strengthening arsenal, the Tool can stimulate debate about the merits and consequences of different healthcare systems structural designs, using a common framework that fosters multi-country comparative analyses.

Taiwan suffered its own share: a rise in unemployment and a severe decline in gross domestic product. This study is to address the health consequences of this crisis on different socioeconomic populations in Taiwan. Methods: A sample of 6,225,766 men and 5,417,651 women, was obtained and their admissions data over 2007-2012 were retrieved. Stratified into three income levels, the sample was examined on the 147,921 episodes of hospitalization due to depressive illnesses (DIs) over that period by an interrupted time series analysis for monthly incidence rates of DI hospitalizations Results: The adjusted incidence rates of hospitalization (AIRH) for DIs among the low income were 10 times that of the high income group. The AIRHs were generally higher in all of three female income groups than they were in the three male income groups. The low income men and women showed increases (of 18.0% and 14.2%, respectively) beginning in April 2008 that sustained for two years. The high income women exhibited a 5.0% monthly rise in the rate of DI hospitalizations. Limitations: Our time series models can control some confounding factors, but the ecological fallacy remained. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the economic recession resulted in increased rates of DI hospitalization in Taiwan, especially among the low income population. Women of higher incomes may have suffered a more enduring impact.

Persistent inequity in maternal health care utilization in Nepal despite impressive overall gains	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						Equity; maternal health care; delivery care utilization; antenatal care; Nepal	NEWBORN HEALTH; MORTALITY; DELIVERY; SERVICES; COVERAGE; QUALITY; EQUITY; TRENDS	Background: Maternal health care utilization is at the core of global public health provision and an area of focus in the now-concluded Millennium Development Goal agenda. Objective: This study aims to examine trends in maternal health care utilization over the last 15 years in Nepal, focusing on coverage and equity. Methods: This paper used data from the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) 2001, 2006 and 2011 and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), 2014. Coverage rates were calculated and logistic regression models used to examine inequity. Results: Impressive gains were found in antenatal care (ANC) attendance, which increased from nearly half of women attending (49%) in 2001 to 88% in 2014, and the rate of facility delivery increased from just 7-44%. This development did not, however, influence the equity gap in ANC and skilled attendance at birth, as women from low socioeconomic backgrounds were six times more likely to deliver without skilled assistance than those from high socioeconomic backgrounds (AdjOR 6.38 CI 95% 4.57-8.90) in 2014. Conclusion: These persistent equity gaps call for targeted interventions focusing on the most disadvantaged and vulnerable women in order to achieve the new Sustainable Development Goal of universal health coverage.

Ethical, legal and societal considerations on Zika virus epidemics complications in scaling-up prevention and control strategies	PHILOSOPHY ETHICS AND HUMANITIES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Zika virus; Epidemics; Ethical; Legal; Abortion; Mental; Reproductive; Programs	GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; PUBLIC-HEALTH; INFECTION; HISTORY; US	Much of the fear and uncertainty around Zika epidemics stem from potential association between Zika virus (ZIKV) complications on infected pregnant women and risk of their babies being born with microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities. However, much remains unknown about its mode of transmission, diagnosis and long-term pathogenesis. Worries of these unknowns necessitate the need for effective and efficient psychosocial programs and medical-legal strategies to alleviate and mitigate ZIKV related burdens. In this light, local and global efforts in maintaining fundamental health principles of moral, medical and legal decision-making policies, and interventions to preserve and promote individual and collectiveHuman Rights, autonomy, protection of the most vulnerable, equity, dignity, integrity and beneficence that should not be confused and relegated by compassionate humanitarian assistance and support. This paper explores the potential medical and ethical-legal implications of ZIKV epidemics emergency response packages and strategies alongside optimizing reproductive and mental health policies, programs and best practice measures. Further long-term cross-borders operational research is required in elucidating Zika-related population-based epidemiology, ethical-medical and societal implications in guiding evidence-based local and global ZIKV maternal-child health complications related approaches and interventions. Core programs and interventions including future Zika safe and effective vaccines for global Zika immunization program in most vulnerable and affected countries and worldwide should be prioritized.

While some castigate MT as promoting healthcare inequity, others endorse it as a revenue generator, promising local healthcare system strengthening. Currently, however, the understanding of this component of healthcare in Africa is inadequate. This study seeks to determine the level of knowledge on the role, structure and effect of MT in Africa as it relates to healthcare systems in the region. Methods Conduct a systematic scoping review to outline the role, structure and effect of MT in Africa. Databases: Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete. Studies mapped in two stages: (1) mapping the studies based on the relevance of their titles and subject descriptors; (2) applying further inclusion criteria on studies from stage 1. Two reviewers will independently assess study quality and abstract data. Both quantitative and qualitative data analysis will be performed, using STATA V. 13 and NVIVO, respectively. Ethics and dissemination The study results will be disseminated by publication in peer-reviewed journals and findings presented at academic and industry conferences related to MT, public health, health systems strengthening and tourism. Discussion MT spurs cutting-edge medical technologies, techniques and best practices in healthcare delivery. The two-tier healthcare landscape in Africa, however, presents an exceptionally unique context in which to situate this study. Much has been written about MT globally, but not much is known about the phenomenon in Africa; hence the appropriateness of this scientific assessment of MT in the region. By elucidating the role, structure and effect of this phenomenon, this study hopes to contribute to health systems strengthening in Africa.

We conducted a dialogue between the LASM/CH proposal called social determination of health (in particular one of its nuclear categories ways of living together') and studies that address social inequalities and oral health. This dialogue allowed us to redefine oral health-disease-treatment as a process that either promotes or harms well-being and is modulated by different ways of living together where not only patients and professionals, but also governments, supranational bodies, and national and international markets represented by food, pharmaceutical, insurance, personal care, and cosmetic companies interact. The article proposes the cycle particular-consumption care/institutional-consumption care as the construct that allows investigators to think about how ways of living together relate to oral health inequalities. Particular-consumption care' includes ways and possibilities to access healthy foods and practice protective hygienic measures. Institutional-consumption care' refers to institutional responses related to supply, access to services, capabilities for resolution, and pedagogical practices.

Emancipatory Nursing Praxis A Theory of Social Justice in Nursing	ADVANCES IN NURSING SCIENCE			English	Article						ally; disparity; inequity; nursing praxis; nursing theory; privilege; social justice	POLITICS; PATIENT; HEALTH; MODEL	Emancipatory nursing praxis (ENP) is a middle-range nursing theory of social justice developed from an international, grounded theory study of the critical factors influencing nurses' perceptions of their role in social justice. The ENPs implementing processes (becoming, awakening, engaging, and transforming) and 2 conditional contexts (relational and reflexive) provide an in-depth understanding of the transformative learning process that determines nurse engagement in social justice. Interpretive findings include the voice of Privilege primarily informed ENP theory, the lack of nursing educational and organizational support in social justice role development, and the advocate role should expand to include the role of an ally.

J	Duncombe, R				Duncombe, Rohena			What systems participants know about access and service entry and why managers should listen	AUSTRALIAN HEALTH REVIEW			English	Article						health equity; inclusion; participatory design; social determinants of health	HEALTH-CARE; PATHWAYS; HELP; PERSPECTIVES; BARRIERS; DRUG	Objective The present study looked at the views of people directly involved in the entry process for community health counselling using the frame of the health access literature. The concurrence of system participants' views with the access literature highlights access issues, particularly for people who are vulnerable or disadvantaged. The paper privileges the voices of the system participants, inviting local health services to consider using participatory design to improve access at the entry point. Methods People involved in the entry process for community health counselling explored the question, What, for you, are the features of a good intake system?' They also commented on themes identified during pilot interviews. These were thematically analysed for each participant group by the researcher to develop a voice for each stakeholder group. Results People accessing the service could be vulnerable and the entry process failed to take that into account. People directly involved in the counselling service entry system, system participants, consisted of: professionals referring in, people seeking services and reception staff taking first enquiries. They shared substantially the same concerns as each other. The responses from these system participants are consistent with the international literature on access and entry into health services. Conclusion Participatory service design could improve primary healthcare service entry at the local level. Canvassing the experiences of system participants is important for delivering services to those who have the least access and, in that way, could contribute to health equity.

However, drinking patterns and associated factors remain under-investigated, especially among low socioeconomic groups such as street laborers. Objective: Using the social cognitive model as a framework for the study we aimed to identify factors associated with risky alcohol consumption. Methods: In a cross-sectional study using structured questionnaires, 450 male street laborers searching for casual works in Hanoi, Vietnam were interviewed. A logistic regression was applied in order to detect predictors of risky alcohol drinking. Results: During the last month, 45% of the participants reported daily consumption while the other 55% consumed weekly or less. Among the drinkers (416 out of 450, 92%), 27% were identified as high-risk drinkers who reported more than 14 standard drinks per week, while only 8% were lifetime abstainers. The multivariable logistic regression showed that older age, higher income were positively associated with a higher likelihood of drinking alcohol, while high school level negatively. The environmental predictor was the higher level of peer connection. The association between drinking and risky behavior was found positive with regards to the number of sexual partners. Conclusions: The study suggests that male street laborers are vulnerable to health risks. Decision makers should note that a significant proportion of this target group exceeds the guidelines for alcohol use and this should be included in future interventions or further research. A multisectoral approach together with an important strategy of education is needed to control alcohol use.

While mortality is used to guide public health policies and is considered as a synthetic measure of population health, few studies deals with the contextual features potentially associated with mortality in a representative sample of an entire country. This paper investigates the possible role of area deprivation (FDep99) and travel time to health care on French cause-specific mortality in a proper multilevel setting. Methods: The study population was a 1% sample representative of the French population aged from 30 to 79 years in 1990 and followed up until 2007. A frailty Cox model was used to measure individual, contextual effects and spatial variances for several causes of death. The chosen contextual scale was the Zone d'Emploi of 1994 (348 units) which delimits the daily commute of people. The geographical accessibility to health care score was constructed with principal component analysis, using 40 variables of hospital specialties and health practitioners' travel time. Results: The outcomes highlight a positive and significant association between area deprivation and mortality for all causes (HR = 1.24), cancers, cerebrovascular diseases, ischemic heart diseases, and preventable and amenable diseases (HR from 1.14 to 1.29). These contextual associations exhibit no substantial differences by sex except for premature ischemic heart diseases mortality which was much greater in women. Unexpectedly, mortality decreased as the time to reach health care resources increased. Only geographical disparities in cerebrovascular and ischemic heart diseases mortality were explained by compositional and contextual effects. Discussion: The findings suggest the presence of confounding factors in the association between mortality and travel time to health care, possibly owing to population density and health-selected migration. Although the spatial scale considered to define the context of residence was relatively large, the associations with area deprivation were strong in comparison to the existing literature and significant for almost all the causes of deaths investigated. Conclusion: The broad spectrum of diseases associated with area deprivation and individual education support the idea of a need for a global health policy targeting both individual and territories to reduce social and socio-spatial inequalities.

Unexplained heterogeneity in the persistence and development of toxicities, as well as an incomplete understanding of their mechanisms, have generated a growing need for the identification of predictive pharmacogenomic markers. Early studies addressing this need used a candidate gene approach; however, over the last decade, unbiased and comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided markers of phenotypic risk and potential targets to explore the mechanistic and regulatory pathways of biological functions associated with chemotherapeutic toxicity. In this review, we provide the current status of GWAS of chemotherapeutic toxicities with an emphasis on examining the ancestral diversity of the representative cohorts within these studies. Persistent calls to incorporate both ancestrally diverse and/or admixed populations into genomic efforts resulted in a recent rise in the number of studies utilizing cohorts of East Asian descent; however, few pharmacogenomic studies to date include cohorts of African, Indigenous American, Southwest Asian, and admixed populations. Through comprehensively evaluating sample size, composition by ancestry, genome-wide significant variants, and population-specific minor allele frequencies as reported by HapMap/dbSNP using NCBI PubMed and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, we illustrate how allele frequencies and effect sizes tend to vary among individuals of differing ancestries. In an era of personalized medicine, the lack of diversity in genome-wide studies of anticancer agent toxicity may contribute to the health disparity gap. (C) 2017 AACR.

Associations between dental care coverage from public health budgets or social insurance, and income-related inequalities in perceived access to dental care, are analysed. Methods: Survey data 2008-2013 from 23 countries were combined with country data on macro-economic conditions and coverage for dental care. Foregone dental care was defined as self-reported abstentions from needed dental care because of costs or other crisis-related reasons. Age-standardized percentages reporting foregone dental care were estimated for respondents, age 20-74, in the lowest and highest income quartile. Associations between dental care coverage and income inequalities in foregone dental care, adjusted for macro-economic indicators, were examined by country-level regression models. Results: In all 23 countries, respondents in the lowest income quartile reported significantly higher levels of foregone dental care than respondents in the highest quartile. During 2008-2013, income inequalities in foregone dental care widened significantly in 13 of 23 countries, but decreased in only three countries. Adjusted for countries' macro-economic situation and severity of the economic crisis, higher dental care coverage was significantly associated with smaller income inequalities in foregone dental care and less widening of these inequalities. Conclusions: Income-related inequalities in dental care have widened in Europe during the years with global economic crisis. Higher dental care coverage corresponded to less income-related inequalities in foregone dental care and less widening of these inequalities.

Identifying populations at risk and the upstream determinants of homicide are important for addressing inequalities that hinder population health. This population-based study investigates the public health significance of homicides in Ontario, Canada, over the period of 1999-2012. We quantified the relative burden of homicides by comparing the socioeconomic gradient in homicides with the leading causes of death, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neoplasm, and estimated the potential years of life lost (PYLL) due to homicide. Methods: We linked vital statistics from the Office of the Registrar General Deaths register (ORG-D) with Census and administrative data for all Ontario residents. We extracted all homicide, neoplasm, and cardiovascular deaths from 1999 to 2012, using International Classification of Diseases codes. For socioeconomic status (SES), we used two dimensions of the Ontario Marginalization Index (ON-Marg): material deprivation and residential instability. Trends were summarized across deprivation indices using age-specific rates, rate ratios, and PYLL. Results: Young males, 15-29 years old, were the main victims of homicide with a rate of 3.85 [IC 95%: 3.56; 4.13] per 100,000 population and experienced an upward trend over the study period. The socioeconomic neighbourhood gradient was substantial and higher than the gradient for both cardiovascular and neoplasms. Finally, the PYLL due to homicide were 63,512 and 24,066 years for males and females, respectively. Conclusions: Homicides are an important cause of death among young males, and populations living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Our findings raise concerns about the burden of homicides in the Canadian population and the importance of addressing social determinants to address these premature deaths.

However, international medical graduates (IMGs) have experienced difficulties in accessing postgraduate training and in progressing their careers in several destination countries. Ireland is highly dependent on IMGs, but also employs non-European Union (EU) doctors who qualified as doctors in Ireland. However, little is known regarding the career progression of these doctors. In this context, the present study assesses the determinants of career progression of non-EU doctors with particular focus on whether barriers to progression exist for those graduating outside Ireland compared to those who have graduated within. Methods: The study utilises quantitative data from an online survey of non-EU doctors registered with the Medical Council of Ireland undertaken as part of the Doctor Migration Project (2011-2013). Non-EU doctors registered with the Medical Council of Ireland were asked to complete an online survey about their recruitment, training and career experiences in Ireland. Analysis was conducted on the responses of 231 non-EU hospital doctors whose first post in Ireland was not permanent. Career progression was analysed by means of binary logistic regression analysis. Results: While some of the IMGs had succeeded in accessing specialist training, many experienced slow or stagnant career progression when compared with Irish-trained non-EU doctors. Key predictors of career progression for non-EU doctors working in Ireland showed that doctors who qualified outside of Ireland were less likely than Irish-trained non-EU doctors to experience career progression. Length of stay as a qualified doctor in Ireland was strongly associated with career progression. Those working in anaesthesia were significantly more likely to experience career progression than those in other specialities. Conclusions: The present study highlights differences in terms of achieving career progression and training for Irish-trained non-EU doctors, compared to those trained elsewhere. However, the findings herein warrant further attention from a workforce planning and policy development perspective regarding Ireland's obligations under the Global Code of hiring, promoting and remunerating migrant health personnel on the basis of equality of treatment with the domestically-trained health workforce.

Therefore, we carried out a retrospective international multicentre study including 126 patients to assess outcomes and to reliably quantify the incidence of implant-related and growth-plate related adverse events (AEs). Correction was achieved in 66% of varus valgus deformities and in 59% of limb-length discrepancies and maintained in 85%. Twenty (18%) patients experienced 43 AEs, which were primarily screw-related. The AE rate of the Eight Plate is low; however, many of them could be avoided through tighter monitoring. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Farchi, S; De Sario, M; Lapucci, E; Davoli, M; Michelozzi, P				Farchi, Sara; De Sario, Manuela; Lapucci, Enrica; Davoli, Marina; Michelozzi, Paola			Meat consumption reduction in Italian regions: Health co-benefits and decreases in GHG emissions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CANCER-RISK; RED; MITIGATION; NUTRITION; MORTALITY; DISEASE; IMPACT; FISH; DIET	Introduction Animal agriculture has exponentially grown in recent decades in response to the rise in global demand for meat, even in countries like Italy that traditionally eat a Mediterranean, plant-based diet. Globalization related dietary changes are contributing to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases and to the global climate crisis, and are associated with huge carbon and water footprints. The objective of the study is to assess inequalities in health impacts and in attributable greenhouse gases-GHG emissions in Italy by hypothesizing different scenarios of reduction in red and processed meat consumption towards healthier consumption patterns more compliant with the recommendations of the Mediterranean food pyramid. Methods We used demographic and food consumption patterns from national surveys and risk relationships between meat intake and cardiovascular and colorectal cancer mortality from IARC and other meta-analyses. From the baseline data (year 2005-2006, average 406 gr/week beef and 245 gr/week processed meat), we considered hypothetical meat reduction scenarios according to international dietary guidelines such as the Mediterranean pyramid targets. For each geographical area (Northwest, Northeast, Centre, and South) and gender, we calculated the number of avoidable deaths from colorectal cancer, and cardiovascular disease among the adult population. Moreover, years of life gained by the adult population from 2012 to 2030 and changes in life expectancy of the 2012 birth cohort were quantified using gender-specific life tables. GHG emission reductions under Mediterranean scenario were estimated only for beef by applying the Global Warming Potential (GWP) coefficient to total consumption and to a low carbon food substitution in adult diet. Results The deaths avoidable (as percentage change compared to baseline) according to the three reduction scenarios for beef consumption were between 2.3% and 4.5% for colorectal cancer, and between 2.1% and 4.0% for cardiovascular disease; higher benefits would be observed in Northwestern areas and among males. In parallel, 5% and 6.4% of colorectal cancer and CVD deaths would be avoided if the Italian population ate the advised quantity of processed meat. Life table analysis suggests that the scenario that is fully compliant with the Mediterranean diet model would save 5 million years of life lost prematurely among men and women over the next 18 years and would increase average life expectancy of future generations by over 7 months. Considering the environmental impact, emissions associated with the actual total intake of beef range from 12,900 to 21,800 Gg CO2 eq; emissions saved according to the Mediterranean scenario are in the range 8000-14000 Gg CO2 eq per year. The per capita reduction is 263 KgCO2eq/year/person with higher reductions in Northwestern and Central areas. Conclusions In Italy, scenarios for reducing beef consumption are consistent with significant health and environmental co-benefits on current and future generations. Results support introducing policies to promote healthier behavior towards red and processed meat in the adult population within an overall balanced and healthy dietary pattern. Interventions should address gender, vulnerable population groups, and geographical differences in order to be more effective.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Activity and participation (AP); Whodas 2.0; Adults with disability; Population norm; Normative value	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE; CHINESE VERSION; NORMATIVE DATA; HEALTH; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION; VALIDITY	Background: In 2010, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) was developed, based on the concept of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The ICF provides a common language and framework for health and health-related status and attempts to integrate the biopsychosocial model as a multidimensional perspective in understanding functioning. Activities and participation (AP) is one salient component of the ICF refers to the execution of a task by an individual, and how such tasks are involved in their daily life. It is essential to examine the gap between the general adult population and adults with disabilities. This gap may be attributed to health status, personal factors, and natural and social environments, which include social and health services and policies. The purposes: (1) To develop a normative activity and participation (AP) value for the adult population and people with disabilities; and (2) to compare the gap in AP normative values between the two groups in Taiwan. Methods: We use the WHODAS 2.0 to survey and develop a normative AP value for the general adult population, and used secondary data from National Disability Eligibility Determination System (NDEDS) of Taiwan to describe the AP functioning distribution of adult with disability. There were 1100 participants, selected by stratified proportional sampling from two cities. There were also 144,850 participants who were adults with disability, selected from the secondary database in Taiwan. Results and conclusions: The AP curve for the disabled population increased rapidly at the beginning. The summary score was 13.21 in the performance at 90 percentile for the general population and 82.61 score for disabled adults that the similar gap in every domain, its means that there are significant functioning difference and health equality in general adults population and adults with disabilities. This presents a substantial challenge for both the government and the whole population of Taiwan, to begin considering how to reduce the gap in AP functioning and promote equality for people with disabilities, using social welfare policy. It is important to make sure disabled people have the same rights to be included in society as anybody else and better access to things in all areas of life that are according to Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).

Numerous reports have focused on the relationship between social inequity and health, but few studies have assessed how the overall magnitude of disparities in child health has changed in the course of drastic social and economic transitions from 1899 to more recent times. In this study, we assessed the trend of the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) and its inter-prefecture disparity in Japan. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of Japan's vital statistics data from 1899 to 2014 (115 years), which covers a core period of modern Japan. We calculated the U5MR of each prefecture and its Theil index by year to assess the trend of inter-prefecture disparity in child health from 1899 to 2014. Results: The U5MR monotonically decreased from 238 per 1,000 births in 1899 to 3 in 2014. The Theil index of the U5MR increased in the post-war period, peaked in 1962 (0.027) and gradually reduced to <0.01 in the 1970s. In the 2000s, however, even though U5MR continued to decrease, the Theil index started to increase, and in 2014 (0.013) it exceeded that in 1970 and was more similar to that before World War II. Conclusions: The disparities in child health appear to be widening, and may serve as a warning to today's society that increasing socioeconomic gradients may lead to rising health inequity among children. Further investigations into the causes, mechanisms, and possible interventions are needed.

J	Yuksekdag, Y				Yuksekdag, Yusuf			Against Cursory Treatments in Ethics of Medical Migration from Underserved Countries	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						Medical migration; Ethics; Right to exit; Retention		In a recent paper, Mpofu, Sen Gupta, and Hays (2016) attempt to outline the obligations of recruiting high-income countries (HICs) and would-be emigrant health workers (HWs) to tackle the effects of mass exodus of health workers from underserved regions. They reconstruct (i) Rawlsian and Kantian global justice approaches to argue for moral obligations of HICs and (ii) an individual justice approach to point to non-enforceable social responsibilities of HWs to assist their compatriots. This critical commentary demonstrates that the argumentation within their individual justice approach is problematic on the basis of three reasons: (1) their discussion under-theorizes and undervalues individual rights and more specifically the right to exit, (2) their argumentation in the latter part, even if problematically, does rather point to moral obligations in lieu of social responsibilities of HWs, and (3) they overlook many other important freedoms, interests, and values pertinent to the issue of retention.

J	Hense, C; McFerran, KS				Hense, Cherry; McFerran, Katrina Skewes			Promoting young people's musical identities to facilitate recovery from mental illness	JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES			English	Article						Youth; musical identity; mental illness; recovery		The new youth mental health paradigm' (IAYMH. 2015. International Association for Youth Mental Health. Accessed February 15, http://www.iaymh.org/) promotes the need for youth-friendly mental health options. Music therapy initiatives offer innovative modes of working towards young people's recovery in ways that align with the ethos of these services (McCaffrey, Edwards, and Fannon. 2011. Is There a Role for Music Therapy in the Recovery Approach in Mental Health? The Arts in Psychotherapy 38 (3): 185-189). This paper details a participatory research project investigating how and why promoting young people's musical identities can facilitate their recovery from mental illness. Young people accessing a music therapy programme in a youth mental health service in Australia participated in collaborative qualitative interviews that were analysed using constructivist grounded theory techniques. Cycles of action and reflection resulted in a grounded theory explaining the recovery of musical identity, and mapping young people's community-based music needs for wellbeing. We propose that promoting young people's musical identities facilitates recovery through: the construction of a health-based identity; facilitating meaning-making; and supporting social participation. Findings are discussed in relation to recovery literature and social justice issues that arise in response to findings about young people's needs for appropriate music access.

J	Finnegan, A; Morse, M; Nadas, M; Westerhaus, M				Finnegan, Amy; Morse, Michelle; Nadas, Marisa; Westerhaus, Michael			Where We Fall Down: Tensions in Teaching Social Medicine and Global Health	ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						health professional education; social medicine; praxis; Uganda; Haiti	EDUCATION; COMPETENCES; STUDENTS; EMPATHY; ETHICS	BACKGROUND As global health interest has risen, so too has the relevance of education on the social determinants of health and health equity. Social medicine offers a particularly salient framework for educating on the social determinants of health, health disparities, and health equity. SocMed and EqualHealth, 2 unique but related organizations, offer annual global health courses in Uganda, Haiti, and the United States, which train students to understand and respond to the social determinants of health through praxis, self-reflection and self-awareness, and building collaborative partnerships across difference. OBJECTIVES The aim of this paper is to describe an innovative pedagogical approach to teaching social medicine and global health. We draw on the notion of praxis, which illuminates the value of iterative reflection and action, to critically examine our points of weakness as educators in order to derive lessons with broad applicability for those engaged in global health work. METHODS The data for this paper were collected through an auto ethnography of teaching 10 global health social medicine courses in Uganda and Haiti since 2010. It draws on revealing descriptions from participant observation, student feedback collected in anonymous course evaluations, andongoing relationshipswith alumni. FINDINGS Critical analysis reveals 3 significant and complicated tensions raised by our courses. The first point of weakness pertains to issues of course ownership by North American outsiders. The second tension emerges from explicit acknowledgment of social and economic inequities among our students and faculty. Finally, there are ongoing challenges of sustaining positive momentum toward social change after transformative course experiences. CONCLUSIONS Although successful in generating transformative learning experiences, these courses expose significant fracture points worth interrogating as educators, activists, and global health practitioners. Ultimately, we have identified a need for building equitable partnerships and intentional community, embracing discomfort, and moving beyond reflection to praxis in global health education.

J	Puig, S				Puig, Sergio			Tobacco Litigation in International Courts	HARVARD INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL			English	Article							HUMAN-RIGHTS; UNITED-STATES; TRADE; LAW; WTO; SPEECH; HEALTH	For years, tobacco interests have played an important role in developing international law. Recently, cooperation among nations concerned with the risks and health consequences of smoking tobacco has resulted in the adoption of international treaties, regional directives, and common administrative and regulatory practices. As a result, a wave of litigation before international courts and tribunals, including the European and Andean Courts of Justice, Investor-State Tribunals, and the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement body, has led to novel legal questions. This Article is the first to trace, survey, and recount the history of tobacco litigation before international courts and tribunals and to assess its contribution to international law. In particular, it pays new attention to recent efforts by tobacco interests to challenge compelled speech by exporting the far-reaching Free Speech Clause of the United States into international law, especially in the context of marketing controls, mandatory graphic warnings, and "plain packaging" labels. This Article shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom, international courts and tribunals can play a central role in advancing and enhancing complex national, regional, and global regulations rather than eroding sovereign regulatory space. Complete deference to states' policies, however, can also be risky as it may perpetuate the use of economic and political influence to distort the functioning of government. Hence, the history of international tobacco litigation reveals a more complex interrelationship between domestic institutions and international law than many scholars acknowledge.

Methods: This study has used Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) data collected by the National Institute of Population Studies (NIPS), Islamabad, Pakistan, and Macro International Inc. (now ICF International) Calverton, Maryland, United States. It used three episodes of Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey Data from 1990-91, 2006-07 and 2012-13. Data was analysed using descriptive analysis and odds of delivering at hospital were calculated using logistic regression analysis. Results: Home-based delivery was over 4 times higher in 1990-91 compared with institutional delivery 5,465(85.3%) vs. 852(13.3%), and around 2 times higher in 2006-07 5,900(64.7%) vs. 3,128(34.3%). However, in 2012-13, the share of women delivering at home or health facility was roughly the same, i.e. 6,180(51.6%) at home and 5,773(48.2%) at health facility. Conclusion: There were wide gaps in the rates of institutional delivery among different subgroups, and they were accentuated by the socio-economic and financial disparities, and high illiteracy rates in the lowest wealth quintiles.

Moving towards a more inclusive patient and public involvement in health research paradigm: the incorporation of a trauma-informed intersectional analysis	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; QUALITY; CANADA; WOMEN; MODEL	Background: The concept of patient engagement in health research has received growing international recognition over recent years. Yet despite some critical advancements, we argue that the concept remains problematic as it negates the very real complexities and context of people's lives. Though patient engagement conceptually begins to disrupt the identity of "researcher," and complicate our assumptions and understandings around expertise and knowledge, it continues to essentialize the identity of "patient" as a homogenous group, denying the reality that individuals' economic, political, cultural, subjective and experiential lives intersect in intricate and multifarious ways. Discussion: Patient engagement approaches that do not consider the simultaneous interactions between different social categories (e.g. race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, gender, class, sexuality, geography, age, ability, immigration status, religion) that make up social identity, as well as the impact of systems and processes of oppression and domination (e.g. racism, colonialism, classism, sexism, ableism, homophobia) exclude the involvement of individuals who often carry the greatest burden of illness - the very voices traditionally less heard in health research. We contend that in order to be a more inclusive and meaningful approach that does not simply reiterate existing health inequities, it is important to reconceptualize patient engagement through a health equity and social justice lens by incorporating a trauma-informed intersectional analysis. Summary: This article provides key concepts to the incorporation of a trauma- informed intersectional analysis and important questions to consider when developing a patient engagement strategy in health research training, practice and evaluation. In redefining the identity of both "patient" and "researcher," spaces and opportunities to resist and renegotiate power within the intersubjective relations can be recognized and addressed, in turn helping to build trust, transparency and resiliency - integral to the advancement of the science of patient engagement in health research.

In the framework of the Joint Action for Rare Diseases (RD-ACTION), a specific task was defined to identify mechanisms influencing sustainability, equity and resilience of health systems for rare diseases (RDs). Method. Literature narrative review on health systems sustainability and resilience for RDs. Years: 2000-2015. Databases: PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOHost, EMBAL, PASCAL, EMBASE, STN International and GoogleScholar. Analysis: interpretive synthesis concept and thematic analysis (Dixon-Wood, et al.). Results. 97 papers and 4 grey literature publications were identified. Two main topics stand out: economic evaluation and networks. The first topic did not identify widely accepted criterion to assign more weight to individuals with greater health needs. Healthcare network are identified as increasingly important for sustainability and resilience, in all of their aspects: professional "expertise", "experience" networks of users and carers; policy, learning, and interest networks. Conclusion. Possible mechanisms for ensuring sustainability can be identified in networking, patients' empowerment and reorienting healthcare towards integrated community and home care.

J	de Santana, JP				de Santana, Jose Paranagua			Bioethical Dimensions of International Cooperation for Health: still a controversial issue?	CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA			English	Article						Bioethics; Public health; International health; International relations; International cooperation		This essay stresses the importance of undertaking a critical analysis of international cooperation for health based upon reflections on diplomacy, acknowledging the ethical limits and possibilities of cooperation within this context. It emphasizes the importance of adopting an historical perspective, highlighting the circumstances surrounding the consolidation of the current international system, whereby, after two world wars, the victorious countries created the United Nations Organization, which today brings together all the world's nations, notwithstanding the fact that the majority of countries are in favor of significant changes to its institutional framework. It also stresses the importance of the bioethics dimension, despite the systematic disregard of principles adopted in relevant UN documents, especially in view of inequalities pari passu with asymmetries of knowledge and enjoyment of innovations that separate nations. This reflection also suggests that South-South cooperation is fundamental to the analysis of the inequality and dependence that demarcate North-South and East-West bipolarity. These reflections are, in short, important guiding elements for deepening analysis and resolutions in the arena of international cooperation for health, leaving aside catastrophic visions and idealistic illusions.

First, we look at how the theme of health is treated within the UN, focusing on the concept of global health. We then discuss the concept of global health from a human rights perspective and go on to outline the debate surrounding universal coverage versus universal access as a human right, addressing some important ethical questions. Thereafter, we discuss universal coverage versus universal access using the critical and constructivist theories of international relations as a frame of reference. Finally, it is concluded that, faced with the persistence of huge global health inequalities, the WHO began to reshape itself, leaving behind the notion of health as a human right and imposing the challenge of reducing the wide gap that separates international intergovernmental laws from reality.

J	Herrero, MB				Belen Herrero, Maria			Moving towards South-South International Health: debts and challenges in the regional health agenda	CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA			English	Article						Right to health; Health inequalities; Global health; Diplomacy; International cooperation	AMERICA; DIPLOMACY	The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it aims to investigate the increased interest in health as an important dimension of the foreign policy and diplomatic concerns together with the emergence of a new framework for regional health integration and regional health diplomacy. Second, it seeks to understand the role and practices of new regional blocs in the field of health and whether they are conducting to the emergence of new strategies for addressing health regional policies in South America. The regional policy process relates to health as a right. Thus, some practices and processes in social policy are setting new standards for political and social cohesion in the construction of new regionalism. Health crosses national, regional, and global agendas in a multi-directional fashion, rather than via one-way, top-down policy transfer. A special feature of Unasur is upholding regional health sovereignty despite the unique fact that member countries retain national autonomy. Unasur has projected foreign policy that promotes social values in ways that seem innovative.

To analyze the differences and inequalities involved in access to RRT in the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa). This is an applied, descriptive, cross-sectional, quantitative and qualitative study, with documentary analysis and a literature review. The sources of data were from national censuses and scientific publications regarding access to RRT in the BRICS countries. There is unequal access to RRT in all the BRICS countries, as well as the absence of information regarding dialysis and transplants (India), the absence of effective legislation to inhibit the trafficking of organs (India and South Africa) and the use of deceased prisoners as donors for renal transplants (China). The construction of mechanisms to promote the sharing of benefits and solidarity in the field of international cooperation in the area of renal health involves the recognition of bioethical issues related to access to RRT in the BRICS countries.

At the present moment, the increase in non-communicable illnesses and diseases raises major concerns about the paradox of malnutrition and obesity. Based on an in-depth reading and interpretation of texts, documents and databases, this article discusses issues related to nutrition, considering the dimensions of shortages and excesses, the evolution of nutrition over time, and the connection with the new epidemiological trend. We begin with a conceptual characterization, the historical background and the anthropological connections with the guiding theme of the article. We then describe the prevalence, distribution and secular trend of malnutrition and obesity, as well as the temporal relationship with the new epidemiological trend in Brazil within a context of development and inequalities. Finally, we reflect on the issue of (mal) nutrition in post-modernity, the new interests at stake in the health-disease process, as well as international experiences and strategies of partnerships designed to overcome these problems. We conclude by discussing some current advances and challenges in relation to the complexity and speed of contemporary changes.

DESIGN: International, comparative burden-of-disease study. METHODS: Published data on national age-standardized DALY rates caused by cataract and- human development index (HDI) between 1990 and 2013 were obtained. The association between age-standardized DALY rates and HDI in 2013 was analyzed. The health-related Gini coefficients and the concentration indexes were calculated to explore the trends in between-country inequality in cataract burden from 1990 to 2013. RESULTS: Multiple comparison revealed that lower-HDI countries had higher age-standardized DALY rates caused by cataract. Age-standardized DALY rates were inversely associated with HDI (0 = -0.522, P < .01). From 1990 to 2013, global age-standardized DALY rates showed a trend of decline, whereas the Gini coefficients increased from 0.409 to 0.439. The concentration indexes indicated that socioeconomic associated inequality declined in the 1990s and subsequently increased since 2000, with values of -0.259 in 1990, -0.244 in 2000, and -0.273 in 2013. CONCLUSIONS: Global health progress in cataract was accomianied by widening inequality, with cataract burden being more concentrated in countries with lower socioeconomic status. The findings highlight the need to provide more cataract services for developing countries, to combat global vision loss caused by cataract. (C) 2017.Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A crucial question is whether this is still possible in current modes of global governance based on capitalist values. Four reflections are provided. (1) Ecological - centered values must become central in any future global health framework. (2) The objectives of 'sustainability' and 'economic growth' present a profound contradiction. (3) The resilience discourse maintains a gridlock in the functioning of the global health system. (4) The legitimacy of multi-stakeholder governance arrangements in global health requires urgent attention. A dual track approach is suggested. It must be aimed to transform capitalism into something better for global health while in parallel there is an urgent need to imagine a future and pathways to a different world order rooted in the principles of social justice, protecting the commons and a central role for the preservation of ecology.

Association of Educational Attainment With Lifetime Risk of Cardiovascular Disease The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study	JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article							CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; UNITED-STATES; FOLLOW-UP; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; HEALTH; MEN; PREVALENCE; CANCER; ARTERY	IMPORTANCE Estimates of lifetime risk may help raise awareness of the extent to which educational inequalities are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVE To estimate lifetime risks of CVD according to categories of educational attainment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants were followed from 1987 through December 31, 2013. All CVD events (coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) were confirmed by physician review and International Classification of Diseases codes. A total of 13 948 whites and African Americans who were 45 to 64 years old and free of CVD at baseline were included from 4 US communities (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; and suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota). The data analysis was performed from June 7 to August 31, 2016. EXPOSURES Educational attainment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We used a life table approach to estimate lifetime risks of CVD from age 45 through 85 years according to educational attainment. We adjusted for competing risks of death from underlying causes other than CVD. RESULTS The sample of 13 948 participants was 56% female and 27% African American. During 269 210 person-years of follow-up, we documented 4512 CVD events and 2401 non-CVD deaths. Educational attainment displayed an inverse dose-response relation with cumulative risk of CVD, which became evident in middle age, with the most striking gap between those not completing vs completing high school. In men, lifetime risks of CVD were 59.0%(95% CI, 54.0%-64.1%) for grade school, 52.5%(95% CI, 47.7%-56.8%) for high school education without graduation, 50.9%(95% CI, 47.3%-53.9%) for high school graduation, 47.2%(95% CI, 41.5%-52.5%) for vocational school, 46.4%(95% CI, 42.8%-49.6%) for college with or without graduation, and 42.2%(95% CI, 36.6%-47.0%) for graduate/professional school; in women, 50.8%(95% CI, 45.7%-55.8%), 49.3%(95% CI, 45.1%-53.1%), 36.3%(95% CI, 33.4%-39.1%), 32.2%(95% CI, 26.0%-37.3%), 32.8%(95% CI, 29.1%-35.9%), and 28.0%(95% CI, 21.9%-33.3%), respectively. Educational attainment was inversely associated with CVD even within categories of family income, income change, occupation, or parental educational level. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE More than 1 in 2 individuals with less than high school education had a lifetime CVD event. Educational attainment was inversely associated with the lifetime risk of CVD, regardless of other important socioeconomic characteristics. Our findings emphasize the need for further efforts to reduce CVD inequalities related to educational disparities.

Progress and priorities for reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health in Kenya: a Countdown to 2015 country case study	LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							ATTENDANCE; PEOPLE; SLUMS; CARE; LIVE	Background Progress in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) in Kenya has been inconsistent over the past two decades, despite the global push to foster accountability, reduce child mortality, and improve maternal health in an equitable manner. Although several cross-sectional assessments have been done, a systematic analysis of RMNCH in Kenya was needed to better understand the push and pull factors that govern intervention coverage and influence mortality trends. As such, we aimed to determine coverage and impact of key RMNCH interventions between 1990 and 2015. Methods We did a comprehensive, systematic assessment of RMNCH in Kenya from 1990 to 2015, using data from nationally representative Demographic Health Surveys done between 1989 and 2014. For comparison, we used modelled mortality estimates from the UN Inter-Agency Groups for Child and Maternal Mortality Estimation. We estimated time trends for key RMNCH indicators, as defined by Countdown to 2015, at both the national and the subnational level, and used linear regression methods to understand the determinants of change in intervention coverage during the past decade. Finally, we used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to model the effect of intervention scale-up by 2030. Findings After an increase in mortality between 1990 and 2003, there was a reversal in all mortality trends from 2003 onwards, although progress was not substantial enough for Kenya to achieve Millennium Development Goal targets 4 or 5. Between 1990 and 2015, maternal mortality declined at half the rate of under-5 mortality, and changes in neonatal mortality were even slower. National-level trends in intervention coverage have improved, although some geographical inequities remain, especially for counties comprising the northeastern, eastern, and northern Rift Valley regions. Disaggregation of intervention coverage by wealth quintile also revealed wide inequities for several health-systems-based interventions, such as skilled birth assistance. Multivariable analyses of predictors of change in family planning, skilled birth assistance, and full vaccination suggested that maternal literacy and family size are important drivers of positive change in key interventions across the continuum of care. LiST analyses clearly showed the importance of quality of care around birth for maternal and newborn survival. Interpretation Intensified and focused efforts are needed for Kenya to achieve the RMNCH targets for 2030. Kenya must build on its previous progress to further reduce mortality through the widespread implementation of key preventive and curative interventions, especially those pertaining to labour, delivery, and the first day of life. Deliberate targeting of the poor, least educated, and rural women, through the scale-up of community-level interventions, is needed to improve equity and accelerate progress.

Undernutrition underlies 45% of deaths. Determinants include access to care, maternal education, and absolute and relative poverty. Socio-political-economic factors and policies tremendously influence health and their determinants. Most deaths can be prevented with interventions that are currently available and recommended for widespread implementation. Millennium Development Goal 4 was not achieved. Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 presents an even more ambitious target and opportunity to save millions of lives, and requires attention to scaling up interventions, especially among the poorest and most vulnerable children.

We analyze how vulnerability changes over time and ask whether there is evidence of critical thresholds beyond which social vulnerability drastically changes. The review finds that climate change is expected to exacerbate current vulnerabilities and inequalities. The findings confirm concerns about climate justice, especially its intergenerational dimensions. For example, deficiencies in early childhood may limit future educational and income generation opportunities. Evidence of clear thresholds is rare and is mainly related to the vulnerability of different age groups, household income level, and the impacts of different degrees of global warming.

This study examines the pathways through which mothers are affected by seasonal and meteorological factors in sub-Saharan Africa in general, and Kanungu District (Uganda), in particular. We conducted a community-based study consisting of focus group discussions with mothers and interviews with health care workers in Kanungu District. Using a priori and a posteriori coding, we found a diversity of perspectives on the impacts of seasonal and weather exposures, with reporting of more food available in the rainy season. The rainy season was also identified as the period in which women performed physical labour for longer time periods, while work conditions in the dry season were reported to be more difficult due to heat. The causal pathways through which weather and seasonality may be affecting size at birth as reported by Kanungu mothers were consistent with those most frequently reported in the literature elsewhere, including maternal energy balance (nutritional intake and physical exertion output) and seasonal illness. While both Indigenous and non-Indigenous mothers described similar pathways, however, the severity of these experiences differed. Non-Indigenous mothers frequently relied on livestock assets or opportunities for less taxing physical work than Indigenous women, who had fewer options when facing food shortages or transport costs. Findings point to specific entry points for intervention including increased nutritional support in dry season periods of food scarcity, increased diversification of wage labour opportunities, and increased access to contraception. Interventions should be particularly targeted towards Indigenous mothers as they face greater food insecurity, may have fewer sources of income, and face greater overall deprivation than non-Indigenous mothers.

Multipurpose renewable energy resources based hybrid energy system for remote community in northern Ghana	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS			English	Article						Green energy; Cost of energy; Solar PV; Electricity access; Water; Remote area; Immigration	GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; NIGERIA	Many developing countries face the triple problems of unreliable supply of electricity, inadequate access to good drinking water supply and insecurity. The problem of electricity and water supply are more pronounced in remote areas due to lack of utility grid extension. This study examines the feasibility of using hybrid energy system consisting of solar PV and biodiesel generators in meeting the electricity and domestic water needs of a remote community in Ghana. The Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software was used to carry out the analysis presented in this study. A daily electrical load of 104 kWh/day to meet the need of 100 households, small-scale businesses and a central water pumping system is estimated. Five different initial investment support scenarios, are considered: 100%, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0%. The results show a rather poor load profile (load factor of 12.26%) and a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of US$ 0.76/kWh at full cost (100% cost). The LCOE declines to US$. 20/kWh when the entire upfront cost of the project is grant-financed. Compared with end-user tariff of US$ 0.10/kWh for lifeline customers in Ghana, beneficiaries of this PV-based mini-grid system will pay up to 200% more, even under full-grant finance conditions for maintenance of the system. Such interventions often replace inferior and health-threatening options such kerosene lamps, candles and in some cases outright darkness. Although the system is relatively expensive from a purely financial point of view, social equity considerations, together with innovative approaches encouraging daytime use of electricity for productive activities can help sustain such mini-grid solutions.

This paper examines dementia awareness and the perspectives of businesses and organisations in the visitor economy, given that people with the early stages of dementia remain consumers of leisure and tourism experiences. It adopts the concept of the civil society where people are treated in a fair and equitable manner irrespective of their abilities and state of health to promote equality of opportunity. As an exploratory study, it evaluates the awareness, perception and experience of businesses in developing a dementia-friendly visitor economy. It focuses on dementia as a 'hidden condition' with a focus on the attractions sector to develop a greater understanding of how to embrace dementia as part of a civil society. The research highlights the implications for the wider visitor economy with dementia set to grow globally in scale and significance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Article						Adolescent pregnancy; Equity; Latin America and the Caribbean	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTERVENTIONS; COUNTRIES	Adolescent fertility rates in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) remain unacceptably high, especially compared to the region's declining total fertility rates. The Region has experienced the slowest progress of all regions in the world, and shows major differences between countries and between subgroups in countries. In 2013, LAC was also noted as the only region with a rising trend in pregnancies in adolescents younger than 15 years. In response to the lack of progress in the LAC region, PAHO/WHO, UNFPA and UNICEF held a technical consultation with global, regional and country-level stakeholders to take stock of the situation and agree on strategic approaches and priority actions to accelerate progress. The meeting concluded that there is no single portrait of an adolescent mother in LAC and that context and determinants of adolescent pregnancy vary across and within countries. However, lack of knowledge about their sexual and reproductive health and rights, poor access to and inadequate use of contraceptives resulting from restrictive laws and policies, weak programs, social and cultural norms, limited education and income, sexual violence and abuse, and unequal gender relations were identified as key factors contributing to adolescent pregnancy in LAC. The meeting participants highlighted the following seven priority actions to accelerate progress: 1. Make adolescent pregnancy, its drivers and impact, and the most affected groups more visible with disaggregated data, qualitative reports, and stories. 2. Design interventions targeting the most vulnerable groups, ensuring the approaches are adapted to their realities and address their specific challenges. 3. Engage and empower youth to contribute to the design, implementation and monitoring of strategic interventions. 4. Abandon ineffective interventions and invest resources in applying proven ones. 5. Strengthen inter-sectoral collaboration to effectively address the drivers of adolescent pregnancy in LAC. 6. Move from boutique projects to large-scale and sustainable programs. 7. Create an enabling environment for gender equality and adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights.

Uncertainty stress is a prominent aspect of mental stress. Yet no research has ever empirically analyzed the impact of SES on uncertainty stress. Methods: Students were identified through a multistage survey sampling process including 50 universities. Each student participant completed the Global Health Professions Student Survey (GHPSS) on Tobacco Control in China. Regional variables were retrieved from the National Bureau of Statistics database. Both unadjusted and adjusted methods were considered in the analyses. Results: Among the 11,942 participants, severe uncertainty stress prevalence was 19.6%, while severe life stress prevalence was 8.6%. Multilevel logistic regression showed that most SES variables were associated with uncertainty stress. Students with "operation and commercial work" as mother's occupation and "rural or township" as family location exhibited a higher prevalence of severe uncertainty stress. Lower family income and original region gross domestic products (GDP) were also associated with higher severe uncertainty stress prevalence. However, only father's occupation was correlated with life stress. Conclusions: Based on the literature review, this is the first empirical study examining the impact of SES on uncertainty stress in China and elsewhere in the world. Our research underscores the importance of decreasing socioeconomic inequalities in controlling excessive uncertainty stress.

J	Dickson, KS; Ahinkorah, BO				Dickson, Kwamena Sekyi; Ahinkorah, Bright Opoku			Understanding tobacco use and socioeconomic inequalities among men in Ghana, and Lesotho	ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Tobacco use; Socio - economic; Inequalities; Ghana; Lesotho	GLOBAL MORTALITY; HEALTH-RISKS; SMOKING; PREVALENCE	Background: Tobacco use is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths and has become a significant public health issue. Previous studies have paid less attention to tobacco use and socio-economic equalities among men in developing countries. This study examines the relationship between tobacco use and socio-economic inequalities among men in Ghana and Lesotho. Methods: The study made use of data from the 2014 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) from Ghana, and Lesotho. Binary logistic regression was employed to examine the associations between socio-economic inequality characteristics of respondents and tobacco use. Results: The results showed that the prevalence of tobacco use was high in Lesotho (47.9%) as compared to that of Ghana (6.3%). Tobacco use was generally high across all age groups in Lesotho and in contrast, it was relatively low across all ages in Ghana. A statistically significant association was found between all the socio-economic variables and tobacco use in both countries. The prevalence of tobacco use was smaller in age group 15-24 years compared to the age groups 25-34 years and 35-59 years in both Ghana and Lesotho, although the association is stronger in Ghana. The AOR's in Ghana are respectively 5.3 (95% CI: 3.29-8.59) and 9.7 (95% CI: 6.20-15.06), compared to respectively 1.7 (95% CI: 1.32-2.11) and 1.7 (95% CI: 1.36-2.12). Smoking prevalence was smaller in men with higher level of education compared to men with no education in both Ghana and Lesotho, although the association was weaker in Ghana. The AOR in Ghana is 0.1 (95% CI: (0.02-0.11), compared to 0.2 (95% Cl: (0.17-0.30). The prevalence of tobacco use was smaller among men in urban areas compared to rural areas in both Ghana and Lesotho, although the association is stronger in Ghana. The AOR in Ghana is 2.1 (95% CI: 1.67-2.73), compared to 1.6 (95% CI: (1.31-1.95). In both countries, prevalence of tobacco use was higher in men who are traditionalist/spiritualists or who had no religion compared to Christians, although the association was stronger in Ghana. The AOR in Ghana is 6.2 (95% CI: (4.42-4.09) compared to 1.7 (95% CI: (1.21-2.47). The prevalence of tobacco use was low among men with richest wealth status compared to men with poorest wealth status in both Ghana and Lesotho, although the association is weaker in Ghana. The AOR in Ghana is 0.1 (95% Cl: (0.06-0.17) compared to 0.4 (95% CI: (0.51-1.12). In relation to occupation, prevalence of tobacco use was smaller among professional workers compared to men in the Agricultural sector in both Ghana and Lesotho, although the association is stronger in Ghana. The AOR in Ghana is 9.3 (95% Cl: (4.54-18.99), compared to 3.5 (95% CI: (2.27-5.52). Formerly married men in both countries were more likely to use tobacco compared to currently not married men, although the prevalence was higher in Ghana.

Critical discourse analysis of social justice in nursing's foundational documents	PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						critical discourse analysis; health inequity; professionalism; social justice	HEALTH EQUITY; PROFESSIONALISM; PEDAGOGY	ObjectiveSocial inequities threaten the health of the global population. A superficial acknowledgement of social justice by nursing's foundational documents may limit the degree to which nurses view injustice as relevant to nursing practice and education. The purpose was to examine conceptualizations of social justice and connections to broader contexts in the most recent editions. DesignCritical discourse analysis examines and uncovers dynamics related to power, language, and inequality within the American Nurses Association's Code of Ethics, Scope and Standards of Practice, and Social Policy Statement. ResultsThis analysis found ongoing inconsistencies in conceptualizations of social justice. Although the Code of Ethics integrates concepts related to social justice far more than the other two, tension between professionalism and social change emerges. The discourse of professionalism renders interrelated cultural, social, economic, historical, and political contexts nearly invisible. ConclusionGreater consistency would provide a clearer path for nurses to mobilize and engage in the courageous work necessary to address social injustice. These findings also call for an examination of how nurses can critique and use the power and privilege of professionalism to amplify the connection between social institutions and health equity in nursing education, practice, and policy development.

Numerous studies examine catastrophic healthcare expenditures (CHE) worldwide on whole populations rather than specific vulnerable groups. As hypertension and other chronic conditions impose a growing share of the disease burden in China, they will become an increasingly important component of CHE. This study aims to estimate households with hypertension incurring CHE and its income-related inequality in the rural areas of Shaanxi Province. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Household Health Service Surveys of Shaanxi Province conducted in 2013 and 13104 households were identified for analysis. The households were classified into three types: households with non-chronic diseases, households with hypertension only and households with hypertension plus other chronic diseases. CHE was measured according to the proportion of out-of-pocket health payments to non-food household expenditures and the concentration index was employed to measure the extent of income related inequality in CHE. A decomposition method based on a probit model was used to decompose the concentration index into its determining components. Results: The incurring of CHE of households with hypertension is at a disconcerting level compared to households with non-chronic diseases. Households with hypertension only and households with hypertension plus other chronic diseases incurred CHE in 23.48% and 34.01% of cases respectively whereas households with non-chronic diseases incurred CHE in only 13.33%. The concentration index of households with non-chronic diseases is 0.4871. However, the concentration index of households with hypertension only and households with hypertension plus other chronic diseases is -0.4645 and -0.3410 respectively. The majority of observed inequalities in CHE were explained by household economic status and having elder members. Conclusions: The proportion of households incurring CHE in the rural areas of Shaanxi Province was considerably high in all three types of households and households with hypertension were at a higher risk of incurring CHE. Furthermore, there existed a strong pro-poor inequality of CHE in all three types of households and the results implied more inequality in households with non-chronic diseases compared with two other groups. Our study suggests that more concern needs to be directed toward households with hypertension plus other chronic diseases and households having elder members.

However, the causal nature of the relationship is not established. Here we describe a natural experiment involving deteriorating socioeconomic circumstances following exposure to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. We investigated the relationship between subjective economic deterioration and housing damage due to the disaster and tooth loss in a cohort of community-dwelling residents (n = 3,039), from whom we obtained information about socioeconomic status and health status in 2010 (i.e., predating the disaster). A follow-up survey was performed in 2013 (postdisaster), and 82.1% of the 4,380 eligible survivors responded. We estimated the impact of subjective economic deterioration and housing damage due to the disaster on tooth loss by fitting an instrumental variable probit model. Subjective economic deterioration and housing damage due to the disaster were significantly associated with 8.1% and 1.7% increases in the probability of tooth loss (probit coefficients were 0.469 (95% confidence interval: 0.065, 0.872) and 0.103 (95% confidence interval: 0.011, 0.196), respectively). In this natural experiment, we confirmed the causal relationship between deteriorating socioeconomic circumstances and tooth loss.

Solving Disparities Through Payment And Delivery System Reform: A Program To Achieve Health Equity	HEALTH AFFAIRS			English	Article							ETHNIC DISPARITIES; CARE; PERFORMANCE; SERVICES; PAY	Payment systems generally do not directly encourage or support the reduction of health disparities. In 2013 the Finding Answers: Solving Disparities through Payment and Delivery System Reform program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation sought to understand how alternative payment models might intentionally incorporate a disparities-reduction component to promote health equity. A qualitative analysis of forty proposals to the program revealed that applicants generally did not link payment reform tightly to disparities reduction. Most proposed general pay-for-performance, global payment, or shared savings plans, combined with multicomponent system interventions. None of the applicants proposed making any financial payments contingent on having successfully reduced disparities. Most applicants did not address how they would optimize providers' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to reduce disparities. A better understanding of how payment and care delivery models might be designed and implemented to reduce health disparities is essential.

However, there is a lack of large-scale measurements of physical activity patterns across free-living populations worldwide(1,6). Here we leverage the wide usage of smartphones with built-in accelerometry to measure physical activity at the global scale. We study a dataset consisting of 68 million days of physical activity for 717,527 people, giving us a window into activity in 111 countries across the globe. We find inequality in how activity is distributed within countries and that this inequality is a better predictor of obesity prevalence in the population than average activity volume. Reduced activity in females contributes to a large portion of the observed activity inequality. Aspects of the built environment, such as the walkability of a city, are associated with a smaller gender gap in activity and lower activity inequality. In more walkable cities, activity is greater throughout the day and throughout the week, across age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) groups, with the greatest increases in activity found for females. Our findings have implications for global public health policy and urban planning and highlight the role of activity inequality and the built environment in improving physical activity and health.

J	Brolan, CE; Gouda, H				Brolan, Claire E.; Gouda, Hebe			CIVIL REGISTRATION AND VITAL STATISTICS, EMERGENCIES, AND INTERNATIONAL LAW: UNDERSTANDING THE INTERSECTION	MEDICAL LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Civil registration and vital statistics; Public health emergencies; Human rights; International law	HEALTH; SYSTEMS; SURVEILLANCE; INFORMATION; MIGRATION; CONFLICTS; DEATHS; TRENDS; COUNT	Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems are typically run by governments to record every birth, adoption, death, marriage, and divorce that occurs among a country's population. Registration of vital events provides individuals with a formal relationship with the State and each other, and is the foundation of a person's identity, nationality, and legal status. At a population level, vital statistics are essential for effective planning and implementation of policies and services. Globally, strong CRVS systems are increasingly recognised as a crucial backbone for redressing health inequities and as a priority in strengthening global health and development efforts. Many countries, however, currently lack adequate and reliable CRVS systems, leaving many people vulnerable to statelessness, limited access to important government services (such as education and health services), and effective legal protection. Public health and humanitarian emergencies in such contexts can expose those already disadvantaged and marginalised to heightened risk. CRVS systems weakened by crises make registration difficult or impossible and unregistered people may be displaced or separated from their families, exacerbating their susceptibility. The presence of a strong CRVS system, therefore, can facilitate effective and cost-effective emergency responses, help prevent exploitation of individuals (particularly women and children), and help to rebuild communities post-crisis. This article will consequently review the international legal mandates that exist to strengthen CRVS systems globally, with particular view to public health and humanitarian emergencies. Identity and citizenship, and the socio-political contexts in which these concepts co-exist, are inevitably interconnected with CRVS. This can create potential for CRVS systems and data to be exploited as a political instrument. Grounding CRVS strengthening in a single binding, human rights law instrument is a potential way forward.

One Health contributions towards more effective and equitable approaches to health in low- and middle-income countries	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						One Health; zoonoses; health equity; global health; sustainable development; poverty	Q-FEVER; HUMAN BRUCELLOSIS; ENDEMIC ZOONOSES; FEBRILE PATIENTS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; VACCINATION; RABIES; KENYA; LEPTOSPIROSIS; MALARIA	Emerging zoonoses with pandemic potential are a stated priority for the global health security agenda, but endemic zoonoses also have a major societal impact in low-resource settings. Although many endemic zoonoses can be treated, timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of human cases is often challenging. Preventive 'One Health' interventions, e.g. interventions in animal populations that generate human health benefits, may provide a useful approach to overcoming some of these challenges. Effective strategies, such as animal vaccination, already exist for the prevention, control and elimination of many endemic zoonoses, including rabies, and several livestock zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever) that are important causes of human febrile illness and livestock productivity losses in low- and middle-income countries. We make the case that, for these diseases, One Health interventions have the potential to be more effective and generate more equitable benefits for human health and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, than approaches that rely exclusively on treatment of human cases. We hypothesize that applying One Health interventions to tackle these health challenges will help to build trust, community engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration, which will in turn strengthen the capacity of fragile health systems to respond to the threat of emerging zoonoses and other future health challenges. One Health interventions thus have the potential to align the ongoing needs of disadvantaged communities with the concerns of the broader global community, providing a pragmatic and equitable approach to meeting the global goals for sustainable development and supporting the global health security agenda.

Although coverage improvements depend on multiple factors and increased coverage cannot be attributed to the use of polio assets alone, 6 out of the 10 focus countries improved coverage in three doses of diphtheria tetanus pertussis containing vaccine between 2013 and 2015. Government leadership, evidence-based programming, country-driven comprehensive operational annual plans, community partnership and strong accountability systems are critical for all programs and polio eradication has illustrated these can be leveraged to increase immunization coverage and equity and enhance global health security in the focus countries.

J	von Gablenz, P; Holube, I				von Gablenz, Petra; Holube, Inga			Social inequalities in pure-tone hearing assessed using occupational stratification schemes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY			English	Article						Hearing loss; epidemiology; social stratification; occupational measures; age; gender; otologically normal	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; IMPAIRMENT; NOISE; AGE; THRESHOLDS; ADULTS; HEALTH; CHILDHOOD; BEHAVIOR; SMOKING	Objective: The objective of this study is to analyse the performance of two occupational stratification approaches and the impact of social position on adult hearing. Design: The prevalence of hearing impairment, pure-tone averages (PTA) and prevalence ratios (PR) for relative hearing loss, which focuses on the position of one's PTA in the age- and gender-specific distribution, were compared in groups defined by ISCO Skill Level and the International Socio-Economic Index (ISEI). Study sample: About 1571 subjects aged 30-89, including 677 highly screened adults, from the cross-sectional study HoRSTAT. Results: ISCO Skill Level and ISEI yielded qualitatively the same results. The prevalence difference between the socially least and most advantaged group ranges between 10 and 16%, varying with the scheme applied. Low- and high-frequency PTA and PR for relative hearing loss confirm the gradient. Screening reduced, but did not negate the social differences. The prevalence difference dropped to 6-7% in the otologically normal subsample. Conclusions: Social groups defined by hierarchical, occupational measures differ in their pure-tone hearing, even if the main risk factors are controlled for. This underlines the need for population-based sampling, the relevance of reporting the study group's social composition and the importance of advancing the discussion on appropriate social measures in hearing research.

J	Rawlinson, P				Rawlinson, Paddy			Saving the Girls: Medical Colonialism and the HPV Programme	POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES			English	Article						Medical colonialism; HPV vaccine; India; medical intervention; biopolitics	CLINICAL-RESEARCH; POLITICS	Mass immunisation is a central aspiration of global health programmes, such as in the 2000 Millennium Development Goals (MDG), as a means of addressing the glaring inequalities in life expectancy that separate the Global North and South. A recent initiative, the Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) vaccine, is being rolled out in so-called developing countries to prevent a number of sexually transmitted diseases, including one of the rarer forms of cervical cancer. Despite its apparent good intentions, resistance to the vaccine has occurred, in developed as well as in developing countries, not least because it constitutes a largely gendered form of medical intervention which is promoted according to Western concepts of risk, biomedical knowledge and normative understandings of female sexual behaviour. As a major component of the MDG health strategy aimed at developing countries, the HPV vaccine initiative carries implicit tendencies towards 'medical colonialism' underpinned as it is by hegemonic scientific masculinity, in which gendered forms of structural violence are legitimised through the discursive affiliations of progress and global health. This paper will examine the intersecting themes of political economy, gendered structural violence and hegemonic medical masculinity underpinning HPV immunisation programmes within the context of development. It interrogates how masculine scientific narratives of disease prevention, which legitimises the state-endorsed (and increasingly mandated) pharmaceuticalised protection of young women as objects of patriarchal care and control, have become the new missionary voices, saving bodies rather than souls.

CHILD MALTREATMENT			English	Article						child welfare; cohort study; foster care; longitudinal research	LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES; FOSTER-CARE; PHYSICAL HEALTH; WELFARE CLIENTS; OUTCOMES; INEQUALITY; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; RISK; COEFFICIENTS; OPPORTUNITY	International research has consistently reported that children placed in out-of-home care (OHC) have poor outcomes in young adulthood. Yet, little is known about their outcomes in midlife. Using prospective data from a cohort of more than 14,000 Swedes born in 1953, of which nearly 9% have been placed in OHC, this study examines whether there is developmental continuity or discontinuity of disadvantage reaching into middle age in OHC children, compared to same-aged peers. Outcome profiles, here conceptualized as combinations of adverse outcomes related to education, economic hardship, unemployment, and mental health problems, were assessed in 1992-2008 (ages 39-55). Results indicate that having had experience of OHC was associated with 2-fold elevated odds of ending up in the most disadvantaged outcome profile, controlling for observed confounding factors. These findings suggest that experience of OHC is a strong marker for disadvantaged outcomes also in midlife.

In this study, we aimed at assessing the trends in socioeconomics inequalities among the hardcore smokers in adult male population in Vietnam over a five-year period from 2010 to 2015. Methods: We used data from two rounds of the Vietnam Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) conducted in 2010 and 2015. We included only men aged 25 years and above in the analysis. We measured socioeconomic inequalities among hardcore smokers by calculating the concentration index. We conducted multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with hardcore smoking among men aged 25 years and above. Results: The results of this study showed that the prevalence of male hardcore smokers aged 25 years and above in Vietnam was 9.5% in 2010 which increased to 13.1% in 2015. The prevalence of male hardcore smokers declined in the richest group from the 2010 level whereas it increased in the middle, poor and poorest groups. All values of weighted concentration indices indicated that the prevalence of male hardcore smokers occurred more among the poor men in Vietnam in both 2010 and 2015. The socioeconomic inequalities in hardcore smokers increased during 2010 and 2015. Residence in urban areas was significantly associated with higher adult male hardcore smoking in our study. Belonging to the age groups between 40 and 59 years, attaining primary and lower education, being self-employed, belonging to the poorest household group, smoking being allowed at home and no rule for smoking at home were associated with higher risk of being hardcore smoker among adult males in Vietnam. Conclusions: We found increased trends in socioeconomic inequalities in hardcore smoking among the study population. Our study results indicate that existing smoking secession and tobacco control policy and interventions need to be modified or new policies and interventions should be introduced with the perspective of addressing socioeconomic inequalities to have the desired impact. We recommend implementing specific targeted interventions for vulnerable population groups for better results.

B.; Hampson, Katie; Hanley, Nick; Lembo, Tiziana; Sharp, Joanne P.; Haydon, Daniel T.; Cleaveland, Sarah			Driving improvements in emerging disease surveillance through locally relevant capacity strengthening	SCIENCE			English	Review							NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES; PATHOGENS; EMERGENCE	Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) threaten the health of people, animals, and crops globally, but our ability to predict their occurrence is limited. Current public health capacity and ability to detect and respond to EIDs is typically weakest in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Many known drivers of EID emergence also converge in LMICs. Strengthening capacity for surveillance of diseases of relevance to local populations can provide a mechanism for building the cross-cutting and flexible capacities needed to tackle both the burden of existing diseases and EID threats. A focus on locally relevant diseases in LMICs and the economic, social, and cultural contexts of surveillance can help address existing inequalities in health systems, improve the capacity to detect and contain EIDs, and contribute to broader global goals for development.

J	Howell, A; Mills, C; Rushton, S				Howell, Alison; Mills, China; Rushton, Simon			The (Mis) appropriation of HIV/AIDS advocacy strategies in Global Mental Health: towards a more nuanced approach	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Global mental health; HIV/AIDS; International development; Global public health policy; Human rights; Medicalization	RICH MANS TABLE; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; SACHS REPORT; GOVERNANCE; SECURITY; HIV; SECURITISATION; GLOBALIZATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Background: Mental health is increasingly finding a place on global health and international development agendas. Advocates for Global Mental Health (GMH), and international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, argue that treatments available in high-income countries should also be made available in low-and middle-income countries. Such arguments are often made by comparing mental health to infectious diseases, including the relative disease and economic burdens they impose, and pointing to the applicability of the right to access treatment for mental health, not only infectious diseases. HIV/AIDS advocacy in particular has been held up by GMH advocates as offering an appropriate strategy for generating global commitment. Discussion: There is a need to assess how health issues are framed not only in relation to social goods outside of health (such as human rights, security or development), but also in relation to other health or disease models, and how health policy and practice is shaped as a result. The article debates the merits and consequences of likening mental health to HIV/AIDS, and identifies four major problems with the model for GMH advocacy being developed through these analogies: 1. An inappropriately universalizing global approach to context-specific problems; 2. A conception of human rights that focuses on the right to access treatment at the expense of the right to refuse it; 3. A tendency to treat poverty as a psychiatric issue, rather than recognizing that mental distress can be the result of poverty and other forms of inequality; 4. The prioritization of destigmatization of disease over social justice models. Conclusion: There are significant problems with the wholesale adoption of an (often simplified) version of HIV/AIDS advocacy as a model for GMH. Yet critical engagement with the important and nuanced differences between HIV/AIDS and mental health may nevertheless point to some possibilities for productive engagement and cross-fertilisation between advocates, activists and scholars in both fields.

J	Lee, SG				Lee, Sun Goo			Assessing impacts of the WHO FCTC on national legislations: A case study of the Republic of Korea	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						WHO FCTC; International law; National legislation; Korean tobacco law	FRAMEWORK CONVENTION; GLOBAL HEALTH; JUSTICE	The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is an international treaty that was adopted in 2003 with the aim of addressing public health problems related to tobacco. The treaty is expected to bring substantial changes to global tobacco control because it has legally binding power over its signatory countries. However, its actual impact on national legislative processes, to date, has not been thoroughly examined. This article assesses the effect of the WHO FCTC on national tobacco legislation, with the Republic of Korea as a case study. This article also reviews whether and how lawmakers and government officials actually refer to the WHO FCTC as a justification for amending tobacco law after Korea ratified the WHO FCTC in 2005. This review shows that the WHO FCTC served as an important ground upon which to amend laws to strengthen tobacco control in Korea. The legally binding power of the WHO FCTC compelled lawmakers to comply with international standards. Furthermore, various tobacco control measures listed in the treaty have provided practical tips for Korean policymakers to refer to in designing tobacco control laws. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A systematic review of evolving definitions and adaptations of the framework at the health system level	HEALTH POLICY			English	Review						Triple Aim; Health care system; Populations	CARE; REFORM	Notwithstanding important contributions of the Triple Aim, uncritical enthusiasm regarding the implications of the framework may be leading to inconsistent use, particularly when applied at the health system level, which goes beyond the original positioning of the framework as a strategic organizing principle to guide improvement initiatives at the organizational or local community level. We systematically identified uses of the Triple Aim that extended beyond its original intention to focus on uses at the whole health system level, to assess convergence and divergence with the original definition. We also attempted to identify consistencies in the way the Triple Aim was adapted for different contexts and settings. Data sources were indexed databases, web search engines, and international experts. Forty-seven articles were included in the analysis. We found that the definition of the Triple Aim has been subject to important modifications when the framework is used to define goals for whole health care systems or globally. Despite widespread recognition of the name, what constitutes the Triple Aim framework varies. We identified the need to consider the inclusion of at least two additional aims of health care systems - the provider experience of care, and the desire to achieve health equity for populations.

HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Public health; Cause of death; Premature mortality; Healthcare disparities	INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS; MEDICAL INTERVENTION; AVOIDABLE MORTALITY; INEQUALITIES; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; FINLAND; NATIONS	Amenable mortality has been recently included in the joint monitoring tool by the European Commission and Member States to assess a country's health system performance. Amenable deaths are premature deaths, which should not have occurred at this stage in the light of timely and effective health care. This paper recalculated annual amenable mortality rates for 28 EU countries and the EU for the period 1994-2013 based on the recently published list of deaths amenable to health care by Eurostat. Thereby, it offers a consistent calculation of amenable mortality across European Member States and provides time series data on amenable mortality. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of the amenable mortality indicator for varying age limits and attributional weights of circulatory system diseases is carried out. While large improvements were made in reducing amenable deaths in all European countries, great variations persist among Member States. Most of the decreases in amenable mortality are explained by a substantial reduction of deaths due to circulatory system diseases. In addition, even in countries with good national performance on amenable mortality, sub-national analysis shows that great regional disparities exist. The sensitivity analysis revealed that for the large majority of countries results are stable across different attributional weights used for ischaemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular diseases.

Improvement of Geographic Disparities: Amelioration or Displacement?	JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE			English	Article						Disparities; Urban Health Index; Health determinant; GIS; Cities	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; RACIAL DISPARITIES; BREAST-CANCER; HEALTH; REDEVELOPMENT; NEIGHBORHOODS; ENVIRONMENT; STAGE; INEQUALITY; RESIDENCE	Progression of geographic disparities in social determinants of health is a global concern. Using an Urban Health Index (UHI) approach, we proposed a framework of examining the change of geographic disparities in social determinants in small areas. Using the City of Atlanta in Georgia (USA) as a case study, we standardized six census-based social determinant indicators in 2000 and in 2010, respectively, and calculated their geometric mean to assign each census tract a UHI value for 2000 and for 2010. We then evaluated the temporal change of the UHIs in relation to the demographic changes using spatial and statistical methods. We found that Atlanta experienced an improvement in social determinant status and a reduction of disparities in the 10 years. The areas that experienced improvement, however, underwent demographic changes as well. This analysis provides support for displacement, rather than improvement, as the underlying factor for apparent change in geographic disparities. Findings suggest the importance of local evaluation for future policies to reduce disparities in cities.

Significant contributions have been made to the development of concepts, methods, and applications for CRA over the past decade. Work in both human health and ecological cumulative risk has advanced in two different contexts. The first context is the effects of chemical mixtures that share common modes of action, or that cause common adverse outcomes. In this context two primary models are used for predicting mixture effects, dose addition or response addition. The second context is evaluating the combined effects of chemical and nonchemical (e.g., radiation, biological, nutritional, economic, psychological, habitat alteration, land-use change, global climate change, and natural disasters) stressors. CRA can be adapted to address risk in many contexts, and this adaptability is reflected in the range in disciplinary perspectives in the published literature. This article presents the results of a literature search and discusses a range of selected work with the intention to give a broad overview of relevant topics and provide a starting point for researchers interested in CRA applications.

Post-apartheid population policies shifted away from population control to aligning policies to the global agenda that placed emphasis on the link between population and development. The focus on population and development polices in post-apartheid South Africa is on social equality, justice and peace rather than controlling sections of the population. Given the shift, this paper interrogates the conceptions of contraceptive use among rural communities in KwaZulu-Natal. Our primary objective is to understand the dynamics surrounding access to and use of family planning services in peri-urban and rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal. Using focus group data, the findings of the study suggest that different social categories interact with the family planning programmes differently. How teenagers and married women perceive the value of family planning differs. Gender differences regarding the use of condoms are also evident. The paper attempts to grapple with the non-use of condoms despite the knowledge that these prevent pregnancy and provide protection from sexually-transmitted diseases. The contribution of this paper lies in its identification of socio-cultural factors and the political economy underlying the different attitudes towards contraceptive use in rural KwaZulu-Natal.

J	Lee, Y				Lee, Yeonjin			Does Context Matter? Literacy Disparities in Self-rated Health Using Evidence from 17 Developed Countries	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR			English	Article						self-rated health; adult literacy; cross-national survey; health expenditures; curriculum standardization	EDUCATIONAL-ATTAINMENT; CARE; IMPACT; MORTALITY; ADULTS; PARTICIPATION; EXPENDITURES; EFFICACY; OUTCOMES; RATINGS	Objectives: The study examines whether adult literacy skills predict self-rated health status beyond educational credentials in 17 developed countries using a cross-national survey, the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Methods: The study uses linear regression models with country-level fixed effects to predict self-rated health to account the unobserved country-level heterogeneity. A total of 73,806 respondents aged 25 to 65 were included in the analysis. Results: Although adult literacy is positively associated with better self-rated health in general, the strength of the relationship varies across nations. The literacy-related health inequalities are less severe in countries with the higher public share of health expenditures that may better address the needs of individuals with limited cognitive abilities. Curriculum standardization also contributes to reducing the literacy gradients in health by decreasing variations in skills obtained in school across individuals with different social origins. Conclusions: Overall, this study reveals that promoting equity in adult literacy skills is an important way to improve a population's health. Country-level differences in the strength of the relationship between literacy and self-rated health are systematically related to between-country differences in health financing and educational systems.

Psychometric measures often assess conceptually related facets of global overarching constructs based on the implicit or explicit assumption that these overarching constructs exist as global entities including conceptually related specificities mapped by the facets. Proper variable- and person-centered methodologies are required to adequately reflect the dimensionality of these constructs. We illustrate these approaches using employees' (N = 1077) ratings of their psychological wellbeing at work. The results supported the added value of the variable-centered approach proposed here, showing that employees' ratings of their own wellbeing simultaneously reflect a global overarching wellbeing construct, together with a variety of specific wellbeing dimensions. Similarly, the results show that anchoring person-centered analyses into these variable-centered results helps to achieve a more precise depiction of employees' wellbeing profiles. The variable-centered bifactor exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) framework provides a way to fully explore these sources of psychometric multidimensionality. Similarly, whenever constructs are characterized by the co-existence of overarching constructs with specific dimensions, it becomes important to properly disaggregate these two components in person-centered analyses. In this context, person-centered analyses need to be clearly anchored in the results of preliminary variable-centered analyses. Substantively, this study proposes an improved representation of employees' wellbeing at work. Methodologically, this study aims to pedagogically illustrate the application of recent methodological innovations to organizational researchers.	[Morin, Alexandre J.

Economic growth and obesity in South African adults: an ecological analysis between 1994 and 2014	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							DISEASE RISK-FACTORS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; NUTRITION TRANSITION; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; INCOME INEQUALITY; CIVIL-SERVANTS; WHITEHALL-II; LIFE-STYLE; HEALTH	Background: To assess the trend associations between South Africa's economic growth using various economic growth indicators (EGIs) with adult obesity prevalence over a specified period of time. Methods: Data for obesity levels reported were obtained from national surveys conducted in South African adults in 1998, 2003 and 2012. EGIs incorporated in the current analysis were obtained from the World Bank and IHS Global insight databases. Obesity prevalence is presented by gender, urbanisation level and ethnicity. EGIs congruent to the time points where obesity data are available are presented. Unadjusted time trend plots were applied to assess associations between obesity prevalence and EGIs by gender, urbanisation level and ethnicity. Results: Females present higher levels of obesity relative to males for all time points. For both males and females, an overall increase in prevalence was observed in both rural and urban settings over-time, with urban dwellers presenting higher obesity levels. An overall increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE) per capita was observed. The Gini coefficient for all ethnicities except the White population increased between 1998 and 2003 but declined by 2012. Overtime per capita GDP and HFCE increased with increasing obesity prevalence in both genders. The trend association between the Gini coefficient for all ethnicities and obesity prevalence was similar for both genders in that as the Gini coefficient increased obesity prevalence declined, and when the coefficient decreased obesity prevalence increased. Conclusion: Trend associations exist between South Africa's economic growth and adult obesity.

L&D relies on modified working practices with key delivery partners, especially the police. Service evaluation data is thus presented from both police and health services. Method: A before and after intervention review of 3 months of operational data of L&D in Cornwall focusing on health, criminal and economic outcomes. Results: After L&D intervention individuals' contact with the police as either victim or perpetrator reduced significantly. Implications: Preliminary findings suggest that L&D enabled reduced use of police and criminal justice resources. National reporting procedures may be unable to demonstrate the multi-agency impact if criminal justice data are not considered within the outcome data-set. Recommendations echo international observations that specifying outcome measures and the consistent definition of L&D services would enable generalisation of findings.

I argue that the values underpinning the project align with those of Mad Studies, a field that is located as an emerging academic discipline within disability studies. The article seeks to problematise the conceptual frameworks available to a researcher working within theatre and disability in the global South. As a researcher, I may choose the framework of madness' as part of a social justice research stance. However, in a South African context of little to no psychiatric survivor/consumer activism, this may not in any way be adopted, understood, or claimed by any of the people who suffer madness' and with whom I create theatre. This article seeks to provoke questions around applied theatre disability research and the potential for research practices to de/re colonise.

To provide evidence on how nations vary in terms of accessing PHC, the aim of this study is to describe the extent to which barriers to access were experienced by adults in Australia compared with other countries. Communities participating in an international research project on PHC access interventions were engaged to prioritise questions from the 2013 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey within a framework that conceptualises access across dimensions of approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability and appropriateness. Logistic regression models, with barriers to access as outcomes, found measures of availability to be a problematic dimension in Australia; 27% of adults experienced difficulties with out-of-hours access, which was higher than 5 of 10 comparator countries. Although less prevalent, affordability was also perceived as a substantial barrier; 16% of Australians said they had forgone health care due to cost in the previous year. After adjusting for age and health status, this barrier was more common in Australia than 7 of 10 countries. Findings of this integrated assessment of barriers to access offer insights for policymakers and researchers on Australia's international performance in this crucial PHC domain.

J	Skorecki, K; Horton, R				Skorecki, Karl; Horton, Richard			Israel: health and beyond	LANCET			English	Article							WORKFORCE; MEDICINE; OFFLINE; ARAB	The principle that global human identity and dignity supersede other values is a broadly accepted conviction that guides practice and policies in the realm of human health in most of the world. An assessment of the level of success that Israel has achieved in health, in the face of formidable challenges, including rapid population growth, diverse and often divided ethnic affiliations, and existential security threats, leads us to propose that extension of this principle of global human identity and dignity, together with the objective of a decent society, as overriding values beyond health to other domains of human endeavour within Israel and in its relations with neighbouring peoples, represents an entirely achievable imperative. The result will be to further advance Israel's aspiration to serve as a model for societal decency with wide international acceptance and engagement. We have identified several determinants of Israel's advancement in health, including: articulation of a clear vision, national purpose, and long-term commitment that seeks to take the health of its citizens seriously; a multi-ethnic population that brings diversity and energy to national progress; a political democracy, which is characterised by robust debate and discussion about the nation's future; national legislation governing cardinal health-care processes; cultural and religious histories that respect and revere scholarship, learning, research, and charitable donation; an expanding economy, with recent but increasing appreciation of the economic, social, and political underpinnings of health and health inequalities; a strong base of international support from the Diaspora Jewish community; and a strong desire for acceptance by the international community in key arenas, especially science and health. As a result, despite the fewer than seven decades since its establishment, Israel has achieved important milestones in health. Nevertheless, this trajectory of achievement is threatened by several serious challenges, including the capacity to sustain high-quality universal health coverage, especially for an ageing population living with multiple comorbidities in the face of a stagnant level of the percentage of treasury funding to health care at a level that is well below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; ever-increasing transfer of services and care covered by the mandatory public health services basket to private programmes; insufficient progress in resolving health disparities among and between communities, populations, and regions of the country congruent with disparities in income and employment; gender inequities; a looming increase in the already alarming shortfall in health-care professionals; and failure to match inpatient and acute care facilities to manage growing needs. These challenges within Israel are magnified in the context of health disparities with the neighbouring Palestinian population, a situation in which ongoing-but fragile and limited-health cooperation and training arrangements cannot stand in for a solution that will address Palestinian national aspirations. We come away from this Series with a great sense of optimism, but with specific recommendations that are based on the foregoing challenges. We believe that by increasing the investment in the health sector, which includes investing in the societal, political, educational, and environmental underpinnings of health, far more can be achieved to move Israel to a model international leadership position in health care, education, and research, and turn health into an engine for economic wellbeing and development. Religious leadership in Israel, with its formidable political influence, can be harnessed to promote health initiatives in areas ranging from smoking cessation and healthy diet to organ transplantation, and most of all condemnation of hostility and its replacement by peaceful resolution of even the deepest conflicts. Most of all, this Series showed that there is an enormous opportunity, which Israel can lead, to leverage the universally accepted principles of health as a sanctuary against conflict and inequity, to achieve a brighter future for a deeply troubled region of the world.

Design Retrospective demographic analysis using aggregated data. Setting National civil registration systems in member states of the World Health Organization. Participants 52 populations with moderate to high quality data on cause specific mortality. Main outcome measures Disease specific contributions to changes in life expectancy in ages 40-84 (LE40-84) over time in populations grouped by two levels of Human Development Index (HDI) values. Results Declining CVD mortality rates during 1981-2010 contributed to, on average, over half of the gains in LE40-84; the corresponding gains were 2.3 (men) and 1.7 (women) years, and 0.5 (men) and 0.8 (women) years in very high and medium and high HDI populations, respectively. Declines in cancer mortality rates contributed to, on average, 20% of the gains in LE40-84, or 0.8 (men) and 0.5 (women) years in very high HDI populations, and to over 10% or 0.2 years (both sexes) in medium and high HDI populations. Declining lung cancer mortality rates brought about the largest LE40-84 gain in men in very high HDI populations (up to 0.7 years in the Netherlands), whereas in medium and high HDI populations its contribution was smaller yet still positive. Among women, declines in breast cancer mortality rates were largely responsible for the improvement in longevity, particularly among very high HDI populations (up to 0.3 years in the United Kingdom). In contrast, losses in LE40-84 were observed in many medium and high HDI populations as a result of increasing breast cancer mortality rates. Conclusions The control of CVD has led to substantial gains in LE40-84 worldwide. The inequality in improvement in longevity attributed to declining cancer mortality rates reflects inequities in implementation of cancer control, particularly in less resourced populations and in women. Global actions are needed to revitalize efforts for cancer control, with a specific focus on less resourced countries.

Through a culturally centered ethnographic examination of the ways in which family members left behind in a village in China make sense of their (in) access to health services, we seek to develop an understanding of China's new rural cooperative medical scheme (NCMS). Although structures have been theorized in earlier CCA projects, this article specifically focuses on the interpretations of health services under a newly introduced health policy framework. To our knowledge, this is the first culture-centered study of negotiations of health services in rural China amid the ongoing health reforms as China opens up to a global market economy and undergoes market reforms in the public sectors (e.g., health, education). Voices of community members point toward the inequities constituted in the structures of NCMS, corruption introduced by the transformation to a monetary economy from a cooperative-based economy of health care, and agentic expressions that imagine alternative structures of organizing health and care.

FAIR RESOURCE ALLOCATION TO HEALTH RESEARCH: PRIORITY TOPICS FOR BIOETHICS SCHOLARSHIP	BIOETHICS			English	Article						resource allocation; health research; ethics; health justice; fairness; equity	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; CHALLENGES; COVERAGE; JUSTICE; EQUITY; IMPACT	This article draws attention to the limited amount of scholarship on what constitutes fairness and equity in resource allocation to health research by individual funders. It identifies three key decisions of ethical significance about resource allocation that research funders make regularly and calls for prioritizing scholarship on those topics - namely, how health resources should be fairly apportioned amongst public health and health care delivery versus health research, how health research resources should be fairly allocated between health problems experienced domestically versus other health problems typically experienced by disadvantaged populations outside the funder's country, and how domestic and non-domestic health research funding should be further apportioned to different areas, e.g. types of research and recipients. These three topics should be priorities for bioethics research because their outcomes have a substantial bearing on the achievement of health justice. The proposed agenda aims to move discussion on the ethics of health research funding beyond its current focus on the mismatch between worldwide basic and clinical research investment and the global burden of disease. Individual funders' decision-making on whether and to what extent to allocate resources to non-domestic health research, health systems research, research on the social determinants of health, capacity development, and recipients in certain countries should also be the focus of ethical scrutiny.

Educational inequalities in self-rated health across US states and European countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						International comparison; Self-rated health; Health inequalities; Spatial inequalities	LIFE EXPECTANCY; UNITED-STATES; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; INCOME INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; DISADVANTAGE; DISPARITIES; AMERICANS; DISEASE; ADULTS	The US shows a distinct health disadvantage when compared to other high-income nations. A potential lever to reduce this disadvantage is to improve the health situation of lower socioeconomic groups. Our objective is to explore how the considerable within-US variation in health inequalities compares to the health inequalities across other Western countries. Representative survey data from 44 European countries and the US federal states were obtained from the fourth wave of the European Values Study (EVS) and the 2008 wave of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Using binary logistic regression, we analyze different forms of educational inequalities in self-rated health (SRH), adjusted for age and sex. The extent of educational inequalities in SRH varies considerably over European countries and US states; with US states in general showing greater inequality, however, differences between US states and European countries are less clear than commonly assumed. The US has considerable differences in educational inequalities in SRH across geographic locations. To understand the reasons for the US health disadvantage, comparative research has to take into account the vast variation in health inequalities within the US.

Objective of the study was to investigate variation of self-perceived health status in Italians and immigrants during the economic global crisis, focusing on demographic and socioeconomic factors. Methods: Through a cross-sectional design we analyzed the national sample of multipurpose surveys "Health conditions and use of health services" (2005 and 2013) conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores, derived from SF-12 questionnaire, were assumed as study outcome, dichotomizing variables distribution at 1st quartile. Prevalence rate ratios (PRR) were estimated through log-binomial regression models, stratified by citizenship and gender, evaluating the association between PCS and MCS with surveys' year, adjusting for age, educational level, employment status, self-perceived economic resources, smoking habits, body mass index. Results: From 2005 to 2013 the proportion of people not employed or reporting scarce/insufficient economic resources increased, especially among men, in particular immigrants. Compared with 2005 we observed in 2013 among Italians a significant lower probability of worse PCS (PRR = 0.96 both for males and females), while no differences were observed among immigrants; a higher probability of worse MCS was observed, particularly among men (Italians: PRR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.22-1.29; immigrants: PRR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03-1.38). Self-perceived scarce/insufficient economic resources were strongly and significantly associated with worse PCS and MCS for all subgroups. Lower educational level was strongly associated with worse PCS in Italians and slightly associated with worse MCS for all subgroups. Being not employed was associated with worse health status, especially mental health among men. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that economic global crisis could have negatively affected health status, particularly mental health, of Italians and immigrants. Furthermore, results suggest socioeconomic inequalities increase, in economic resources availability dimension. In a context of public health resources' limitation due to financial crisis, policy decision makers and health service managers must face the challenge of equity in health.

J	Bosch-Capblanch, X; Zuske, MK; Auer, C				Bosch-Capblanch, Xavier; Zuske, Meike-Kathrin; Auer, Christian			Research on subgroups is not research on equity attributes: Evidence from an overview of systematic reviews on vaccination	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Review							SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; HEALTH INTERVENTIONS; COVERAGE; INCOME	Background: Equity remains a priority in the international health development agenda. However, major inequities in vaccination coverage jeopardise the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We aim at comprehensively describing how research has addressed equity issues related to vaccination. Methods: We carried out an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) that explicitly explored the effects of interventions to improve vaccination in any context; for any vaccine and, in any language. We followed standard research synthesis methods to systematically search for SR, assess them for inclusion and extracting relevant data, particularly on vaccination related outcomes. To gather evidence on equity issues addressed in the SR, we used the PROGRESS-plus framework. Findings: Our search obtained 2,003 hits which resulted in 54 included SRs, published between 1994 and 2014. The quality of SRs was generally poor, with less than half complying with most of the quality criteria. Reported vaccines included, by order of frequency, influenza and Expanded Programme on Immunisation vaccines. The types of interventions more frequently reported were related to vaccination delivery strategies, financial support and information, education and communication. Most of the SRs suggested effects favouring intervention groups as opposed to comparison groups. The most frequently reported equity attribute was 'place of residence' and the least reported equity attributes were sexual orientation and religion. Very few estimates of effects actually measured differences or changes between groups having those attributes and all of them referred to the place of residence. No data was found about reducing equity gaps for vulnerable groups or minorities, or attributes such as sexual orientation, education or specific religious groups. Conclusions: Although research on vulnerable populations as a subgroup is abundant, it fails to report on the interventions that will actually reduce inequities and consider how redistribution of health care resources could shrink the gap between the privileged and most vulnerable groups including minorities. Research, if aiming at being responsive to global health policy trends, needs to report not only on specific attributes but also on how a better redistribution of health care resources could contribute to alleviating the unjust situation of the most vulnerable populations.

The role of academic health centres in building equitable health systems: a systematic review protocol	BMJ OPEN			English	Review							ORGANIZATIONAL MODELS; SCIENCE CENTERS; POPULATION HEALTH; MEDICAL-SCHOOL	Introduction Academic health centres (AHCs) are complex organisations often defined by their 'tripartite' mission: to achieve high standards of clinical care, undertake clinical and laboratory research and educate health professionals. In the last decade, AHCs have moved away from what was a dominant focus on high impact (clinical) interventions for individuals, towards a more population-oriented paradigm requiring networked institutions and responsiveness to a range of issues including distribution of health outcomes and health determinants. Reflective of this paradigm shift is a growing interest in the role of AHCs in addressing health disparities and improving health system equity. This protocol outlines a systematic review that seeks to synthesise and critically appraise the current state of evidence on the role of AHCs in contributing to equitable health systems locally and globally. Methods and analysis Electronic searches will be conducted on a pilot list of bibliographic databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, ERIC, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, Cochrane Library, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Campbell Library and A+ Education, from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2016. Apart from studies reporting clinical interventions or trials, all types of published peer-reviewed and grey literature will be included in the review. The single screening method will be employed in selecting studies, with two additional reviewers consulted where allocation is unclear. Quality and relevance appraisal utilising Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools will follow data extraction to a preprepared template. Thematic synthesis will be undertaken to develop descriptive themes and inform analysis. Ethics and dissemination As the review is focused on the analysis of secondary data, it does not require ethics approval. The results of the study will be disseminated through articles in peer-reviewed journals and trade publications as well as presentations at relevant national and international conferences. Results will be further disseminated through networks and associations of AHCs. Protocol registration International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) number CRD42016051802.

It was implemented in the context of the National Insecticide Treated Nets (NATNETS) Programme and was the main keep up strategy for vulnerable populations. Case description: The programme design was adjusted considerably over time to incorporate new evidence, shifting public health policies, and changing donor priorities. Three TNVS models can be distinguished: (1) the fixed discount; (2) the fixed top-up; (3) the hybrid voucher model. The changes improved equity and effectiveness, but also had a profound effect on how the programme was managed and implemented. Results: The TNVS reached the majority of beneficiaries with vouchers, and significantly increased household ownership and use of LLINs. While two mass distribution campaigns implemented between 2009 and 2011 achieved universal coverage and equity, the TNVS ensured continuous protection of the vulnerable populations before, during and after the campaigns. The TNVS stimulated and maintained a large national retail network which managed the LLIN supply chain. Discussion and lessons learned: The effectiveness of the TNVS was a function of several interdependent factors, including the supply chain of vouchers through the public health system; the supply chain of nets in the commercial sector; the demand for nets from voucher recipients; management and risk mitigation measures; and the influence of global and donor objectives. Conclusion: The TNVS was a highly innovative and globally influential programme, which stimulated the thinking around effectively and equitably distributing ITNs, and contributed directly to the evolution of global policy. It was a fundamental component of the NATNETS programme which protected a malaria-vulnerable population for over a decade.

In this study, we explore trends in the expansion of water and sanitation coverage in developing countries and the performance of ODA. Design: We explored inequality across developing countries by income level, and investigated how ODA for water and sanitation was committed by country, region, and income level. Changes in inequality were tested via slope changes by investigating the interaction of year and income level with a likelihood ratio test. A random effects model was applied according to the results of the Hausman test. Results: The slope of the linear trend between economic level and sanitation coverage has declined over time. However, a random effects model suggested that the change in slope across years was not significant (e.g. for the slope change between 2000 and 2010: likelihood ratio X-2 = 2.49, probability > X-2 = 0.1146). A similar pro-rich pattern across developing countries and a non-significant change in the slope associated with different economic levels were demonstrated for water coverage. Our analysis shows that the inequality of water and sanitation coverage among countries across the world has not been addressed effectively during the past decade. Our findings demonstrate that the countries with the least coverage persistently received far less ODA per capita than did countries with much more extensive water and sanitation coverage, suggesting that ODA for water and sanitation is poorly targeted. Conclusion: The most deprived countries should receive more attention for water and sanitation improvements from the world health community. A strong political commitment to ODA targeting the countries with the least coverage is needed at the global level.

Using Bardin's method of document analysis, it was focused on the findings of Canadian qualitative studies published in French or English from 2005 to 2011. Boltanski's theory on social uses of the body inspired the analysis. Living with a chronic disease threatens men's sense of masculinity and self-image, as well as their perceived ability to fulfill expected social roles. Social images of men's bodies influence how men express their emotions, attributes, and attitudes, or acknowledge the need for and seek social affirmation. Self-management has been documented in Canadian qualitative literature as a complex phenomenon influenced by the social environment, personal capacities, feelings, perceptions, and potentials. The extent of how all these features interact within the scope of men's mental and physical health and illness experiences was partially revealed in this study. The findings underscore the social invisibility of men's bodies, especially those of men facing social inequities. Attending to principles of social justice can ensure that future research on men's health will amplify the range of men's voices and allow them to be heard. Recommendations address also the international scientific community interested in advancing men's health research, especially in those countries that lack a national men's health policy.

Socioeconomic inequalities in caries experience, care level and dental attendance in primary school children in Belgium: a cross-sectional survey	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							ORAL-HEALTH; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; GLOBAL BURDEN; METAANALYSIS; IMPACT	Objectives Oral health inequality in children is a widespread and well-documented problem in oral healthcare. However, objective and reliable methods to determine these inequalities in all oral health aspects, including both dental attendance and oral health, are rather scarce. Aims To explore oral health inequalities and to assess the impact of socioeconomic factors on oral health, oral health behaviour and dental compliance of primary school children. Methods Data collection was executed in 2014 within a sample of 2216 children in 105 primary schools in Flanders, by means of an oral examination and a validated questionnaire. Intermutual Agency database was consulted to objectively determine individuals' social state and frequency of utilisation of oral healthcare services. Underprivileged children were compared with more fortunate children for their mean DMFt, DMFs, plaque index, care index (C, restorative index (RI), treatment index (TI), knowledge and attitude. Differences in proportions for dichotomous variables (RI100%, TI100% and being a regular dental attender) were analysed. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Ghent (2010/061). All parents signed an informed consent form prior to data collection. All schools received information about the study protocol and agreed to participate. Children requiring dental treatment or periodic recall were referred to the local dentist. Results Underprivileged children had higher D1MFT (95% CI 0.87 to 1.36), D3MT (95% CI 0.30 to 0.64), plaque scores (95% CI 0.12 to 0.23) and lower care level (p< 0.02). In the low- income group, 78.4% was caries-free, compared with 88.4% for the other children. Half of the low- income children could be considered as regular dental attenders, while 12.6% did not have any dental visit during a 5-year period. Conclusion Oral health, oral hygiene, oral healthcare level and dental attendance patterns are negatively affected by children's social class, leading to oral health inequalities in Belgian primary school children.

We hypothesize that tracking environmental exposures over time and space (dynamic exposure) is key to assessing total exposure. This study compares breast cancer survivors' exposure to walkable and recreation- promoting environments using dynamic Global Positioning System (GPS) and static home- based measures of exposure in relation to insulin resistance. Methods: GPS data from 249 breast cancer survivors living in San Diego County were collected for one week along with fasting blood draw. Exposure to recreation spaces and walkability was measured for each woman's home address within an 800mbuffer (static), and using a kernel density weight of GPS tracks (dynamic). Participants' exposure estimates were related to insulin resistance (using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, HOMA-IR) controlled by age and body mass index (BMI) in linear regression models. Results: The dynamic measurement method resulted in greater variability in built environment exposure values than did the static method. Regression results showed no association between HOMA-IR and home-based, static measures of walkability and recreation area exposure. GPS-based dynamic measures of both walkability and recreation area were significantly associated with lower HOMA-IR (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Dynamic exposure measurements may provide important evidence for community-and individual-level interventions that can address cancer risk inequities arising from environments wherein breast cancer survivors live and engage. Impact: This is the first study to compare associations of dynamic versus static built environment exposure measures with insulin outcomes in breast cancer survivors. (C) 2017 AACR.

J	Barreto, ML				Barreto, Mauricio Lima			Health inequalities: a global perspective	CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA			English	Article						Health inequalities; Social determinants of health; Social inequity; Global health	MORTALITY	The objective of this article is to present health inequalities as a global problem which afflicts the populations of the poorest countries, but also those of the richest countries, and whose persistence represents one of the most serious and challenging health problems worldwide. Two components of global inequalities are highlighted: inequalities between groups within the same society, and inequalities between nations. The understanding that many of these inequalities are unjust, and therefore inequities, is largely derived from the inequalities that are identified between the various social groups of a given society. Inequalities between different societies and nations, while relevant and often of greater magnitude, are not always considered to be unjust. There have been several proposed solutions, which vary according to different theoretical interpretations and explanations. At the global level, the most plausible thesis has focused on improving global governance mechanisms. While that latter are attractive and have some arguments in their favor, they are insufficient because they do not incorporate an understanding of how the historical process of the constitution of the nations occurred and the importance of the position of each country in the global productive system.

The burden of disease attributable to HAP was quantified by the comparative risk assessment method using four inputs: (1) exposure to HAP, (2) the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), (3) exposure-response relationships of related causes (4) disease burden of related causes. All across the country, solid fuel use decreased from 5.26% in 1990 to 0.15% in 2013. The drastic reduction of solid fuel use leaded to DALYs attributable to HAP fell by 97.8% (95% uncertainty interval 97.7-98.0%) from 87,433 (51072-144303) in 1990 to 1889 (1016-3247) in 2013. Proportion of YLLs in DALYs from HAP decreased from 95.7% in 1990 to 86.6% in 2013. Contribution of causes in the attributable DALYs was variable during the study period and in 2013 was in the following order: ischemic heart disease for 43.4%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for 24.7%, hemorrhagic stroke for 9.7%, lower respiratory infections for 9.3%, ischemic stroke for 7.8%, lung cancer for 3.4% and cataract for 1.8%. Based on the Gini coefficient, the spatial inequality of the disease burden from HAP increased during the study period. The remained burden of disease was relatively scarce and it mainly occurred in seven southern provinces. Further reduction of the disease burden from HAP as well as compensation of the increasing spatial inequality in Iran could be attained through an especial plan for providing cleaner fuels in the southern provinces.

J	Pratt, B; Paul, A; Hyder, AA; Ali, J				Pratt, Bridget; Paul, Amy; Hyder, Adnan A.; Ali, Joseph			Ethics of health policy and systems research: a scoping review of the literature	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Review						Developing countries; ethics; ethical guidance; health policy and systems research; research ethics committee; scoping review	MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; CLUSTER RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; SERVICES RESEARCH; INFORMED-CONSENT; GLOBAL JUSTICE; ANCILLARY CARE; CHALLENGES; MULTICENTER; GOVERNANCE	Health policy and systems research (HPSR) is increasingly funded and undertaken as part of health system strengthening efforts worldwide. HPSR ethics is also a relatively new and emerging field, with numerous normative and descriptive questions that have largely not been considered. Normative questions include what ethical principles and values should guide HPSR. Descriptive questions include what ethical concerns arise when conducting HPSR. A small but growing body of scholarly work characterizes the various ethics issues inherent in HPSR. Towards informing the future development of ethics guidance for HPSR, a scoping review was undertaken to: (1) identify the range of ethics issues relevant to the conduct of HPSR-with a deliberate (though not exclusive) focus on low- and middle-income country settings and (2) describe existing guidance on key ethics issues relevant to HPSR. Using the Cochrane methods as a basis, the review identified formal and informal literature on HPSR ethics by searching the following databases: PubMed's Medline, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, WHO Global Health Regional Libraries, LILACs, OpenDOAR and Bielefeld Academic Search Engine. In total, 11 062 documents were identified from the formal (10 519) and informal (543) literature. One hundred and seven of these documents (formal 99 and informal 8) met at least one inclusion criterion and underwent thematic analysis. Ethical issues in four main categories were identified: upholding autonomy, identifying and balancing risks and benefits, justice and determination of ethical review requirements. The review indicated that the ethical values behind HPSR place an emphasis on its contributing to the reduction of health disparities. Unsurprisingly then, numerous ethical concerns relating to justice arise in HPSR. However, the majority of existing guidance focuses on obtaining or waiving informed consent and, thus, appears to be insufficient for HPSR. A list of priority ethics issues in HPSR in need of guidance development is provided.

Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Model Based Fault Estimation and Signal Compensation With Application to Wind Turbines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Robust fault estimation; signal compensation; Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model; wind turbines	OBSERVER DESIGN; TOLERANT CONTROL; SYSTEMS; DIAGNOSIS; RECONSTRUCTION; STATE	In response to the high demand of the operation reliability by implementing real-time monitoring and system health management, a robust fault estimation and fault-tolerant control approach is proposed for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems in this study, by integrating the augmented system method, unknown input fuzzy observer design, linear matrix inequality optimization, and signal compensation techniques. Specifically, a fuzzy augmented system method is used to construct an augmented plant with the concerned faults and system states being the augmented states. An unknown input fuzzy observer technique is thus utilized to estimate the augmented states and decouple unknown inputs that can be decoupled. A linear matrix inequality approach is further addressed to ensure the global stability of the estimation error dynamics and attenuate the influences from the unknown inputs that cannot be decoupled. As a result, the robust estimates of the concerned faults and system states can be obtained simultaneously. Based on the fault estimates, a signal compensation scheme is developed to remove the effects of the faults on the system dynamics and outputs, leading to a stable dynamic satisfying the expected performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed Takagi-Sugeno model based fault estimation and signal compensation algorithms is demonstrated by a case study on a 4.8-MW wind turbine benchmark system.

We identified trajectories of childhood family income over a 12-year period, and examined associations between these trajectories and later psychiatric disorders, among individuals born in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 (n=534 294). Methods We used annual income data between the ages of 3-14 years and identified 5 trajectories (2 high-income upward, 1 downward and 2 low-income upward trajectories). Psychiatric disorders in the follow-up period after age 15 were defined from International Classification of Disease (ICD)-codes in a nationwide patient register. Multiadjusted risks for all psychiatric disorders, as well as for specific psychiatric diagnoses, were calculated as HRs with 95% CIs. Results Of the 5 identified income trajectories, the constant low and the downward trajectories were particularly associated with later psychiatric disorder. Children with these trajectories had increased risks for psychiatric disorder, including mood, anxiety, psychotic disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The association remained, even after adjusting for important variables including parental psychiatric disorder. In contrast, the relationship was reversed for eating disorders, for which children in higher income trajectories had elevated risks. Conclusions Findings show that children growing up in a household characterised by low or decreasing family income have an increased risk for psychiatric disorder. Continued work is needed to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in psychiatric disorders. Policies and interventions for psychiatric disorders should consider the socioeconomic background of the family as an important risk or protective factor.

By dealing with such heterogeneity through a systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine the association between income inequality, mental health problems, use of mental health services, and resilience (defined as the ability to cope with adversity). Methods We searched the Global Health, PsychARTICLES, PsycINFO, Social Policy and Practice, Embase and MEDLINE databases up to July 6, 2016, for quantitative studies of the association of income inequality with prevalence or incidence of mental disorders or mental health problems, use of mental health services, and resilience. Eligible studies used standardised instruments at the individual level, and income inequality at the aggregated, contextual, and ecological level. We extracted study characteristics, sampling, exposure, outcomes, statistical modelling, and parameters from articles. Because several studies did not provide enough statistical information to be included in a meta-analysis, we did a narrative synthesis to summarise results with studies categorised as showing either a positive association, mixed results, or no association. The primary outcome in the random-effects meta-analysis was mental health-related morbidity, defined as the prevalence or incidence of any mental health problem. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016036377. Findings Our search identified 15 615 non-duplicate references, of which 113 were deemed potentially relevant and were assessed for eligibility, leading to the inclusion of 27 studies in the qualitative synthesis. Nine articles found a positive association between income inequality and the prevalence or incidence of mental health problems; ten articles found mixed results, with positive association in some subgroups and non-significant or negative association in other subgroups; and eight articles found no association between income inequality and mental health problems. Of the nine articles included in our meta-analysis, one reported a positive association between income inequality and mental health problems, six reported mixed results, and two reported no association. Pooled Cohen's d effect sizes for the association between income inequality and any mental disorder or mental health problems were 0.06 (95% CI 0.01-0.11) for any mental disorder, and 0.12 (0.05-0.20) for depressive disorders. Our meta-regression analysis showed that none of the factors considered (sample size, contextual level at which income inequality was assessed, quality assessment, type of instruments, and individual income as control variable) explained heterogeneity between studies (I-2 89.3%; p<0.0001). Only one study investigated the association between income inequality and resilience; it found greater income inequality was associated with higher prevalence of depression only among individuals with low income. The only study of the role of income inequality as a determinant of the use of mental health services reported no association. Interpretation Income inequality negatively affects mental health but the effect sizes are small and there is marked heterogeneity among studies. If this association is causal and growing income inequality does lead to an increase in the prevalence of mental health problems, then its reduction could result in a significant improvement in population wellbeing.

By applying the bounds test approach to cointegration we found in both countries a long-run but not a statistically significant relationship between income inequality and CO2 emissions both in the long-run and in the short-run. The robustness of our cointegration results is also ascertained by using three different long-run tests. Furthermore, applying the variance decomposition analysis to examine the dynamic causal relationship between the Gini coefficient of income distribution and CO2 emissions, we found that income inequality was the least important factor in determining CO2 emissions and that there was no causality running in any direction between CO2 emissions and income inequality in both countries. Still income and energy consumption are the major determinants of CO2 emissions in both countries. Nevertheless, even though the evidence is not statistically significant, in the case of China it indicates that reducing income inequality can have a positive impact on environmental quality, while in India redistributing income to improve environmental degradation may not be effective.

Intimate partner violence and mental ill health among global populations of Indigenous women: a systematic review	SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Systematic review; Indigenous women; Intimate partner violence; Mental health	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA SCALE; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE; PHYSICAL ABUSE; PREVALENCE; CONSEQUENCES; MULTICOUNTRY; ASSOCIATIONS; ALCOHOLISM	Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been recognised as a major obstacle to the achievement of gender equality and human development. Its adverse physical and mental health consequences have been reported to affect women of all ages and backgrounds. Although Indigenous women seem to experience higher rates of partner abuse than non-Indigenous women, mental health consequences of IPV among this population are not yet clearly established in the literature. This study systematically reviewed the global literature on mental health outcomes and risk factors for mental ill health among Indigenous women who experienced IPV. Primary quantitative and mixed methods studies that reported about mental health and IPV among Indigenous women (aged 14+) were included. 21 bibliographic databases were searched until January 2017. Quality of included studies was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Findings are reported according to PRISMA-P 2015. 13 studies were identified. The majority of studies reported very high rates of IPV and high prevalence of mental disorders. The most frequently identified types of IPV were physical and/or sexual violence, verbal aggression, and emotional abuse. The strongest predictor of poor mental health was physical violence. The most commonly reported mental health outcomes were depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite the small number of studies identified, the available evidence suggests that experiences of IPV and mental disorders among Indigenous women are linked and exacerbated by poverty, discrimination, and substance abuse. More research is needed to better understand distributions and presentations of IPV-related mental illness in this population.

The paper introduces the notions of policyscape and policy magic to explain ways in which thinking about both policy problems and solutions in education is discursively constrained. Analysis of boundaries is presented as a means of revealing and prospectively challenging such constraint. Research findings from projects spanning different international contexts and phases of education are analysed to illustrate complex inter-relationships between a series of knowledge boundaries that variously define the policy and pedagogical directions that can legitimately be pursued in physical education. The paper presents a case for further critical research and policy action in physical education that draws insight from education policy sociology and that examines ways in which equity in physical education is being (re-) framed by broader policy processes and contexts.

Compared with a uniform delay, some argue that those who have entered precociously the labor market should be allowed to retire earlier. They assert that such a 'long career' exception is all the more justified that those unskilled workers live also less long due to heavier and potentially health-damaging jobs. In this paper, we then study macroeconomic and distributional consequences of global gain in life expectancy, with or without the postponement of the legal age of retirement and with or without a 'long career' exception. By considering a framework where individuals decide to acquire skills depending on economic incentives and differential mortality, we focus particularly on spillover effects possibly generated by education. We show in particular that introducing a 'long career' exception cannot be to the advantage of future unskilled workers unless education yields no spillover effects.

Health activism against barriers to indigenous health in Aotearoa New Zealand	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Anti-racism; racism; advocacy; indigenous people; resistance; inequalities	DISPARITIES; RACISM	Racism and government policies of colonisation and assimilation contribute to the disproportionate burden of disease carried by indigenous people globally. In colonial contexts such as Aotearoa New Zealand, these inequities are routinely monitored but governments believe economic growth and better lifestyles will resolve the issues. Stop Institutional Racism (STIR), a group of health activists, is challenging this dominant discourse and building a boutique social movement to transform racism within the New Zealand public health sector. Central to the work of STIR is partnership between indigenous and non-indigenous practitioners underpinned by Te Tiriti o Waitangi - the founding document of the colonial state of New Zealand. This paper reflects on STIR organisational processes and political achievements to date. We have worked towards mobilising the public health sector, re-energising the conversation around racism and strengthening the capacity and evidence base of the sector around key sites of racism and anti-racism praxis. This paper will be of interest to others within the global public health community who are looking for new collective ways to organise and challenge entrenched inequities.	[Came, H.

Principal component analysis was conducted on data from adolescents in the Brazilian National Oral Health Survey (N = 5,445). Higher loadings were found for crowding (0.6), maxillary and mandibular irregularities (0.5), and count of communitary periodontal index (CPI) sextants with bleeding and dental calculus (0.5). The mean rates for periodontal and occlusal disorders were at least two times higher in adolescents from lower income families and those reporting the need for dental prostheses, as well as those dissatisfied with their dental and overall oral health. Increased mean rates of occlusal disorders were associated with schooling delay and history of toothache in the previous six months. The mean scores suggested accumulation of at least one of the negative oral health indicators in the lower income strata, among adolescents with schooling delay, and in those reporting dental needs. The results suggest priorities for planning and monitoring as a function of oral health requirements.

PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						One Health; zoonotic disease; policy; practice	ONE HEALTH; EMERGENCE; ZOONOSES; SURVEILLANCE; VACCINATION; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; POOR	Zoonotic diseases will maintain a high level of public policy attention in the coming decades. From the spectre of a global pandemic to anxieties over agricultural change, urbanization, social inequality and threats to natural ecosystems, effectively preparing and responding to endemic and emerging diseases will require technological, institutional and social innovation. Much current discussion emphasizes the need for a 'One Health' approach: bridging disciplines and sectors to tackle these complex dynamics. However, as attention has increased, so too has an appreciation of the practical challenges in linking multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral research with policy, action and impact. In this commentary paper, we reflect on these issues with particular reference to the African sub-continent. We structure the themes of our analysis on the existing literature, expert opinion and 11 interviews with leading One Health scholars and practitioners, conducted at an international symposium in 2016. We highlight a variety of challenges in research and knowledge production, in the difficult terrain of implementation and outreach, and in the politicized nature of decision-making and priority setting. We then turn our attention to a number of strategies that might help reconfigure current pathways and accepted norms of practice. These include: (i) challenging scientific expertise; (ii) strengthening national multi-sectoral coordination; (iii) building on what works; and (iv) re-framing policy narratives. We argue that bridging the research-policy-action interface in Africa, and better connecting zoonoses, ecosystems and well-being in the twenty-first century, will ultimately require greater attention to the democratization of science and public policy. This article is part of the themed issue 'One Health for a changing world: zoonoses, ecosystems and human well-being'.

How to influence the obesity landscape using health policies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Review							SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PREVENTION; INTERVENTIONS; POSITION	There is widespread acceptance that a significant and sustained impact on the growing global obesity burden requires implementation of a range of health policies to influence the obesity landscape. This acceptance is underpinned by the understanding that the obesity landscape is a complex interaction between the many factors that influence an individual's dietary intake and physical activity levels. Over the past decade we have seen increasing convergence in national and international recommendations on how to best improve this obesity landscape. In the past few years this has led to a noticeable increase in the implementation of these recommended national, state and local government policies. Here, we argue that to maximise the impact of population-level policies intended to improve diet and activity environments we need to see progress in a number of key areas, namely: broadening the range of environments that can be empowered to implement policy; improving our understanding of how best to combine multiple policies and interventions; and improving our understanding of the equity impact of these policies. We also argue that a key goal moving forward should be better capture and communication of the existing activities in order to more rapidly spread the uptake of these policies globally and at scale.

Accordingly, key components (i.e., policies, services and structures related to the communities' physical and social environments) should be designed to be age-friendly and help all aging adults to live safely, enjoy good health and stay involved in their communities. Although age-friendly communities are believed to be a promising way to help aging Canadians lead healthy and active lives, little is known about which key components best foster positive health, social participation and health equity, and their underlying mechanisms. This study aims to better understand which and how key components of age-friendly communities best foster positive health, social participation and health equity in aging Canadians. Specifically, the research objectives are to: 1) Describe and compare age-friendly key components of communities across Canada 2) Identify key components best associated with positive health, social participation and health equity of aging adults 3) Explore how these key components foster positive health, social participation and health equity Methods: A mixed-method sequential explanatory design will be used. The quantitative part will involve a survey of Canadian communities and secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). The survey will include an age-friendly questionnaire targeting key components in seven domains: physical environment, housing options, social environment, opportunities for participation, community supports and healthcare services, transportation options, communication and information. The CLSA is a large, national prospective study representative of the Canadian aging population designed to examine health transitions and trajectories of adults as they age. In the qualitative part, a multiple case study will be conducted in five Canadian communities performing best on positive health, social participation and health equity. Discussion: Building on new and existing collaborations and generating evidence from real-world interventions, the results of this project will help communities to promote age-friendly policies, services and structures which foster positive health, social participation and health equity at a population level.

J	Hastings, G				Hastings, Gerard			Rebels with a cause: the spiritual dimension of social marketing	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL MARKETING			English	Article						Health promotion; Social marketing; Marketing; Spirituality		Purpose - This paper aims to explore the spiritual dimension of social marketing. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a conceptual approach. Findings - The greatest problems humankind faces, from non-communicable diseases epidemics to global warming, are self-inflicted. Humans are voluntarily drinking sugar-sweetened beverages and driving SUVs which threaten our health and our planet. It need not be so. Historical experience and two millennia of thinking show we are capable of better. We all have within us the moral agency to make the right choice even when it is the difficult one; we just have to reconnect with it. Indeed, it is this capacity and desire "to follow after wisdom and virtue", to rebel against injustice and malignancy, that make us human and cements our collective identity. In the past century, this realisation was focused by the terrible events of Second World War and resulted in the formation of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Originality/value - This paper argues that these ideas of agency, morality and rights have fundamental implications for social marketing. We have to move beyond mere behaviour change and start thinking about people in the round - body, mind and spirit. Our job involves more than giving diets a healthy nudge or making the ecological option easy, fun and popular; we have to foster and encourage the innate human drive to think critically and act accordingly. We are not here to edit choice but to facilitate personal growth and social progress.

High-Resolution Air Pollution Mapping with Google Street View Cars: Exploiting Big Data	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PARTICLE NUMBER CONCENTRATIONS; BLACK CARBON; ULTRAFINE PARTICLES; GLOBAL BURDEN; MOBILE; EXPOSURE; URBAN; EMISSIONS; PM2.5; AREA	Air pollution affects billions of people worldwide, yet ambient pollution measurements are limited for much of the world. Urban air pollution concentrations vary sharply over short distances (<< 1 km) owing to unevenly distributed emission sources, dilution, and physicochemical transformations. Accordingly, even where present, conventional fixed-site pollution monitoring methods lack the spatial resolution needed to characterize heterogeneous human exposures and localized pollution hotspots. Here, we demonstrate a measurement approaCh to reveal urban air pollution patterns at 4-5 orders of magnitude greater spatial precision than possible with current central-site ambient monitoring. We equipped Google Street View vehicles with a fast-response pollution measurement platform and repeatedly sampled every street in a 30-km(2) area of Oakland, CA, developing the largest urban air quality data set of its type. Resulting maps of annual daytime NO, NO2, and black carbon at 30 m-scale reveal stable, persistent pollution patterns with surprisingly sharp small-Scale variability attributable to local sources, up to 5-8X within individual city blocks. Since local variation in air quality profoundly impacts public health and environmental equity, our results have important implications for how air pollution is measured and managed. If validated elsewhere, this readily scalable measurement approach could address major air quality data gaps worldwide.

Yet there is considerable variability in the vulnerability of countries around the world to these effects. We calculate a vulnerability index of 147 countries by drawing on the most recent data related to the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries. Building on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change framework for vulnerability, we first construct aggregate indices for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity using 12 primary variables. Seven out of the ten most vulnerable countries on the resulting index are Small Island Developing States, and the top quartile of the index includes countries located in Africa (17), Asia (7), North America and the Caribbean (4) and Oceania (8). More than 87% of least developed countries are found within the top half of the vulnerability index, while the bottom half includes all but one of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member states. This is primarily due to the tremendous variation in countries' adaptive capacity, as no such trends are evident from the exposure or sensitivity indices. A negative correlation exists between vulnerability and per capita carbon emissions, and the clustering of states at different levels of development across the vulnerability index suggests growing barriers to meeting global commitments to reducing inequality, promoting human well-being and ensuring sustainable cities and communities. The index provides a useful tool for prioritizing the allocation of climate finance, as well as activities aimed at capacity building and the transfer of marine technology.

A systematic review with meta-analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Review							MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; RISK-FACTORS; DIABETES-MELLITUS; TOBACCO USE; DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEILLANCE; SOCIAL NETWORKS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HEALTH	Background Chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have emerged as a huge global health problem in low- and middle-income countries. The magnitude of the rise of NCDs is particularly visible in Southeast Asia where limited resources have been used to address this rising epidemic, as in the case of Indonesia. Robust evidence to measure growing NCD-related burdens at national and local levels and to aid national discussion on social determinants of health and intra-country inequalities is needed. The aim of this review is (i) to illustrate the burden of risk factors, morbidity, disability, and mortality related to NCDs; (ii) to identify existing policy and community interventions, including disease prevention and management strategies; and (iii) to investigate how and why an inequitable distribution of this burden can be explained in terms of the social determinants of health. Methods Our review followed the PRISMA guidelines for identifying, screening, and checking the eligibility and quality of relevant literature. We systematically searched electronic databases and gray literature for English- and Indonesian-language studies published between Jan 1, 2000 and October 1, 2015. We synthesized included studies in the form of a narrative synthesis and where possible meta-analyzed their data. Results On the basis of deductive qualitative content analysis, 130 included citations were grouped into seven topic areas: risk factors; morbidity; disability; mortality; disease management; interventions and prevention; and social determinants of health. A quantitative synthesis meta-analyzed a subset of studies related to the risk factors smoking, obesity, and hypertension. Conclusions Our findings echo the urgent need to expand routine risk factor surveillance and outcome monitoring and to integrate these into one national health information system. There is a stringent necessity to reorient and enhance health system responses to offer effective, realistic, and affordable ways to prevent and control NCDs through cost-effective interventions and a more structured approach to the delivery of high-quality primary care and equitable prevention and treatment strategies. Research on social determinants of health and policy-relevant research need to be expanded and strengthened to the extent that a reduction of the total NCD burden and inequalities therein should be treated as related and mutually reinforcing priorities.

To identify dental pain prevalence and associated factors inMexican schoolchildren. Methods. This cross-sectional study included 1,404 schoolchildren aged 6 to 12 years from public schools in the city of Pachuca de Soto, Hidalgo, Mexico. Data were collected through a questionnaire that addressed sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, eating and dental hygiene habits, and behavior variables. The dependent variable was self-reported dental pain in the 12 months prior to the survey. Data were analyzed using nonparametric statistics and a binary logistical regressionmodel. Results. Dental pain prevalence among the studied children was 49.9%. The variables associated in the final model (P < 0.05) were younger mother's age, higher socioeconomic level, absence of an automobile in the home, fried food, fruit intake, lower tooth brushing frequency, never having used mouthwash or not knowing about it, and parents/guardians with regular to high levels of knowledge about oral health and a regular or good/very good perception of their child's oral health. Conclusions. One in two children in the study had experienced dental pain in the twelve months prior to the survey. The association of socioeconomic variables with dental pain suggested inequalities among the children in terms of oral health.

Historical research shows a negative association between the height of individuals and their birth order. This is frequently explained by the resource dilution hypothesis. However, we question the negative effect of birth order on growth patterns in contemporary Flanders, where the fertility decline has stabilized and policies supporting the family are well established. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to examine the influence of birth order on early child development - in terms of height - in contemporary society. In addition, we control for socioeconomic and sociodemographic parameters. We use a longitudinal dataset of almost all births in Flanders between 2006 and 2009 (N=291,230), together with check-ups (N=2,949,169). All height measurements are standardized to conform to the international World Health Organization growth standards. Several statistical techniques are used to estimate a six-step model. Results show that the effects of birth order are significant at the 5% level, but explain very little of the variation in height increase. This contribution improves the understanding of the present-day link between birth order and early child development in contemporary Flanders. In light of historical trends, our results indicate that the effect of birth order is consistent but particularly small during the first three years of early childhood. Part of the explanation for the changing role of birth order at the macro level can be found in the fertility decline, the general improvement in standards of living and the development of the welfare state.

The Weight of Inequality: Socioeconomic Status and Adolescent Body Mass in Brazil	SOCIAL FORCES			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; US ADOLESCENTS; OBESITY; OVERWEIGHT; TRENDS; INDEX; CHILDREN; IMPACT; ASSOCIATION	The high rate of obesity among adolescents is a global public health problem that has recently expanded to affect middle-and low-income countries. Brazil, which is undergoing a relatively rapid nutrition transition and has inadequate health systems, is currently experiencing the consequences of increasing rates of overweight and obesity concomitantly with the consequences of generations of malnourishment. Given this scenario, Brazil is an ideal context for examining the relationship between family socioeconomic status (SES) and adolescent body mass, as well as how this relationship varies across very different regions within the same country and across the body mass index (BMI) continuum. Guided by a framework that integrates nutrition transition and fundamental cause theories, we use unique nationally representative data with measured height and weight for all household members to conduct quantile regression models. The results suggest that family socioeconomic conditions are important theoretical factors associated with adolescent BMI, but that the way in which family SES impinges on adolescent BMI varies across regions characterized by different locations in the nutrition transition and varying levels of economic development. We also find that family socioeconomic disadvantages operate very differently according to BMI status. The results show that the socioeconomic gradient of adolescent BMI varies by stages of the nutrition transition and economic development and across BMI percentiles.

However, this approach does no justice to the dimensional nature of psychopathology. In addition, anxiety and functioning-levels have seldom been integrated in subtyping efforts. Therefore, this study used a hybrid discrete-dimensional approach to identify subgroups with shared patterns of depressive and anxiety symptomatology, while accounting for functioning-levels. Methods: The Comprehensive International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) 1.1 was used to assess previous-year depressive and anxiety symptoms in the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-1 (NEMESIS 1; n=5583). The data were analyzed with factor analyses, LCA and hybrid mixed-measurement item response theory (MM-IRT) with and without functioning covariates. Finally, the classes' predictors (measured one year earlier) and outcomes (measured two years later) were investigated. Results: A 3-class MM-IRT model with functioning covariates best described the data and consisted of a 'healthy class' (74.2%) and two symptomatic classes ('sleep/energy' [13.4%]; 'mood/anhedonia' [12.4%]). Factors including older age, urbanicity, higher severity and presence of 1-year MDD predicted membership of either symptomatic class vs. the healthy class. Both symptomatic classes showed poorer 2-year outcomes (i.e. disorders, poor functioning) than the healthy class. The odds of MDD after two years were especially increased in the mood/anhedonia class. Limitations: Symptoms were assessed for the past year whereas current functioning was assessed. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of depression and anxiety symptomatology are optimally captured by a hybrid discrete-dimensional subtyping model. Importantly, accounting for functioning-levels helps to capture clinically relevant interpersonal differences.	[Wardenaar, Klaas J.; Wanders, Rob B.

J	Dauda, B; Dierickx, K				Dauda, Bege; Dierickx, Kris			Viewing benefit sharing in global health research through the lens of Aristotelian justice	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Review							GENETIC-RESOURCES; CLINICAL-TRIALS; GLOBALIZATION; ALTRUISM; ETHICS; TIME	The ethics of benefit sharing has been a topical issue in global health research in resource-limited countries. It pertains to the distribution of goods, benefits and advantages to the research participants, communities and countries that are involved in research. One of the nuances in benefit sharing is the ethical justification on which the concept should be based. Extensive literature outlining the different principles underlying benefit sharing is available. The purpose of this paper is to examine the proposed principles using Aristotelian principles of justice. The paper assesses the central idea of Aristotelian justice and applies and evaluates this idea to benefit sharing in research, especially when commercial research sponsors conduct research in resource-limited countries. Two categories of Aristotelian justice-universal and particular-were examined and their contribution to the benefit-sharing discourse assessed. On the one hand, benefit sharing in accordance with universal justice requires that for-profit research sponsors obey the legal regulations and international standards set for benefit sharing. On the other hand, benefit sharing in accordance with particular justice transcends obeying legal requirements and standards to a realm of acting in an ethically accepted manner. Accordingly, the paper further examines three perspectives of particular justice and develops ethical justification for benefit sharing in global health research. As Aristotelian justice is still relevant to the contemporary discourse on justice, this paper broadens the ethical justifications of benefit sharing in global health research.

J	Acheampong, M; Ejiofor, C; Salinas-Miranda, A				Acheampong, Michael; Ejiofor, Chukwudi; Salinas-Miranda, Abraham			An Analysis of Determinants of Under-5 Mortality across Countries: Defining Priorities to Achieve Targets in Sustainable Developmental Goals	MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article						Under-five mortality; Millennium development goals; Sustainable development goals; Health literacy; Social determinants of health	CHILD-MORTALITY; MATERNAL EDUCATION; SURVIVAL; INFANT	Objectives The end of the era of millennium development goals (MDGs) ushered in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) with a new target for the reduction of under-five mortality rates (U5MR). Although U5MR decreased globally, the reduction was insufficient to meet MDGs targets because significant socioeconomic inequities remain unaddressed across and within countries. Thus, further progress in achieving the new SDGs target will be hindered if there is no adequate prioritization of important socioeconomic, healthcare, and environmental factors. The objective of this study was to assess factors that account most for the differences in U5MR between countries around the globe. Methods We conducted an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression-based prioritization analysis of socioeconomic, healthcare, and environmental variables from 109 countries to understand which factors explain the differences in U5MR best. Results All indicators examined individually affected differences in U5MR between countries. However, the results of multivariate OLS regression showed that the most important factors that accounted for the differences were, in order: fertility rate, total health expenditure per capita, access to improved water and sanitation, and female employment rate. Conclusions To achieve the new global target for U5MR, policymakers must focus on certain priority areas, such as interventions that address access to affordable maternal healthcare services, educational programs for mothers, especially those who are adolescents, and safe drinking water and sanitation.

Student-Developed Simulations: Enhancing Cultural Awareness and Understanding Social Determinants of Health	JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION			English	Article							COMPETENCE; EDUCATION	Background: National and global initiatives to address the social determinants of health (SDH) are on the rise. On a parallel trajectory, increased cultural awareness is emerging as an integral strategy to improve the understanding of these social contributions to disease states, health inequities, and health disparities. Method: Undergraduate nursing students developed modalities and role-played simulations as a teaching and learning strategy. The simulations demonstrated how nurses assess patients' unique needs and offer support and resources regarding patients' socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental needs. Results: The student-developed simulations were an interactive teaching and learning strategy that offered several benefits, such as improved interpersonal skills, learned specific nursing roles, and improved cultural awareness. Conclusion: Student-developed simulations are an innovative teaching strategy for improving cultural awareness and learning more about SDH.

''Hans''; Squires, Gregory D.; Riggs, William; Capek, Stella			Think globally, act locally: neighbourhood pollution and the future of the earth	LOCAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Environmental justice; reduced life expectancy; neighbourhood pollution; climate change; environmental racism	AIR-POLLUTION; MORTALITY	Each year governments and industry around the globe spend billions of dollars in search of treatments and cures for diseases that shorten lives, which often means gadgets, implants, radiation and pills. These "cures", do not get to the root of the problem. Perhaps it is time for us to adjust our thinking to be more proactive instead of reactive in public health. Perhaps we need to consider confronting environmental pollution of air, soil and water at a local level. As the Physicians for Social Responsibility point out, we should be "preventing what we cannot cure". One such preventive measure is ensuring that our communities, including our poor inner-city neighbourhoods, enjoy a clean environment. We challenge local and national policy-makers to respond to the global call and to take action to address environmental toxins; to take local action to ameliorate the pollution of the air, water and soil in so many of our nation's neighbourhoods. A person's neighbourhood, and the proximity of dangerous environmental contaminants within it, is a powerful predictor of how long s/he will live. While situations like the poisoning of the water in Flint, Michigan have gotten some attention, they are generally treated as the exception rather than a reflection of real environmental hazards that exist in the west. Moreover we wonder why more endemic issues of neighbourhood environmental contamination that shorten human lives are not a priority for local action or that it is not linked to disproportionate production of greenhouse gases that cause climate change/warming/chaos.

The pernicious effects of this broad societal trend are striking: Rising inequality is linked to poorer health and well-being across countries, continents, and cultures. The economic and psychological forces that perpetuate inequality continue to be studied, and in this theoretical review, we examine the role of daily experiences of economic inequality-the communication of social class signals between interaction partners-in this process. We theorize that social class signals activate social comparison processes that strengthen group boundaries between the haves and have nots in society. In particular, we argue that class signals are a frequent, rapid, and accurate component of person perception, and we provide new data and analyses demonstrating the accuracy of class signaling in 60-s interactions, Facebook photographs, and isolated recordings of brief speech. We suggest that barriers to the reduction of economic inequality in society arise directly from this class signaling process through the augmentation of class boundaries and the elicitation of beliefs and behaviors that favor the economic status quo.

I document that expected returns, or risk premia, increase substantially in financial crises, but not in the other episodes. Asset prices decline in all episodes, but the decline in financial crises is substantially larger than the decline in fundamentals so that expected returns going forward are large. However, drops in consumption and consumption volatility are fairly similar across financial crises and recessions and are largest during wars, so asset pricing models based on aggregate consumption have trouble matching these facts. Comparing crises to "deep" recessions strengthens these findings further. By disentangling financial crises from other bad macroeconomic times, the results suggest that financial crises are particularly important to understanding why risk premia vary. I discuss implications for theory more broadly and discuss both rational and behavioral models that are consistent with the facts. Theories where asset prices are related to the health of the financial sector appear particularly promising.

Specialized memory clinics vary in the type of patients seen, diagnostic procedures applied, and the pharmacological treatment given. The aim of this study was to investigate quality-of-care indicators in subjects with EOD from 3 tertiary memory clinics in 3 European countries. Methods: We included 1325 newly diagnosed EOD patients, ages 65 years or younger, between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2013, from the Danish Dementia Registry (Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen), the Swedish Dementia Registry ("SveDem", Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm), and the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (VU University Medical Center). Results: The frequency of EOD among all dementia patients was significantly lower in Copenhagen (410, 20%) and Stockholm (284, 21%) compared with Amsterdam (631, 48%). Not all quality indicator targets were met, such as the time to diagnosis, the mini-mental state examination score available, and the prescription of cholinesterase inhibitors. Cerebrospinal fluid sampling, registered in 2 sites, was performed in over 80% of the subjects. Conclusions: In tertiary referral centers in Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Amsterdam, quality indicators were not always met for patients with EOD. Results partly reflect differences in referral pattern, the application of diagnostic criteria, and local best practices. Standardized international procedures for patients with EOD may reduce this variability.

QUEST			English	Article						Adolescent; difference; globalization; health; physical education	CRITICAL RACE THEORY; MEDIA CONSUMPTION; CULTURE; GIRLS; POLICY; RACISM; SPORT; DIRECTIONS; EMBODIMENT; CURRICULUM	Critical theorists have called attention to the intensification of diversity that is now occurring inside and outside of school, while critically engaging with the detrimental effects of globalization on equity, diversity, and social justice. Globalization presents new challenges to education and to issues of social justice. In this article, we argue that there is a need for scholars in the field of physical education to re-think and re-frame the social-justice agenda to address current inequalities produced by globalization. To support this argument, we first reflect on the impact of global neoliberalism on physical education; second, we discuss the ways in which, as a result of global neoliberalism, public health discourses have an othering effect on ethnically diverse young people; third, we propose a theoretical shift from a focus on equality to a focus on difference; and finally, we conclude with considerations for future research and curricula in school physical education.

We used data from surveillance sites in Bangladesh, Nicaragua and Vietnam and Demographic Health Surveys in Rwanda to explore the development of neonatal and under-five mortality. The mortality curves showed dramatic reductions over time, but child mortality in the four countries peaked during wars and catastrophes and was rapidly reduced by targeted interventions, multisectorial development efforts and community engagement. Conclusion: Lessons learned from these countries may be useful when tackling future challenges, including persistent neonatal deaths, survival inequalities and the consequences of climate change and migration.

Methods: Our study assessed data from the French national cross-sectional survey of occupational hazards (SUMER) that was conducted in 2003 and 2010. We included all of the 27 CMR agents that were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer or European Union regulations as being known or presumed to have CMR potential in humans. Trends in prevalence and degree of exposure were examined using multilevel logistic regression analysis. Results: The number of employees exposed to CMR agents decreased by 17.5% between 2003 and 2010. The only CMR entities for which exposure rates increased are not considered to be proven CMRs according to the European Union regulations. With the exception of apprentices, there was an overall decrease in exposure prevalence for all employees. This decrease occurred, however, to different extents. The decrease in the risk of exposure to CMR agents was much greater for those on permanent contracts, managers, and in enterprises with more than 500 employees. Nonetheless, in situations where there was potential for exposure, companies with fewer than 10 employees were in fact able to decrease the degree of risk more than the others. Conclusions: Our results confirm the relevance of reinforcing regulatory restrictions for CMR products, while also indicating that monitoring of trends in disparities will allow public health policy makers to better evaluate progress made toward reducing disparities that affect vulnerable populations.

This practice has implications for preferential access to medical care for Canadians both through inbound and outbound medical tourism. In this paper, we identify four patterns of medical tourism with implications for preferential access to care by Canadians: (1) Inbound medical tourism to Canada's public hospitals; (2) Inbound medical tourism to a First Nations reserve; (3) Canadian patients opting to go abroad for medical tourism; and (4) Canadian patients traveling abroad with a Canadian surgeon. These patterns of medical tourism affect preferential access to health care by Canadians by circumventing domestic regulation of care, creating jurisdictional tensions over the provision of health care, and undermining solidarity with the Canadian health system.

In Vietnam, the cost to patients of medicines was 47 times the international reference price for originator brands and 11 times the price for generic equivalents in the public sector. In this article, we report the results of a qualitative study conducted to identify the principal reasons for inflated medicine prices in Vietnam. Between April 2008 and December 2009, 29 semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff from pharmaceutical companies, private pharmacies, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Finance of Vietnam. Study participants were recruited using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded using NVivo8A (R) software and analyzed using a framework of structure-conduct-performance (SCP). Participants attributed high prices of originator medicines to a monopoly of supply. The prices of generic medicines were also considered to be excessive, reportedly due to the need to recoup the cost of financial inducements paid to prescribers and procurement officers. These inducements constituted a dominant cost component of the end price of generic medicines. Poor market intelligence about current world prices, as well as failure to achieve economies of scale because of unwarranted duplication in pharmaceutical production and distribution system were also factors contributing to high prices. This was reported to be further compounded by multiple layers in the supply chain and unregulated retail mark-ups. To address these problems a multifaceted approach is needed encompassing policy and legislative responses. Policy options include establishing effective monitoring of medicine quality assurance, procurement, distribution and use. Rationalization of the domestic pharmaceutical production and distribution system to achieve economies of scale is also required. Appropriate legal responses include collaborations with the justice and law enforcement sectors to enforce existing laws.

Tuberculosis in migrants in low-incidence countries: epidemiology and intervention entry points	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Article						tuberculosis; migration; asylum seekers; epidemiology; policy	HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; RISK-FACTORS; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; ACTIVE TUBERCULOSIS; UNITED-STATES; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; BORN POPULATIONS; TB CONTROL	As tuberculosis (TB) rates continue to decline in native populations in most low TB incidence countries, the proportion of TB patients born outside their country of residence ('foreign-born') increases. Some low-incidence countries have experienced a substantial increase in TB rates related to recent increases in the number of asylum seekers and other migrants from TB-endemic countries. However, average TB rates among the foreign-born in low-incidence countries declined moderately in 2009-2015. TB in foreign-born individuals is commonly the result of reactivation of latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis acquired outside the host country. Transmission is generally low in low-incidence countries, and transmission from migrants to the native population is often modest. Variations in levels and trends in TB notifications among the foreign-born are likely explained by differences and fluctuations in the number and profile of migrants, as well as by variations in TB control, health and social policies in the host countries. To optimise TB care and prevention in migrants from endemic to low-incidence countries, we propose a framework for identifying possible TB care and prevention interventions before, during and after migration. Universal access to high-quality care along the entire migration pathway is critical. Screening for active TB and latent tuberculous infection should be tailored to the TB epidemiology, adapted to the needs of specific migrant groups and linked to treatment. Ultimately, the long-term TB elimination goal can be reached only if global health and socio-economic inequalities are dramatically reduced. Low-incidence countries, most of which are among the wealthiest nations, need to contribute through international assistance.

This study aimed to identify the variations in suicide specific rates using the Human Development Index (HDI) and some health related variables among countries around the world. In this ecological study, we obtained the data from the World Bank Report 2013. The analysis was restricted to 91 countries for which both the epidemiologic data from the suicide rates and HDI were available. Overall, the global prevalence of suicide rate was 10.5 (95% confidence intervals: 8.8, 12.2) per 100,000 individuals, which significantly varied according to gender (16.3 in males vs. 4.6 in females, p < 0.001) and different levels of human development (11.64/100,000 individuals in very high development countries, 7.93/100,000 individuals in medium development countries, and 13.94/100,000 individuals in high development countries, p = 0.004). In conclusion, the suicide rate varies greatly between countries with different development levels. Our findings also suggest that male gender and HDI components are associated with an increased risk of suicide behaviors. Hence, detecting population subgroups with a high suicide risk and reducing the inequality of socioeconomic determinants are necessary to prevent this disorder around the world.

This lack of alignment of donor's priorities with local research need may be one of the reasons why countries fail to achieve set goals for population health and nutrition. India has a high burden of morbidity and mortality in women, children and infants. In order to look forward toward the Sustainable Development Goals, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the INCLEN Trust International (INCLEN) employed the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative's (CHNRI) research priority setting method for maternal, neonatal, child health and nutrition with the timeline of 2016-2025. The exercise was the largest to-date use of the CHNRI methodology, both in terms of participants and ideas generated and also expanded on the methodology. Methods CHNRI is a crowdsourcing-based exercise that involves using the collective intelligence of a group of stakeholders, usually researchers, to generate and score research options against a set of criteria. This paper reports on a large umbrella CHNRI that was divided into four theme-specific CHNRIs (maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition). A National Steering Group oversaw the exercise and four theme-specific Research Sub-Committees technically supported finalizing the scoring criteria and refinement of research ideas for the respective thematic areas. The exercise engaged participants from 256 institutions across India - 4003 research ideas were generated from 498 experts which were consolidated into 373 research options (maternal health: 122; newborn health: 56; child health: 101; nutrition: 94); 893 experts scored these against five criteria (answerability, relevance, equity, innovation and out-of-box thinking, investment on research). Relative weights to the criteria were assigned by 79 members from the Larger Reference Group. Given India's diversity, priorities were identified at national and three regional levels: (i) the Empowered Action Group (EAG) and North-Eastern States; (ii) States and Union territories in Northern India (including West Bengal); and (iii) States and Union territories in Southern and Western parts of India. Conclusions The exercise leveraged the inherent flexibility of the CHNRI method in multiple ways. It expanded on the CHNRI methodology enabling analyses for identification of research priorities at national and regional levels. However, prioritization of research options are only valuable if they are put to use, and we hope that donors will take advantage of this prioritized list of research options.

Gender bias in careseeking practices in 57 low-and middle-income countries	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							CHILD; MORTALITY; HEALTH	Background Preventive and curative medical interventions can reduce child mortality. It is important to assess whether there is gender bias in access to these interventions, which can lead to preferential treatment of children of a given sex. Methods Data from Demographic and Health Surveys carried out in 57 low-and middle-income countries were used. The outcome variable was a composite careseeking indicator, which represents the proportion of children with common childhood symptoms or illnesses (diarrhea, fever, or suspected pneumonia) who were taken to an appropriate provider. Results were stratified by sex at the national level and within each wealth quintile. Ecological analyses were carried out to assess if sex ratios varied by world region, religion, national income and its distribution, and gender inequality indices. Linear multilevel regression models were used to estimate time trends in careseeking by sex between 1994 and 2014. Findings Eight out of 57 countries showed significant differences in careseeking; in six countries, girls were less likely to receive care (Colombia, Egypt, India, Liberia, Senegal and Yemen). Seven countries had significant interactions between sex and wealth quintile, but the patterns varied from country to country. In the ecological analyses, lower careseeking for girls tended to be more common in countries with higher income concentration (P = 0.039) and higher Muslim population (P = 0.006). Coverage increased for both sexes; 0.95 percent points (pp) a year among girls (32.9% to 51.9%), and 0.91 pp (34.8% to 52.9%) among boys. Conclusion The overall frequency of careseeking is similar for girls and boys, but not in all countries, where there is evidence of gender bias. A gender perspective should be an integral part of monitoring, accountability and programming. Countries where bias is present need renewed attention by national and international initiatives, in order to ensure that girls receive adequate care and protection.

Examining the relationship between pandemic communication and awareness and knowledge of MERS in the USA	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						awareness; communication inequalities; disease outbreaks; MERS; pandemic; risk communication	PUBLIC-HEALTH EMERGENCY; INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION; PREVENTIVE BEHAVIORS; INEQUALITIES; RESPONSES; MESSAGES; BELIEFS; PERCEPTIONS; OUTBREAK; THREAT	Large-scale influenza outbreaks over the last decade, such as SARS and H1N1, have brought to global attention the importance of emergency risk communication and prompted the international community to develop communication responses. Since pandemic outbreaks are relatively infrequent, there is a dearth of evidence addressing the following questions: (i) Have the resources invested in strategic and routine communication for past pandemic outbreaks yielded public health preparedness benefits? (ii) Have past efforts sensitized people to pay attention to new pandemic threats? The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that was followed closely by major media outlets in the USA provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between exposure to public communication about epidemics and public awareness and knowledge about new risks. In December, 2013, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 627 American adults and examined the associations between people's awareness to prior pandemics and their awareness of and knowledge about MERS. Awareness of prior pandemics was significantly associated with awareness and knowledge of MERS. The most common sources from which people first heard about MERS were also identified. Communication inequalities were observed between racial/ethnic and socioeconomic positions, suggesting a need for more effective pandemic communication.

J	Wang, CH; Chen, N				Wang, Chih-Hao; Chen, Na			A geographically weighted regression approach to investigating the spatially varied built-environment effects on community opportunity	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Spatial statistics; GWR; Land-use and transportation planning; Community opportunity; Social equity	MODE CHOICE MODEL; URBAN SPRAWL; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; UNITED-STATES; LAND-USE; VIOLENT CRIME; PROBIT MODEL; GIS APPROACH; NEIGHBORHOOD; HEALTH	Geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been increasingly used to better understand the spatially varied relationships between socioeconomic outcomes and policy investments. In this study, a community opportunity index (COI) is computed for Columbus, Ohio, using a set of socioeconomic factors. An ordinary regression and GWR model are estimated to account for the global and local effects of land uses and capital investments respectively, while controlling for socio-demographical characteristics. The global results indicate that the community opportunity increases as the distance from the city center increases, while The Ohio State University (OSU) has higher positive spillover-effect on near communities than on distant ones. However, the local results appear a local spatially inverse relationship in the areas adjacent to the international airport (CMH), indicating the existence of negative externalities. With the advantage of visualizing spatial variations, the GWR results suggest that the most effective location for allocating future developments is in eastern Columbus, where shows a clustering of higher COI premiums of a percentage change in residential and commercial uses. A variety of spatial variations is found among different capital-investment effects. Therefore, local characteristics require consideration when allocating additional public facilities. Finally, the GWR results reveal the existence of spatial mismatch that socially disadvantaged groups (e.g. black population, other minorities, single-parent families, and zero-vehicle households) tend to reside in vulnerable communities. These local results provide a new perspective on land-use and transportation planning to help shape a fair community opportunity framework for the future.

Inequality and childhood overweight and obesity: a commentary	PEDIATRIC OBESITY			English	Review						Childhood; inequality; obesity; treatment	SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION; HEALTH; INTERVENTIONS; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; PREVENTION; EPIDEMIC; RESPONSIBILITY; COMMUNITY	Statements on childhood overweight and obesity (COO) have focused on different avenues for prevention and treatment, critical stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy and lactation, individual, family, school and community-based interventions, multidisciplinary family programmes and multicomponent interventions. This commentary is concerned with the less-addressed relationship between COO and inequality. It describes current global patterns of inequality and COO and the ways in which those inequalities are linked to COO at micro-level, meso-level and macro-level. It then describes current programmatic approaches for COO inequality, preventive and medical, and considers important pitfalls in the framing of the problem of COO and inequality. It ends with describing how childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity prevention and treatment programmes might be formulated within broader socio-political frameworks to influence outcomes.

A leading driver is the energy-economy cycle, where poor economic status, inefficient utilization of limited budget, and energy deficiency reinforced each other and led these countries into a spiral of economic downfall. How to turn this cycle around? It is a classic question but not well answered in the energy policy/economics literature and barely studied in the operations management literature. We apply supply chain design and location optimization models to address the unique features of the energy sector in these countries and present a new class of mathematical models for designing coal- fired energy supply chains. The model captures the interaction among different parts of an integrated energy supply chain, the unique economics of power transmission such as yield losses, the political issues associated with equity, and the dynamic interaction among energy consumption, economy and budget. The model attempts to answer the classic question by determining the optimal and politically feasible ways to build up an energy supply chain under limited budgets for energy security and economic prosperity. Applying the model to Pakistan's recent energy crises, we show that the solutions can significantly outperform the government's plan by reducing the energy gaps faster, boosting the economy stronger with less greenhouse gas emissions. We develop insights as to how an energy supply chain should be built up strategically for developing countries, and how various system parameters may affect the results.

MetS prevalence is stratified by socioeconomic status (SES), such that low SES is associated with higher MetS risk. The present study examined the relative roles of early-life SES and current SES in explaining MetS risk. Methods Participants (N = 354; ages = 15-55 years, M [SD] = 36.5 [10.7] years; 55% female; 72.9% white, 16.9% Asian, 10.2% others) were evaluated for SES and MetS. All were in good health, defined as free of chronic medical illness and acute infectious disease. Using occupational status as a proxy for SES, we recruited roughly equal numbers of participants with low-low, low-high, high-low, and high-high combinations of early-life and current SES. We used the International Diabetes Federation definition for MetS using race- and sex-specific cutoffs for waist circumference, triglyceride levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Results Analyses revealed a main effect of low early-life SES on increased MetS risk according to the three separate definitions. They included the traditional MetS diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53, confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-2.33, p = .044), the number of MetS components for which diagnostic thresholds were met (OR = 1.61, CI = 1.10-2.38, p = .015), and a continuous indicator of metabolic risk based on factor analysis (F(1,350) = 6.71, p = .010, partial (2) = .019). There was also a significant interaction of early-life SES and current SES in predicting MetS diagnosis (OR = 1.54, CI = 1.02-2.34). The main effects of current SES were nonsignificant in all analyses. Conclusions These findings suggest that MetS health disparities originate in childhood, which may be an opportune period for interventions.

J	Bremberg, SG				Bremberg, Sven G.			Mortality rates in OECD countries converged during the period 1990-2010	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Mortality; time trends; OECD nations	LIFE EXPECTANCY; HEALTH INEQUALITIES; INCOME INEQUALITY; EUROPEAN-UNION; LEVEL	Aims: Since the scientific revolution of the 18th century, human health has gradually improved, but there is no unifying theory that explains this improvement in health. Studies of macrodeterminants have produced conflicting results. Most studies have analysed health at a given point in time as the outcome; however, the rate of improvement in health might be a more appropriate outcome. Methods: Twenty-eight OECD member countries were selected for analysis in the period 1990-2010. The main outcomes studied, in six age groups, were the national rates of decrease in mortality in the period 1990-2010. The effects of seven potential determinants on the rates of decrease in mortality were analysed in linear multiple regression models using least squares, controlling for country-specific history constants, which represent the mortality rate in 1990. Results: The multiple regression analyses started with models that only included mortality rates in 1990 as determinants. These models explained 87% of the intercountry variation in the children aged 1-4 years and 51% in adults aged 55-74 years. When added to the regression equations, the seven determinants did not seem to significantly increase the explanatory power of the equations. Conclusions: The analyses indicated a decrease in mortality in all nations and in all age groups. The development of mortality rates in the different nations demonstrated significant catch-up effects. Therefore an important objective of the national public health sector seems to be to reduce the delay between international research findings and the universal implementation of relevant innovations.

A Technical and Policy Case Study of Large-Scale Rescue and Redistribution of Perishable Foods by the "Leket Israel" Food Bank	FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN			English	Article						food security; food policy; household food insecurity; dietary diversity; agriculture; food waste	NUTRITION PROGRAM; ASSISTANCE; INSECURITY; SECURITY; CLIENTS; INFANTS; HEALTH; STATES; DIET	Background: Food banks seeking to rescue and redistribute highly nutritious perishable foods to simultaneously alleviate food insecurity and reduce food waste often encounter practical, ethical, and political dilemmas. Objectives: We present a case study of "Leket Israel," an Israeli food bank that uses an effective large-scale logistical model for the rescue and redistribution of perishable food and discuss the challenges and solutions it offers. Results: The organization operates in a rich country plagued with poverty and inequality, where the government passively encourages nongovernmental organizations to respond to the serious and growing problem of food insecurity. Operating under a business-to-business model, Leket Israel distributes food via intermediary nonprofit organizations (NPOs), enriching the food they provide with fresh produce. Food is obtained through an Agricultural Gleaning project, Self-Growing Farm project, and Meal Rescue project. The partnering NPOs then distribute the food to people in need. Although the rescue and redistribution of highly perishable food is more costly and complex than acquiring, storing, and distributing dried and staple foods and it requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure in order to maintain rigorous safety standards, it improves the nutritional quality of the aid. In 2015, Leket Israel distributed 15 217 389 kg of food, 90% of which was fruit and vegetables, to 180 partnering NPOs nationwide, reaching an estimated 175 000 recipients. Conclusion: " Leket Israel" offers a valuable model that can be studied and emulated by international nutrition scientists, practitioners, and policy makers who are seeking to reduce food insecurity and food waste in other countries.

However, guidance for patient engagement (PE) in HRQoL research does not exist, the evidence-base for practice is limited, and we know relatively little about underpinning values that can impact on PE practice. This is the first study to explore the values that should underpin PE in contemporary HRQoL research to help inform future good practice guidance. A modified 'World Caf,' was hosted as a collaborative activity between patient partners, clinicians and researchers: self-nominated conference delegates participated in group discussions to explore values associated with the conduct and consequences of PE. Values were captured via post-it notes and by nominated note-takers. Data were thematically analysed: emergent themes were coded and agreement checked. Association between emergent themes, values and the Public Involvement Impact Assessment Framework were explored. Eighty participants, including 12 patient partners, participated in the 90-min event. Three core values were defined: (1) building relationships; (2) improving research quality and impact; and (3) developing best practice. Participants valued the importance of building genuine, collaborative and deliberative relationships-underpinned by honesty, respect, co-learning and equity-and the impact of effective PE on research quality and relevance. An explicit statement of values seeks to align all stakeholders on the purpose, practice and credibility of PE activities. An innovative, flexible and transparent research environment was valued as essential to developing a trustworthy evidence-base with which to underpin future guidance for good PE practice.

Global poultry production: current state and future outlook and challenges	WORLDS POULTRY SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Review						trends; livelihoods; health; natural resources	FAMILY POULTRY; FOOD SECURITY; FOOTPRINT; DYNAMICS; IMPACT	This paper presents the current situation of the global poultry sector and future trends, and discusses the challenges the sector is facing, with particular emphasis on four areas: food security, social challenges (poverty alleviation and equity), health (animal and human) and environment (natural resources and climate change). Poultry makes a substantial contribution to food security and nutrition, providing energy, protein, and essential micro-nutrients to humans, with short production cycles and the ability to convert a wide range of agri-food by-products and wastes into meat and eggs edible by humans. Poultry is the fastest growing agricultural sub-sector, especially in developing countries. The global poultry sector is expected to continue to grow as demand for meat and eggs is driven by growing populations, rising incomes and urbanisation. In this context, the sector is facing unprecedented challenges. Particularly for small holders and the poor, both in rural and urban areas, poultry is a major asset and key to poverty alleviation, providing income and market participation. Birds can be sold in times of crisis and act as household insurance. But the growing market is essentially benefiting large scale operations and access to market is critical for small holders. However, poultry represent a threat to human health, especially as a vector of infectious diseases and because of its role in antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, poultry has a significant impact on the environment and is a large consumer of natural resources. While the sector is usually seen as efficient in converting natural resources into edible products, it uses large amounts of land, water and nutrients for the production of feed materials and contributes to climate change, mainly through feed production, and air and water pollution.

J	Vissandjée, B; Short, WE; Bates, K				Vissandjee, Bilkis; Short, Wendy E.; Bates, Karine			Health and legal literacy for migrants: twinned strands woven in the cloth of social justice and the human right to health care	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						Justice; Ethics; Equity; Human Rights; Gender; Health literacy; Legal literacy; Empowerment; Migration	PUBLIC-HEALTH; GENDER; EQUITY; ACCULTURATION; DETERMINANTS; DIVERSITY; ISSUE; INTERVENTIONS; COMMUNICATION; DISPARITIES	Background: Based on an analysis of published literature, this paper provides an over-view of the challenges associated with delivering on the right to access quality health care for international migrants to industrialized countries, and asks which group of professionals is best equipped to provide services that increase health and legal literacy. Both rights and challenges are approached from a social justice perspective with the aim of identifying opportunities to promote greater health equity. That is, to go beyond the legal dictates enshrined in principles of equality, and target as an ethical imperative a situation where all migrants receive the particular assistance they need to overcome the barriers that inhibit their equitable access to health care. This assistance is especially important for migrant groups that are further disadvantaged by differing cultural constructions of gender. Viewing the topic from this perspective makes evident a gap in both research literature and policy. The review has found that while health literacy is debated and enshrined as a policy objective, and consideration is given to improving legal literacy as a means of challenging social injustice in developing nations, however, no discussion has been identified that considers assisting migrants to gain legal literacy as a step toward achieving not only health literacy and improved health outcomes, but critical participation as members of their adoptive society. Conclusion: Increasing migrant health literacy, amalgamated with legal literacy, aids migrants to better access their human right to appropriate care, which in turn demonstrably assists in increasing social engagement, citizenship and productivity. However what is not evident in the literature, is which bureaucratic or societal group holds responsibility for assisting migrants to develop critical citizenship literacy skills. This paper proposes that a debate is required to determine both who is best placed to provide services that increase health and legal literacy, and how they should be resourced, trained and equipped.

We sought to identify enablers of paediatric ART coverage in Africa by examining the relationship between paediatric ART coverage and socioeconomic parameters measured at the population level so as to accelerate reaching the 90-90-90 targets. Methods: Ecological analyses of paediatricART coverage and socioeconomic indicators were performed. The data were obtained from the United Nations agencies and Forum for a new World Governance reports for the 21 Global Plan priority countries in Africa with highest burden of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Spearman's correlation and median regression were utilized to explore possible enablers of paediatric ART coverage. Results: Factors associated with paediatric ART coverage included adult literacy (r =0.6, p = 0.004), effective governance (r =0.6, p =0.003), virology testing by 2 months of age (r=0.9, p = 0.001), density of healthcare workers per 10,000 population (r=0.6, p = 0.007), and government expenditure on health (r=0.5, p = 0.046). The paediatric ART coverage had a significant inverse relationship with the national mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate (r=-0.9, p <0.001) and gender inequality index (r=-0.6, p= 0.006). Paediatric ART coverage had no relationship with poverty and HIV stigma indices. Conclusions: Low paediatric ART coverage continues to hamper progress towards eliminating AIDS-related deaths in HIV-infected children. Achieving this requires full commitment to a broad range of socioeconomic development goals.

As the use of haemodialysis machines for patients with end stage renal disease increases survival considerably, it is critical to plan correctly for the allocation of these machines. This study aimed to develop a geographical information systems (GIS)-based approach to predict the need for this service in the northeastern region of Iran taking into account where patients live and where haemodialysis is the most needed and identifying areas with poor access to haemodialysis centres. Patients were interviewed to obtain self-reported actual travel time and the inverse distance-weighting algorithm was used to determine access in each area. The prediction is based on the domestic growth rate for haemodialysis services and the estimated active hours of machine use for the next five years. We estimate that six new haemodialysis machines are required in northeastern Iran at the present time With 50 machines required over the next five years. Ashldiane City was identified to have the least access to haemodialysis centres in the study area. Our GIS-based model can be used to investigate not only the need for new haemodialysis machines but also to examine geographic disparities in the allocation of haemodialysis centres and to identify areas most in need of this service. It is important that policymakers consider both spatial and non-spatial dimensions of access to enable better allocation of haemodialysis services ensuring they are targeted to reach those in need.

J	Müller, A				Mueller, Alex			Scrambling for access: availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of healthcare for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in South Africa	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						Lesbian; gay; bisexual and transgender; Sexual orientation; Gender identity; Right to health; Access to healthcare; Discrimination; General Comment 14; South Africa	ORGANIZATIONS COMMISSION; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; EXPERIENCES; MEN; SEX	Background: Sexual orientation and gender identity are social determinants of health for people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT), and health disparities among sexual and gender minority populations are increasingly well understood. Although the South African constitution guarantees sexual and gender minority people the right to non-discrimination and the right to access to healthcare, homo-and transphobia in society abound. Little is known about LGBT people's healthcare experiences in South Africa, but anecdotal evidence suggests significant barriers to accessing care. Using the framework of the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights General Comment 14, this study analyses the experiences of LGBT health service users using South African public sector healthcare, including access to HIV counselling, testing and treatment. Methods: A qualitative study comprised of 16 semi-structured interviews and two focus group discussions with LGBT health service users, and 14 individual interviews with representatives of LGBT organisations. Data were thematically analysed within the framework of the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights General Comment 14, focusing on availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of care. Results: All interviewees reported experiences of discrimination by healthcare providers based on their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Participants recounted violations of all four elements of the UN General Comment 14: 1) Availability: Lack of public health facilities and services, both for general and LGBT-specific concerns; 2) Accessibility: Healthcare providers' refusal to provide care to LGBT patients; 3) Acceptability: Articulation of moral judgment and disapproval of LGBT patients' identity, and forced subjection of patients to religious practices; 4) Quality: Lack of knowledge about LGBT identities and health needs, leading to poor-quality care. Participants had delayed or avoided seeking healthcare in the past, and none had sought out accountability or complaint mechanisms within the health system. Conclusion: Sexual orientation and gender identity are important categories of analysis for health equity, and lead to disparities in all four dimensions of healthcare access as defined by General Comment 14. Discriminatory and prejudicial attitudes by healthcare providers, combined with a lack of competency and knowledge are key reasons for these disparities in South Africa.

She employs that argument to critique green criminology for promoting adverse social justice impacts. Here, we reanalyze the Lynemouth plant closure. First, this reanalysis illustrates the various social and environmental forms of injustice the plant generated, especially its adverse human, nonhuman and ecological health consequences. Second, the closure is reassessed from a political economic perspective that places the plant closure within the context of global capitalist plant closures in the aluminum industry. That review notes that plant closures and deindustrialization in developed economies are now a common occurrence driven by economic concerns, not environmental policies. We point out that social injustice as well as ecological destruction are often created by the normal operation of capitalism, and that those consequences should not be overlooked.

Public primary and secondary skin cancer prevention, perceptions and knowledge: an international cross-sectional survey	JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY			English	Article							UNTREATED MELANOMA; IPILIMUMAB; ATTITUDES; NIVOLUMAB; BEHAVIORS	BackgroundThe incidence of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer is continuing to increase worldwide, with sun exposure serving as the primary external aetiologic force in its development. Despite noticeable public health efforts, there continue to be gaps in public awareness and primary and secondary prevention mechanisms. This survey study sought to investigate preventative behaviours regarding sun exposure and skin cancer detection at an international scale. MethodsA questionnaire was submitted, both online and by telephone, to a representative sample (based on official demographic statistics on gender, age and region) of people aged from 15 to 65 originating from 23 countries. Questions dealt with demographics, sun exposure and protection, risk knowledge, self-examination, medical advice seeking. Data were then gathered and analysed at different levels. ResultsA total of 19 569 respondents were recruited. Overall, sunscreen and sunglasses were the most used measures for sun protection. There were however difference between countries and geographical areas. Some high-risk countries in terms of sun exposure (according to their location to Equator) exhibited higher rates of primary preventative behaviours, in particular Australia, Chile and Greece. There were also discrepancies between countries regarding secondary prevention through self-examination and medical advice seeking. Young people, men, individuals belonging to a lower socio-economic class or having a lower education level were all least likely to know or follow primary and secondary preventive measures. ConclusionWe found imperfections and geographical inequality both regarding primary and secondary prevention of skin cancer. Our study provides insights that could help to target populations more effectively through information campaigns embedded into the global needed endeavour aiming to reduce mid- and long-term development of skin cancer.

J	Lecerof, SS; Stafström, M; Emmelin, M; Westerling, R; Östergen, PO				Lecerof, Susanne Sundell; Stafstrom, Martin; Emmelin, Maria; Westerling, Ragnar; Ostergen, Per-Olof			Findings from a prospective cohort study evaluating the effects of International Health Advisors' work on recently settled migrants' health	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						migrants; health promotion; health communication; health information; social determinants of health; social capital	SELF-RATED HEALTH; MENTAL-HEALTH; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; ASYLUM SEEKERS; IMMIGRANTS; CARE; PREVALENCE; LITERACY; BARRIERS; REFUGEES	Background: Several interventions have been carried out to tackle health inequalities between migrant groups, especially refugees, and native-born European populations. These initiatives are often address language or cultural barriers. One of them is the International Health Advisors (IHA) in Sweden; a peer education intervention aimed at providing health information for recently settled migrants. It is known that social determinants, such as educational level and access to social capital, affect health. Social determinants may also affect how health information is received and transformed into practice. The aims of this study was to a) assess the impact of the IHA on recently settled migrants' self-reported health status, and received health information; b) determine the moderating role of educational level and social capital; and c) critically discuss the outcomes and suggest implications for health promotion practice. Methods: The study was designed as a prospective cohort study. A postal questionnaire translated to Arabic was sent to recently settled Iraqi migrants in eight counties in Sweden, in May 2008 and May 2010. Two of the counties were exposed to the intervention, and six were used as references. Results: The proportion of individuals who reported that they had received information on healthy diet and physical exercise was higher in the intervention group than in the non-intervention group (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.02-5.22), after adjustments. Low social participation was negatively associated with deteriorated or unchanged health needs (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24-0.92). No other statistically significant differences in health outcomes could be observed between the groups. No signs of effect modification on this association by social capital or educational level could be found. Conclusions: Health information provided by the IHA increased self-reported level of knowledge on healthy diet and physical exercise. The interpretation of the observed negative association between low social participation and deteriorated or unchanged health needs is that participation was limited to one's own social group, and therefore had limited positive influence on health seeking behaviour. The lack of measurable improvements in health status could be explained by limitations in the study, in the theoretical assumptions underlying the intervention, and in the implementation of the intervention. Further research is needed to understand success factors in health promoting interventions among recently settled migrants better.

J	Carcach, C				Carcach, Carlos			A spatio-temporal analysis of suicide in El Salvador	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Stream analogy; Suicide; Total lethal violence; Spatio-temporal; Bayesian model	SPATIAL CLUSTERS; DRINKING-WATER; DETERMINANTS; LITHIUM; HEALTH; TIME; PATTERNS; DISEASE; IMPACT; RATES	Background: In 2012, international statistics showed El Salvador's suicide rate as 40th in the world and the highest in Latin America. Over the last 15 years, national statistics show the suicide death rate declining as opposed to an increasing rate of homicide. Though completed suicide is an important social and health issue, little is known about its prevalence, incidence, etiology and spatio-temporal behavior. The primary objective of this study was to examine completed suicide and homicide using the stream analogy to lethal violence within a spatio-temporal framework. Methods: A Bayesian model was applied to examine the spatio-temporal evolution of the tendency of completed suicide over homicide in El Salvador. Data on numbers of suicides and homicides at the municipal level were obtained from the Instituto de Medicina Legal (IML) and population counts, from the Direccion General de Estadistica y Censos (DIGESTYC), for the period of 2002 to 2012. Data on migration were derived from the 2007 Population Census, and inequality data were obtained from a study by Damianovic, Valenzuela and Vera. Results: The data reveal a stable standardized rate of total lethal violence (completed suicide plus homicide) across municipalities over time; a decline in suicide; and a standardized suicide rate decreasing with income inequality but increasing with social isolation. Municipalities clustered in terms of both total lethal violence and suicide standardized rates. Conclusions: Spatial effects for suicide were stronger among municipalities located in the north- east and center-south sides of the country. New clusters of municipalities with large suicide standardized rates were detected in the north-west, south-west and center-south regions, all of which are part of time-stable clusters of homicide. Prevention efforts to reduce income inequality and mitigate the negative effects of weak relational systems should focus upon municipalities forming time-persistent clusters with a large rate of death by suicide. In municipalities that are part of newly-formed suicide clusters and also are located in areas with a large rate of homicide, interrupting the expansion of spatial concentrations of suicide over time may require the implementation of both public health and public safety interventions.

The imminent changes to the Minimum Standard for the Education of Occupational Therapists engender efforts towards social change and will require university-level human rights education. This education might enhance the profession's influence on disadvantaging social structures in order to effect social change. To contribute to the evidence base for social change education in occupational therapy, this research aims to understand the knowledge, skills, confidence and learning experiences of occupational therapy students who completed a human rights course. Methods: Final year occupational therapy students responded to questionnaires which included listing human rights, a human rights scale measuring knowledge and confidence for working towards human rights, and open questions. Numbers of rights listed, knowledge scores and confidence scores were calculated. Responses to the open questions were thematically analysed. Results: After completing a human rights course, students had good knowledge and moderate confidence to work with human rights. Three themes were identified including 'learning about human rights', 'learning about structural, societal and global perspectives on occupational engagement' and 'learning how occupational therapists can work with groups, communities and populations: becoming articulate and empowered'. Conclusions: Human rights education fosters the development of occupational therapists who are skilled, knowledgeable, confident and empowered to address occupational injustices, according to these research findings. To develop a more occupationally just global society, education that considers iniquitous social structures and human rights is necessary.

The bridging of the child survival and child development fields has recently been prioritized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other agencies as being essential for optimizing global health, equity, and sustainable development.(8) In fact, a recent review found significant overlap between public health strategies for improving child survival and child development interventions, the latter of which typically include enriching learning components.(9)	[Kutlesic, Vesna; Isaacs, Margaret Brewinski; Freund, Lisa S.; Hazra, Rohan; Raiten, Daniel J.] Eunice Kennedy Shriver Natl Inst Child Hlth & Hum, Bethesda, MD USA	National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)	Kutlesic, V (corresponding author), Eunice Kennedy Shriver Natl Inst Child Hlth & Hum, Off Global Hlth, 6710B Rockledge Dr,MSC 7002, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.	vesna.kutlesic@nih.gov	Freund, Lisa/ABD-8855-2020		Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH)	Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH)	This supplement was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH).		52	12	13	1	11	AMER ACAD PEDIATRICS	Itasca	345 Park Boulevard, Itasca, IL, UNITED STATES	0031-4005	1098-4275		PEDIATRICS	Pediatrics	APR	2017	139			1					e20162828	10.1542/peds.2016-2828C	http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2016-2828C			13	Pediatrics	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Pediatrics	ET6AF	28562244	Green Published, hybrid			2025-01-01	WOS:000400372000001

Renal-replacement therapy poses several practical and ethical dilemmas of global relevance for patients, clinicians, and policy makers. These include how to: promote patients' best interests; increase access to dialysis while maintaining procedural and distributive justice; minimise the influence of financial incentives and competing interests; ensure quality of care in service delivery and access to non-dialytic supportive care when needed; minimise the financial burden on patients and health-care system; and protect the interests of vulnerable groups during crisis situations. These issues have received comparatively little attention, and there is scant ethical analysis and guidance available to decision makers. In this Health Policy, we provide an overview of the major ethical issues related to dialysis provision worldwide, identify priorities for further investigation and management, and present preliminary recommendations to guide practice and policy.

We measure cognitive skills using standardized scores in mathematics; non-cognitive abilities are captured by a composite measure of internal locus of control related to mathematics. A particular focus lies on father absence although we also examine the role played by co-residence with siblings and grandparents. We use cross-nationally comparable data on students participating in the Programme for International Student Assessment's release for 2012. By mapping inequalities by family forms across 33 developed countries, this study provides robust cross-country comparable evidence on the relationship of household structure with both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. The study produces three key results: first, the absence of fathers from the household as well as co-residence with grandparents is associated with adverse outcomes for children in virtually all developed countries. Second, this is generally true in terms of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills, although the disadvantage connected to both family forms is notably stronger in the former than in the latter domain. Finally, there is marked cross-national diversity in the effects associated with the presence in the household of siblings and especially grandparents which furthermore differs across the two outcomes considered.

However, since studies into perceived classism have mainly been qualitative, little is known about its association with socioeconomic status, health, health behaviours and perceived inferiority, especially in more egalitarian countries. This study, therefore, examined the associations of perceived classism with socioeconomic status, health, health behaviours and perceived inferiority. We used cross-sectional data (2012/2013) from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) (n = 1540; age 16-90; 46.9 % men). We found that classism was perceived by 18.2 % of the participants, with the lowest income and occupation group most likely to perceive classism (22.0 and 27.5 %, respectively). Perceived classism was significantly associated with poor health (e.g. self-rated health OR = 2.44, 95 % CI = 1.76-3.38) and feelings of inferiority (e.g. shame OR = 4.64, 95 % CI = 3.08-6.98). No significant associations were found with health behaviours. To further examine the role of perceived classism for socioeconomic differences in health and its association with country-level socioeconomic inequalities, prevailing ideologies, and objective opportunities for social mobility, we recommend more longitudinal and international studies with comparable measures of perceived classism.

Unfortunately, systems developed for high-resource settings have a range of elements that make them suboptimal for low-resource settings. We discuss what a point-of-care clinical knowledge system designed for low-resource settings would ideally contain, and argue that such a system is worthy of further study and funding, towards the overarching goal of reducing global health inequity.

J	Nolan, A; Layte, R				Nolan, Anne; Layte, Richard			The impact of transitions in insurance coverage on GP visiting among children in Ireland	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Ireland; Public healthcare entitlements; User fees; Healthcare utilisation; Children; Growing up in Ireland (GUI)	PUBLIC-HEALTH INSURANCE; MEDICAL-CARE; ELIGIBILITY; EXPANSIONS; EMPLOYMENT; INEQUITY; PROGRAM; ACCESS	The use of direct out-of-pocket payments to finance general practitioner (GP) care by the majority of the population in Ireland is unusual in a European context. Currently, approximately 40 per cent of the population have means-tested access to free GP care, while the remainder must pay the full out-of-pocket cost. In this paper, we use nationally representative data from the Growing up in Ireland (GUI) study to examine the impact of transitions in insurance coverage on GP utilisation among children. GUI surveys two cohorts of nearly 20,000 children (aged 9 months and 9 years at baseline); we use data from the first two waves of each cohort (which covers the period 2007-2012). Using difference-in-difference propensity score matching methods, we find significant effects of changes in public health insurance coverage on GP utilisation (i.e., introducing user fees reduces utilisation, while removing them increases utilisation). The results have direct implications for current Irish health policy, and add to the international literature on the effects of insurance on healthcare utilisation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shmueli, A				Shmueli, Amir			Do the equity-efficiency preferences of the Israeli Basket Committee match those of Israeli health policy makers?	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH			English	Article						Efficiency; Equity; Policymakers; Health; DCE; Basket Committee; Prioritization	NATIONAL LIST; SERVICES; CRITERIA	Background: Prioritization of medical technologies requires a multi-dimensional view. Often, conflicting equity and efficiency criteria should be reconciled. The most dramatic manifestation of such conflict is in the prioritization of new medical technologies asking for public finance performed yearly by the Israeli Basket Committee. The aim of this paper is to compare the revealed preferences of the 2006/7 Basket Committee's members with the declared preferences of health policy-makers in Israel. Methods: We compared the ranking of a sample of 18 accepted and 16 rejected technologies evaluated by the 2006/7 Basket Committee with the ranking of these technologies as predicted based on the preferences of Israeli health policy-makers. These preferences were elicited by a recent Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) which estimated the relative weights of four equity and three efficiency criteria. The candidate technologies were characterized by these seven criteria, and their ranking was determined. A third comparative ranking of these technologies was the efficiency ranking, which is based on international data on cost per QALY gained. Results: The Committee's ranking of all technologies show no correspondence with the policy-makers' ranking. The correlation between the two is negative when only accepted technologies are ranked. The Committee's ranking is positively correlated with the efficiency ranking, while the health policy-makers' ranking is not. Discussion: The Committee appeared to assign to efficiency considerations a higher weight than assigned by health policy-makers. The main explanation is that while policy-makers' ranking is based on stated preferences, that of the Committee reflects revealed preferences. Real life prioritization, made under a budget constraint, enhances the importance of efficiency considerations at the expense of equity ones. Conclusions: In order for Israeli health policy to be consistent and well coordinated across policy-makers, some discussions and exchanges are needed, to arrive at a common set of preferences with respect to equity and efficiency considerations.

J	Hurlimann, T; Groisman, IJ; Godard, B				Hurlimann, Thierry; Groisman, Iris Jaitovich; Godard, Beatrice			The elusive ideal of inclusiveness: lessons from a worldwide survey of neurologists on the ethical issues raised by whole-genome sequencing	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Research ethics; Justice; Fair inclusion; Genomics	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; HEALTH SYSTEMS; GLOBAL HEALTH; EPILEPSY; VIEWS; PARTICIPANTS; CHALLENGES; GENETICS; JUSTICE	The anticipation of ethical issues that may arise with the clinical use of genomic technologies is crucial to envision their future implementation in a manner sensitive to local contexts. Yet, populations in low- and middle-income countries are underrepresented in studies that aim to explore stakeholders' perspectives on the use of such technologies. Within the framework of a research project entitled "Personalized medicine in the treatment of epilepsy", we sought to increase inclusiveness by widening the reach of our survey, inviting neurologists from around the world to share their views and practices regarding the use of whole-genome sequencing in clinical neurology and its associated ethics. We discuss herein the compelling scientific and ethical reasons that led us to attempt to recruit neurologists worldwide, despite the lack, in many low- or middle-income countries, of access to genomic technologies. Recruitment procedures and their results are presented and discussed, as well as the barriers we faced. We conclude that inclusive recruitment remains a challenging, albeit necessary and legitimate, endeavour.

We argue that microcredit can act in this way and develop a conceptual framework from which to examine this. In seeking to evaluate microcredit this way we then examine how randomized controlled trials, currently considered as the gold standard' in impact evaluations of microcredit, compare with developments in thinking about study design in public health. This leads us to challenge the notion of trials as the apparent gold standard for microcredit evaluations and contend that the pursuit of trial-based evidence alone may be hampering the production of relevant evidence on microcredit's public health (and other wider) impacts. In doing so, we introduce new insights into the global debate on microfinance impact evaluation, related to ethical issues in staging randomized controlled trials, and propose innovations on complementary methods for use in the evaluation of complex interventions.

Delhi's health system exceptionalism: inadequate progress for a global capital city	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Amenable mortality; Delhi; India; Premature mortality	AVOIDABLE MORTALITY; INDIA; COVERAGE; CARE	Objectives: India has proclaimed commitment to the goal of Universal Health Coverage and Delhi, the National Capital Territory, has increased investment in public health and other health services over the past decade. The research investigates whether Delhi's increased investment in health over this period is associated with a reduction in premature deaths, after the age of 1 year, which could have been avoided with better access to effective health care interventions (amenable mortality). Study design: A population-based study of changes in amenable mortality (AM) in Delhi over the 2003-2013 period. Methods: To calculate AM, a list of International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes from the published literature was relied upon. In defining AM in India, an upper age limit of 69 years was adopted, rather than the more common limit of 74 years. Population estimates and vital statistics were downloaded from the Delhi Statistical Handbook. Deaths by cause and age, including medical certification, are from the Vital Statistics site of the Delhi Government. To age-adjust these data, the direct method was employed, using weights derived from the 2010 United Nations world standard population. Results: The research found that, between 2004 and 2013, the age-adjusted rate of AM rose from 0.87 to 1.09. The leading causes of death in both years were septicemia and tuberculosis. Maternal mortality is well above the global level for middle-income countries. Conclusion: Recent investments in public health and health care and the capacity to leverage them to improve access to effective care have not been sufficient to overcome the crushing poverty and inequalities within Delhi. Large and growing numbers of residents die prematurely each year due to causes that are amenable to public health and health care interventions. (C) 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health.

Demographic and socioeconomic factors are determinants of inequalities and inequities in health. There is a need for country-specific evidence of NCD inequalities in developing countries where populations are ageing rapidly amid economic and social change. The study measures and decomposes socioeconomic inequality in single and multiple NCD morbidity in adults aged 50 and over in China and Ghana. Methods: The data source is the World Health Organization Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE) Wave 1 (2007-2010). Nationally representative cross-sectional data collected from adults in China (n = 11,814) and Ghana (n = 4,050) are analysed. Country populations are ranked by a socioeconomic index based on ownership of household assets. The study uses a decomposed concentration index (CI) of single and multiple NCD morbidity (multimorbidity) covering arthritis, diabetes, angina, stroke, asthma, depression, chronic lung disease and hypertension. The CI quantifies the extent of overall inequality on each morbidity measure. The decomposition utilises a regression-based approach to examine individual contributions of demographic and socioeconomic factors, or determinants, to the overall inequality. Results: In China, the prevalence of single and multiple NCD morbidity was 64.7% and 53.4%, compared with 65.9% and 55.5% respectively in Ghana. Inequalities were significant and more highly concentrated among the poor in China (single morbidity CI = -0.0365: 95% CI = -0.0689,-0.0040; multimorbidity CI = -0.0801: 95% CI = -0.1233,-0.0368;). In Ghana inequalities were significant and more highly concentrated among the rich (single morbidity CI = 0.1182; 95% CI = 0.0697, 0.1668; multimorbidity CI = 0.1453: 95% CI = 0.0794, 0.2083). In China, rural residence contributed most to inequality in single morbidity (36.4%) and the wealth quintiles contributed most to inequality in multimorbidity (39.0%). In Ghana, the wealth quintiles contributed 24.5% to inequality in single morbidity and body mass index contributed 16.2% to the inequality in multimorbidity. Conclusions: The country comparison reflects different stages of economic development and social change in China and Ghana. More studies of this type are needed to inform policy-makers about the patterning of socioeconomic inequalities in health, particularly in developing countries undergoing rapid epidemiological and demographic transitions.

Gender equality and human rights approaches to female genital mutilation: a review of international human rights norms and standards	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Review						Human rights; Gender equality; Gender equity; Gender discrimination; Female genital mutilation; Female genital cutting; Female circumcision; Gender norms; Harmful traditional practices; Violence against women; Gender based violence		Two hundred million girls and women in the world are estimated to have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), and another 15 million girls are at risk of experiencing it by 2020 in high prevalence countries (UNICEF, 2016. Female genital mutilation/cutting: a global concern. 2016). Despite decades of concerted efforts to eradicate or abandon the practice, and the increased need for clear guidance on the treatment and care of women who have undergone FGM, present efforts have not yet been able to effectively curb the number of women and girls subjected to this practice (UNICEF. Female genital mutilation/cutting: a statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change. 2013), nor are they sufficient to respond to health needs of millions of women and girls living with FGM. International efforts to address FGM have thus far focused primarily on preventing the practice, with less attention to treating associated health complications, caring for survivors, and engaging health care providers as key stakeholders. Recognizing this imperative, WHO developed guidelines on management of health complications of FGM. In this paper, based on foundational research for the development of WHO's guidelines, we situate the practice of FGM as a rights violation in the context of international and national policy and efforts, and explore the role of health providers in upholding health-related human rights of women at girls who are survivors, or who are at risk. Findings are based on a literature review of relevant international human rights treaties and UN Treaty Monitoring Bodies.

Methods The 1991 and 2001 Belgian censuses were linked with cause-of-death data, each yielding a study population of over 5 million individuals aged 25-64, followed up for 5 years. Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMR) were computed by educational level (EL) and cause. Inequalities were measured through rate differences (RDs), rate ratios (RRs) and population attributable fractions (PAFs). We analysed changes in educational inequalities between the 1990s and the 2000s, and decomposed the PAF into the main causes of death. Results All-cause and avoidable ASMR decreased in all ELs and both sexes. Lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and suicide in men, and IHD, stroke, lung cancer and COPD in women had the highest impact on population mortality. RDs decreased in men but increased in women. RRs and PAFs increased in both sexes, albeit more in women. In men, the impact of lung cancer and COPD inequalities on population mortality decreased while that of suicide and IHD increased. In women, the impact of all causes except IHD increased. Conclusion Absolute inequalities decreased in men while increasing in women; relative inequalities increased in both sexes. The PAFs decomposition revealed that targeting mortality inequalities from lung cancer, IHD, COPD in both sexes, suicide in men and stroke in women would have the largest impact at population level.

Consequently, understanding policy and how to change it has become a central goal of public health. Yet conceptualisation of what constitutes policy and where it can be found is very limited within this field. Our glossary demonstrates that policy is many headed. It is located in a vast array of documents, discussions dialogues and actions which can be captured variously by formal and informal forms of documentation and observation. Effectively understanding policy and its relevance for public health requires an awareness of the full range of places and contexts in which policy work happens and policy documents are produced.

Although the employee should first request reasonable accommodation with the employer, evaluation by a mental health professional is one of the initial steps for individuals who report significant psychiatric symptoms that are impairing their functioning at work in the U.S.. Important regulations and laws in the United States that are essential knowledge to performing thorough mental disability evaluations include the ADA and Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), Social Security Disability, Workers' Compensation, and private disability insurance. These laws differ in applicability and in their definitions of disability. Social Security Disability is applicable to workers who have long-term impairments regardless of whether the disability arose on or off the job, while Worker's Compensation is specific to persons with work-related illness and injuries that occur on the job (Reno, Williams, & Sengupta, ). The Social Security definition of a disabled person is a person who is not able to engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a medically-determinable physical or mental impairment(s): that is expected to result in death, or that has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months (Social Security Red Book, ). However, the Workers' Compensation definition of what illnesses/injuries are compensated, the level of benefits and who provides the insurance are state-specific. Due to these differences in definition of disability, it is essential for the mental health professional performing a mental disability evaluation to clarify with the referral source or referring agency which legislation and laws they feel are directly relevant to the specific situation before starting the evaluation. While the ADA and ADA Amendments Act of 2008 have had the greatest impact on the improvement of conditions for mentally disabled individuals in employment over the last 25 years, they have also been the most challenging by far for mental health experts to understand and apply (Cook, ). Interestingly, the ADA has had a much quicker effect on improving access to services for the medically disabled as compared with the mentally disabled in the U.S. (Ullman, Johnsen, Moss, & Burris, ). This article reviews the history and status of current ADA- and ADAAA-related law and employment as well as Canadian disability law and global progress towards universal disability legislation as evidenced by the 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Pain conditions are a concern in primary health care, and people with severe and complex pain are referred to specialty health care. There is gender bias in access, counselling, assessment, and treatment of long-term pain. Objective: This study explores patient accounts and perceptions about important (social) factors for accessing specialised pain rehabilitation from gender and intersectional equality perspectives. We aimed to identify potential biases and inequalities in accessing rehabilitation resources at a specialised rehabilitation clinic Design: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 adults after an assessment or completion of a specialised rehabilitation programme in northern Sweden. Qualitative content analysis was used to explore patients' perceptions of important factors for accessing rehabilitation. Results: One main theme was formulated as Access to rehab - not a given. Three categories of perceived inequality were demonstrated: power of gender, power of social status, and power of diagnosis. Participants perceived rehabilitation as a resource that is not equally available, but dependent on factors such as gender, socio-economic status, ability to work, ethnicity, or age, and more subtle aspects of social status and habitus (e.g. appearance, fitness, and weight). The character of diagnosis received (medical versus psychiatric or social) was also noted. Conclusions: It is crucial that professionals are aware of how potential inequalities related to gender, social status, and diagnosis, and their intersections, can be created, perceived, and have influence on the processes of assessment and treatment. Reduction of social determinants of health and biases remain important within global, national, and local contexts.

J	Green-Thompson, LP; McInerney, P; Woollard, B				Green-Thompson, Lionel P.; McInerney, Patricia; Woollard, Bob			The social accountability of doctors: a relationship based framework for understanding emergent community concepts of caring	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							MEDICAL-EDUCATION; HEALTH; MODEL	Background: Social accountability is defined as the responsibility of institutions to respond to the health priorities of a community. There is an international movement towards the education of health professionals who are accountable to communities. There is little evidence of how communities experience or articulate this accountability. Methods: In this grounded theory study eight community based focus group discussions were conducted in rural and urban South Africa to explore community members' perceptions of the social accountability of doctors. The discussions were conducted across one urban and two rural provinces. Group discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results: Initial coding was done and three main themes emerged following data analysis: the consultation as a place of love and respect (participants have an expectation of care yet are often engaged with disregard); relationships of people and systems (participants reflect on their health priorities and the links with the social determinants of health) and Ubuntu as engagement of the community (reflected in their expectation of Ubuntu based relationships as well as part of the education system). These themes were related through a framework which integrates three levels of relationship: center dot a central community of reciprocal relationships with the doctor-patient relationship as core; center dot a level in which the systems of health and education interact and together with social determinants of health mediate the insertion of communities into a broader discourse. center dot An ubuntu framing in which the tensions between vulnerability and power interact and reflect rights and responsibility. The space between these concepts is important for social accountability. Conclusion: Social accountability has been a concept better articulated by academics and centralized agencies. Communities bring a richer dimension to social accountability through their understanding of being human and caring. This study also creates the connection between ubuntu and social accountability and their mutual transformative capacity as agents for social justice	[Green-Thompson, Lionel P.; McInerney, Patricia] Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, PV Tobias Hlth Sci Bldg,5 York Rd, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Woollard, Bob] Univ British Columbia, Dept Family Practice, Vancouver, BC, Canada	University of Witwatersrand; University of British Columbia	Green-Thompson, LP (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Fac Hlth Sci, PV Tobias Hlth Sci Bldg,5 York Rd, ZA-2193 Johannesburg, South Africa.

J	Eichbaum, Q				Eichbaum, Quentin			Acquired and Participatory Competencies in Health Professions Education: Definition and Assessment in Global Health	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							CULTURAL COMPETENCE; MEDICAL-SCHOOLS; CHALLENGES; RETHINKING; FEEDBACK; JUSTICE	Many health professions education programs in high-income countries (HICs) have adopted a competency-based approach to learning. Although global health programs have followed this trend, defining and assessing competencies has proven problematic, particularly in resource-constrained settings of low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) where HIC students and trainees perform elective work. In part, this is due to programs failing to take sufficient account of local learning, cultural, and health contexts. A major divide between HIC and LMIC settings is that the learning contexts of HICs are predominantly individualist, whereas those of LMICs are generally collectivist. Individualist cultures view learning as something that the individual acquires independent of context and can possess; collectivist cultures view learning as arising dynamically from specific contexts through group participation. To bridge the individualist-collectivist learning divide, the author proposes that competencies be classified as either acquired or participatory. Acquired competencies can be transferred across contexts and assessed using traditional psychometric approaches; participatory competencies are linked to contexts and require alternative assessment approaches. The author proposes assessing participatory competencies through the approach of self-directed assessment seeking, which includes multiple members of the health care team as assessors. The proposed classification of competencies as acquired or participatory may apply across health professions. The author suggests advancing participatory competencies through mental models of sharing. In global health education, the author recommends developing three new competency domains rooted in participatory learning, collectivism, and sharing: resourceful learning; transprofessionalism and transformative learning; and social justice and health equity.

This study investigates whether new international migrants in the U.S. are exposed to environmental hazards and how this pattern varies among immigrant subpopulations (e.g., Hispanics, Asian, European). We combine sociodemographic information from the American Community Survey with toxicity-weighted chemical concentrations (Toxics Release Inventory) to model the relationship between toxin exposure and the relative population of recent immigrants across Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs, n = 2054) during 2005-2011. Results from spatial panel models show that immigrants tend to be less exposed to toxins, suggesting resilience instead of vulnerability. This pattern was pronounced among immigrants from Europe and Latin America (excluding Mexico). However, our results revealed that Mexican immigrants are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards in wealthy regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The issues of biosafety and biosecurity are also examined. A consequentialist analysis offers an essential road map to policymakers and regulators as to how to deal with synbio. Additionally, the article discusses the limitations of consequentialism as a tool for analysing synbioethics. Is it possible to predict, with any degree of plausibility, what the consequences of synthetic biology will be in 50 years, or in 100, or in 500? Synbio may take humanity to a place of radical departure from what is known or knowable.

Rather than meeting this challenge by working in separate domains or via single-disciplinary perspectives, we chart the development of a system-wide approach to the food supply chain. In this approach, social and environmental questions are simultaneously addressed. Firstly, we provide a holistic model of the agri-food system, which depicts the processes involved, the principal inputs and outputs, the actors and the external influences, emphasising the system's interactions, feedbacks and complexities. Secondly, we show how this model necessitates a research programme that includes the study of land-use, crop production and protection, food processing, storage and distribution, retailing and consumption, nutrition and public health. Acknowledging the methodological and epistemological challenges involved in developing this approach, we propose two specific ways forward. Firstly, we propose a method for analysing and modelling agri-food systems in their totality, which enables the complexity to be reduced to essential components of the whole system to allow tractable quantitative analysis using LCA and related methods. This initial analysis allows for more detailed quantification of total system resource efficiency, environmental impact and waste. Secondly, we propose a method to analyse the ethical, legal and political tensions that characterise such systems via the use of deliberative fora. We conclude by proposing an agenda for agri-food research which combines these two approaches into a rational programme for identifying, testing and implementing the new agri-technologies and agri-food policies, advocating the critical application of nexus thinking to meet the global food security challenge.

Various studies attribute declines in mortality to the combined effects of improvements in health care practices and changes in socio-economic factors. Since the early nineties, Cambodia has managed to evolve from a country devastated by war to a nation soon to enter the group of middle income countries. Cambodia's development efforts are reflected in some remarkable health outcomes such as a significant decline in child mortality rates and the early achievement of related Millennium Development Goals. An achievement acknowledged through the inclusion of Cambodia as one of the ten fast-track countries in the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. This study aims to highlight findings from the field so to provide evidence for future programming and policy efforts. It will be argued that to foster further advances in health, Cambodia will need to keep neonatal survival and health high on the agenda and tackle exacerbating inequities that arise from a pluralistic health system with considerable regional differences and socio-economic disparities. Methods/Findings Data was drawn from Demographic Health Surveys (2000, 2005, 2010, 2014). Information on a series of demographic and socio-economic household characteristics and on child anthropometry, feeding practices and child health were collected from nationally representative samples. To reach the required sample size, live-births that occurred over the past 10 years before the date of the interview were included. Demographic variables included: gender of the child, living area (urban or rural; four ecological regions (constructed by merging provinces and the capital), mother's age at birth (<20, 20-35, 35+), birth interval (long, short) and birth order (1st, 2-3, 4-6, 7+). Socio-economic variables included: mother education level (none, primary, secondary+) and household wealth (asset-based index). Data on antenatal care, tetanus injection and skilled assistance at birth were used for the mother's last child. Between 2000 and 2014, Cambodia achieved a considerable reduction in neonatal mortality (46% reduction rate). By 2014, gender inequities became almost non-existent (for all measures of equality); inequity related to mother's education decreased for all time periods; improvements were observed for differences in neonatal mortality by preceding birth interval; and a reduction in neonatal mortality rates could be noted among all the regional subgroups. Inequities increased between mothers who had limited antenatal care and those who received more than four antenatal care visits. In most scale indicators, the Slope Index of Inequality and Relative Index of Inequality estimates for all four rounds of the survey suggest inequity exacerbated in deprived communities. Also, wealth and residence (urban/rural divide) continued to be major determinants in neonatal mortality rates and related inequity trends. Conclusion Analysis highlighted some of the complex patterns and determinants of neonatal mortality, in Cambodia. There has been a considerable decline in neonatal mortality which echoes global trends. Our analysis reveals that despite these advances, additional socio-economic and demographic characteristics considerably affected neonatal mortality rates and its inequities. There continue to be pockets of vulnerable groups that are lagging behind. This analysis highlights the determinants along the urban-rural and rich-poor divides in neonatal mortality inequities and how these affect access to and utilization of quality basic health services. This calls for future policy and programming efforts to be deliberate in their equity approach. Quality improvements in health services and targeted interventions for specific socio-economic groups will be required to further accelerate progress in reducing neonatal mortality and address Cambodia's pressing unfinished agenda in health.

Bioarchaeological Perspectives on Socio-Economic Status, Inequality, and Health in Urban Children from the Industrial Revolution (18th-19th C), England	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OSTEOARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article						post-medieval; growth; palaeopathology; vitamin D deficiency; weaning; London	INFANT-MORTALITY; BONE-GROWTH; SKELETAL MANIFESTATIONS; DISEASE; NUTRITION; LONDON; POPULATION; MEDIEVAL; RICKETS; STRESS	The 18th and 19th centuries in England were characterised by a period of increasing industrialisation of its urban centres. It was also one of widening social and health inequalities between the rich and the poor. Childhood is well-documented as being a stage in the life course during which the body is particularly sensitive to adverse socio-economic environments. This study therefore aims to examine the relationship between health and wealth through a comprehensive skeletal analysis of a sample of 403 children (0-17years), of varying socio-economic status, from four cemetery sites in London (c.1712-1854). Measurements of long bone diaphyseal length, cortical thickness, vertebral neural canal size, and the prevalence of a range of pathological indicators of health stress were recorded from the Chelsea Old Church (high status), St Benet Sherehog (middle status), Bow Baptist (middle status), and Cross Bones (low status) skeletal collections. Children from the low status Cross Bones site demonstrated deficient growth values, as expected. However, those from the high status site of Chelsea Old Church also demonstrated poor growth values during infancy. Fashionable child-care practices (e.g. the use of artificial infant feeds and keeping children indoors) may have contributed to poor infant health amongst high status groups. However, differing health risks in the lower status group revealed the existence of substantial health inequality in London at this time.

Economic inequality increases risk taking	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						income inequality; risk taking; decision making; inequality; socioeconomic status	INCOME INEQUALITY; EARNINGS; AVERSION	Rising income inequality is a global trend. Increased income inequality has been associated with higher rates of crime, greater consumer debt, and poorer health outcomes. The mechanisms linking inequality to poor outcomes among individuals are poorly understood. This research tested a behavioral account linking inequality to individual decision making. In three experiments (n = 811), we found that higher inequality in the outcomes of an economic game led participants to take greater risks to try to achieve higher outcomes. This effect of unequal distributions on risk taking was driven by upward social comparisons. Next, we estimated economic risk taking in daily life using large-scale data from internet searches. Risk taking was higher in states with greater income inequality, an effect driven by inequality at the upper end of the income distribution. Results suggest that inequality may promote poor outcomes, in part, by increasing risky behavior.	[Payne, B.

Squaring the circle: health as a bridge to global solidarity in the Sustainable Development Goals	ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD			English	Article							CHILD HEALTH; POST-2015; INEQUALITIES; COVERAGE	The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), launched in September 2015 to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals, require action by all countries. The new goals range from traditional areas of health and education to a newer focus on global trade and environmental protection. We discuss how all countries can be incentivised to engage and commit and argue that thoughtful target-setting and benchmarking, a more aggressive focus on equity and an emphasis on the interdependence of health and non-health development goals are key to meaningful progress. Fundamental shared values and aspirations around health, and in particular child health, within SDG3 may, we argue, offer a platform on which to build genuine global solidarity.

J	Danielsen, L				Danielsen, Lotte			Enforcing 'Progress': A Story of an MDG 5 Indicator and Maternal Health in Malawi	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article							ANTHROPOLOGY; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; CULTURE; POLICY; LIFE	Considering the importance of metrics in current systems of global health accountability, this article analyses the dynamics behind a maternal health indicator. To achieve the target of Millennium Development Goal 5 (MDG5) and increase the proportion of births attended by 'skilled health personnel', some districts in Malawi in 2010 introduced information campaigns to promote births in hospitals and a fine to punish mothers who delivered outside of biomedical health institutions. The study is based on ethnographic research in one Malawian village. While many mothers described the ill treatment and bad conditions in maternity wards, most women still started to publicly sanction institutional births. This apparent contradiction can be understood by looking at the positions and motivations of the various actors who participated in the performance of MDG 5 in the village and how their projects became tied to the focus on improving the indicator. Rather than expressing a demand for the existing maternal health services as such, the ethnography suggests that the actors' practices expressed hopes and claims to wider material improvements in a context of inequality. The article highlights dynamics that are concealed if we restrict the analysis to one of biopower, and expands the purview of the study of metrics into the spaces which indicators are intended to represent.

Combining the Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) and the Eora global multi-regional input-output table, we use input-output analysis to calculate a consumer social risk footprint (SF) of nations' imports. For our SFs, we select four indicators related to five of the UN's SDGs: gender equality (SDG 5 also 8.5 & 8.8); mother and child health (SDG 3, especially 3.1 & 3.2); governance (SDG 16, especially 16.5 & 16.6); and access to clean water (SDG 6, especially 6.1 & 62). After examining results for all four indicators we focus on gender equality to fully convey the value and limitations of using this method of analysis. Our study compares producer (domestic) social risk and consumer social risk footprints resulting from international trade patterns. Generally, developed countries show higher social risk footprints while developing countries show higher domestic social risks with the exceptions of UK and Ireland in the developed-world, and China and India in the developing-world. Details of the SFs associated with exported products worldwide reveal that Pakistan, Yemen and Iran have some of the highest SF risk, while Australia, Canada and Denmark are among the lowest. These results are important for the UN in developing partnerships to address the Sustainable Development Goals and for organisations such as the World Bank, Trade Unions and NGOs' work towards a fairer world.

We explored relationships between district II, household income (HHI) and depressive symptoms in national panel data. Method: We used 3 waves (2008, 2010, 2012) of the SA National Income Dynamics Study (n=25936) in adjusted mixed effects logistic regression to assess if the relationship between HHI and depressive symptoms is dependent on level of II. Depressive symptoms were assessed with Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, and District inequality ratios (P10P90) derived from HHI distributions in 53 districts. Results: Lower HHI and increasing II were associated with depressive symptoms. The interaction term between HHI and II on depressive symptoms was significant ((beta=0.01, 95% CI: < 0.01-0.01); with increasing II and decreasing HHI, depression risk increased. Conclusion: II widens income-related disparities in depression risk in SA, with policy implications for understanding socioeconomic determinants of mental health and informing global efforts to reduce disparities in high poverty and inequality contexts.

National income inequality and ineffective health insurance in 35 low- and middle-income countries	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Health insurance; income inequality; ineffective insurance; LMIC; universal health coverage	SELF-RATED HEALTH; POPULATION HEALTH; LIFE EXPECTANCY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MORTALITY; STATES; LEVEL	Global health policy efforts to improve health and reduce financial burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) has fuelled interest in expanding access to health insurance coverage to all, a movement known as Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Ineffective insurance is a measure of failure to achieve the intended outcomes of health insurance among those who nominally have insurance. This study aimed to evaluate the relation between national-level income inequality and the prevalence of ineffective insurance. We used Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) Gini coefficients for 35 LMICs and World Health Survey (WHS) data about insurance from 2002 to 2004 to fit multivariable regression models of the prevalence of ineffective insurance on national Gini coefficients, adjusting for GDP per capita. Greater inequality predicted higher prevalence of ineffective insurance. When stratifying by individual-level covariates, higher inequality was associated with greater ineffective insurance among sub-groups traditionally considered more privileged: youth, men, higher education, urban residence and the wealthiest quintile. Stratifying by World Bank country income classification, higher inequality was associated with ineffective insurance among upper-middle income countries but not low- or lower-middle income countries. We hypothesize that these associations may be due to the imprint of underlying social inequalities as countries approach decreasing marginal returns on improved health insurance by income. Our findings suggest that beyond national income, income inequality may predict differences in the quality of insurance, with implications for efforts to achieve UHC.

We present data from the UN Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific, exploring the pathways between different forms of childhood trauma and violence against women. Methods In this multicountry study, we interviewed multistage representative samples of men and women, aged 18-49 years, in Asia and the Pacific, using standardised population-based household surveys. Men were interviewed in six countries, and women in four. Respondents were asked questions about their perpetration or experience of intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence, childhood trauma, and harsh parenting (smacking their children as a form of discipline). We used maximum likelihood multivariate logit models to explore associations between childhood trauma and violence against women, and fitted path models to explore associations between experience and perpetration of child maltreatment. Findings Between Jan 1, 2011, and Dec 1, 2012, 10 178 men and 3106 women completed interviews in this study, with between 815 and 1812 men per site and 477 and 1103 women per site. The proportion of men who experienced any childhood trauma varied between 59% (n=478, 95% CI 54.0-63.3; Indonesia rural site) and 92% (n=791, 89.4-93.8; Bougainville, Papua New Guinea). For women, the results ranged from 44% (n=272, 37.7-50.8; Sri Lanka) to 84% (n=725, 80.7-86.8; Bougainville, Papua New Guinea). For men, all forms of childhood trauma were associated with all forms of intimate partner violence perpetration. For women, all forms of childhood trauma were associated with physical intimate partner violence, and both physical and sexual intimate partner violence. There were significant, often gendered, pathways between men's and women's perpetration and experiences of childhood trauma, physical intimate partner violence, harsh parenting, and other factors. Interpretation The data point to both a co-occurrence and a cycle of abuse, with childhood trauma leading to violence against women and further child maltreatment, which in turn increases the risk of experience or perpetration of violence during adulthood. Efforts to prevent both forms of violence would benefit from a meaningful integrated approach. Interventions should promote positive parenting, address inequality and the normalisation of violence across the life course, and transform men's power over women and children.

In this study, we aimed to estimate the level and trend of child mortality from 1990 to 2015 in Iran, to assess the progress of the country and its provinces toward these goals. Methods We used three different data sources: three censuses, a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and 5-year data from the death registration system. We used the summary birth history data from four data sources (the three censuses and DHS) and used maternal age cohort and maternal age period methods to estimate the trends in child mortality rates, combining the estimates of these two indirect methods using Loess regression. We also used the complete birth history method to estimate child mortality rate directly from DHS data. Finally, to synthesise different trends into a single trend and calculate uncertainty intervals (UI), we used Gaussian process regression. Findings Under-5 mortality rates (deaths per 1000 livebirths) at the national level in Iran in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015 were 63.6 (95% UI 63.1-64.0), 38.8 (38.5-39.2), 24.9 (24.3-25.4), and 19.4 (18.6-20.2), respectively. Between 1990 and 2015, the median annual reduction and total overall reduction in these rates were 4.9% and 70%, respectively. At the provincial level, the difference between the highest and lowest child mortality rates in 1990, 2000, and 2015 were 65.6, 40.4, and 38.1 per 1000 livebirths, respectively. Based on the MDG 4 goal, five provinces had not decreased child mortality by two-thirds by 2015. Furthermore, six provinces had not reached SDG 3 (target 2). Interpretation Iran and most of its provinces achieved MDG 4 and SDG 3 (target 2) goals by 2015. However, at the subnational level in some provinces, there is substantial inequity. Local policy makers should use effective strategies to accelerate the reduction of child mortality for these provinces by 2030. Possible recommendations for such strategies include enhancing the level of education and health literacy among women, tackling sex discrimination, and improving incomes for families.

The CONCORD programme was designed to assess worldwide differences and trends in population-based cancer survival. In this population-based study, we aimed to estimate survival inequalities globally for several subtypes of childhood leukaemia. Methods Cancer registries participating in CONCORD were asked to submit tumour registrations for all children aged 0-14 years who were diagnosed with leukaemia between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2009, and followed up until Dec 31, 2009. Haematological malignancies were defined by morphology codes in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third revision. We excluded data from registries from which the data were judged to be less reliable, or included only lymphomas, and data from countries in which data for fewer than ten children were available for analysis. We also excluded records because of a missing date of birth, diagnosis, or last known vital status. We estimated 5-year net survival (ie, the probability of surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis, after controlling for deaths from other causes [background mortality]) for children by calendar period of diagnosis (1995-99, 2000-04, and 2005-09), sex, and age at diagnosis (< 1, 1-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years, inclusive) using appropriate life tables. We estimated age-standardised net survival for international comparison of survival trends for precursor-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Findings We analysed data from 89 828 children from 198 registries in 53 countries. During 1995-99, 5-year agestandardised net survival for all lymphoid leukaemias combined ranged from 10.6% (95% CI 3.1-18.2) in the Chinese registries to 86.8% (81.6-92.0) in Austria. International differences in 5-year survival for childhood leukaemia were still large as recently as 2005-09, when age-standardised survival for lymphoid leukaemias ranged from 52.4% (95% CI 42.8-61.9) in Cali, Colombia, to 91.6% (89.5-93.6) in the German registries, and for AML ranged from 33.3% (18.9-47.7) in Bulgaria to 78.2% (72.0-84.3) in German registries. Survival from precursor-cell ALL was very close to that of all lymphoid leukaemias combined, with similar variation. In most countries, survival from AML improved more than survival from ALL between 2000-04 and 2005-09. Survival for each type of leukaemia varied markedly with age: survival was highest for children aged 1-4 and 5-9 years, and lowest for infants (younger than 1 year). There was no systematic difference in survival between boys and girls. Interpretation Global inequalities in survival from childhood leukaemia have narrowed with time but remain very wide for both ALL and AML. These results provide useful information for health policy makers on the effectiveness of health-care systems and for cancer policy makers to reduce inequalities in childhood survival.

The number of open defecators in India dwarfs that of other states, and most live in rural places. Open defecation is often approached as a problem scaled at the site of the individual, who makes a choice not to build and/or use a toilet. Attempts to end rural open defecation by targeting individuals, like social marketing or behavior change approaches, often ignore the structural inequalities that shape rural residents' everyday lives. Our study explores the question, "What is the role of remoteness in sustaining open defecation in rural India?" We deploy the concept of remoteness as an analytical tool that can capture everyday practices of open defecation as a function of physical and social distance. Using ethnographic methods, we interviewed and observed 70 participants in four villages in Uttarakhand, India over a three-month period in 2013. We find that remoteness in general, and its lived nuances, form a context for prevalent open defecation. Structural inequalities across space will need to be addressed to make latrine building and usage viable in remote places. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Illustrative examples include: the use of remote sensing data to fight vector-borne diseases; large databases of genomic sequences of foodborne pathogens helping to identify origins of outbreaks; social networks and internet search engines for tracking communicable diseases; cell phone data in humanitarian actions; drones to deliver healthcare services in remote and secluded areas. Open science and data sharing platforms are proposed for fostering international research programmes under fair, ethical and respectful conditions. Innovative education, such as massive open online courses or serious games, can promote wider access to training in public health and improving health literacy. The world is moving towards learning healthcare systems. Professionals are equipped with data collection and decision support devices. They share information, which are complemented by external sources, and analysed in real time using machine learning techniques. They allow for the early detection of anomalies, and eventually guide appropriate public health interventions. This article shows how information- driven approaches, enabled by digital technologies, can help improving global health with greater equity.

J	Heller, A; Hannig, A				Heller, Alison; Hannig, Anita			Unsettling the fistula narrative: cultural pathology, biomedical redemption, and inequities of health access in Niger and Ethiopia	ANTHROPOLOGY & MEDICINE			English	Article						Obstetric fistula; childbirth; narrative; biomedicine; Niger; Ethiopia	OBSTETRIC FISTULA	Obstetric fistula, a maternal childbirth injury that results in chronic incontinence, affects an estimated one million women in the global south. In the course of media and donor coverage on this condition, fistula sufferers have been branded as child brides' who, following the onset of their incontinence, become social pariahs and eventually find physical and social redemption through surgical repair. This narrative framing pits the violence of culture' against the potency of biomedical salvation. Based on over two years of ethnographic research at fistula repair centres in Niger and Ethiopia, this paper challenges this narrative and argues that most women with obstetric fistula remain embedded in social relations, receive continued familial support, and, unexpectedly, experience ambiguous surgical outcomes. This paper interrogates the existing logics of the fistula narrative that have had the unintended effects of obscuring global structural inequalities and diverting attention away from systemic health access reforms.

The policies of the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis (GF) have not excluded fragile states, and this source has provided financing for these countries according to standardized procedures. They represent interesting cases for exploring the meaning and role of measurement in a globalized context. Measurement in the field of HIV/AIDS and its treatment has given rise to a private outsourcing of expertise and auditing, thereby creating a new form of value based on the social process of registration and the creation of realities produced by the intervention itself. These "scriptural economies" must be questioned in terms of the production of knowledge, but also in terms of social justice. Governing HIV/AIDS treatments by numbers in a fragile state is explored in this article through the experience of the Central African Republic (CAR) in terms of epidemiology and access to antiretroviral drugs. The unexpected effects of performancebased programs in this context underline the need for global health governance to be re-embedded into a social justice framework.

Participation of women in research is necessary to reduce the current bias that most empirical evidence is obtained from studies with men to inform health care and related policy interventions. Various factors are assumed to limit autonomy amongst the Yoruba women of western Nigeria. This paper seeks to explore the experience and understanding of autonomy by the Yoruba women in relation to research participation. Focus is on factors that affect women's autonomous decision making in research participation. An exploratory qualitative approach comprising four focus group discussions, 42 in-depth interviews and 14 key informant interviews was used. The study permits a significant amount of triangulation, as opinions of husbands and religious leaders are also explored. Interviews and discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was employed for data analysis. Findings show that concepts of autonomy varied amongst the Yoruba women. Patriarchy, religion and culture are conceived to have negative impact on the autonomy of women in respect to research participation. Among the important findings are: 1) male dominance is strongly emphasized by religious leaders who should teach equality, 2) while men feel that by making decisions for women, they are protecting them, the women on the other hand see this protection as a way of limiting their autonomy. We recommend further studies to develop culturally appropriate and workable recruitment methods to increase women's participation in research.

The aim of the study was to investigate how the interplay between capitals constitutes social inequalities in adolescent healthy food intake. Methods: Data were collected in the 2013/14 Flemish Health Behavior among School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, which is part of the international WHO HBSC survey. The total sample included 7266 adolescents aged 12-18. A comprehensive set of 58 capital indicators was used to measure economic, cultural and social capital and a healthy food index was computed from a 17-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess the consumption frequency of healthy food within the overall food intake. Results: The different forms of capital were unequally distributed in accordance with the subdivisions within the education system. Only half of the capital indicators positively related to healthy food intake, and instead 17 interactions were found that both increased or reduced inequalities. Cultural capital was a crucial component for explaining inequalities such that social gradients in healthy food intake increased when adolescents participated in elite cultural practices (P < 0.05), and were consequently reduced when adolescents reported to have a high number of books at home (P < 0.05). Conclusion: A combination of selected resources in the form of economic, cultural and social capital may both increase or reduce healthy food intake inequalities in adolescents. Policy action needs to take into account the unequal distribution of these resources within the education system.

HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL AID; OPPORTUNITY; ALLOCATION	After years of unprecedented growth in development assistance for health (DAH), the system is challenged on several fronts: by the economic downturn and stagnation of DAH, by the epidemiological transition and increase in non-communicable diseases, and by the economic transition and rise of the middle-income countries. This raises questions about which countries should receive DAH and how much, and, fundamentally, what criteria that promote fair and effective allocation. Yet, no broad comparative assessment exists of the criteria used today. We reviewed the allocation criteria stated by five multilateral and nine bilateral funders of DAH. We found that several funders had only limited information about concrete criteria publicly available. Moreover, many funders not devoted to health lacked specific criteria for DAH or criteria directly related to health, and no funder had criteria directly related to inequality. National income per capita was emphasised by many funders, but the associated eligibility thresholds varied considerably. These findings and the broad overview of criteria can assist funders in critically examining and revising the criteria they use, and inform the wider debate about what the optimal criteria are.

Central to any potent response is a fair and effective allocation of DAH across countries. A myriad of criteria has been proposed or is currently used, but there have been no comprehensive assessment of their distributional implications. We simulated the implications of 11 quantitative allocation criteria across countries and country categories. We found that the distributions varied profoundly. The group of low-income countries received most DAH from needs-based criteria linked to domestic capacity, while the group of upper-middle-income countries was most favoured by an income-inequality criterion. Compared to a baseline distribution guided by gross national income per capita, low-income countries received less DAH by almost all criteria. The findings can inform funders when examining and revising the criteria they use, and provide input to the broader debate about what criteria should be used.

J	Ottersen, T; Moon, S; Rottingen, JA				Ottersen, Trygve; Moon, Suerie; Rottingen, John-Arne			The challenge of middle-income countries to development assistance for health: recipients, funders, both or neither?	HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article							INTERNATIONAL AID; CONDITIONALITY; OPPORTUNITY; COVERAGE; POVERTY; POLICY; COSTS	Recent developments have transformed the role and characteristics of middle-income countries (MICs). Many stakeholders now question the appropriate role of MICs in the system of development assistance for health (DAH), and key funders have already recast their approach to these countries. The pressing question is whether MICs should be recipients, funders, both or neither. The answer has deep implications for individual countries and their citizens, and for the DAH system as a whole. We clarify the fundamental issues involved and emphasise a special feature of many MICs: mid-level gross national income per capita (GNIpc) combined with substantial health needs and large inequalities. We discuss the trade-off between concerns for capacity and need, and illustrate a capacity-based approach to setting the level of a GNIpc eligibility threshold. We also discuss how needs-based exceptions and incentive-preserving instruments can complement such a threshold. Against this background, we outline options for the future roles of MICs in various circumstances. We conclude that major players in the DAH system have reason to reconsider the criteria for allocating DAH among countries and the norms for which countries should contribute and how much.

Methods: We used the criteria of efficiency and equity which were adopted in a previous international study, adapted to Israel. The equity criteria, as defined in the international study, are: severity of the disease, age (young vs. elderly), and the extent to which the poor are subsidized. Efficiency is represented by the criteria: the potential number of beneficiaries, the extent of the health benefits to the patient, and the results of economic assessments (cost per QALY gained). We contacted 147 policy-makers, 65 of whom completed the survey (a response rate of 44%). Using Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) methodology by 1000 Minds software, we estimated the relative weights of these seven criteria, and predicted the desirability of technologies characterized by profiles of the criteria. Results: The overall weight attached to the four efficiency criteria was 46% and that of the three equity criteria was 54%. The most important criteria were "financing of the technology is required so that the poor will be able to receive it" and the level of individual benefit. "The technology is intended to be used by the elderly" criterion appeared as the least important, taking the seventh place. Policy-makers who had experience as members of the Basket Committee appear to prefer efficiency criteria more than those who had never participated in the Basket Committee deliberations. While the efficiency consideration gained preference in most countries studied, Israel is unique in its balance between the weights attached to equity and efficiency considerations by health policy-makers. Discussion: The study explored the trade-off between efficiency and equity considerations in the preferences of health policy-makers in Israel. The way these declarative preferences have been expressed in actual policy decisions remains to be explored.

However, this definition does not do justice to the universality of the concept, and the holistic ideas and related valuable practices promoted by the term, applicable to fisheries science, contributing thus to the neglect of the term in the international stage. This article explores the importance of environmental, commercial, and research activities related to Satoumi, based on actions implemented by Fisheries Cooperative Associations (FCAs) of different prefectures in Japan. The examined case studies are bottom-up initiatives undertaken by Japanese fishermen and constitute effective means towards sustainable and competitive fisheries management. Such initiatives play an important role in disseminating the positive effects of the Satoumi approach in Japan, and promote therefore its adoption in other regions of the World as well.

We reviewed the medical literature with respect to cancer prevention, access to cancer treatment, and access to effective supportive and palliative care for Al/AN populations in the United States. Research confirms poorer cancer outcomes, suboptimal cancer screening, and high-risk cancer behaviors among Al/AN communities. Al/AN cancer patients are less likely to undergo recommended cancer surgeries, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation therapy than their White counterparts. Studies including both rural and urban survivors with Al cancer revealed barriers to receipt of optimal cancer symptom management and proportionally lower hospice use among Al/AN populations. Culturally tailored programs in targeted communities have been shown to mitigate the observed cancer-related health disparities among Al/AN communities. There is still much work to be done to improve cancer-related health outcomes in Al/AN communities, and the goals of the providers serving them corresponds with those propelling the growing interest in global oncology equity. Policy work and more funding are needed to continue to build upon the work that the Indian Health Service and established cancer-related health programs have begun in Al/AN communities.

South East Asia, Differing Socioeconomic Factors, Differing Access to Radiotherapy: The Philippines, a Microcosm	SEMINARS IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY			English	Article							RADIATION-THERAPY	The accessibility of radiotherapy in Southeast Asia, a region characterized by diversity in both economy and culture, differ widely among its member countries. In most countries, access is not universal and is generally limited by radiotherapy resources and the health-seeking behavior of patients. This in turn relates to the current health policy in place, the practice of radiation oncology, and cultural factors such as religion and family dynamics. Although it is clear that radiotherapy access parallel economic development, it is also affected by different social factors that work to facilitate or impede its improvement. These factors are herein described in relation to the Philippine situation, where there is wide economic disparity, multiple subcultures, and logistical impediments to improving radiotherapy access, reminiscent of the Southeast Asian region. In the face of increasing cancer burden, it becomes increasingly important to improve services and develop new and efficient approaches taking different cultural factors into consideration. Through regional and international cooperation, solutions to the common and complex problem of inequity in radiotherapy access may be developed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

URBAN STUDIES			English	Article						Asian cities; housing; premature mortality; public housing; spatial analysis; urban health disparities	SOCIAL POLARIZATION; INCOME INEQUALITY; GLOBAL CITY; HEALTH; TENURE; DISPARITIES; EDUCATION; PEOPLE; MODELS; HOME	Research into understanding the relationship between access to housing, health and wellbeing in cities has yielded mixed evidence to date and has been limited to case studies from Western countries. Many studies appear to highlight the negative effects of public housing in influencing the health of its residents. Current trends in the urban housing markets in cities of advanced Asian economies and debates surrounding the role of government in providing housing underscore the need for more focused research into housing and health. In this paper, we investigate Hong Kong as an example of a thriving Asian city by exploring and comparing the intra-urban geographies of premature mortality and public housing provision in the city. Using a fully Bayesian spatial structural model, we estimate associations between public housing provision and different types of premature mortality. We find significant geographic variations in premature mortality within Hong Kong during the five-year period 2005-2009, with positive associations between the residents of public housing and premature mortality risk. But the associations attenuate or are even reversed for premature mortality of injuries and non-communicable diseases after controlling for local deprivation, housing instability, access to local amenities and other neighbourhood characteristics. The results indicate that public housing may have a protective effect on community health, which contradicts the findings of similar studies carried out in Western cities. We suggest reasons why the association between public housing and health differs in Hong Kong and discuss the implications for housing policy in Hong Kong and other Asian cities.

However, most of the existing programs describe partnerships that are primarily faculty-driven and supported by extramural funding. Program Description: Research and Advocacy for Health in India (RAHI, or "pathfinder" in Hindi) and Support and Action Towards Health-Equity in India (SATHI, or "partnership" in Hindi) are 2 interconnected, collaborative efforts between the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) and Charutar Arogya Mandal (CAM), a medical college and a tertiary care center in rural western India. The RAHI-SATHI program is the culmination of a series of student/trainee-led research and capacity strengthening initiatives that received institutional support in the form of faculty mentorship and seed funding. RAHI-SATHI's trainee-led twinning approach overcomes traditional barriers faced by global health programs. Trainees help mitigate geographical barriers by acting as a bridge between members from different institutions, garner cultural insight through their ability to immerse themselves in a community, and overcome expertise limitations through pre-planned structured mentorship from faculty of both institutions. Trainees play a central role in cultivating trust among the team members and, in the process, they acquire personal leadership skills that may benefit them in their future careers. Conclusion: This paradigm of trainee-led twinning partnership promotes sustainability in an uncertain funding climate and provides a roadmap for conducting foundational work that is essential for the development of a broad, university-wide global health program.

To illustrate the methodology of combining multiple publicly available data sources, we present a case study of the Lorraine region (France), where regional stakeholders were involved in the global procedures for data collection and organization. Different indicators are developed by combining technical approaches for assessing and characterizing human health exposure to chemical substances (in soil, air and water) and noise risk factors. The results permit identification of pollutant sources, determinants of exposure, and potential hotspot areas. A test of the model's assumptions to changes in sub-indicator spatial distribution showed the impact of data transformation on identifying more impacted areas. Cumulative risk assessment permits the combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluation of health risks by including stakeholders in the decision process, helping to define a subjective conceptual analysis framework or assumptions when uncertainties or knowledge gaps operate.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Institute of Medicine (2011) supported the call to strengthen the nursing profession by establishing global standards of educational criteria and outcomes. Throughout the world, health education is affected by fundamental inadequacies related to static, fragmented, and content-oriented curricula. There are inadequacies in our curricula, and nursing faculties are facing challenges with clinical placements (both the number and quality of these placements); therefore, alternative methods of providing practice to students need to be considered. A transformative agenda comprising changes in the way students are taught fully harnessing the potential of information and communications technology (i.e., simulation) is necessary. Simulated patient encounters and Objective Structured Clinical Examinations are 2 means to achieve needed practice in a safe environment. The purpose of this article is to show, by using simulation, how students can practice and be evaluated within their clinical practice role in a safe, controlled environment. In addition, this practice can (a) enable students to increase the complexity of their understanding and their autonomy and (b) educate students about social accountability, health and gender equity, social justice, and human rights.

The current study recruited independent panels of experts in Indigenous cardio-metabolic health from Australia, New Zealand and the United States, in order to establish local consensus opinion and initiate dialogue on appropriate prevention strategies. Therefore, a three-round Delphi process was used to consolidate and compare the opinions of 60 experts, 20 from each country. Round one, the experts were asked twelve open-ended questions across six domains: (i) prevention; (ii) consultation; (iii) educational resources; (iv) societal issues; (v) workforce issues; (vi) culture and family. Round two, the experts completed a structured questionnaire based on results from the first round, in which they ranked items according to their importance. Final round, the experts were asked to re-rank the same items after receiving summary feedback about the rank ordering from the previous round. Several themes emerged common to all three countries: (i) socio-economic and education inequalities should be addressed; (ii) educational, behaviour change and prevention strategies should address physical environmental determinants and be responsive to the local context, including being culturally appropriate; and (iii) cultural appropriateness can be achieved through consultation with Indigenous communities, cultural competency training, use of Indigenous health workers, and use of appropriate role models. These findings highlight several key priorities that can be used to initiate dialogue on appropriate prevention strategies. Such strategies should be contextualized to the local Indigenous populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the Chinese authorities have so far acted with great caution because this transition cannot but accelerate the slowdown of China's growth which will likely occur because of other structural factors. We address these issues by means of a two-country two-stage (before and after the renminbi's full convertibility) model, which reproduces some qualitative features of China's growth pattern and its relationship with the United States. We analyse the extent to which altering the Chinese exchange rate regime, as well as other policies affecting sensitive social and economic issues, may impact on the short-, medium-and long-term evolution of the Chinese economy. The paper shows that by lifting the controls on the capital account and letting the currency float, the Chinese authorities will renounce those policy instruments for controlling the allocation of the national resources and the dynamics of China's economy.

With the creation of a devolved government with authority over health and social services, the country has witnessed practice and policy developments that offer distinctive opportunities for innovative research. With multidisciplinary groups of internationally recognized researchers, Scotland is able to take advantage of a unique set of opportunities for aging research: a well-profiled population brings opportunities in population data and linkage to understand people's interactions with health, social care, and other public services; while research on technology and telecare is a distinctive area where Scotland is recognized internationally for using technology to develop effective, high-quality and well-accepted services at relatively low financial cost. The paper also considers free personal care for older people and the national dementia strategy in Scotland. The potential to evaluate the impact of free personal care will provide valuable information for other global health and social care systems. Exploring the impact of the national dementia strategy is another unique area of research that can advance understanding in relation to quality of life and the development of services. The paper concludes that, while Scotland benefits from unique opportunities for progressive public policy and innovative aging research that will provide valuable lessons at the forefront of a globally aging population, the challenges associated with an aging population and increasing cultural diversity must be acknowledged and addressed to ensure that the vision of equality and social justice for all is realized.

The aim of this study was to examine trends in first-authorship for researchers from LMIC institutions (LMIC first-authors) over the period 1990-2013. Methods: This study systematically reviewed research articles about randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in HIV/ AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis (TB) conducted in LMICs from 1990 to 2013, and identified the institutional affiliations of the authors. Key variables extracted from the articles included author affiliation, funding source, disease, intervention type, region and year of publication. Poisson regression was used to explore the impact of these key variables on LMIC first-authorship over time. Results: A total of 1593 articles were identified, of which 49.8% had LMIC first-authors. From 1990 to 2000 a total of 222 trials were published, and from 2001 to 2013 a total of 1371 trials were published, with a steady year-on-year increase over the period particularly evident in trials conducted in Africa. Whereas the absolute total number of LMIC first-authors has increased, as a proportion of all authors it declined. The relative rate increase in first-authorships post 2000 was 11.8-fold for non-LMIC first-authors and 2.8fold for LMIC authors. LMIC first-authorship increased over time for research funded from LMIC; but LMIC first-authorship declined over time for research funded from high income countries (HIC). Conclusions: The absolute increase in the number of trials in HIV/ AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in Africa has led to a modest increase in LMIC first-authors, and a much larger increase in non-LMIC authors. The findings suggest that more inclusive policies by international funders are important in shifting research control to LMICs and improving research equity in the future.

Methods: An existing framework was used to review the three processes for local initiatives: emergence, formulation, and implementation. Multiple case studies were conducted, followed by literature review and semi-structured interviews with key informants. Results: Sixteen districts had implemented local initiatives, including cost sharing, free care for women and children, and free care for delivery and cesareans. Most districts (n= 10) had implemented the cost-sharing intervention. These initiatives were initiated by local actors as well as nongovernmental organizations. The profile of those involved led to different ways of handling the emergence and formulation processes. At implementation, these initiatives faced many issues including late payment of contributions, low involvement of local governments, and equity in participation. Conclusion: There are some issues in the implementation and sustainability of the local initiatives. Although many initiatives exist, these are unable to fully address the financial barriers to care. However, these initiatives highlight context-based financial barriers that must be taken into account to accelerate universal access to health care.

This literature review sought to provide contextual and historical reflection needed to bridge the conceptual gap between clinical efficacy and community effectiveness (i.e. knowledge and usage) of existing HIV prevention options, especially in resource-poor settings. Methods: Between January 2015 and October 2015, we reviewed scholarly and grey literatures to define treatment literacy and health literacy and assess the current need for literacy related to HIV prevention. The review included searches in electronic databases including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Permutations of the following search terms were used: "treatment literacy," "treatment education," "health literacy," and "prevention literacy." Through an iterative process of analyses and searches, titles and/or abstracts and reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed for additional articles, and historical content analyses of grey literature and websites were additionally conducted. Results and discussion: Treatment literacy was a well-established concept developed in the global South, which was later partially adopted by international agencies such as the World Health Organization. Treatment literacy emerged as more effective antiretroviral therapies became available. Developed from popular pedagogy and grassroots efforts during an intense struggle for treatment access, treatment literacy addressed the need to extend access to underserved communities and low-income settings that might otherwise be excluded from access. In contrast, prevention literacy is absent in the recent surge of new biomedical prevention strategies; prevention literacy was scarcely referenced and undertheorized in the available literature. Prevention efforts today include multimodal techniques, which jointly comprise a toolkit of biomedical, behavioural, and structural/environmental approaches. However, linkages to community advocacy and mobilization efforts are limited and unsustainable. Success of prevention efforts depends on equity of access, community-based ownership, and multilevel support structures to enable usage and sustainability. Conclusions: For existing HIV prevention efforts to be effective in "real-world" settings, with limited resources, reflection on historical lessons and contextual realities (i.e. policies, financial constraints, and biomedical patents) indicated the need to extend principles developed for treatment access and treatment literacy, to support prevention literacy and prevention access as an integral part of the global response to HIV.

A virtual and face-to-face consensus process was conducted with participation by a group of international experts who used the surveys available up until 2013 as the point of departure for defining the proposal. The final questionnaire included 77 questions grouped in six dimensions: socio-demographic characteristics of workers and companies; employment conditions; working conditions; health status; resources and preventive activities; and family characteristics. The minimum methodological criteria feature the interviewee's home as the place for the interview and aspects related to the quality of the fieldwork. These results can help improve the comparability of future surveys in Latin America and the Caribbean, which would in turn help improve information on workers' heath in the region.

The present study explored patterns of spatial accessibility with respect to pharmacies in Liguria, Italy, a region with particular geographical and demographic features. Municipal density of pharmacies was proxied as the number of pharmacies per capita and per km2, and spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed to identify spatial clusters. Both non-spatial and spatial models were constructed to predict the study outcome. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed a highly significant clustered pattern in the density of pharmacies per capita (I=0.082) and per km2 (I=0.295). Potentially under-supplied areas were mostly located in the mountainous hinterland. Ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions established a significant positive relationship between the density of pharmacies and income among municipalities located at high altitudes, while no such association was observed in lower-lying areas. However, residuals of the OLS models were spatially auto-correlated. The best-fitting mixed geographically weighted regression (GWR) models outperformed the corresponding OLS models. Pharmacies per capita were best predicted by two local predictors (altitude and proportion of immigrants) and two global ones (proportion of elderly residents and income), while the local terms population, mean altitude and rural status and the global term income functioned as independent variables predicting pharmacies per km2. The density of pharmacies in Liguria was found to be associated with both socio-economic and landscape factors. Mapping of mixed GWR results would be helpful to policy-makers.

Providers' perspectives on inbound medical tourism in Central America and the Caribbean: factors driving and inhibiting sector development and their health equity implications	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						medical tourism; health services research; qualitative methods; Central America; Caribbean	POLICY IMPLICATIONS; COUNTRIES; SERVICES; DESTINATION; FRAMEWORK; THAILAND	Background: Many governments and health care providers worldwide are enthusiastic to develop medical tourism as a service export. Despite the popularity of this policy uptake, there is relatively little known about the specific local factors prospectively motivating and informing development of this sector. Objective: To identify common social, economic, and health system factors shaping the development of medical tourism in three Central American and Caribbean countries and their health equity implications. Design: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Mexico, Guatemala, and Barbados with 150 health system stakeholders. Participants were recruited from private and public sectors working in various fields: trade and economic development, health services delivery, training and administration, and civil society. Transcribed interviews were coded using qualitative data management software, and thematic analysis was used to identify cross-cutting issues regarding the drivers and inhibitors of medical tourism development. Results: Four common drivers of medical tourism development were identified: 1) unused capacity in existing private hospitals, 2) international portability of health insurance, vis-a-vis international hospital accreditation, 3) internationally trained physicians as both marketable assets and industry entrepreneurs, and 4) promotion of medical tourism by public export development corporations. Three common inhibitors for the development of the sector were also identified: 1) the high expense of market entry, 2) poor sector-wide planning, and 3) structural socio-economic issues such as insecurity or relatively high business costs and financial risks. Conclusion: There are shared factors shaping the development of medical tourism in Central America and the Caribbean that help explain why it is being pursued by many hospitals and governments in the region. Development of the sector is primarily being driven by public investment promotion agencies and the private health sector seeking economic benefits with limited consideration and planning for the health equity concerns medical tourism raises.

In addition, there is limited documentation of models for providing appropriately tailored services and social support for transgender populations in lowand middle-income countries. This paper presents outcomes of the Global Fund-supported Pehchan programme, which aimed to strengthen community systems and provide HIV, health, legal and social services to transgender communities across 18 Indian states through a rights-based empowerment approach. Methods: We used a pre-and post-intervention cross-sectional survey design with retrospective analysis of programmatic data. Using stratified sampling, we identified 268 transgender participants in six Indian states from a total of 48,280 transgender people served by Pehchan through 186 community-based organizations. We quantified the impact of interventions by comparing baseline and end line indicators of accessed health social and legal services. We also assessed end line self-efficacy and collective action with regard to social support networks. Results: There were significant increases in community-based demand and use of tailored health, legal, social and psychological services over the time of the Pehchan programme. We report significant increases in access to condoms (12.5%, p < 0.001) and condom use at last anal sex with both regular (18.1%, p < 0.001) and casual (8.1%, p < 0.001) male partners. Access to HIV outreach education and testing and counselling services significantly increased (20.10%, p < 0.001; 33.7%, p < 0.001). In addition, significant increases in access to emergency crisis response (19.7%, p < 0.001), legal support (26.8%, p < 0.001) and mental health services (33.0%, p < 0.001) were identified. Finally, we note that the Pehchan programme successfully provided a platform for the formation, collectivization and visibility of peer support groups. Conclusions: The Pehchan programme's community involvement, rights-based collectivization and gender-affirming approaches significantly improved both demand and access to tailored HIV, health and social services for transgender individuals across India. Furthermore, the Pehchan programme successfully fostered both self-efficacy and collective identity and served as a model for addressing the unique health needs of transgender communities. Continued strengthening of health, social and community systems to better respond to the unique needs of transgender communities is needed in order to sustain these gains.

In the global context of stigma and poor healthcare access, transgender (trans) MSM may face additional barriers to HIV prevention services. Drawing on data from a global survey of MSM, we aimed to describe perceived access to prevention services among trans MSM, examine associations between stigma and access, and compare access between trans MSM and cisgender (non-transgender) MSM. Methods: The 2014 Global Men's Health and Rights online survey was open to MSM (inclusive of trans MSM) from any country and available in seven languages. Baseline data (n = 3857) were collected from July to October 2014. Among trans MSM, correlations were calculated between perceived service accessibility and anti-transgender violence, healthcare provider stigma, and discrimination. Using a nested matched-pair study design, trans MSM were matched 4: 1 to cisgender MSM on age group, region, and HIV status, and conditional logistic regression models compared perceived access to prevention services by transgender status. Results: About 3.4% of respondents were trans men, of whom 69 were included in the present analysis. The average trans MSM participant was 26 to 35 years old (56.5%); lived in western Europe, North America, or Oceania (75.4%); and reported being HIV-negative (98.6%). HIV testing, condoms, and lubricants were accessible for 43.5, 53.6, and 26.1% of trans MSM, respectively. Ever having been arrested or convicted due to being trans and higher exposure to healthcare provider stigma in the past six months were associated with less access to some prevention services. Compared to matched cisgender controls, trans MSM reported significantly lower odds of perceived access to HIV testing (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33, 0.98) and condom-compatible lubricants (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.30, 0.98). Conclusions: This first look at access to HIV prevention services for trans MSM globally found that most reported inadequate access to basic prevention services and that they were less likely than cisgender MSM to have access to HIV testing and lubricants. Results indicate the need to enhance access to basic HIV prevention services for trans MSM, including MSM-specific services.

Summary: Herein, we present a scoping review of the use of OR to analyse issues in global health, with an emphasis on health equity and research impact. A systematic search of five databases was designed to identify relevant published literature. A global overview of 1099 studies highlights the geographic distribution of OR and common OR methods used. From this collection of literature, a narrative description of the use of OR across four main application areas of global health - health systems and operations, clinical medicine, public health and health innovation - is also presented. The theme of health equity is then explored in detail through a subset of 44 studies. Health equity is a critical element of global health that cuts across all four application areas, and is an issue particularly amenable to analysis through OR. Finally, we present seven select cases of OR analyses that have been implemented or have influenced decision-making in global health policy or practice. Based on these cases, we identify three key drivers for success in bridging the gap between OR and global health policy, namely international collaboration with stakeholders, use of contextually appropriate data, and varied communication outlets for research findings. Such cases, however, represent a very small proportion of the literature found. Conclusion: Poor availability of representative and quality data, and a lack of collaboration between those who develop OR models and stakeholders in the contexts where OR analyses are intended to serve, were found to be common challenges for effective OR modelling in global health.

J	Svennberg, L				Svennberg, Lena			Swedish PE teachers' understandings of legitimate movement in a criterion-referenced grading system	PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY			English	Article						Assessment; grading; movement; standards-based; teachers' grading practice	PHYSICAL-EDUCATION; ABILITY; CURRICULUM; HEALTH	Background: Physical Education (PE) has been associated with a multi-activity model in which movement is related to sport discourses and sport techniques. However, as in many international contexts, the Swedish national PE syllabus calls for a wider and more inclusive concept of movement. Complex movement adapted to different settings is valued, and in the national grading criteria qualitative measures of movement are used. This research seeks to examine how the wider concept of movement is interpreted and graded. Drawing on Bernstein's concept of the pedagogic device, the paper explores teachers' roles as active mediators in the transformation of national grading criteria for movement and the kinds of movement that are valued in teachers' grading practices. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate what PE teachers consider legitimate movement in a criterion-referenced grading system and the factors that influence their grading practice. The Repertory Grid (RG) technique was employed in order to access their tacit knowledge. Methodology: Seven Swedish PE teachers were interviewed, all of whom teach and grade years seven to nine in different compulsory schools. Using the RG technique, the teachers were asked to reflect on the aspects they considered important for achieving a high grade. The national grading criteria for years seven to nine were then presented one at a time and the teachers were asked to describe how they assessed and graded each requirement. The teachers were also asked whether any specific factors had influenced their grading. In the content analysis, the second part of the interview was attended to first and the results were interpreted in light of Bernsteins' concept of the pedagogic device. Findings: Sport techniques and competitive sports influenced the teachers' interpretations of what constitutes complex movement. The aspect of fitness also appeared to be valued by the teachers in that it facilitates the valued movement. In some cases the difficulty of describing movement qualities in words could reduce the concept of movement to something measurable and quantifiable. The teachers' concerns about students' unequal opportunities to develop and demonstrate their skills also influenced the teachers' interpretation of complex movement. Conclusions: In the transformation of national grading criteria to grading practice, the pedagogic actions taken inform and limit the way in which legitimate movement in PE is conceptualised. Adopting a concept of movement that is wider than competitive sports allows the structures of inequality to be addressed and enables the movements performed by students with other moving experiences than competitive sports to be valued. The tension between the demands of transparency in a high stakes grading system and the inability to articulate the quality of complex movements is problematic. There is a need to verbalise teachers' conceptions about physical education knowledge to be able to discuss and develop the concept of movement.

J	Petersmann, EU				Petersmann, Ernst-Ulrich			REFORMING MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE OF TRANSNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS THROUGH REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM?-LEGAL METHODOLOGY PROBLEMS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY			English	Article						constitutionalism; cosmopolitanism; international law; legal methodology; multilevel governance; public goods; WHO; WTO	WORLD; EU	Globalization transforms most national into transnational public goods (PGs), which no state can protect unilaterally without international law and multilevel governance institutions. Democratic, republican and cosmopolitan constitutionalism have proven to be the most effective "legal methods" for protecting transnational "aggregate PGs" like open, rules-based markets and public health (I). They require challenging the "chessboard paradigm" of "disconnected UN/WTO governance" by promoting "republican network governance" empowering citizens to invoke and enforce international `PGs treaties" like UN, WHO and WTO agreements protecting equal rights, rule of law, public health and mutually beneficial markets across national frontiers inside domestic legal systems. Even if "global democracy" and "global justice" are likely to remain utopias for a long time, stronger republican and cosmopolitan rights and judicial remedies can empower and motivate citizens as "republican owners" of PGs (res publica) and "democratic principals" of governments to challenge and limit "market failures" and "governance failures" through "countervailing rights" (II). "Connecting" interdependent local, national, regional and global governance of "aggregate PGs" through cosmopolitan rights and "multilevel constitutionalism" can strengthen "republican governance" of PGs, whose effectiveness is empirically confirmed by rights -based commercial, trade, investment, intellectual property, labour, environmental, criminal, health and human rights law promoting accountable "bottom-up governance" of PGs beyond national borders (III-IV).

J	Wichelns, D				Wichelns, Dennis			Volumetric water footprints, applied in a global context, do not provide insight regarding water scarcity or water quality degradation	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Food security; Livelihoods; Health; Sustainability; Efficiency; Equity	SAFE DRINKING-WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DROUGHT-PRONE; POVERTY REDUCTION; HEAVY-METALS; FOOD SECURITY; VIRTUAL WATER; HEALTH-RISK; IRRIGATION; ADAPTATION	Many authors have presented estimates of volumetric water footprints in the context of describing and comparing the water requirements of crop production and industrial activities. In recent years, water footprints have been proposed as indicators for use in assessing the sustainability, efficiency, and equity of water allocations in a global context. That perspective is notably ambitious, given that volumetric water footprints contain information pertaining to just one resource, with no consideration of scarcity values, opportunity costs, or the impacts of water use on the environment, livelihoods, or human health. The suggestion that water scarcity must be assessed from a global perspective also is misplaced. Water scarcity and water quality degradation arise in local and regional settings. The impacts and potential remedies must be evaluated at those levels, by scientists and public officials charged with determining the policies and investments needed to ensure wise use of water resources. Efforts to extend access to clean, safe, and affordable water to the millions of households lacking such access also must be designed and implemented locally. Public officials will not gain useful insight by comparing volumetric water footprints in a global context. Water scarcity and water quality degradation cannot be resolved by reorganizing production activities across river basins and continents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As a retrospective policy analysis, this research analyzes systematically and chronologically the country's illegal drug policies in terms of a Walt and Gilson policy triangle approach. Accordingly, matters of context, key actors, and process are examined with regard to continuities and shifts in policy content. Broadly, the main factors exerting influence on drug policy making are demonstrated to be both national and international in origin. Since 2000, however, a national drug policy posture emphasizing a criminal justice approach and sanctions has won out. As a consequence, Turkish policies have proven inadequate for resolving drug-related problems faced by the state.(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Method A systematic review of relevant literature was conducted, and results were organized and compared in relation to study aims, design, measures used to screen for ID, sample, limitations and key findings. Results Existing international data suggest a prevalence of prisoners with ID between 7 and 10%. Most frequent coexisting health issues among this population are hearing and vision impairments, obesity, diabetes and a range of mental health disorders, notably anxiety and personality and conduct disorders. Conclusion More research is required on prevalence rates and associated comorbidities of ID within prison settings, taking into account the heterogeneity of the population with ID.

A community sample of 140 self-reported undocumented Latino/a immigrants completed questionnaires measuring perceptions of legal status, well-being (global and psychological), perceived context of reception, and experiences of discrimination. Results indicated that individuals who perceived their experiences as different from those of documented Latinos/as due to an unauthorized legal status reported less social equality as evidenced by lower well-being, increased experiences of discrimination, and a more adverse context of reception. Moreover, individuals who perceived their social experiences as different from those of documented Latinos/as due to their legal status reported issues centering on 2 domains: limited opportunity/restricted social mobility and discrimination/unfair treatment. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of advancing theory and from a multicultural counseling perspective.

Methods: Data were obtained from 32 countries around the world that participated in the 2011 health module of the International Social Survey Programme. Ordered logit regression models were used to evaluate whether gender differences remained significant when other social and lifestyle factors were considered. Results: Gender differences in mental well-being in the Nordic countries are not particularly small and the four countries do not cluster together. The gender differences remain when other social and lifestyle factors are taken into account. Conclusions: There appears to be a similar Nordic health paradox for mental well-being outcomes as for physical health outcomes. Although there may be multiple reasons for this, continued gender equality, including sex segregation in the labour market and gendered expectations, are considered to play a part.

Early adolescent childbearing in low- and middle-income countries: associations with income inequity, human development and gender equality	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Adolescent childbearing; human development; development; gender equality; LMIC	HEALTH; RATES; WOMEN	Objective. Reducing unwanted adolescent childbearing is a global priority. Little is known about how national-level economic and human development indicators relate to early adolescent childbearing. This ecological study evaluates associations of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GINI index, Human Development Index (HDI) and Gender-related Development Index (GDI; i.e. the HDI adjusted for gender disparities) with early adolescent childbearing in 27 low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) across three time periods. Methods. Among women ages 18-24, prevalence estimates for early birth (< 16 years) were calculated by nation, and weighted linear regressions evaluated associations between national indicators and early childbearing. To examine temporal trends, analyses were stratified by year groupings. Findings. Early adolescent childbearing declined over time, with the greatest change observed in Bangladesh (31.49% in 1996/7 to 19.69% in 2011). In adjusted models, GDI was negatively associated with early childbearing, i.e. early childbearing prevalence decreased as GDI increased. In the most recent time period, relative to the lowest GDI group, the average prevalence of early childbearing was significantly lower in the middle (-12.40, P< 0.00) and upper (-10.96, P = 0.03) tertiles after adjustment for the other indicators. These other indicators showed no consistent association with early childbearing. Conclusion. As national-level GDI increased, early adolescent childbearing declined. The GDI, which reflects human development adjusted for gender disparities in educational and economic prospects, was more consistently related to early adolescent childbearing than the absolute development prospects as given by the HDI. While creating gender equality is an important goal in and of itself, the findings emphasize the potential for improved national-level gender equitable development as a means to improve adolescents' sexual and reproductive health.

This study analysed the injuries treated in primary care in the Community of Madrid, Spain, by socioeconomic status (SES), sex and age. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of injuries registered in the primary care electronic medical records of the Madrid Health Service in 2012. Incidence stratified by sex, SES and type of injury were calculated. Poisson regression was performed. Results A statistically significant upward trend in global injury incidence was observed with decreasing SES in all age groups. By type of injury, the largest differences were observed in injuries by foreign body in men aged 15-44 and in poisonings in girls under 15 years of age. Burns risk also stood out in the group of girls under 15 years of age with the lowest SES. In the group above 74 years of age, wounds, bruises and sprains had the lowest SES differences in both sexes, and the risk of fractures was lower in the most socioeconomically advantaged group. Conclusion People with lower SES were at a greater risk of injury. The relationship between SES and injury varies by type of injury and age.

Method: The study used baseline and follow-up data from the 2008-2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (N = 17,230; age = 51-101). Linear, multilevel, and logistic models compared individual resources at baseline as independent, cumulative, and binary predictors of outcomes 4 years later. Results: Individual resources were unequally distributed across age group and social structures (education, wealth, race, gender) and had a cumulative effect on all successful aging outcomes. For experienced well-being, individual resources were most important at midlife and for groups with lower education. Person-environment congruence (social cohesion, city satisfaction) was associated with all successful aging outcomes and conditioned the effect of individual resources on experienced well-being. Discussion: A cumulative index allows for gradations in resources that can be compensated for by external factors such as person-environment congruence. This index could guide policy and interventions to enhance resources in vulnerable subgroups and diminish inequalities in successful aging outcomes.

J	Rudra, N; Tirone, DC				Rudra, Nita; Tirone, Daniel C.			Trade, Politics, and the Poor: Is Sen Right and Bhagwati Wrong?	STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Income inequality; Health; Trade; International political economy	INCOME-DISTRIBUTION; WAGE INEQUALITY; GROWTH; DEMOCRACY; EDUCATION; CONFLICT; POVERTY; QUALITY	The current debate between two of the world's finest economists-Amartya Sen and Jagdish Bhagwati-has not only roiled India but also attracted global attention. Is trade liberalization associated with improved welfare outcomes for the poor, as Bhagwati contends? Or is Sen correct that policymakers in liberalizing economies need to change their governance priorities to focus on redistribution? This analysis draws on existing literature to develop testable hypotheses that attempt to resolve the Sen-Bhagwati divide. Using fixed effect panel regressions and simultaneous equation models, we find that although there is empirical support for both arguments, the results on balance favor Sen: The positive relationship between trade and improved poverty is conditional upon more equitable distributions of income. In effect, Bhagwati's predictions about the beneficial impacts of openness on social welfare occur only in a subset of developing nations, findings which have very different implications for the poor in developing countries.

Due to the group size of patients affecting the cost of treatment, they risk being disadvantaged in relation to existing cost-effectiveness thresholds. In an article by Niklas Juth it has been argued that it is irrelevant to take indirectly operative factors like group size into account since such a compensation would risk discounting the use of cost, a relevant factor, altogether. In this article we analyze Juth's argument and observe that we already do compensate for indirectly operative factors, both outside and within cost-effectiveness evaluations, for formal equality reasons. Based on this we argue that we have reason to set cost-effectiveness thresholds to integrate equity concerns also including formal equality considerations. We find no reason not to compensate for group size to the extent we already compensate for other factors. Moreover, groups size implying a systematic disadvantage also on a global scale, i.e. taking different aspects of the health condition of patients suffering from rare diseases into account, will provide strong reason for why group size is indeed relevant to compensate for (if anything).

The impacts of trade liberalization on the social determinants of health (SDH), are by contrast, less well known. Missing is an account of how liberalizing processes identified across different research areas relate to each other and how the association between trade liberalization and health is conceptualized within each of them, especially with reference to SDH. This paper presents a systematic review which provides a more complete picture of the pathways between trade liberalization and health, with special attention to SDH pathways. This picture captures the interrelationships between different areas of investigation, along with current limitations of our understanding and recommendations for future research.

Research indicates that colonialism and its associated processes are important determinants of Indigenous peoples' health internationally. In Canada, despite an abundance of health research documenting inequalities in morbidity and mortality rates for Indigenous peoples, relatively little research has focused on mental health. This paper provides a critical scoping review of the literature related to Indigenous mental health in Canada. We searched eleven databases and two Indigenous health-focused journals for research related to mental health, Indigenous peoples, and Canada, for the years 2006-2016. Over two hundred papers are included in the review and coded according to research theme, population group, and geography. Results demonstrate that the literature is overwhelmingly concerned with issues related to colonialism in mental health services and the prevalence and causes of mental illness among Indigenous peoples in Canada, but with several significant gaps. Mental health research related to Indigenous peoples in Canada overemphasizes suicide and problematic substance use; a more critical use of the concepts of colonialism and historical trauma is advised; and several population groups are underrepresented in research, including Metis peoples and urban or off-reserve Indigenous peoples. The findings are useful in an international context by providing a starting point for discussions, dialogue, and further study regarding mental health research for Indigenous peoples around the world.

Building Responsive Health Systems to Help Communities Affected by Migration: An International Delphi Consensus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						public health; health systems; refugees; other migrants; Delphi consensus		Persons affected by migration require health systems that are responsive and adaptable to the needs of both disadvantaged migrants and non-migrant populations. The objective of this study is to support health systems for populations affected by migration. Materials and Methods: An international Delphi consensus process was used to identify policy approaches to improve health systems for populations affected by migration. Participants were leading migrant health experts from Americas, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and Australasia. We calculated average ranking scores and qualitatively analyzed open-ended questions. Results: Participants identified the following key areas as priorities for policy development: health inequities, system discrimination, migrant related health data, disadvantaged migrant sub-groups, and considerations for disadvantaged non-migrant populations. Highly ranked items to improve health systems were: Health Equity Impact Assessment, evidence based guidelines, and the International Organization for Migration annual reports. Discussion: Policy makers need tools, data and resources to address health systems challenges. Policies need to avoid preventable deaths of migrants and barriers to basic health services.

Identifying inequities in maternal and child health through risk stratification to inform health systems strengthening in Northern Togo	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTERVENTION; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES	Objective In Togo, substantial progress in maternal and child health is needed to reach global development goals. To better inform clinic and community-based health services, this study identifies factors associated with maternal and child health care utilization in the Kara region of Northern Togo. Methods We conducted a population-representative household survey of four health clinic catchment areas of 1,075 women of reproductive age in 2015. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model individual and structural factors associated with utilization of four maternal and child health services. Key outcomes were: facility-based delivery, maternal postnatal health check by a health professional within the first six weeks of birth, childhood vaccination, and receipt of malaria medication for febrile children under age five within 72 hours of symptom onset. Results 83 percent of women who gave birth in the last 2 years delivered at a health facility. In adjusted models, the strongest predictor of facility delivery in the rural catchment areas was proximity to a health center, with women living under three kilometers having 3.7 (95% CI 1.7, 7.9) times the odds of a facility birth. Only 11 percent of women received a health check by a health provider at any time in the postnatal period. Postnatal health checks were less likely for women in the poorest households and for women who resided in rural areas. Children of polygamous mothers had half the odds of receiving malaria medication for fever within 72 hours of symptom onset, while children with increased household wealth status had increased odds of childhood vaccination and receiving treatment for malaria. Conclusion Our analysis highlights the importance of risk stratification analysis to inform the delivery and scope of maternal and child health programs needed to reach those with the least access to care.

J	Friedman, EA; Gostin, LO				Friedman, Eric A.; Gostin, Lawrence O.			From local adaptation to activism and global solidarity: framing a research and innovation agenda towards true health equity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article								The proposal for a global health treaty aimed at health equity, the Framework Convention on Global Health, raises the fundamental question of whether we can achieve true health equity, globally and domestically, and if not, how close we can come. Considerable knowledge currently exists about the measures required to, at the least, greatly improve health equity. Why, then, do immense inequities remain? Building on this basic question, we propose four areas that could help drive the health equity research and innovation agenda over the coming years. First, recognizing that local contexts will often affect the success of policies aimed at health equity, local research will be critical to adapt strategies to particular settings. This part of the research agenda would be well-served by directly engaging intended beneficiaries for their insights, including through participatory action research, where the research contributes to action towards greater health equity. Second, even with the need for more local knowledge, why is the copious knowledge on how to reduce inequities not more frequently acted upon? What are the best strategies to close policymakers' knowledge gaps and to generate the political will to apply existing knowledge about improving health equity, developing the policies and devoting the resources required? Linked to this is the need to continue to build our understanding of how to empower the activism that can reshape power dynamics. Today's unequal power dynamics contribute significantly to disparities in a third area of focus, the social determinants of health, which are the primary drivers of today's health inequities. Continuing to improve our understanding of the pathways through which they operate can help in developing strategies to change these determinants and disrupt harmful pathways. And fourth, we return to the motivating question of whether we can achieve health equity. For example, can all countries have universal health coverage that comprehensively meets all of people's health needs? How to foster the national and global solidarity to achieve such equity? The answers to questions such as these can help point the way to measures, often well outside the narrow realm of technical solutions, to realize the right to health, and to achieve and sustain substantive health equality.

Pregnant women and mothers with minor children comprise a large proportion of this population. The rise in criminal justice oversight and incarceration rates has differentially impacted a highly vulnerable population of women and children. This article outlines an international human rights perspective on the criminal justice involvement of pregnant women and mothers with minor children, and describes common and broadly accepted U.S. criminal justice practices in the areas of pregnancy, birth, and contact with children that differ from a rights-based approach. Using the United Nations-developed Bangkok Rules and existing research as a foundation, the authors conclude by advancing recommendations for more humane approaches to pregnant and parenting women and their children that would bring the United States more closely in line with international standards. This article capitalizes on the increased attention currently being placed on the U.S. criminal justice system to highlight continued problems and provide humane solutions that draw on international approaches while also fitting a U.S. context.

When addressing poverty- associated risk, the educational emphasis need not only be on attaining more individual wealth in society, but could rather be to improve the educational, psychological and social well- being. I draw on four ethnographic studies to construct a bricolage of narratives to show how resilience, health and well- being agendas may lead to positive education outcomes given inequality.

CURRENT OPINION IN FOOD SCIENCE			English	Review							GLOBAL SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; COLD CHAIN; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS; FRAMEWORK; SECURITY; EUROPE; ISSUES	Food safety has governed food policy for decades. More recently, concerns about sustainability of food chains have emerged. Food sustainability is becoming an increasingly important issue because food systems are not sustainable in terms of consumption of resources, their impact on ecosystems or their effect on health and social equality.

J	Rudan, I; Sridhar, D				Rudan, Igor; Sridhar, Devi			Structure, function and five basic needs of the global health research system	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							RESEARCH PRIORITIES; INVESTMENTS	Background Two major initiatives that were set up to support and co-ordinate global health research efforts have been largely discontinued in recent years: the Global Forum for Health Research and World Health Organization's Department for Research Policy and Cooperation. These developments provide an interesting case study into the factors that contribute to the sustainability of initiatives to support and co-ordinate global health research in the 21st century. Methods We reviewed the history of attempts to govern, support or co-ordinate research in global health. Moreover, we studied the changes and shifts in funding flows attributed to global health research. This allowed us to map the structure of the global health research system, as it has evolved under the increased funding contributions of the past decade. Bearing in mind its structure, core functions and dynamic nature, we proposed a framework on how to effectively support the system to increase its efficiency. Results Based on our framework, which charted the structure and function of the global health research system and exposed places and roles for many stakeholders within the system, five basic needs emerged: (i) to co-ordinate funding among donors more effectively; (ii) to prioritize among many research ideas; (iii) to quickly recognize results of successful research; (iv) to ensure broad and rapid dissemination of results and their accessibility; and (v) to evaluate return on investments in health research. Conclusion The global health research system has evolved rapidly and spontaneously. It has not been optimally efficient, but it is possible to identify solutions that could improve this. There are already examples of effective responses for the need of prioritization of research questions (eg, the CHNRI method), quick recognition of important research (eg, systems used by editors of the leading journals) and rapid and broadly accessible publication of the new knowledge (eg, PLoS One journal as an example). It is still necessary to develop tools that could assist donors to co-ordinate funding and ensure more equity between areas in the provided support, and to evaluate the value for money invested in health research.

NTD interventions have the greatest relevance for SDG3, the health goal, where the focus on equity, and its commitment to reaching people in need of health services, wherever they may live and whatever their circumstances, is fundamentally aligned with the target of Universal Health Coverage. NTD interventions, however, also affect and are affected by many of the other development areas covered under the 2030 Agenda. Strategies such as mass drug administration or the programmatic integration of NTD and WASH activities (SDG6) are driven by effective global partnerships (SDG17). Intervention against the NTDs can also have an impact on poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2), can improve education (SDG4), work and economic growth (SDG8), thereby reducing inequalities (SDG10). The community-led distribution of donated medicines to more than 1 billion people reinforces women's empowerment (SDG5), logistics infrastructure (SDG9) and non-discrimination against disability (SDG16). Interventions to curb mosquito-borne NTDs contribute to the goals of urban sustainability (SDG11) and resilience to climate change (SDG13), while the safe use of insecticides supports the goal of sustainable ecosystems (SDG15). Although indirectly, interventions to control waterand animal-related NTDs can facilitate the goals of small-scale fishing (SDG14) and sustainable hydroelectricity and biofuels (SDG7). NTDs proliferate in less developed areas in countries across the income spectrum, areas where large numbers of people have little or no access to adequate health care, clean water, sanitation, housing, education, transport and information. This scoping review assesses how in this context, ending the epidemic of the NTDs can impact and improve our prospects of attaining the SDGs.

There has been limited research on community exposures to TNC policies and practices. Our pilot research used McDonald's Australia to test methods for assessing the health impacts of one TNC within Australia. Methods: We adapted existing Health Impact Assessment methods to assess McDonald's activities. Data identifying potential impacts were sourced through document analysis, including McDonald's corporate literature; media analysis and semi-structured interviews. We commissioned a spatial and socioeconomic analysis of McDonald's restaurants in Australia through Geographic Information System technology. The data was mapped against a corporate health impact assessment framework which included McDonald's Australia's political and business practices; products and marketing; workforce, social, environmental and economic conditions; and consumers' health related behaviours. Results: We identified both positive and detrimental aspects of McDonald's Australian operations across the scope of the CHIA framework. We found that McDonald's outlets were slightly more likely to be located in areas of lower socioeconomic status. McDonald's workplace conditions were found to be more favourable than those in many other countries which reflects compliance with Australian employment regulations. The breadth of findings revealed the need for governments to strengthen regulatory mechanisms that are conducive to health; the opportunity for McDonald's to augment their corporate social responsibility initiatives and bolster reputational endorsement; and civil society actors to inform their advocacy towards health and equity outcomes from TNC operations. Conclusion: Our study indicates that undertaking a corporate health impact assessment is possible, with the different methods revealing sufficient information to realise that strong regulatory frameworks are need to help to avoid or to mediate negative health impacts.

J	Toch-Marquardt, M				Toch-Marquardt, Marlen			Does the pattern of occupational class inequalities in self-reported health depend on the choice of survey? A comparative analysis of four surveys and 35 European countries	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; PART; INDICATORS; RATIOS	Background: Despite increasing overall life expectancy, substantial differences in health between socioeconomic groups persist. Research on inequalities in health often draws on data from different, single surveys. An important question that arises is whether these surveys reflect health and inequalities in the same way. When occupational class is utilized, data are often not analysed for women. The aim of this study therefore is to investigate whether patterns of occupational class inequalities in self-reported health differ across sex and country, between four major European surveys. Methods: Data on self-reported health and occupational class are taken from the European Social Survey (ESS), the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) and the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). Data from 35 countries for men and women aged 25-65 years are analysed. Occupational class is measured according to manual and non-manual workers. Age-standardized prevalence rates, and prevalence ratios (PR) between nonmanual and manual workers and likelihood ratio (LR) tests are estimated to determine occupational class inequalities in self-rated health in Europe. Results: Results show that prevalence rates of less than good health differ noticeably between countries and surveys. Furthermore, occupational class inequalities in health differ between countries. In some countries inequalities are larger for women than for men. This is especially true in Eastern, Central and Baltic European countries. Besides that no regional patterns, consistent over all surveys, in inequalities could be detected. Inequalities differed significantly between surveys. Conclusion: The magnitude of inequalities in all countries depend on the survey used in the analysis. When undertaking a comparative analysis of inequalities in health, or other determinants, these differences have to be taken into account, as results might differ according to the data source used.

J	Wass, V; Southgate, L				Wass, Val; Southgate, Lesley			Doctors Without Borders	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							HEALTH; EDUCATION	The unprecedented demands of patient and population priorities created by globalization and escalating health and social inequities will not be met unless medical education changes. Educators have failed to move fast enough to create an education framework that meets current population needs. A new common set of professional values around global social accountability is necessary. Education borders must be broken down at three levels-societal-institutional, interpersonal, and individual. At a societal-institutional level, global health must be embraced as part of a philosophy of population needs, human rights, equity, and justice. A move from informative acquisition of knowledge and skills to formative learning where students socialize around values, develop leadership attributes, and become agents for change is needed. At an interpersonal level, radical changes in curriculum delivery, which move away from the well-defined borders of specialty rotations, are required. Students must develop an integrated understanding of the future of health care and the patient's journey through health care delivery, within the context of population needs. At an individual level, doctors need to understand the boundaries of the professional values they hold within themselves and develop a deeper understanding of their own internal prejudices and conflicts. Opening the borders between the sciences and humanities is essential. Fostering and mentoring that emphasize that resilience, leadership, flexibility, and the ability to cope with uncertainty are needed to tackle the complexities of current, as well as future, health care. Doctors need to understand the restraints within themselves to work effectively without borders.

A poorer quality diet among individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) may partly explain the higher burden of noncommunicable disease among disadvantaged populations. Because there is a link between sodium intake and noncommunicable diseases, we systematically reviewed the current evidence on the social patterning of sodium intake. Objectives. To conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the evidence on the association between SES and sodium intake in healthy adult populations of high-income countries. Search Methods. We followed the PRISMA-Equity guidelines in conducting a literature search that ended June 3, 2016, via MEDLINE, Embase, and SciELO. We imposed no publication date limits. Selection Criteria. We considered only peer-reviewed articles meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) reported a measure of sodium intake disaggregated by at least 1 measure of SES (education, income, occupation, or any other socioeconomic indicator); (2) were written in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, or Italian; and (3) were conducted in a high-income country as defined by the World Bank (i.e., per capita national gross income was higher than $12 746). We also excluded articles that exclusively sampled low-SES individuals, pregnant women, children, adolescents, elderly participants, or diseased patients or that reported results from a trial or intervention. Data Collection and Analysis. As summary measures, we extracted (1) the direction (positive, negative, or neutral) and the magnitude of the association between each SES indicator and sodium intake, and (2) the estimated sodium intake according to SES level. When possible and if previously unreported, we calculated the magnitude of the relative difference in sodium intake between high-and low-SES groups for each article, applying this formula: ([value for high-SES group -value for low-SES group]/[value for high-SES group]) x 100. We considered an association significant if reported as such, and we set an arbitrary 10% relative difference as clinically relevant and significant. We conducted a meta-analysis of the relative difference in sodium intake between high-and low-SES groups. We included articles in the meta-analysis if they reported urinebased sodium estimates and provided the total participant numbers in the low-and high-SES groups, the estimated sodium intake means for each group (in mg/day or convertible units), and the SDs (or transformable measures). We chose a random-effects model to account for both within-study and between-study variance. Main Results. Fifty-one articles covering 19 high-income countries met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 22 used urine-based methods to assess sodium intake, and 30 used dietary surveys. These articles assessed 171 associations between SES and sodium intake. Among urine-based estimates, 67% were negative (higher sodium intake in people of low SES), 3% positive, and 30% neutral. Among diet-based estimates, 41% were negative, 21% positive, and 38% neutral. The random-effects model indicated a 14% relative difference between low-and high-SES groups (95% confidence interval [CI] = -18, -9), corresponding to a global 503 milligrams per day (95% CI = 461, 545) of higher sodium intake among people of low SES. Conclusions. People of low SES consume more sodium than do people of high SES, confirming the current evidence on socioeconomic disparities in diet, which may influence the disproportionate noncommunicable disease burden among disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. Public Health Implications. It is necessary to focus on disadvantaged populations to achieve an equitable reduction in sodium intake to a population mean of 2 grams per day as part of the World Health Organization's target to achieve a 25% relative reduction in noncommunicable disease mortality by 2025.

J	Zhao, PJ; Li, PL				Zhao, Pengjun; Li, Peilin			Rethinking the relationship between urban development, local health and global sustainability	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review							PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; PUBLIC-HEALTH; AIR-POLLUTION; COMPACT CITY; GREEN SPACE; TRAVEL MODE; FORM; NEIGHBORHOOD; SPRAWL	The environmentally sustainable city has been increasingly attracting the attention of politicians and researchers. In this regard, this paper reviews the existing literature on the relationship between urban development, local health and Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions. Some findings suggest that patterns of urban development could promote urban sustainability in terms of the reduction of GHG emissions, for example, high-density development or compact urban form, which reduces vehicle kilometres travelled and thus reduce GHG emissions. However, it has also been found that these types of urban development might also cause health problems for local residents related to factors such as overcrowding, less green space for outdoor activities, a local heat island effect, high exposure to traffic and air pollution, and psychological stress. This local health paradox related to environmentally sustainable development is also deeply connected to equity issues, including environmental justice, health equity and the related spatial inequities. For future research, the paper proposes a new conceptual framework of the 'glocal environmentally sustainable city', addressing a balance between local health and global environmental sustainability.

The PM2.5 mass concentrations from 1382 national air quality monitoring stations in 367 cities, between January 2014 and December 2016, were analyzed to estimate the health burden attributable to ambient PM2.5 across China. The integrated exposure-response model was applied to estimate the relative risks of disease-specific mortality. Disease-specific mortality baselines in province-level administrative units were adjusted by the national mortality baseline to better reveal the spatial inequality of the health burden associated with PM2.5. Our study suggested that PM2.5 in 2015 contributed as much as 40.3% to total stroke deaths, 33.1% to acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI, <5yr) deaths, 26.8% to ischemic heart disease (IHD) deaths, 23.9% to lung cancer (LC) deaths, 18.7% to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) deaths, 30.2% to total deaths combining IHD, stroke, COPD, and LC, 15.5% to all cause deaths. The population weighted average (PWA) attributable mortality rates (10(-5) y(-1)) were 112.0 in current year analysis, and 124.3 in 10-year time lag analysis. The Mortality attributable to PM2.5 in 10-year time lag analysis (1.7 million) was 12% higher than the current year analysis (1.5 million). Our study also estimated site -specific annual PM2.5 concentrations in scenarios of achieving WHO interim targets (ITs) and AQG. The mortality benefits will be 24.0%, 44.8%, 70.8%, and 85.2% of the total current mortalities (1.5 million) when the PWA PM2.5 concentrations in China meets the WHO IT-1, IT-2, IT-3, and AQG, respectively. We expect air quality modeling and cost-benefits analysis of emission reduction scenarios and corresponding health benefits in meeting the site-specific annual PM2.5 concentrations (WHO IT-1, IT-2, IT-3, and AQG) this study raised.

J	Ngamaba, KH				Ngamaba, Kayonda Hubert			Determinants of subjective well-being in representative samples of nations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; INCOME INEQUALITY; HAPPINESS; COUNTRIES; HEALTH; SATISFACTION	Background: Maximising the happiness and life satisfaction [i. e. subjective well-being (SWB)] of citizens is a fundamental goal of international governmental organizations' policies. In order to decide what policies should be pursued in order to improve SWB there is a need to identify what the key drivers of SWB are. However, to date most studies have been conducted in unrepresentative samples of largely ` developed' nations. Methods: Data from the latest World Value Survey (2010-14) and gathered 85 070 respondents from 59 countries (Age 1-99 years, Mean = 42, SD = 16.54; 52.29% females) were pooled for the analysis. A cross-sectional multilevel random effects model was performed where respondents were nested by country. Results: The average levels of SWB varied across countries and geographical regions. Among the lowest 10 SWB countries are nations from: Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Union and Middle East and North Africa. Factors driving SWB include state of health, financial satisfaction, freedom of choice, GDP per capita, income scale, importance of friends, leisure, being females, weekly religious attendance, unemployment and income inequality. Nevertheless, according to Cohen's rules of thumb, most of these factors have ` small' effect sizes. Thus, the main factors that possibly will improve the SWB of people across the globe are: state of health, household's financial satisfaction and freedom of choice. Conclusions: To maximize the well-being of the population, policy makers may focus on health status, household's financial satisfaction and emancipative values. The levels of prosperity and political stability appear to positively improve the SWB of people.

J	Meheus, F; Mcintyre, D				Meheus, Filip; Mcintyre, Di			Fiscal space for domestic funding of health and other social services	HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article							COVERAGE; CARE; EQUITY	To progress toward universal health coverage and promote inclusive social and economic development, it will be necessary to strengthen domestic resource mobilization for health. In this paper, we examine options for increasing domestic government revenue in low- and middle-income countries. We analyze the relationship between level of economic development and levels of government revenue and expenditure, and show that a country's level of economic development does not predetermine its spending levels. Government revenue can be increased through improved tax compliance and efficiency in revenue collection, maximizing revenue from mineral and other natural resources, and increasing tax rates where appropriate. The emphasis should be on increasing revenue through the most progressive means possible; the purpose of raising government spending on health would be defeated if that spending were funded by increasing the relative tax burden of those who are meant to benefit. Increasing government revenue through taxation or other sources is first and foremost a fiscal policy choice or political decision and should be supported through concerted global action.

J	Mccoy, D; Chigudu, S; Tillmann, T				Mccoy, David; Chigudu, Simukai; Tillmann, Taavi			Framing the tax and health nexus: a neglected aspect of public health concern	HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article								Previous studies have described various associations between tax policy and health. Here we propose a unifying conceptual framework of Five R's' to stimulate awareness about the importance of tax to health improvement. First, tax can improve representation and democratic accountability, and help make governments more responsive to the needs of its citizens. Second, tax can create a revenue stream for a universal pool of public finance for health care and other public services. Third, progressive taxation when combined with appropriate public spending can help redistribute wealth and income and mitigate social and health inequalities. Fourth, the re-pricing of harmful products (e.g. tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy food) can help reduce their consumption. Fifth, taxation provides a route by which certain harmful industries can be regulated. The paper also discusses the barriers that hinder the full potential for taxation to be used to improve health, including: weak tax administrations, large shadow economies', international trade liberalisation, tax avoidance, transfer pricing by transnational corporations and banking secrecy. We suggest that a greater awareness of the manifold associations between tax and health will encourage health practitioners to actively promote fairer and better taxation, thereby helping to improve health and reduce health inequalities.

Almost one in seven people on the planet are expected to reside in urban informal settlements, or slums, by 2030. Slum upgrading is the process of delivering place-based environmental and social improvements to the urban poor, including land tenure, housing, infrastructure, employment, health services and political and social inclusion. The processes and products of slum upgrading can address multiple environmental determinants of health. This paper reviewed urban slum upgrading evaluations from cities across Asia, Africa and Latin America and found that few captured the multiple health benefits of upgrading. With the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on improving well-being for billions of city-dwellers, slum upgrading should be viewed as a key strategy to promote health, equitable development and reduce climate change vulnerabilities. We conclude with suggestions for how slum upgrading might more explicitly capture its health benefits, such as through the use of health impact assessment (HIA) and adopting an urban health in all policies (HiAP) framework. Urban slum upgrading must be more explicitly designed, implemented and evaluated to capture its multiple global environmental health benefits.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Political Power; Structure; Agency; Global Health Governance		Ilona Kickbusch's thought provoking editorial is criticized in this commentary, partly because she fails to refer to previous critical work on the global conditions and policies that sustain inequality, poverty, poor health and damage to the biosphere and, as a result, she misreads global power and elides consideration of the fundamental historical structures of political and material power that shape agency in global health governance. We also doubt that global health can be improved through structures and processes of multilateralism that are premised on the continued reproduction of the ecologically myopic and socially unsustainable market civilization model of capitalist development that currently prevails in the world economy. This model drives net financial flows from poor to rich countries and from the poor to the affluent and super wealthy individuals. By contrast, we suggest that significant progress in global health requires a profound and socially just restructuring of global power, greater global solidarity and the "development of sustainability."

This study aimed to present these models in historical perspective and provide main component of SDH models as an SES indicators. Methods: This was a narrative study using international databases to retrieve literature dealing with conceptual models of SDH. All publication in English language until Mar 2015 was included. The CASP and PRISMA were used to summarize the literature. Results: Overall, 248 publications were retrieved and screened. After exclusion of irrelevant and duplicates, 94 citations were found to be relevant and 21 publications included in this review. In general, 21 models of SDH were found: some models presented before year 1995(n= 4), some models presented between 1995 and 2005 (n= 13) and some models presented after 2005 (n= 4). However, we found three categories of indicators that contribute to SDH models and that were classic factors, fixed and demographic factors and proxy factors. Conclusion: Reduction of socioeconomic inequalities in health requires understanding of mechanisms and causal pathways; therefore, every country needs to design the specific model. As the available models are for developed countries, lack of a specific model for developing ones is tangible. As there is no gold standard related to SES indicators, therefore, it is proposed to use the various indicators based on life course approach, which leads to understanding and adopting effective policy interventions.

Prevalence of Thinness in Adolescent Girls in Low- and Middle-Income Countries and Associations With Wealth, Food Security, and Inequality	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH			English	Article						Adolescent; Nutrition; Thinness; Food security; Female; Global	SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; RISK-FACTORS; OVERWEIGHT; OBESITY; UNDERNUTRITION; UNDERWEIGHT; INTERVENTIONS; MORTALITY; GROWTH	Purpose: Adequate nutrition during adolescence is important for optimal physical and cognitive development and for pregnancy either during adolescence or later life. Thinness among adolescent girls in low- and middle-income countries has been little studied. Methods: We used body mass index data from40 countries from the Global School Health Survey to estimate the prevalence of moderate and severe thinness in 12-to 18-year-olds using the World Health Organization 2007 growth reference. Self-report data on going to bed hungry were used as a proxy for household food insecurity. We used multilevel models to assess whether national wealth (gross domestic product), income inequality (Gini index), national gender inequality (Gender Inequality Index), and food security (Global Food Security Index) were associated with undernutrition. Results: Prevalence rates of moderate and severe thinness across 61,603 girls from 40 countries were 6.30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.71-6.95) and 1.34% (1.12-1.59), respectively, with higher rates in Asia. Combined moderate/severe thinness was more common among early (12-14 years) than later adolescents (15-18 years). Going to bed hungry sometimes was associated with increased risk of moderate/severe thinness (odds ratio [OR]: 1.102; 95% CI: 1.007-1.206). A significant inverse relationship was found between thinness and gross domestic product (OR: .94; 95% CI:.88-.99) and Global Food Security Index (OR: .96; 95% CI:.93-.99) but not Gini or Gender Inequality Index. Conclusion: Thinness remains prevalent in adolescent schoolgirls in low- and middle-income countries and poses a significant threat to their health and that of the next generation. Further research is needed to assess potential interventions for this group. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

J	Li, JJ; Li, BY; Zhang, FF; Sun, Y				Li, Jingjing; Li, Boyang; Zhang, Fengfan; Sun, Yang			Urban and rural stroke mortality rates in China between 1988 and 2013: An age-period-cohort analysis	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						China; mortality; stroke; age-period-cohort analysis; intrinsic estimator; rural; urban	AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; GLOBAL VARIATION; HEALTH; CHALLENGES; DISPARITY; BURDEN; TRENDS; RISK	Objective To evaluate effects attributable to age, time period and birth cohort, on stroke mortality data from urban and rural regions in China between 1988 and 2013. Methods Mortality data were obtained from the Chinese Health Statistics Annual Report (1987-2001) and Chinese Health Statistics Yearbooks (2003-2014). Population data were obtained from population censuses (i.e. 1982, 1990, 2000 and 2010). Data were analysed using an age-period-cohort (APC) model and intrinsic estimation (IE) method. Results The age effect suggested that all older residents had higher stroke mortality risk than younger residents. Period effect showed that compared with figures for 1988, stroke mortality in 2013 was 1.8 times higher for urban regions and 2.4 times higher for rural regions. After controlling for age and period effects, cohorts born before the Chinese economic reform had a steady decline in stroke mortality. However, mortality rates increased and fluctuated in post-reform cohorts. Conclusions This APC-IE analysis identified a modest period effect with large age and cohort contributions to both the overall mortality and the disparity between urban and rural stroke mortality. Identifying early life and cumulative risk factors for stroke, improving equality in stroke prevention and care are needed to reduce the stroke mortality in China.

Exploring the high-resolution mapping of gender-disaggregated development indicators	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						geo-statistics; development indicators; mapping; geographic information system	PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; CHILD MALNUTRITION; POVERTY; MALARIA; AFRICA; RISK	Improved understanding of geographical variation and inequity in health status, wealth and access to resources within countries is increasingly being recognized as central to meeting development goals. Development and health indicators assessed at national or subnational scale can often conceal important inequities, with the rural poor often least well represented. The ability to target limited resources is fundamental, especially in an international context where funding for health and development comes under pressure. This has recently prompted the exploration of the potential of spatial interpolation methods based on geolocated clusters from national household survey data for the high-resolution mapping of features such as population age structures, vaccination coverage and access to sanitation. It remains unclear, however, howpredictable these different factors are across different settings, variables and between demographic groups. Here we test the accuracy of spatial interpolation methods in producing gender-disaggregated high-resolution maps of the rates of literacy, stunting and the use of modern contraceptive methods from a combination of geolocated demographic and health surveys cluster data and geospatial covariates. Bayesian geostatistical and machine learning modelling methods were tested across four low-income countries and varying gridded environmental and socio-economic covariate datasets to build 1 x 1 kmspatial resolution maps with uncertainty estimates. Results show the potential of the approach in producing high-resolution maps of key gender-disaggregated socio-economic indicators, with explained variance through cross-validation being as high as 74-75% for female literacy in Nigeria and Kenya, and in the 50-70% range for many other variables. However, substantial variations by both country and variable were seen, with many variables showing poormapping accuracies in the range of 2-30% explained variance using both geostatistical and machine learning approaches. The analyses offer a robust basis for the construction of timely maps with levels of detail that support geographically stratified decision-making and themonitoring of progress towards development goals. However, the great variability in results between countries and variables highlights the challenges in applying these interpolation methods universally across multiple countries, and the importance of validation and quantifying uncertainty if this is undertaken.

Family structure and childhood mental disorders: new findings from Australia	SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Family structure; Parental separation; Childhood; Mental disorders; Australia	DIAGNOSTIC-INTERVIEW-SCHEDULE; YOUNG-PEOPLE; DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; MARITAL DISRUPTION; HEADSPACE CENTERS; PARENTAL DIVORCE; SINGLE-PARENT; RISK-FACTORS; HEALTH; CHILDREN	Many children now live in non-traditional families-including one-parent, blended, and step families. While a substantial body of international evidence indicates that these children display poorer cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes than children living in traditional families, research on childhood mental disorders is scarce. This report provides new evidence of the relationships between family structure and childhood mental disorders in an under-researched context, Australia. We use recent, nationally representative data on children aged 4-17 from Young Minds Matter, the second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Well-being (N = 6310). Mental disorders were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version IV and included social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorder. Compared to children living in original families, children in one-parent, blended, and step families experienced a higher prevalence of mental disorders. Amongst children whose parents separated, the time since separation was not statistically significantly related to the prevalence of mental disorders. Although we are unable to assess causality, our findings highlight the strength of the association between family structure and child and adolescent mental health. They also stress the need for programs to support children, parents, and families in non-traditional family types to reduce mental health inequalities in childhood and later life.

To highlight the existence and the extent of food insecurity and food waste, the Orange County Health Department in Orange County, California, created a coalition called "Waste Not Orange County." Orange County is the sixth most populous county in California and has the highest median income, yet 11.4% of those residing in Orange County are food insecure, and 24.0% live in poverty. The overall vision of the coalition is to mitigate hunger in Orange County by educating the community about food donations, identifying food-insecure individuals, and connecting those individuals to sources of food. We examine the coalition's impacts between 2014 and 2016.

J	Middleton, J				Middleton, John			Public health in England in 2016-the health of the public and the public health system: a review	BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN			English	Review								Background: This article describes the current state of the health of the public in England and the state of the public health professional service and systems. Sources of data: Data sources are wide ranging including the Global Burden of Disease, the Commonwealth Fund and Public Health England reports. Areas of agreement: There is a high burden of preventable disease and unacceptable inequalities in England. There is considerable expectation that there are gains to be made in preventing ill health and disability and so relieving demand on healthcare. Areas of controversy: Despite agreement on the need for prevention, the Government has cut public health budgets by a cumulative 10% to 2020. Public health professionals broadly supportive of remaining in the EU face an uphill battle to retain health, workplace and environmental protections following the ` Leave' vote. Growing points and areas timely for developing research: There is revitalized interest in air pollution. Extreme weather events are testing response and organizational skills of public health professionals and indicating the need for greater advocacy around climate change, biodiversity and protection of ecological systems. Planetary health and ecological public health are ideas whose time has certainly come.

This review describes the evolution of the diabetes epidemic in Indigenous populations and associated risk factors, highlighting gestational diabetes and intergenerational risk, lifestyle risk factors and social determinants as having particular importance and impact on Indigenous peoples. This review further describes the impact of chronic disease and diabetes on Indigenous peoples and communities, specifically diabetes-related comorbidities and complications. This review provides continued evidence that dramatic changes are necessary to reduce diabetes-related inequities in Indigenous populations, with a call to action to support programmatic primary healthcare transformation capable of empowering Indigenous peoples and communities and improving chronic disease prevention and management. Promising strategies for transforming health services and care for Indigenous peoples include quality improvement initiatives, facilitating diabetes and chronic disease registry and surveillance systems to identify care gaps, and prioritizing evaluation to build the evidence-base necessary to guide future health policy and planning locally and on a global scale.

Zika virus infection in Brazil and human rights obligations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Children's rights; Congenital Zika virus syndrome; Disability rights; Human rights; Public health; Women's rights; Zika infection	HEALTH EQUITY; AMERICA	The February 2016 WHO declaration that congenital Zika virus syndrome constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern reacted to the outbreak of the syndrome in Brazil. Public health emergencies can justify a spectrum of human rights responses, but in Brazil, the emergency exposed prevailing inequities in the national healthcare system. The government's urging to contain the syndrome, which is associated with microcephaly among newborns, is confounded by lack of reproductive health services. Women with low incomes in particular have little access to such health services. The emergency also illuminates the harm of restrictive abortion legislation, and the potential violation of human rights regarding women's health and under the UN Conventions on the Rights of the Child and on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Suggestions have been proposed by which the government can remedy the widespread healthcare inequities among the national population that are instructive for other countries where congenital Zika virus syndrome is prevalent.

Accounting for population exposure to vehicle-generated pollutants and environmental equity in the toll design problem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Bilevel optimization; environmental equity; network design problems; pollution exposure; road pricing; surrogate-based solution algorithm; toll design problem	SIMULATION-BASED OPTIMIZATION; SURROGATE-BASED OPTIMIZATION; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; AIR-POLLUTION; ROAD NETWORKS; CONGESTION; EMISSIONS; HEALTH; MULTICLASS; ALGORITHMS	The emissions generated by motor vehicles remain a major source of air pollutants that affect public health and contribute to anthropogenic climate change. These negative externalities can be reduced, in part, with the implementation of environmentally oriented road pricing schemes, which can be designed using optimization-based approaches. In this paper, a toll design problem is proposed for determining toll locations and levels that minimize the expected human exposure to air pollutants and the related environmental inequalities, subject to constraints on pollutant concentration levels and implementation costs. The practical use of the proposed problem is hindered in most real-world applications by the computational costs associated with the evaluation of candidate solutions, as is common for network design problems. Furthermore, the problem cannot be expressed analytically given the multiple types of models (e.g., traffic assignment, emissions, air dispersion models) that would be required to evaluate a single design alternative. For these reasons, a derivative-free surrogate-based solution algorithm is proposed for mixed integer problems like the ones considered here. Numerical examples are used to illustrate possible applications of the proposed model and to test the performance of the surrogate-based algorithm. Relative to a joint simulated annealing-genetic algorithm heuristic and a genetic algorithm-based approach, the proposed algorithm found better solutions in fewer function evaluations.

Deprivation, occupational hazards and perinatal outcomes in pregnant workers	OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD			English	Article						EPICES score; individual social deprivation; occupational hazards; pregnancy at work; pre-term birth	WORKING-CONDITIONS; BIRTH; RISK; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Background Recent global economic difficulties have widened social inequalities, but their impact on pregnant workers is not known. Aims To investigate the association between deprivation, exposure to occupational hazards and adverse perinatal outcomes in pregnant workers. Methods A cross-sectional study performed in 2014 in French occupational health services. Eligible workers were women who had worked during their pregnancy and had a medical visit by occupational health physicians (OHPs) after delivery and at the time of returning to work. Deprivation was measured using the EPICES scale (Evaluation of Precariousness and Inequalities in Health Examination Centres). Information on birth outcomes was self-reported. Occupational risks for pregnancy were assessed by OHPs. Jobs were coded by the occupational health team using standardized French nomenclature. The groups (deprivation/no deprivation) were compared using univariate (chi-squared test) and multivariate Poisson regression analyses. Results Of 1402 pregnant workers, 293 (21%) were classed as deprived. This group more frequently encountered occupational hazards, particularly for physical exposures (P < 0.001), and had a higher risk of cumulated occupational hazards of three or more for pregnancy [adjusted relative risk (RRa) = 4.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-7.9]. Our findings suggest that deprivation and exposure to three or more occupational hazards during pregnancy cumulatively increased the risk of pre-term birth (RRa = 3.9; 95% CI 1.2-12.4). Conclusions Our data suggest that deprived pregnant workers are an occupationally vulnerable group.

J	Paylor, A				Paylor, Adrian			The social-economic impact of shale gas extraction: a global perspective	THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY			English	Review						Commodities; energy; Global South; poverty and inequality; environmental policy	WATER	This article explores the global social-economic impact of shale gas extraction, comparing the differing social and economic impacts shale gas extraction may have on communities in developed and developing countries. It argues that the benefits of fracking are more likely to be enjoyed by communities in highly and very highly developed countries rather than by those in countries with low or medium levels of development . Additionally, it shows that the potential risks and drawbacks of shale gas and its extraction are more likely to be experienced by communities in these latter countries than by those in highly or very highly developed countries. However, it also demonstrates that even communities in developed countries are vulnerable to environmental and health risks associated with shale gas extraction.

A Protocol to Develop Practice Guidelines for Primary Care Medical Service Trips	ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						medical missions; humanitarian health; medical service trips; Latin America; global health; international health		B A C K G R O U N D North American clinicians are increasingly participating in medical service trips (MSTs) that provide primary healthcare in Latin America and the Caribbean. Literature reviews have shown that the existence and use of evidence-based guidelines by these groups are limited, which presents potential for harm. O B J E C T I V E This paper proposes a 5-step methodology to develop protocols for diagnosis and treatment of conditions encountered by MST clinicians. M E T H O D S We reviewed the 2010 American College of Physicians guidance statement on guidelines development and developed our own adaptation. Ancestry search of the American College of Physicians statement identified specific publications that provided additional detail on key steps in the guideline development process, with additional focus given to evidence, equity, and local adaptation considerations. F I N D I N G S Our adaptation produced a 5-step process for developing locally optimized protocols for diagnosis and treatment of common conditions seen in MSTs. For specified conditions, this process includes: 1) a focused environmental scan of current practices based on grey literature protocols from MST sending organizations; 2) a review of relevant practice guidelines; 3) a literature review assessing the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the specified condition; 4) an eDelphi process with experts representing MST and Latin American and the Caribbean partner organizations assessing identified guidelines; and 5) external peer review and summary. C O N C L U S I O N S This protocol will enable the creation of practice guidelines that are based on best available evidence, local knowledge, and equitable considerations. The development of guidelines using this process could optimize the conduct of MSTs, while prioritizing input from local community partners.

To expand coverage, or increase frequency: Quantifying the tradeoffs between equity and efficiency facing cervical cancer screening programs in low-resource settings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						human papillomavirus; Uganda; cervical cancer; cancer screening; HPV; DNA test; economic evaluation; health disparities	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS INFECTION; NATURAL-HISTORY MODEL; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; VISUAL INSPECTION; ACETIC-ACID; SUSTAINED EFFICACY; SELF-COLLECTION; WOMEN; HIV; RISK	Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with 85% of the disease burden residing in less developed regions. To inform evidence-based decision-making as cervical cancer screening programs are planned, implemented, and scaled in low-and middle-income countries, we used cost and test performance data from the START-UP demonstration project in Uganda and a microsimulation model of HPV infection and cervical carcinogenesis to quantify the health benefits, distributional equity, cost-effectiveness, and financial impact of either (1) improving access to cervical cancer screening or (2) increasing the number of lifetime screening opportunities for women who already have access. We found that when baseline screening coverage was low (i. e., 30%), expanding coverage of screening once in a lifetime to 50% can yield comparable reductions in cancer risk to screening two or three times in a lifetime at 30% coverage, lead to greater reductions in health disparities, and cost 150 international dollars (I$) per year of life saved (YLS). At higher baseline screening coverage levels (i. e., 70%), screening three times in a lifetime yielded greater health benefits than expanding screening once in a lifetime to 90% coverage, and would have a cost-effectiveness ratio (I$ 590 per YLS) below Uganda's per capita GDP. Given very low baseline coverage at present, we conclude that a policy focus on increasing access for previously unscreened women appears to be more compatible with improving both equity and efficiency than a focus on increasing frequency for a small subset of women.

In particular, we explore the role of formal and informal relationships in meeting the demands of daily existence and how and when public social welfare programs assist pavement dwellers. Over fifteen months, beginning in 2013, participant observation was conducted, and approximately 200 individuals (homeless persons, government officials, and NGO representatives) were interviewed in Hindi or English. Triangulated data including documents, interviews, and fieldnotes were subjected to thematic analyses. Results produced five themes: persistent illegality, dependence on charitable others, personhood and worthiness, migration and social isolation, and precarious relationships and distrust. Based on the research findings, we make recommendations for legal inclusion, decriminalization, access to health care, and income support for parents with dependent children. Broader concerns about global homelessness are also discussed in the context of growing income inequality.

In this study, we assess whether the importance of dense settlement for infant mortality and child height is moderated by exposure to local sanitation behavior. Is open defecation (i.e., without a toilet or latrine) worse for infant mortality and child height where population density is greater? Is poor sanitation is an important mechanism by which population density influences child health outcomes? We present two complementary analyses using newly assembled data sets, which represent two points in a trade-off between external and internal validity. First, we concentrate on external validity by studying infant mortality and child height in a large, international child-level data set of 172 Demographic and Health Surveys, matched to census population density data for 1,800 subnational regions. Second, we concentrate on internal validity by studying child height in Bangladeshi districts, using a new data set constructed with GIS techniques that allows us to control for fixed effects at a high level of geographic resolution. We find a statistically robust and quantitatively comparable interaction between sanitation and population density with both approaches: open defecation externalities are more important for child health outcomes where people live more closely together.

Complementing the micro-level data from the survey with country-level variables, namely GDP per capita and gender inequality (measured by the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index, GGGI), we estimate a multilevel regression model to shed light on the contextual factors of the life satisfaction of women in Europe. We find that working women's well-being relative to housewives is greater in countries where the GGGI indicates a smaller gender gap, i.e. where women are in a better position in terms of equality with men in the public domains. We interpret this finding to mean that the so-called 'paradox of declining female happiness' is in part due to persistent gender roles which appear to have a larger impact on the well-being of working women.

J	Peric, N; Hofmarcher-Holzhacker, MM; Simon, J				Peric, Natasa; Hofmarcher-Holzhacker, Maria M.; Simon, Judit			Health system performance assessment landscape at the EU level: a structured synthesis of actors and actions	ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health system performance assessment; Health information; Policy making; International comparisons; European Union; Public health indicators	FRAMEWORK	Background: Many policy makers and other stakeholders in the EU have expressed interest in better understanding the performance of their own health systems to identify opportunities for improvement in effectiveness, efficiency and equity. Health system performance assessment (HSPA) has received considerable attention at EU level as an instrument to improve transparency and accountability. This is equally important for population health and sustainable health spending. The goal of this paper is to synthesise and map the current state and developments in the field of HSPA relevant in the EU context and by this aid the navigation in the growing HSPA system, understand the available tools and identify opportunities for improvement. Methods: Structured synthesis of the literature on initiatives in the field of HSPA at EU level was carried out. Key literature was identified by a focused review performed between October 2015 and June 2016 on websites of key institutions including the EU, OECD and WHO and Google engine. We used six predefined criteria for identifying key literature. Identified initiatives were classified according to analytical and conceptual output or whether a guiding or advisory role was resumed. A visual map of the relationships between the different actions and actors involved in HSPA was developed. In addition, expert opinion was sought to refine the map. Results: We identified a total of 64 relevant initiatives and their relationships in the field of HSPA. These include institutions such as the European Commission (73%), European Council (8%), OECD (9%) and WHO-EUR (9%). 24 initiatives produced analytical outputs, four developed conceptual outputs and six had a guiding role. The role of the EU in HSPA and collaboration with other key actors have intensified considerably since the adoption of the EU Health Strategy in 2013. The EU HSPA landscape is complex with seemingly few streamlining activities. Conclusions: Knowledge transfer and exchange of expertise are key to HSPA. While cooperation between the key actors have intensified recently and clearly reflect the "Health in all Policies" (HIAP) approach, there is considerable room for improved streamlining activities to share knowledge and avoid overlapping efforts, especially within the European Commission.

Justice and US Occupational Therapy Practice: A Relationship 100 Years in the Making	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY			English	Article								At 99 years old, occupational therapy is a global health care profession with a growing orientation' toward justice. Because Much of the occupational justice discourse has developed outside the United States, parallels between the profession's ethos and its current focus on justice must be examined more closely in this country. Although occupational therapy practitioners in the United States are better equipped than their predecessors with language and theories that explicitly emphasize justice, the potential for bringing that focus to bear depends on practitioners' willingness to think differently about their practices. We argue that a focus on justice can be naturally integrated with curriculum standards by emphasizing the link between cultural humility, client-centeredness, and embodied habits of "seeking out unknown others." Outside formal education, practitioners can be encouraged to think of justice as something that already intersects with practice, not something that practitioners must choose whether to take up.

J	Nulu, S				Nulu, Shanti			Neglected chronic disease: The WHO framework on non-communicable diseases and implications for the global poor	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Noncommunicable disease; sub-Saharan Africa; anthropology; health systems	INDOOR AIR-POLLUTION; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; HEART-FAILURE; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION; HEALTH SYSTEMS; DIABETES CARE; RISK-FACTORS; LOW-INCOME; HYPERTENSION	The current global framework on noncommunicable disease (NCD), as exemplified by the WHO Action Plan of 2012, neglects the needs of the global poor. The current framework is rooted in an outdated pseudo-evolutionary theory of epidemiologic transition, which weds NCDs to modernity, and relies on global aggregate data. It is oriented around a simplistic causal model of behaviour, risk and disease, which implicitly locates 'risk' within individuals, conveniently drawing attention away from important global drivers of the NCD epidemic. In fact, the epidemiologic realities of the bottom billion reveal a burden of neglected chronic diseases that are associated with 'alternative' environmental and infectious risks that are largely structurally determined. In addition, the vertical orientation of the framework fails to centralise health systems and delivery issues that are essential to chronic disease prevention and treatment. A new framework oriented around a global health equity perspective would be able to correct some of the failures of the current model by bringing the needs of the global poor to the forefront, and centralising health systems and delivery. In addition, core social science concepts such as Bordieu's habitus may be useful to re-conceptualising strategies that may address both behavioural and structural determinants of health.

The prevalence of Depo-Provera in Nicaragua is high and increasing compared to other Central American countries. Drawing on data from structured interviews with 87 women and from focus groups with 32 women, we show how women's preference for Depo is shaped by both gendered inequalities and socioeconomic constraints. We employ basic statistical tests to analyse correlations between women's marital status and socioeconomic status (SES) with contraceptive use. Our statistical findings show significant associations between use of Depo and both marital status and SES, such that women who are married or in conjugal unions and women with lower SES are more likely to use Depo. To help explain women's use of Depo-Provera in Nicaragua, we situate our findings within the context of gender, culture, and power, reviewing the contested history of Depo-Provera in the developing world and dynamics of gender inequality, which constrain women's contraceptive choices. We conclude with suggestions for reproductive health programming in Nicaragua and beyond, arguing that gender equity and addressing socioeconomic barriers to family planning remain priorities for the achievement of global reproductive health.

J	Abara, WE; Garba, I				Abara, Winston E.; Garba, Ibrahim			HIV epidemic and human rights among men who have sex with men in sub-Saharan Africa: Implications for HIV prevention, care, and surveillance	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						HIV/AIDS; men who have sex with men; human rights; sub-Saharan Africa; stigma; discrimination	CAPE-TOWN; INFECTION; RISK; HIV/AIDS; PREVALENCE; COMMUNITY; VULNERABILITY; CHALLENGES; ACCESS; STIGMA	Recent research has presented evidence that men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate burden of HIV and are at increased risk for HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, many countries in SSA have failed to address the needs of MSM in national HIV/AIDS programmes. Furthermore, many MSM face structural barriers to HIV prevention and care, the most significant of which include laws that criminalise male-to-male sexual contact and facilitate stigma and discrimination. This in turn increases the vulnerability of MSM to acquiring HIV and presents barriers to HIV prevention, care, and surveillance. This relationship illustrates the link between human rights, social justice, and health outcomes and presents considerable challenges to addressing the HIV epidemic among MSM in SSA. The response to the HIV epidemic in SSA requires a non-discriminatory human rights approach to all at-risk groups, including MSM. Existing international human rights treaties, to which many SSA countries are signatories, and a 'health in all policies' approach provides a strong basis to reduce structural barriers to HIV prevention, care, surveillance, and research, and to ensure that all populations in SSA, including MSM, have access to the full range of rights that help ensure equal opportunities for health and wellness.

SettingCommunity-dwelling population in Copenhagen, Denmark. ParticipantsMen and women born in 1914 (N = 302). MeasurementsCognitive ability was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale at age 50 or 60. A global cognitive ability measure was used as a continuous measure and according to tertile. Information on education was gathered using a questionnaire at age 50 or 60. A clinical oral examination took place at age 70, and oral health was measured according to number of teeth (<6 vs 6). Baseline covariates were smoking, alcohol, sex, and income. ResultsLogistic regression analyses revealed that greater cognitive ability and educational attainment had a protective effect against risk of tooth loss. The associations were significant and persisted after adjusting for confounders and a two-way interaction between cognitive ability and education. ConclusionHigher education level and cognitive ability measured at age 50 or 60 were associated with having more teeth at age 70. Whether these findings are due to the interaction of these factors with oral health, related socioeconomic factors, or other factors remains to be studied.

Enhancing Political Will for Universal Health Coverage in Nigeria	MEDICC REVIEW			English	Article							MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; INSURANCE SCHEME; SYSTEMS; CONSTRAINTS; EQUITY	Universal health coverage aims to increase equity in access to quality health care services and to reduce financial risk due to health care costs. It is a key component of international health agenda and has been a subject of worldwide debate. Despite differing views on its scope and pathways to reach it, there is a global consensus that all countries should work toward universal health coverage. The goal remains distant for many African countries, including Nigeria. This is mostly due to lack of political will and commitment among political actors and policymakers. Evidence from countries such as Ghana, Chile, Mexico, China, Thailand, Turkey, Rwanda, Vietnam and Indonesia, which have introduced at least some form of universal health coverage scheme, shows that political will and commitment are key to the adoption of new laws and regulations for reforming coverage. For Nigeria to improve people's health, reduce poverty and achieve prosperity, universal health coverage must be vigorously pursued at all levels. Political will and commitment to these goals must be expressed in legal mandates and be translated into policies that ensure increased public health care financing for the benefit of all Nigerians. Nigeria, as part of a global system, cannot afford to lag behind in striving for this overarching health goal.

J	van Dijk, A; Crofts, N				van Dijk, Auke; Crofts, Nick			Law enforcement and public health as an emerging field	POLICING & SOCIETY			English	Article						Law enforcement and public health; public health	MENTAL-HEALTH; PARTNERSHIPS; SYSTEMS; POLICE; CARE	Law enforcement (especially policing) and public health share much common ground; insecurity and lack of safety, traditionally provinces of law enforcement, are iniquitous to health and to attempts to improve public health. Considering the maturity of both fields and the growing complexities of their challenges, it is urgent to more consciously join forces'. Public health has a strong culture of seeing the individual within their community, as active participants using social capital to build healthy communities. This is matched by the rise of community policing', with many of the same influences and approaches. More recently, vulnerability and holistic models of community safety and well-being are central to strategy in both law enforcement and public health. Public health is broad, with a huge variety of stakeholders: lists of disciplines engaged in the public health mission are long - but law enforcement officials appear rarely if ever. There is a lack of reciprocal awareness in each sector of the importance of the other in achieving its mission; we wish to raise awareness among both sectors of the importance of the collaboration in addressing the widest range of complex social issues. We argue for closer and better relationships based on mutual understanding of the inextricable entanglement of health and criminal justice perspectives in many complex social issues, and mutual respect for each other's role in addressing them. We have begun exploration of this intersectional area through establishment of an international conference series and a global network of research institutions working in the field.

OBJECTIVES This article describes the course's innovative approach to critically examine how social justice is framed in mixed/divided cities from different professional perspectives (social work, health, law). Participatory methods such as photo-voice, experiential learning, and theatre of the oppressed provide students with a shared language and multiple media to express and problematize their own and others' understanding of social (in) justice and to imagine social change. FINDINGS Much learning about "self" takes place in an immersion experience with "others." Crucial conversations about "the other" and social justice can occur more easily within the intercultural context. In these conversations, students and faculty experience culture as diverse, complex, and personal. CONCLUSIONS Students and faculty alike found the course personally and professionally transformative. Examination of social justice in Haifa and Baltimore strengthened our appreciation for the importance of context and the value of global learning to provide insights on local challenges and opportunities.

J	Adams, LV; Sosin, AN				Adams, Lisa V.; Sosin, Anne N.			Beyond Visas and Vaccines: Preparing Students for Domestic and Global Health Engagement	ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						domestic health; global health; predeparture; training; health equity; international health; orientation; partnership	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; MEDICAL ELECTIVES; SERVICE; PERSPECTIVES; GUIDELINES	At campuses across the United States, scores of students are embarking on global health experiences in low-and middle-income countries. The desire to improve the health of poor communities while preparing for future health careers is often the main driver. The spotlight on domestic health issues also has fueled a resurgence of interest in underserved communities in the United States. Regardless of the destination, rigorous preparation is needed to ensure that the students' presence benefits the communities they aim to serve. Development of mutually beneficial programs with host communities coupled with thoughtful preparation of students is essential to the future of these university programs but, more importantly, to achieve the goal of shared learning and capacity building across borders. US program leaders may not fully consider the potential risks that can occur to their programs from involving poorly prepared students, or these risks may appear largely theoretical. However, many experienced practitioners and their international collaborators can relate examples of damaged partnerships, adverse consequences on community structures, dangers to patient safety, and harmed professional reputations and credibility. Domestic health experiences do not require a visa or vaccines but bring students in contact with many of the same ethical, professional, and cross-cultural challenges as overseas endeavors. Fortunately, best practices for preparing students to confront these challenges have emerged from years of experience in domestic and global contexts alike. It all begins with establishing institutional partnerships built on principles of reciprocity and respect. Through careful program design, universities can align missions, goals, and expectations to best serve all invested parties: local partners, students, faculty, staff, and the communities where they will be working. A second critical component is appropriate student selection. Matching student skills with partner needs can optimize benefits for both the host organization and student. Finally, universities can prepare students to navigate in cross-cultural settings in a professional and ethical manner through careful training. Just as negative experiences can have lasting negative consequences, the best ones can lead to strengthened partnerships; durable benefits for local and global communities; and optimal learning for students, their supervisors, and hosts.

However, socioeconomic factors influencing non-communicable diseases have not been included in the plan. In this study, we aimed to compare the contribution of socioeconomic status to mortality and years-of-life-lost with that of the 25 x 25 conventional risk factors. Methods We did a multicohort study and meta-analysis with individual-level data from 48 independent prospective cohort studies with information about socioeconomic status, indexed by occupational position, 25 x 25 risk factors (high alcohol intake, physical inactivity, current smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity), and mortality, for a total population of 1 751 479 (54% women) from seven high-income WHO member countries. We estimated the association of socioeconomic status and the 25 x 25 risk factors with all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality by calculating minimally adjusted and mutually adjusted hazard ratios [HR] and 95% CIs. We also estimated the population attributable fraction and the years of life lost due to suboptimal risk factors. Findings During 26.6 million person-years at risk (mean follow-up 13.3 years [SD 6.4 years]), 310 277 participants died. HR for the 25 x 25 risk factors and mortality varied between 1.04 (95% CI 0.98-1.11) for obesity in men and 2.17 (2.06-2.29) for current smoking in men. Participants with low socioeconomic status had greater mortality compared with those with high socioeconomic status (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.38-1.45 for men; 1.34, 1.28-1.39 for women); this association remained significant in mutually adjusted models that included the 25 x 25 factors (HR 1.26, 1.21-1.32, men and women combined). The population attributable fraction was highest for smoking, followed by physical inactivity then socioeconomic status. Low socioeconomic status was associated with a 2.1-year reduction in life expectancy between ages 40 and 85 years, the corresponding years-of-life-lost were 0.5 years for high alcohol intake, 0.7 years for obesity, 3.9 years for diabetes, 1.6 years for hypertension, 2.4 years for physical inactivity, and 4.8 years for current smoking. Interpretation Socioeconomic circumstances, in addition to the 25 x 25 factors, should be targeted by local and global health strategies and health risk surveillance to reduce mortality.

J	Webster, AC; Nagler, EV; Morton, RL; Masson, P				Webster, Angela C.; Nagler, Evi V.; Morton, Rachael L.; Masson, Philip			Chronic kidney disease	LANCET			English	Review							GLOMERULAR-FILTRATION-RATE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HEMODIALYSIS-PATIENTS; IRON SUPPLEMENTATION; ESTIMATED GFR; RISK; CANCER; CKD	The definition and classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have evolved over time, but current international guidelines define this condition as decreased kidney function shown by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), or markers of kidney damage, or both, of at least 3 months duration, regardless of the underlying cause. Diabetes and hypertension are the main causes of CKD in all high-income and middle-income countries, and also in many low-income countries. Incidence, prevalence, and progression of CKD also vary within countries by ethnicity and social determinants of health, possibly through epigenetic influence. Many people are asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms such as lethargy, itch, or loss of appetite. Diagnosis is commonly made after chance findings from screening tests (urinary dipstick or blood tests), or when symptoms become severe. The best available indicator of overall kidney function is GFR, which is measured either via exogenous markers (eg, DTPA, iohexol), or estimated using equations. Presence of proteinuria is associated with increased risk of progression of CKD and death. Kidney biopsy samples can show definitive evidence of CKD, through common changes such as glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. Complications include anaemia due to reduced production of erythropoietin by the kidney; reduced red blood cell survival and iron deficiency; and mineral bone disease caused by disturbed vitamin D, calcium, and phosphate metabolism. People with CKD are five to ten times more likely to die prematurely than they are to progress to end stage kidney disease. This increased risk of death rises exponentially as kidney function worsens and is largely attributable to death from cardiovascular disease, although cancer incidence and mortality are also increased. Health-related quality of life is substantially lower for people with CKD than for the general population, and falls as GFR declines. Interventions targeting specific symptoms, or aimed at supporting educational or lifestyle considerations, make a positive difference to people living with CKD. Inequity in access to services for this disease disproportionally affects disadvantaged populations, and health service provision to incentivise early intervention over provision of care only for advanced CKD is still evolving in many countries.

Of the 261 million people requiring preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis in 2013, 92% of them lived in sub-Saharan Africa and only 12.7% received preventive chemotherapy. Moreover, in 2010, the WHO reported that schistosomiasis mortality could be as high as 280 000 per year in Africa alone. In May 2012 delegates to the sixty-fifth World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA65.21 that called for the elimination of schistosomiasis, and foresees the regular treatment of at least 75% of school age children in at-risk areas. The resolution urged member states to intensify schistosomiasis control programmes and to initiate elimination campaigns where possible. Despite this, in June 2015, schistosomiasis was indicated to have the lowest level of preventive chemotherapy implementation in the spectrum of neglected tropical diseases. It was also highlighted as the disease most lacking in progress. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that it was also the only NTD with access to drug donations but without a coalition of stakeholders that collaborates to boost commitment and implementation. As a consequence, and to ensure that the WHO NTDs Roadmap Targets of 2012 and World Health Assembly Resolution WHA65.21 are met, the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance (GSA) has been set up. Diverse and representative, the GSA aims to be a partnership of endemic countries, academic and research institutions, international development agencies and foundations, international organizations, non-governmental development organizations, private sector companies and advocacy and resource mobilisation partners. Ultimately, the GSA calls for a partnership to work for the benefit of endemic countries by addressing health inequity and rural poverty.

However, no studies to date in Japan have reported on the prognosis of patients with CKD with respect to SES. This study aimed to investigate the influences of employment and education level on mortality and hospitalization among maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients in Japan. Methods Data on 7974 HD patients enrolled in Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study phases 1-4 (1999-2011) in Japan were analysed. Employment status, education level, demographic data, and comorbidities were abstracted at entry into DOPPS from patient records. Mortality and hospitalization events were collected during follow-up. Patients on dialysis < 120 days at study entry were excluded from the analyses. Cox regression modelled the association between employment and both mortality and hospitalization among patients < 60 years old. The association between education and outcomes was also assessed. The association between patient characteristics and employment among patients < 60 years old was assessed using logistic regression. Results During a median follow-up of 24.9 months (interquartile range, 18.4-32.0), 10% of patients died and 43% of patients had an inpatient hospitalization. Unemployment was associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-2.36) and hospitalization (HR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.08-1.44). Compared to patients who graduated from university, patients with less than a high school (HS) education and patients who graduated HS with some college tended to have elevated mortality (HR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.04-1.92 and HR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.02-1.82, respectively) but were not at risk for increased hospitalizations. Factors associated with unemployment included lower level of education, older age, female gender, longer vintage, and several comorbidities. Conclusions Employment and education status were inversely associated with mortality in patients on maintenance HD in Japan. Employment but not education was also inversely associated with hospitalizations. After adjustment for comorbidities, the associations with clinical outcomes tended to be stronger for employment than education status.

J	Gostin, LO; Friedman, EA				Gostin, Lawrence O.; Friedman, Eric A.			Reimagining WHO: leadership and action for a new Director-General	LANCET			English	Article							CANDIDATES; HEALTH	Three candidates to be the next WHO Director-General remain: Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, David Nabarro, and Sania Nishtar. The World Health Assembly's ultimate choice will lead an organisation facing daunting internal and external challenges, from its own funding shortfalls to antimicrobial resistance and immense health inequities. The new Director-General must transform WHO into a 21st century institution guided by the right to health. Topping the incoming Director-General's agenda will be a host of growing threats-risks to global health security, antimicrobial resistance, non-communicable diseases, and climate change-but also the transformative potential of the Sustainable Development Goals, including their universal health coverage target. Throughout, the next Director-General should emphasise equality, including through national health equity strategies and, more boldly still, advancing the Framework Convention on Global Health. Success in these areas will require a reinvigorated WHO, with sustainable financing, greater multisector engagement, enhanced accountability and transparency, and strengthened normative leadership. WHO must also evolve its governance to become far more welcoming of civil society and communities. To create the foundation for these transformative changes, the Director-General will need to focus first on gaining political support. This entails improving accountability and transparency to gain member state trust, and enabling meaningful civil society participation in WHO's governance and standing up for the right to health to gain civil society support. Ultimately, in the face of a global environment marked by heightened nationalism and xenophobia, member states must empower the next Director-General to enable WHO to be a bulwark for health and human rights, serving as an inspiring contra-example to today's destructive politics, demonstrating that the community of nations are indeed stronger together.

In addition, the implications of this activity for organization and market concentration are of great interest to policy makers. Using a sample of 2256 firm-year observations in the health care industry during the period from 1985 to 2011, this article provides novel evidence that managers learn from financial markets in making capital expenditure (CAPEX) and M&A investment decisions. Within the industry, managers in the Drugs subsector are most likely to do so, whereas managers in the Medical Equipment and Supplies are least likely to do so. We find informative stock prices improve firm financial performance. This article highlights the importance of financial markets for real economic activity in the health care industry.

International targets to reduce inadequate WASH coverage were set under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs, 1990-2015) and now the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2016-2030). The MDGs called for halving the proportion of the population without access to adequate water and sanitation, whereas the SDGs call for universal access, require the progressive reduction of inequalities, and include hygiene in addition to water and sanitation. Estimating access to complete WASH coverage provides a baseline for monitoring during the SDG period. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has among the lowest rates of WASH coverage globally. Methods The most recent available Demographic Household Survey (DHS) or Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) data for 25 countries in SSA were analysed to estimate national and regional coverage for combined water and sanitation (a combined MDG indicator for 'improved' access) and combined water with collection time within 30 minutes plus sanitation and hygiene (a combined SDG indicator for 'basic' access). Coverage rates were estimated separately for urban and rural populations and for wealth quintiles. Frequency ratios and percentage point differences for urban and rural coverage were calculated to give both relative and absolute measures of urban-rural inequality. Wealth inequalities were assessed by visual examination of coverage across wealth quintiles in urban and rural populations and by calculating concentration indices as standard measures of relative wealth related inequality that give an indication of how unevenly a health indicator is distributed across the wealth distribution. Results Combined MDG coverage in SSA was 20%, and combined basic SDG coverage was 4%; an estimated 921 million people lacked basic SDG coverage. Relative measures of inequality were higher for combined basic SDG coverage than combined MDG coverage, but absolute inequality was lower. Rural combined basic SDG coverage was close to zero in many countries. Conclusions Our estimates help to quantify the scale of progress required to achieve universal WASH access in low-income countries, as envisaged under the water and sanitation SDG. Monitoring and reporting changes in the proportion of the national population with access to water, sanitation and hygiene may be useful in focusing WASH policy and investments towards the areas of greatest need.

Governance of global health research consortia: Sharing sovereignty and resources within Future Health Systems	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Ethics; Governance; Justice; Equity; Research consortia; Global health; Health systems research	JUSTICE	Global health research partnerships are increasingly taking the form of consortia that conduct programs of research in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). An ethical framework has been developed that describes how the governance of consortia comprised of institutions from high-income countries and LMICs should be structured to promote health equity. It encompasses initial guidance for sharing sovereignty in consortia decision-making and sharing consortia resources. This paper describes a first effort to examine whether and how consortia can uphold that guidance. Case study research was undertaken with the Future Health Systems consortium, performs research to improve health service delivery for the poor in Bangladesh, China, India, and Uganda. Data were thematically analysed and revealed that proposed ethical requirements for sharing sovereignty and sharing resources are largely upheld by Future Health Systems. Facilitating factors included having a decentralised governance model, LMIC partners with good research capacity, and firm budgets. Higher labour costs in the US and UK and the funder's policy of allocating funds to consortia on a reimbursement basis prevented full alignment with guidance on sharing resources. The lessons described in this paper can assist other consortia to more systematically link their governance policy and practice to the promotion of health equity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Inequities in the Quality of Antenatal and Delivery Care in Kenya	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OF-CARE; NEWBORN HEALTH; MEDICAL-CARE; INTERVENTIONS	Background Quality of healthcare is an important determinant of future progress in global health. However, the distributional aspects of quality of care have received inadequate attention. We assessed whether high quality maternal care is equitably distributed by (1) mapping the quality of maternal care in facilities located in poorer versus wealthier areas of Kenya; and (2) comparing the quality of maternal care available to Kenyans in and not in poverty. Methods We assessed three measures of maternal care quality: facility infrastructure and clinical quality of antenatal care and delivery care, using indicators from the 2010 Kenya Service Provision Assessment (SPA), a standardized facility survey with direct observation of maternal care provision. We calculated poverty of the area served by antenatal or delivery care facilities using the Multidimensional Poverty Index. We used regression analyses and nonparametric tests to assess differences in maternal care quality in facilities located in more and less impoverished areas. We estimated effective coverage with a minimum standard of care for the full population and those in poverty. Results A total of 564 facilities offering at least one maternal care service were included in this analysis. Quality of maternal care was low, particularly clinical quality of antenatal and delivery care, which averaged 0.52 and 0.58 out of 1 respectively, compared to 0.68 for structural inputs to care. Maternal healthcare quality varied by poverty level: at the facility level, all quality metrics were lowest for the most impoverished areas and increased significantly with greater wealth. Population access to a minimum standard (>= 0.75 of 1.00) of quality maternal care was both low and inequitable: only 17% of all women and 8% of impoverished women had access to minimally adequate delivery care. Conclusion The quality of maternal care is low in Kenya, and care available to the impoverished is significantly worse than that for the better off. To achieve the national targets of maternal and neonatal mortality reduction, policy initiatives need to tackle low quality of care, starting with high-poverty areas.

Violence prevention experts call for engagement of boys and men to change social norms around masculinity in order to prevent gender-based violence. Yet, men do not comprise a homogenous category. Drawing on probability estimates of men who report same-sex practices and preferences captured in a multi-country gender-based violence prevention survey in the Asia-Pacific region, we test the effects of sexuality-related factors on men's adverse life experiences. We find that sexual minority men face statistically higher risk of lifetime adversity related to gender-based violence, stemming from gender inequitable norms in society. Sexuality is thus a key axis of differentiation among men in the Asia-Pacific region, influencing health and wellbeing and reflecting men's differential engagement with dominant norms of masculinity. Integrating awareness of male sexual diversity into gender-based violence prevention interventions, particularly those that work with boys and men, and bridging violence prevention programming between sexual minority communities and women, are essential to tackle the root drivers of violence.

Situating social work within the post-2015 Global Agenda	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						Post-2015 agenda; United Nations; Sustainable Development Goals; inequality; human rights; Global Agenda; SDGs		The launch of the post-2015 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations (UN) initiates a new set of global priorities to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Over a three-year process, governments and civil society representatives at the UN planned and negotiated the post-2015 Agenda and a set of SDGs and targets. Unlike the MDGs which focused almost entirely on developing countries, the new agenda is intended to be universal and therefore applicable to Europe and North America. The goals address a wide range of issues including poverty and inequality, health, international trade, climate change and gender, with a strong emphasis on the environment. This article will provide an overview of the post-2015 process and explore the implications of this agenda for social work globally and locally. It will highlight areas of particular interest to the profession, especially prospects for addressing growing global inequality within and between countries, and concerns over the role of human rights protection. The advantages and limitations of linking social work's global agenda to the new UN priorities will be assessed.

Many burnout studies -original as well as reviews-restricted their analyses to emotional exhaustion or did not report results on cynicism, personal accomplishment or global burnout. To meet this need we carried out this review and meta-analyses with the aim to provide systematically graded evidence for associations between working conditions and near-future development of burnout symptoms. Methods: A wide range of work exposure factors was screened. Inclusion criteria were: 1) Study performed in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand 1990-2013. 2) Prospective or comparable case control design. 3) Assessments of exposure (work) and outcome at baseline and at least once again during follow up 1-5 years later. Twenty-five articles met the predefined relevance and quality criteria. The GRADE-system with its 4-grade evidence scale was used. Results: Most of the 25 studies focused emotional exhaustion, fewer cynicism and still fewer personal accomplishment. Moderately strong evidence (grade 3) was concluded for the association between job control and reduced emotional exhaustion and between low workplace support and increased emotional exhaustion. Limited evidence (grade 2) was found for the associations between workplace justice, demands, high work load, low reward, low supervisor support, low co-worker support, job insecurity and change in emotional exhaustion. Cynicism was associated with most of these work factors. Reduced personal accomplishment was only associated with low reward. There were few prospective studies with sufficient quality on adverse chemical, biological and physical factors and burnout. Conclusion: While high levels of job support and workplace justice were protective for emotional exhaustion, high demands, low job control, high work load, low reward and job insecurity increased the risk for developing exhaustion. Our approach with a wide range of work exposure factors analysed in relation to the separate dimensions of burnout expanded the knowledge of associations, evidence as well as research needs. The potential of organizational interventions is illustrated by the findings that burnout symptoms are strongly influenced by structural factors such as job demands, support and the possibility to exert control.

J	Gopalan, SS; Das, A; Howard, N				Gopalan, Saji S.; Das, Ashis; Howard, Natasha			Maternal and neonatal service usage and determinants in fragile and conflict-affected situations: a systematic review of Asia and the Middle-East	BMC WOMENS HEALTH			English	Review						Fragile and conflict-affected; Maternal and neonatal health; Care-seeking; Service usage; Asia; Middle-East	BIRTH	Background: Fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) in Asia and the Middle-East contribute significantly to global maternal and neonatal deaths. This systematic review explored maternal and neonatal health (MNH) services usage and determinants in FCS in Asia and the Middle-East to inform policy on health service provision in these challenging settings. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using a standardised protocol. Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and selected development agency websites were searched for studies meeting inclusion criteria. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using an adapted evaluation tool. Qualitative and quantitative data were synthesized and pooled odds ratios generated for meta-analysis of service-usage determinants. Results: Of 18 eligible peer-reviewed studies, eight were from Nepal, four from Afghanistan, and two each from Iraq, Yemen, and the Palestinian Territories. Fragile situations provide limited evidence on emergency obstetric care, postnatal care, and newborn services. Usage of MNH services was low in all FCS, irrespective of economic growth level. Demand-side determinants of service-usage were transportation, female education, autonomy, health awareness, and ability-to-pay. Supply-side determinants included service availability and quality, existence of community health-workers, costs, and informal payments in health facilities. Evidence is particularly sparse on MNH in acute crises, and remains limited in fragile situations generally. Conclusions: Findings emphasize that poor MNH status in FCS is a leading contributor to the burden of maternal and neonatal ill-health in Asia and the Middle-East. Essential services for skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric, newborn, and postnatal care require improvement in FCS. FCS require additional resources and policy attention to address the barriers to appropriate MNH care. Authors discuss the 'targeted policy approach for vulnerable groups' as a means of addressing MNH service usage inequities.

Gabriela M.; Waldman, Eliseu Alves			Migration to middle-income countries and tuberculosis-global policies for global economies	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Tuberculosis; Migration; Health equity; Low- and middle-income countries	CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER; TRANSFER PROGRAM; SAO-PAULO; PRE-ENTRY; HEALTH; IMMIGRANTS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INFECTION; COMMUNITY; COVERAGE	Background: International migration to middle-income countries is increasing and its health consequences, in particular increasing transmission rates of tuberculosis (TB), deserve consideration. Migration and TB are a matter of concern in high-income countries and targeted screening of migrants for active and latent TB infection is a main strategy to manage risk and minimize transmission. In this paper, we discuss some aspects of TB control and migration in the context of middle-income countries, together with the prospect of responding with equitable and comprehensive policies. Main body: TB rates in middle-income countries remain disproportionally high among the poorest and most vulnerable groups in large cities where most migrant populations are concentrated. Policies that tackle migrant TB in high-income countries may be inadequate for middle-income countries because of their different socioeconomic and cultural scenarios. Strategies to control TB in these settings must take into account the characteristics of middle-income countries and the complexity of TB as a disease of poverty. Intersectoral policies of social protection such as cash-transfer programs help reducing poverty and improving health in vulnerable populations. We address the development of new approaches to improve well-established strategies including contact tracing and active and latent TB screening as an 'add on' to the existing health care guidelines of conditional cash transfer programs. In addition, we discuss how it might improve health and welfare among both poor migrants and locally-born populations. Authorities from middle-income countries should recognise that migrants are a vulnerable social group and promote cooperation efforts between sending and receiving countries for mitigation of poverty and prevention of disease in this group. Conclusions: Middle-income countries have long sent migrants overseas. However, the influx of large migrant populations into their societies is relatively new and a growing phenomenon and it is time to set comprehensive goals to improve health among these communities. Conditional cash transfer policies with TB screening and strengthening of DOTS are some strategies that deserve attention. Reduction of social and health inequality among migrants should be incorporated into concerted actions to meet TB control targets.

The current study aimed to identify socioeconomic, family and school-related associated factors with physical activity and sedentary behaviour among high-school adolescents. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of T0 physical activity and sedentary behaviour of 2523 students 14-18 years old recruited for the PRALIMAP trial from 24 French state-run high schools. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaire at the start of grade 10. Adolescents completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire for physical activity and sedentary behaviour and an ad hoc questionnaire for active commuting and sport participation. Statistical analyses involved linear and logistic regressions. Results: Socioeconomic, family or school variables were associated with levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviour for both boys and girls, but no factor, except perceived parental physical activity level, was associated with total energy expenditure (total physical activity) for either gender. Adolescents with privileged and less privileged socioeconomic status reported the same total amount of energy expenditure. Conclusions: Total physical activity score alone is not sufficient to assess the physical activity of adolescents. These findings may have implications for better understanding of social inequalities in this context and recommendations to prevent overweight.

Inequality and ethics in paediatric HIV remission research: From Mississippi to South Africa and back	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						'Mississippi baby'; HIV cure; HIV remission; ethics; inequality	TO-CHILD-TRANSMISSION; INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; CARE UTILIZATION; FOOD INSECURITY; HEALTH; CURE; INTERVENTIONS; INDIVIDUALS; THERAPY; JUSTICE	In 2013, physician-researchers announced that a baby in Mississippi had been functionally cured' of HIV [Persaud, D., Gay, H., Ziemniak, C. F., Chen, Y. H., Piatak, M., Chun, T.-W.,...Luzuriaga, K. (2013b, March). Functional HIV cure after very early ART of an infected infant. Paper presented at the 20th conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections, Atlanta, GA]. Though the child later developed a detectable viral load, the case remains unprecedented, and trials to build on the findings are planned [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. (2014). Mississippi baby' now has detectable HIV, researchers find. Retrieved from http://www.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2014/pages/mississippibabyhiv.aspx]. Whether addressing HIV cure' or remission', scrutiny of this case has focused largely on scientific questions, with only introductory attention to ethics. The social inequalities and gaps in care that made the discovery possible - and their ethical implications for paediatric HIV remission - have gone largely unexamined. This paper describes structural inequalities surrounding the Mississippi baby' case and a parallel case in South Africa, where proof-of-concept studies are in the early stages. We argue that an ethical programme of research into infant HIV remission ought to be structurally competent', and recommend that paediatric remission studies consider including a research component focused on social protection and barriers to care.

Our study assessed data from the French national cross-sectional survey of occupational risks (SUMER) that was conducted in 2010 in a national representative sample of employees. We selected 28 CMR agents that were classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer or European Union as being known or presumed to have CMR potential in humans. The association of individual and job characteristics with exposure prevalence, duration, and intensity of the CMR agents during a 1-week period was examined using multilevel logistic regression analysis. Overall, 10.4% of employees in 2010 were exposed to one or more CMR agents at their workplace, and 3.4% were subjected to multiple CMR exposures. Blue-collar workers, night-shift workers and workers with short-term employment contracts experienced higher exposure prevalence (p < 0.01) and intensity (p < 0.05). Blue-collar workers and shift workers experienced also longer exposure duration (p < 0.001). Conversely, managers, workers of large companies, and women were less exposed to CMR agents (p < 0.001). The presence of a Committee for Health, Safety, and Working Conditions, and intervention by Occupational Health and Safety officers were significantly associated with reduced exposure intensities (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05). Establishment of European CMR regulations and the existence of an applicable substitution principle reduced the exposure duration (p < 0.001) and intensity (p < 0.05). Our results point out disparities in CMR exposure and identify high-priority targets for prevention measures to help reducing social health discrepancies.

Much of these disparities come from reduced household earnings due to the loss of parental income. The present study used conditional process analysis to evaluate income and savings among OVC households, using cross-sectional data from 1,060 OVC in a 3-year Kenyan empowerment program that combined elements of cash transfer, psychosocial support, and small business entrepreneurship. Higher monthly earnings were significantly associated with program participation in a graded fashion. Approximately one-third of the association was mediated by material inputs, indicating that a substantial portion may be explained by other unobserved program elements. Eighty-five percent of increased rates of saving money in the past year were mediated by improved monthly income, cash transferred and improved food consumption. Data analysis highlights the need for multisectoral approaches and the need for more research to understand how to improve household economic stability among OVC. Key Practitioner Message: center dot Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) are at risk of greater poverty, leading to multiple developmental and health challenges; center dot Current policy in Kenya to offset costs of caring for OVC utilizes monthly cash transfers to households providing care for OVC; center dot The present study found that increases in monthly income in an OVC multisectoral empowerment program were largely due to factors beyond the material inputs.

The contribution of air pollution to the health status of population is estimated to be about 20%. Health is largely determined by factors outside the reach of healthcare sector, including low income, unemployment, poor environment, poor education, and substandard housing. The aim of the paper was to review a current knowledge of relationships among air pollution, socioeconomic health inequalities, socio-spatial differentiation, and environmental inequity. The relationships were demonstrated on an example of the Ostrava region. Also basic approaches to health valuation were reviewed. Results: Social differences are reasons both for health inequalities and spatial patterns of unprivileged area housing. In urban environments with poor air quality there is also a large concentration of low income residents. Less affluent population groups are more often affected by inadequate housing conditions including second-hand smoking and higher environmental burden in their residential neighbourhoods. Environmental injustice is highly correlated with other factors that link poverty with poor health, including inadequate access to medical and preventive care, lack of availability of healthful food, lack of safe play spaces for children, absence of good jobs, crime, and violence. Conclusions: The theoretical background and also results of the studies brought evidence that population health is affected by both socioeconomic and environmental inequalities. Air pollution is unevenly distributed in Ostrava and is related to distribution of socially disadvantaged environment and social exclusion as well.

International evidence suggests that early intervention is the best approach to reduce the burden of chronic disease. However, the limited research available suggests that health care access remains unequal, with rural populations having the poorest access to and utilisation of primary health care centres and, consequently, the poorest health outcomes. This study aimed to examine the factors influencing the access to and utilisation of primary health care centres in urban and rural areas of Riyadh province of the KSA. Methods: A questionnaire survey was carried out to identify the barriers and enablers to accessing PHCS in rural (n = 5) and urban (n = 5) areas of Riyadh province, selected on the classification of the population density of the governorates. An adapted version of the NHS National Survey Programme was administered that included 50 questions over 11 sections that assessed a wide range of factors related to respondent's access and experience of the PHCS. A total of 935 responses were obtained with 52.9% (n = 495) from urban areas and the remaining 47.1% (n = 440) from rural areas of Riyadh province. Results: This study highlights that there are high levels of satisfaction among patients among all PHCS. In relation to differences between urban and rural respondents, the findings indicated that there were significant variations in relation to: education level, monthly income, medical investigations, receiving blood tests on time, extra opening hours, distance, cleanliness and health prevention. Core barriers for rural patients related to the distance to reach PHCS, cleanliness of the PHCS, receiving health prevention and promotion services, which should serve to improve health outcomes. Conclusions: This study highlighted important differences in access to and utilisation of PHCS between urban and rural populations in Riyadh province in the KSA. These findings have implications for policy and planning of PHCCs and reducing inequalities in health care between rural and urban populations and contributing to a reduction in the chronic disease burden in Riyadh province.

J	Rodríguez, DC; Whiteside, A; Bennett, S				Rodriguez, Daniela C.; Whiteside, Alan; Bennett, Sara			Political commitment for vulnerable populations during donor transition	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article							TRADE-OFF; EXPERIENCE; PROGRAMS; HEALTH; EFFICIENCY; EQUITY; HIV	The responsibilities for the programmatic, technical and financial support of health programmes are increasingly being passed from external donors to governments. Programmes for family planning, human immunodeficiency virus, immunization, malaria and tuberculosis have already faced such donor transition, which is a difficult and often political process. Wherever programmes and services aimed at vulnerable populations are primarily supported by donors, the post-transition future is uncertain. Overreliance on donor support is often a reflection of limited domestic political commitment. Limited commitment, which is frequently expressed as the persecution of vulnerable groups, poses a risk to individuals as well as to the effectiveness and sustainability of health programmes. We argue that, for reasons linked to human rights, the social contract and the cost effectiveness of health promotion, prevention and treatment programmes, it is critical that governments sustain health services for vulnerable populations during and after donor transition. Although civil society organizatins could help by engaging with government stakeholders, pushing to change social norms and supporting mechanisms that demand accountability, they may be constrained by economic, political and social factors.Vulnerable populations need to be actively involved in the planning and implementation of donor transition - to ensure that their voice and needs are taken into account and to establish a platform that improves visibility and accountability. As transitions spread across all aspects of global health, transparent conversations about the building and sustainment of political commitment for health services for vulnerable populations become a critical human rights issue.

Using long-running panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey we examine trends in multidimensional poverty in Australia between 2001 and 2013. We find that this has been relatively stable, with some evidence of an upwards trend following from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However, a closer examination of the individual components reveals a more dynamic picture. Deprivation concerning health, material resources, social support and education increased over the 13-year observation period, offsetting decreases in deprivation concerning safety perceptions, employment and community participation. Additionally, using counterfactual simulations, we examine the relative roles of different poverty domains in explaining changes in Australian multidimensional poverty. We find that recent year-on-year changes in multidimensional poverty are mainly driven by fluctuations in social support, health and material resources. Altogether, our findings suggest that Australian poverty-reduction policies would enhance their effectiveness and efficiency by focusing on improving disadvantage in the domains of health and material resources.

J	Pavarino, RV				Pavarino Filho, Roberto Victor			The Moscow and Brasilia Declarations on road safety - a parallel between two moments in health	CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA			English	Article						Traffic accidents; Public Health; Epidemiology; Health Promotion; Sustainable Development Indicators		Two high-level multisectoral global conferences on road traffic safety (Moscow, 2009 and Brasilia, 2015), held under the auspices of the United Nations, adopted formal declarations on both occasions. Given the potential of these documents to establish positions, propose guidelines, policies and legal frameworks, this paper compares these charters, in order to identify the emphases, expectations and horizons indicated at each moment, highlighting their health-related items. We describe the WHO's involvement with road safety, considering the ways this relationship signaled the health sector's connection with the theme. We present both conferences and their respective declarations, comparing health issues addressed. We conclude that Brasilia reinforces Moscow and, in addition to contributions expected from the health sector (data, notification, post-trauma care), the implications of the sector have increased, particularly with regard to health promotion, the call for intersectoral collaboration, equity and sustainability aspects, influenced by the United Nations 2030 Agenda.

More than Target 6.3: A Systems Approach to Rethinking Sustainable Development Goals in a Resource-Scarce World	ENGINEERING			English	Article						Systems thinking; Sanitation; Environmental protection; Gender Resource recovery; Causal loop diagram; Sustainability	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; RECOVERY; IMPACT; SANITATION; TOOLS; IPAT	The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development outlines 17 individual Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that guide the needs of practice for many professional disciplines around the world, including engineering, research, policy, and development. The SDGs represent commitments to reduce poverty, hunger, ill health, gender inequality, environmental degradation, and lack of access to clean water and sanitation. If a typical reductionist approach is employed to address and optimize individual goals, it may lead to a failure in technological, policy, or managerial development interventions through unintended consequences in other goals. This study uses a systems approach to understand the fundamental dynamics between the SDGs in order to identify potential synergies and antagonisms. A conceptual system model was constructed to illustrate the causal relationships between SDGs, examine system structures using generic system archetypes, and identify leverage points to effectively influence intentional and minimize unintentional changes in the system. The structure of interactions among the SDGs reflects three archetypes of system behavior: Reinforcing Growth, Limits to Growth, and Growth and Underinvestment. The leverage points identified from the conceptual model are gender equality, sustainable management of water and sanitation, alternative resources, sustainable livelihood standards, and global partnerships. Such a conceptual system analysis of SDGs can enhance the likelihood that the development community will broaden its understanding of the potential synergistic benefits of their projects on resource management, environmental sustainability, and climate change. By linking the interactions and feedbacks of those projects with economic gains, women's empowerment, and educational equality, stakeholders can recognize holistic improvements that can be made to the quality of life of many of the world's poor.

J	Ebersöhn, L				Ebersohn, Liesel			Enabling spaces in education research: an agenda for impactful, collective evidence to support all to be first among un-equals	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						barriers to education; buffers in education; egalitarian political philosophy; equality of opportunity; global South education; high risk schools; poverty and education; protective resources; resilience; risk factors	MIDDLE-ADOLESCENTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY; HEALTH-CARE; RESILIENCE; PERFORMANCE; SCHOOLS; LEARNERS; EXPERIENCES; PRINCIPALS	Single case studies are prolific in South African education research. I equate the abundance of case studies to the urgency for evidence to transform the highly unequal landscape of education opportunities. In contrast however, stand-alone case study evidence does not offer much impact in building an evidence-based body of knowledge for education interventions. I posit an alternative for education research in the absence of collective studies, and propose for education researchers to collaborate in order to be deliberate in building a collective body of knowledge on circumstances that enable positive education outcomes given a postcolonial context, such as South Africa. I use an egalitarian political philosophy position to posit the notion of schools as enabling spaces, so as to counter a dis-enabling disaster perspective and promote dialogue on evidence of that which supports positive learning and development, given high structural disparity. I show that, as with studies in which I participated, many studies exist locally to generate evidence on education responses given adversity. However, insights thus derived are fragmented, regional and mostly single case studies using multiple conceptualisations, measures and indicators. I argue that an intentional education research agenda to coordinate inquiries could inform design, conceptualisation, measurement, comparative value and data sharing. An enabling schools research agenda could intentionally guide inquiry into that which supports education, where chronic poverty renders society as characteristically less equal.

Rheumatology in Africa-challenges and opportunities	ARTHRITIS RESEARCH & THERAPY			English	Article						Rheumatology; Africa; Blacks; Arthritis; Health equity; Rheumatoid arthritis; Genetics	SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; GLOBAL BURDEN; PREVALENCE; ARTHRITIS; INJURIES; DISEASES	Africa faces many health challenges despite sustained growth and development over the past decade. Contributory factors are the lack of financial resources, an inadequate health professional workforce, a high burden of communicable diseases, and an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Rheumatology services are limited or non-existent in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Over the past decade, partnerships with international academic institutions have resulted in some progress in the training of rheumatologists and health professionals and development of rheumatology services in countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia. Basic diagnostic tests, biological agents, and arthroplasty are either unavailable or not affordable by the majority of the population. Urbanization has resulted in a change in the epidemiology of rheumatic diseases with an increase in the prevalence of gout, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma over the past four decades. Future growth of rheumatology services will depend on identifying committed individuals in underserved countries for training and supporting them to educate medical students, physicians, and health professionals in their home countries. There is a need to develop models of care using all categories of health workers and identify prevention strategies and cost-effective management programs for low resource settings. Africa affords an opportunity for collaborative research, including genetic and epigenetic studies, to improve our understanding of many of the rheumatic diseases.

Syndemics investigates synergistic, often deleterious interactions among comorbid health conditions, especially under circumstances of structural and political adversity. Health and human rights research draws on international law to argue that all people deserve access not only to health care, but also to the underlying determinants of good health. Taking the urgent matter of migrant health as an empirical focus, we juxtapose the fields of syndemics and health and human rights, identify their complementarities, and advocate for a combined approach. By melding insights from these fields, the combined syndemics/health and human rights approach advanced here can provide clinicians and other key stakeholders with concrete insights, tools, and strategies to tackle the health inequities that affect migrants and other vulnerable groups by: (1) mapping the effect of social, political, and structural determinants on health; (2) identifying opportunities for upstream intervention; and (3) working collaboratively to tackle the structures, institutions, and processes that cause and exacerbate health inequities. Undergirding this approach is an egalitarian interpretation of the right to health that differs from narrow legalistic and individual interpretations by insisting that all people are equal in worth and, as a result, equally deserving of protection from syndemic vulnerability.

These partnerships differ from collaborations that carry out single projects in the multiplicity of their goals, scope of their activities, and nature of their management. Although such consortia typically aim to reduce health disparities between and within countries, what is required for them to do so has not been clearly defined. This article takes a conceptual approach to explore how the governance of transnational global health research consortia should be structured to advance health equity. To do so, it applies an account called shared health governance to derive procedural and substantive guidance. A checklist based on this guidance is proposed to assist research consortia determine where their governance practices strongly promote equity and where they may fall short.

J	Bogin, B; Scheffler, C; Hermanussen, M				Bogin, Barry; Scheffler, Christiane; Hermanussen, Michael			Global effects of income and income inequality on adult height and sexual dimorphism in height	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article							STATURE DIMORPHISM; HEALTH; GROWTH; SCIENCE; TRENDS; SIZE; MEN	Objectives: Average adult height of a population is considered a biomarker of the quality of the health environment and economic conditions. The causal relationships between height and income inequality are not well understood. We analyze data from 169 countries for national average heights of men and women and national-level economic factors to test two hypotheses: (1) income inequality has a greater association with average adult height than does absolute income; and (2) neither income nor income inequality has an effect on sexual dimorphism in height. Methods: Average height data come from the NCD-RisC health risk factor collaboration. Economic indicators are derived from the World Bank data archive and include gross domestic product (GDP), Gross National Income per capita adjusted for personal purchasing power (GNI_ PPP), and income equality assessed by the Gini coefficient calculated by the Wagstaff method. Results: Hypothesis 1 is supported. Greater income equality is most predictive of average height for both sexes. GNI_ PPP explains a significant, but smaller, amount of the variation. National GDP has no association with height. Hypothesis 2 is rejected. With greater average adult height there is greater sexual dimorphism. Conclusions: Findings support a growing literature on the pernicious effects of inequality on growth in height and, by extension, on health. Gradients in height reflect gradients in social disadvantage. Inequality should be considered a pollutant that disempowers people from the resources needed for their own healthy growth and development and for the health and good growth of their children.

Type 2 diabetes and obesity are also major threats in low- and middle-income countries, from which most migrant populations originate. Transitioning of societies and the resulting changes in lifestyles are thought to be major driving forces, but the key specific factors within this broad category still need to be determined. Migrant studies provide a unique opportunity to understand the potential underlying causes of these conditions, but current research is mainly geared toward analyzing the differences between migrants and the host populations in the countries of settlement. For better understanding, there is a need to extend migrant health research across national boundaries. This review discusses innovative ways of studying the effect of migration on type 2 diabetes and obesity beyond the common designs and the relevance of extending migrant health studies across national boundaries in the current era of increasing global migration. Specifically, we describe the burden and different methods for conducting migrant studies. We use the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study as a case study, discussing the methods, some results, and lessons learned, including challenges and an essential recipe for success that may guide future migrant health research.

Many low-income and middle-income countries, including small island states in the Pacific, have committed to UHC and reforming their health financing systems to better align with UHC goals. This study provides the first comprehensive evidence on equity of the health financing system in Fiji, a small Pacific island state. The health systems of such states are poorly covered in the international literature. Methods: The study employs benefit and financing incidence analyses to evaluate the distribution of health financing benefits and burden across the public and private sectors. Primary data from a cross-sectional survey of 2000 households were used to assess healthcare benefits and secondary data from the 2008-2009 Fiji Household Income and Expenditure Survey to assess health financing contributions. These were analysed by socioeconomic groups to determine the relative benefit and financing incidence across these groups. Findings: The distribution of healthcare benefits in Fiji slightly favours the poor-around 61% of public spending for nursing stations and 26% of spending for government hospital inpatient care were directed to services provided to the poorest 20% of the population. The financing system is significantly progressive with wealthier groups bearing a higher share of the health financing burden. Conclusions: The healthcare system in Fiji achieves a degree of vertical equity in financing, with the poor receiving a higher share of benefits from government health spending and bearing a lower share of the financing burden than wealthier groups.

The detection of gender bias requires knowing the expected relation between male and female mortality rates at different levels of overall mortality, in the absence of discrimination. Our objective was to compare two approaches aimed at assessing excess female under-five mortality rate (U5MR) in low/middle-income countries. Methods We compared the two approaches using data from 60 Demographic and Health Surveys (2005-2014). The prescriptive approach compares observed mortality rates with historical patterns in Western societies where gender discrimination was assumed to be low or absent. The descriptive approach is derived from global estimates of all countries with available data, including those affected by gender bias. Results The prescriptive approach showed significant excess female U5MR in 20 countries, compared with only one country according to the descriptive approach. Nevertheless, both models showed similar country rankings. The 13 countries with the highest and the 10 countries with the lowest rankings were the same according to both approaches. Differences in excess female mortality among world regions were significant, but not among country income groups. Conclusion Both methods are useful for monitoring time trends, detecting gender-based inequalities and identifying and addressing its causes. The prescriptive approach seems to be more sensitive in the identification of gender bias, but needs to be updated using data from populations with current-day structures of causes of death.

Health technology assessment (HTA) is an important policy reform that can assist policy-makers to tackle inequities and inefficiencies by improving the way in which health resources are allocated towards cost-effective, appropriate and feasible interventions. The equitable and efficient distribution of health budget resources, as well as timely uptake of good value technologies, are critical to strengthen the Indian healthcare system. The government of India is set to establish a Medical Technology Assessment Board to evaluate existing and new health technologies in India, assist choices between comparable technologies for adoption by the healthcare system and improve the way in which priorities for health are set. This initiative aims to introduce a more transparent, inclusive, fair and evidence-based process by which decisions regarding the allocation of health resources are made in India towards the ultimate goal of UHC. In this analysis article, we report on plans and progress of the government of India for the institutionalisation of HTA in the country. Where India is home to one-sixth of the global population, improving the health services that the population receives will have a resounding impact not only for India but also for global health.

Assessing the Brazilian surgical system with six surgical indicators: a descriptive and modelling study	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							HEALTH; SURGERY; EXPENDITURE	Background: Brazil boasts a health scheme that aspires to provide universal coverage, but its surgical system has rarely been analysed. In an effort to strengthen surgical systems worldwide, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery proposed a collection of 6 standardised indicators: 2-hour access to surgery, surgical workforce density, surgical volume, perioperative mortality rate (POMR) and protection against impoverishing and catastrophic expenditure. This study aims to characterise the Brazilian surgical health system with these newly devised indicators while gaining understanding on the complexity of the indicators themselves. Methods: Using Brazil's national healthcare database, commonly reported healthcare variables were used to calculate or simulate the 6 surgical indicators. Access to surgery was calculated using hospital locations, surgical workforce density was calculated using locations of surgeons, anaesthesiologists and obstetricians (SAO), and surgical volume and POMR were identified with surgical procedure codes. The rates of protection against impoverishing and catastrophic expenditure were modelled using cost of surgical inpatient hospitalisations and a. distribution of incomes based on Gini and gross domestic product/capita. Findings: In 2014, SAO density was 34.7/100 000 population, surgical volume was 4433 procedures/100 000 people and POMR was 1.71%. 79.4% of surgical patients were protected against impoverishing expenditure and 84.6% were protected against catastrophic expenditure due to surgery each year. 2-hour access to surgery was not able to be calculated from national health data, but a proxy measure suggested that 97.2% of the population has 2-hour access to a hospital that may be able to provide surgery. Geographic disparities were seen in all indicators. Interpretation: Brazil's public surgical system meets several key benchmarks. Geographic disparities, however, are substantial and raise concerns of equity. Policies should focus on stimulating appropriate geographic allocation of the surgical workforce and better distribution of surgical volume. In some cases, where benchmarks for each indicator are met, supplemental analysis can further inform our understanding of health systems. This measured and systematic evaluation should be encouraged for all nations seeking to better understand their surgical systems.

J	Wouters, OJ; McKee, M				Wouters, Olivier J.; McKee, Martin			Private Financing of Health Care in Times of Economic Crisis: a Review of the Evidence	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							LOW-INCOME; MEDICATION ADHERENCE; UNITED-STATES; INSURANCE; COST; GROWTH; COMPETITION; COUNTRIES; NATIONS; SYSTEM	Many high-income countries have cut public health care spending since the global economic downturn in 2008. Insome cases these cuts have been accompanied by calls to expand private financing to improve the efficiency of health systems. In low and middle-income countries seeking to increase access to health care, it is sometimes suggested that private financing is more effective than public financing because of weak state institutions and bureaucratic shortcomings. In this paper, we review the theoretical and empirical evidence on private financing in terms of cost, efficiency, equity and financial protection. We consider private health insurance, medical savings accounts and user charges in high, middle and low-income countries. The theoretical and empirical evidence reveals major market failures in the health sector. It is unlikely that private financing generates better results than public financing. Still, as private financing options are heterogeneous, it is possible that a particular form might play a beneficial role in a specific setting. Given the current state of knowledge, however, any calls to increase private financing must be accompanied by robust evidence, such as real world pilot studies.

J	Sarti, S; Terraneo, M; Bordogna, MT				Sarti, Simone; Terraneo, Marco; Bordogna, Mara Tognetti			Poverty and private health expenditures in Italian households during the recent crisis	HEALTH POLICY			English	Article						Inequalities in health care expenditure; Crisis; Health expenditure: poverty; Italy	CARE; INEQUALITIES; EQUITY; INEQUITIES; SYSTEMS; ACCESS	The global financial crisis that began in 2008 had an overall effect on the health behaviours of Italian households. Aggregate private health expenditures have decreased while the citizens have increasingly been asked to share health costs. The reduction of households' health expenditure could have serious consequences for health, especially if it concerns the most vulnerable people. The aim of this paper is to analyse the relation between poverty and household health expenditure, considering regional and social group variations. The data used stem from the "Family Expenditure Survey" collected by the Italian Statistical Institute (ISTAT) from 1997 to 2013. Results of multivariate analysis controlling for potential socio-demographic confounders show that the propensity to spend for poor families is decreased in the last years compared to not poor households. Meanwhile, among the households who spend, the average expenditure in euro seems to have been more stable over time. This is an alarming signal for the health of the most vulnerable households. These conditions could result in a gradual deterioration of health in poor families, which is likely to increase the burden on health systems in future. Hence, at this moment public intervention does not seem able to alleviate this situation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The dental biofilm is a major biological determinant common to the development of both diseases, and they share common risk factors and social determinants, important for their prevention and control. The remit of this working group was to review the current state of knowledge on epidemiology, socio-behavioural aspects as well as plaque control with regard to dental caries and periodontal diseases. Methods: Discussions were informed by three systematic reviews on (i) the global burden of dental caries and periodontitis; (ii) socio-behavioural aspects in the prevention and control of dental caries and periodontal diseases at an individual and population level; and (iii) mechanical and chemical plaque control in the simultaneous management of gingivitis and dental caries. This consensus report is based on the outcomes of these systematic reviews and on expert opinion of the participants. Results: Key findings included the following: (i) prevalence and experience of dental caries has decreased in many regions in all age groups over the last three decades; however, not all societal groups have benefitted equally from this decline; (ii) although some studies have indicated a possible decline in periodontitis prevalence, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that prevalence has changed over recent decades; (iii) because of global population growth and increased tooth retention, the number of people affected by dental caries and periodontitis has grown substantially, increasing the total burden of these diseases globally (by 37% for untreated caries and by 67% for severe periodontitis) as estimated between 1990 and 2013, with high global economic impact; (iv) there is robust evidence for an association of low socio-economic status with a higher risk of having dental caries/caries experience and also with higher prevalence of periodontitis; (v) the most important behavioural factor, affecting both dental caries and periodontal diseases, is routinely performed oral hygiene with fluoride; (vi) population-based interventions address behavioural factors to control dental caries and periodontitis through legislation (antismoking, reduced sugar content in foods and drinks), restrictions (taxes on sugar and tobacco) guidelines and campaigns; however, their efficacy remains to be evaluated; (vii) psychological approaches aimed at changing behaviour may improve the effectiveness of oral health education; (viii) different preventive strategies have proven to be effective during the course of life; (ix) management of both dental caries and gingivitis relies heavily on efficient self-performed oral hygiene, that is toothbrushing with a fluoride-containing toothpaste and interdental cleaning; (x) professional tooth cleaning, oral hygiene instruction and motivation, dietary advice and fluoride application are effective in managing dental caries and gingivitis.

The Social Psychology of the Great Recession and Social Class Divides	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES			English	Article							INCOME INEQUALITY; POVERTY; POOR; STUDENTS; HEALTH; IDENTITIES; HAPPINESS; SYSTEMS; CHOICE; AGENCY	The Great Recession, a marked global economic decline that began in December 2007 in the United States, has affected the entire world economy, although more in some countries than others. It has increased income inequality, intergenerational tensions, and anti-immigrant prejudices. This issue aims to discuss social psychological effects of economic downturns on intergroup and interpersonal relations. Two lines of research, closely related, converge in this issue because the Great Recession has brought social-class inequality into the foreground of worldwide contention. The first line of research here explores how social-class membership influences interpersonal and intergroup processes: trust, deservingness, identity, educational attainment, stereotypes, ideologies, and group behaviors. The second line analyzes how the Great Recession has been affecting people's own lives and their psychological reactions, depending on their social class. Throughout this overview, we introduce the contributions to this special issue. The volume contributes to social psychological ideas about both social classes and the recession.

Less is known on why these relations vary across countries. This study investigates whether the association between income and financial barriers to health care is influenced by national public health expenditures (PHE, in % of total health expenditure). Data from the International Social Survey Programme (2011) was used (28 countries, 23,669 respondents). Financial barriers were assessed by the individual experience of forgone care due to financial reasons. Monthly equivalent household income was included as the main predictor. Other individual level control variables were age, gender, education, subjective health, insurance coverage and place of living. PHE was considered as a macro-level predictor, adjusted for total health expenditure. Statistically significant associations between income and forgone care were found in 21 of 28 examined countries. Multilevel analyses across countries revealed that people with lower income have a higher likelihood to forgo needed medical care (OR: 3.94, 95%-CI: 2.96-5.24). After adjustments for individual-level covariates, this association slightly decreased (OR: 2.94, 95%-CI: 2.16-3.99). PHE did not moderate the relation between income and forgone care. The linkage between health system financing and inequalities in access to health care seems to be more complex than initially assumed, pointing towards further research to explore how PHE affects the redistribution of health resources in different health care systems.

Human rights in childbirth, narratives and restorative justice: a review	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Review						Narratives; Human rights in childbirth; Restorative justice; Obstetric violence; Respectful maternity care	MATERNITY CARE; QUALITY; WOMEN	This review describes the emerging global debate on the role of human rights childbirth. It is also tailored to a UK perspective in view of the Montgomery v. Lanarkshire [2015] legal ruling and it implications to practice. We can never underestimate the power of humane care on health. The compassion and evidence based medicine agenda in healthcare is interconnected with human rights in healthcare, feeding into the principles of decision making and patient centred care. When this has not happened and there is been healthcare conflict, the power of storytelling serves to connect disparate parties to their common humanity. Narratives are an important aspect of restorative justice processes and we suggest that this could be beneficial in the field of human rights in childbirth.	[Lokugamage, A.

J	Adebowale, SA; Morakinyo, OM; Ana, GR				Adebowale, Stephen Ayo; Morakinyo, Oyewale Mayowa; Ana, Godson Rowland			Housing materials as predictors of under-five mortality in Nigeria: evidence from 2013 demographic and health survey	BMC PEDIATRICS			English	Article						Housing materials; Under-five mortality; Nigeria	INDOOR AIR-POLLUTION; COCKROACH ALLERGEN; CHILD HEALTH; EXPOSURE; DETERMINANTS; INEQUITIES; MIGRATION; COMMUNITY; DEATH; AREA	Background: Nigeria is among countries with high Under-Five Mortality (U5M) rates worldwide. Both maternal and childhood factors have been linked to U5M in the country. However, despite the growing global recognition of the association between housing and quality of life, the role of housing materials as predictors of U5M remain largely unexplored in Nigeria. This study, therefore, investigated the relationship between housing materials and U5M in Nigeria. Methods: The study utilised the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data. A representative sample of 40,680 households was selected for the survey. The sample included 18,516 women of reproductive age who had given birth in the past 5 years prior the survey; with attention on the survival status of the index child (the most recent delivery). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square, Cox-proportional hazard and Brass 2-parameter models (a = 0.05). Results: The hazard ratio of U5M was 1.46 (C.I = 1.02-1.47, p < 0.001) and 1.23 (C.I = 1.24-1.71, p < 0.001) higher among children who lived in houses built with inadequate and moderate housing materials respectively than those in good housing materials. Under-five deaths show a downward trend (slope = -0.4871) relative to the housing materials assessment score. The refined U5M rate was 143.5, 127.0 and 90.8 per 1000 live birth among women who live in houses built with inadequate, moderate and adequate housing materials respectively. Other predictors of U5M were; the size of the child at birth, preceding birth interval, prenatal care provider, residence and education. Under-five death reduces with increasing maternal level of; education, wealth quintile, media exposure and housing material type and mostly experienced by Muslim women (6.0%), rural women (6.5%) and women residence in the North-West geopolitical zones (6.9%). Conclusions: Living in houses built with poor housing materials promoted U5M in Nigeria. Provision of sustainable housing by the government and the maintenance of existing housing stock to healthful conditions will play a significant role in reducing the burden of U5M in Nigeria.

J	Salvador-Piedrafita, M; Malmusi, D; Borrell, C				Salvador-Piedrafita, Maria; Malmusi, Davide; Borrell, Carme			Time trends in health inequalities due to care in the context of the Spanish Dependency Law	GACETA SANITARIA			English	Article						Carer; Health inequalities; Gender; Mental health; Public policy; Self-rated health	INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; INFORMAL CAREGIVERS; GENDER INEQUALITIES; SOCIAL-CLASS; SPAIN; SPOUSAL; REGIMES; CRISIS; ADULTS	Objective: In Spain, responsibility for care of old people and those in situations of dependency is assumed by families, and has an unequal social distribution according to gender and socioeconomic level. This responsibility has negative health effects on the carer. In 2006, the Dependency Law recognised the obligation of the State to provide support. This study analyses time trends in health inequalities attributable to caregiving under this new law. Methods: Study of trends using two cross-sectional samples from the 2006 and 2012 editions of the Spanish National Health Survey (27,922 and 19,995 people, respectively). We compared fair/poor self rated health, poor mental health (GHQ-12 >2), back pain, and the use of psychotropic drugs between non-carers, carers sharing care with other persons, and those providing care alone. We obtain prevalence ratios by fitting robust Poisson regression models. Results: We observed no change in the social profile of carers according to gender or social class. Among women, the difference in all health indicators between carers and non-carers tended to decrease among those sharing care but not among lone carers. Inequalities tend to decrease slightly in both groups of men carers. Conclusions: Between 2006 and 2012, trends in health inequalities attributable to informal care show different trends according to gender and share of responsibility. It is necessary to redesign and implement policies to reduce inequalities that take into account the most affected groups, such as women lone carers. Policies that strengthen the fair social distribution of care should also be adopted. (C) 2016 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

J	Burgess, RA				Burgess, Rochelle Ann			Policy, power, stigma and silence: Exploring the complexities of a primary mental health care model in a rural South African setting	TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						ethnography; global mental health; primary health care; South Africa; women's mental health	COMMUNITY; UNDERSTANDINGS; SURVIVORS; INEQUITY; SERVICES; CHILDREN; RECOVERY; PROGRAM; PEOPLE; NURSES	The Movement for Global Mental Health's (MGMH) efforts to scale up the availability of mental health services have been moderately successful. Investigations in resource-poor countries like South Africa have pointed to the value of an integrated primary mental health care model and multidisciplinary collaboration to support mental health needs in underserved and underresourced communities. However, there remains a need to explore how these policies play out within the daily realities of communities marked by varied environmental and relational complexities. Arguably, the lived realities of mental health policy and service delivery processes are best viewed through ethnographic approaches, which remain underutilised in the field of global mental health. This paper reports on findings from a case study of mental health services for HIV-affected women in a rural South African setting, which employed a motivated ethnography in order to explore the realities of the primary mental health care model and related policies in South Africa. Findings highlighted the influence of three key symbolic (intangible) factors that impact on the efficacy of the primary mental health care model: power dynamics, which shaped relationships within multidisciplinary teams; stigma, which limited the efficacy of task-shifting strategies; and the silencing of women's narratives of distress within services. The resultant gap between policy ideals and the reality of practice is discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations for building on existing successes in the delivery of primary mental health care in South Africa.

J	Dorlach, T				Dorlach, Tim			The AKP between populism and neoliberalism: lessons from pharmaceutical policy	NEW PERSPECTIVES ON TURKEY			English	Article						AKP; populism; neoliberalism; pharmaceutical policy; health policy	POLITICAL-ECONOMY; DEVELOPMENT PARTY; HEALTH-POLICY; LATIN-AMERICA; TURKEY; TRANSFORMATION; JUSTICE; REFORMS; REGIME; RISE	In September 2009, Turkey experienced a major reform of its pharmaceutical expenditure and price policy. By introducing a global budget, Turkey saved some 20 billion TL in public pharmaceutical expenditure in the 2010-2012 period. The lion's share of this was achieved by introducing stricter price controls that reduced the profit margins of pharmaceutical producers and distributors (the populist policy solution), rather than by privatizing the cost of medicines through, for example, raising out-of-pocket payments (the neoliberal policy solution). This is a puzzle, given the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi, AKP) government's usual preference for lenient and business-friendly regulation. This article explains the policy reform with reference to (i) the pronounced electoral interests of the AKP's political leadership in not substantially reducing access to public health services, (ii) the absence of powerful business interests in high medicine prices, and (iii) the absence of a developmentalist commitment to an industrial policy strategy for the pharmaceutical sector. This case study holds important lessons for scholars of Turkish politics. It suggests that externally the AKP's economic and social policies are driven by the interests of its two major constituencies (namely, lower-class voters and "Anatolian capital"), while internally they are shaped by two camps of policy makers (namely, neoliberal-minded technocrats and election-focused party leaders).

The magnitude and pattern of changes in weather and climate variables are creating differential exposures, vulnerabilities, and health risks that increase stress on health systems while exacerbating existing and creating new health inequities. Examples from national and local health adaptation projects highlight that developing partnerships across sectors and levels are critical for building climate-resilient health systems and communities. Strengthening current and implementing new health interventions, such as using environmental information to develop early warning systems, can be effective in protecting the most vulnerable. However, not all projected risks of climate change can be avoided by climate policies and programs, so health system strengthening is also critical. Applying a health inequity lens can reduce current vulnerabilities while building resilience to longer-term climate change. Taking inequities into account is critical if societies are to effectively prepare for and manage the challenges ahead.

In regions with scarce resources, fragile or fragmented health systems, cancer contributes to the cycle of poverty. Proven and cost-effective interventions are available for both these common cancers, yet for so many women access to these is beyond reach. These inequities highlight the urgent need in low-income and middle-income countries for sustainable investments in the entire continuum of cancer control, from prevention to palliative care, and in the development of high-quality population-based cancer registries. In this first paper of the Series on health, equity, and women's cancers, we describe the burden of breast and cervical cancer, with an emphasis on global and regional trends in incidence, mortality, and survival, and the consequences, especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged women in different settings.

We also explore indirect pathways-mother's education, health, and empowerment as well as community channels-operating from early marriage to child schooling and assess the presence of negative externalities for non early married mothers and their children on education transmission in communities with large rates of child marriage. In our econometric analysis we employ OLS, matching, instrumental variables, and pseudo-panel for a better understanding of changes over time. Our results show that early marriage is still a significant source of inequality, though its impact has decreased across time: girls born to early married mothers are between 6% and 11% more likely to never been to school and 1.6% and 1.7% to enter late, and 3.3% and 5.1% less likely to complete primary school, whereas boys are between 5.2% and 8.8% more likely to never been to school and 1% and 1.9% to enter late, and 2.3% and 5.5% less likely to complete primary school. Second, child marriage increases gender inequality within household's with girls losing an additional 0.07 years of schooling as compared to boys if born to early married mothers. Third, our estimates show that mother's education and health mediate some of the effect of early marriage and that the large prevalence of child marriage in a community also impairs educational transmission for non-early married mothers. Fourth, empowering of young wives can weaken other channels of transmission of education inequalities. Overall, our findings highlight the need to target these children with the appropriate interventions and support to achieve the greater focus on equity in the global post-2015 education agenda.

Balancing Equity and Advancement: The Role of Health Technology Assessment in Radiotherapy Resource Allocation	CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Cost-effectiveness; global health; health technology assessment; investment framework; low- and middle-income countries; radiotherapy	EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; CANCER CONTROL; BRACHYTHERAPY; STATE; COVERAGE; FOLLOW; MONEY; CARE	Radiotherapy is an essential modality for effective cancer control, yet enormous inequalities in access in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) have created one of the largest global technology gaps in medicine today. The Global Task Force on Radiotherapy for Cancer Control quantified this gap and showed that over half of patients worldwide do not have access to treatment. Governments, policy makers and the global health community have ignored this crisis due to the complexity of radiotherapy technology and its seemingly high upfront costs. However, understanding the cost of treatment in the context of a dramatic clinical benefit could help to demonstrate the feasibility of radiotherapy in diverse income settings. When there are scarce resources, such analysis is essential in order to set priorities and provide high-value interventions to large populations. Here we explore the current status of economic evaluation tools in LMICs and some of the barriers to their use. We describe how the concepts of health technology assessment, value-based care and investment frameworks can be applied to the global crisis of radiotherapy availability to guide appropriate capacity building and resource utilisation. The development of local expertise in these health economic tools can be a powerful level to improve cancer care in LMICs and to build universal global access to radiotherapy.

This is particularly true for radiotherapy, for which the global disparity is one of the largest in healthcare today. New models and paradigms and non-traditional collaborations have been proposed to improve global equity in cancer control. We describe recent initiatives from within the radiation oncology community to increase access to treatment, build the low-and middle-income countries' radiation oncology workforce, mobilise more professionals from within high-income countries and raise awareness of the global need for equitable cancer care.

J	Pinilla, J; Abásolo, I				Pinilla, Jaime; Abasolo, Ignacio			The effect of policies regulating tobacco consumption on smoking initiation and cessation in Spain: is it equal across socioeconomic groups?	Tobacco Induced Diseases			English	Article						Tobacco regulation; Socioeconomic groups; Smoking initiation and cessation; Smoking bans; National health survey; Spain	4 COUNTRY SURVEY; EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; SOCIAL INEQUALITIES; HEALTH; BEHAVIORS; PRICE; POPULATIONS; LIKELIHOOD	Background: In Spain, the Law 28/2005, which came into effect on January 2006, was a turning point in smoking regulation and prevention, serving as a guarantee for the progress of future strategies in the direction marked by international organizations. It is expected that this regulatory policy should benefit relatively more to lower socioeconomic groups, thus contributing to a reduction in socioeconomic health inequalities. This research analyzes the effect of tobacco regulation in Spain, under Law 28/2005, on the initiation and cessation of tobacco consumption, and whether this effect has been unequal across distinct socioeconomic levels. Methods: Micro-data from the National Health Survey in its 2006 and 2011 editions are used (study numbers: 4382 and 5389 respectively; inventory of statistical operations (ISO) code: 54009), with a sample size of approximately 24,000 households divided into 2,000 census areas. This allows individuals' tobacco consumption records to be reconstructed over five years before the initiation of each survey, as well as identifying those individuals that started or stopped smoking. The methodology is based on "time to event analysis". Cox's proportional hazard models are adapted to show the effects of a set of explanatory variables on the conditional probability of change in tobacco consumption: initiation as a daily smoker by young people or the cessation of daily smoking by adults. Results: Initiation rates among young people went from 25% (95% confidence interval (CI), 23-27) to 19% (95% CI, 17-21) following the implementation of the Law, and the change in cessation rates among smokers was even greater, with rates increasing from 12% (95% CI, 11-13) to 20% (95% CI, 19-21). However, this effect has not been equal by socioeconomic groups as shown by relative risks. Before the regulation policy, social class was not a statistically significant factor in the initiation of daily smoking (p > 0.05); however, following the implementation of the Law, young people belonging to social classes IV-V and VI had a relative risk of starting smoking 63% (p = 0.03) and 82% (p = 0.02) higher than young people of higher social classes I-II. On the other hand, lower social class also means a lower probability of smoking cessation; however, the relative risk of cessation for a smoker belonging to a household of social class VI (compared to classes I-II) went from 24% (p < 0.001) lower before the Law to 33% (p < 0.001) lower following the law's implementation. Conclusion: Law 28/2005 has been effective, as after its promulgation there has been a decrease in the rate of smoking initiation among young people and an increase in the rate of cessation among adult smokers. However, this effect has not been equal by socioeconomic groups, favoring relatively more to those individuals belonging to higher social classes.

In 2006, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) outlined the global necessity to meet the rehabilitation needs of people with disabilities, but this goal is often challenged by the undersupply and inequitable distribution of rehabilitation workers. While the aggregate study and monitoring of the physical rehabilitation workforce has been mostly ignored by researchers or policy-makers, this paper aims to present the 'challenges and opportunities' for guiding further long-term research and policies on developing the relatively neglected, highly heterogeneous physical rehabilitation workforce. Methods: The challenges were identified through a two-phased investigation. Phase 1: critical review of the rehabilitation workforce literature, organized by the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (AAAQ) framework. Phase 2: integrate reviewed data into a SWOT framework to identify the strengths and opportunities to be maximized and the weaknesses and threats to be overcome. Results: The critical review and SWOT analysis have identified the following global situation: (i) needs-based shortages and lack of access to rehabilitation workers, particularly in lower income countries and in rural/remote areas; (ii) deficiencies in the data sources and monitoring structures; and (iii) few exemplary innovations, of both national and international scope, that may help reduce supply-side shortages in underserved areas. Discussion: Based on the results, we have prioritized the following 'Six Rehab-Workforce Challenges': (1) monitoring supply requirements: accounting for rehabilitation needs and demand; (2) supply data sources: the need for structural improvements; (3) ensuring the study of a whole rehabilitation workforce (i.e. not focused on single professions), including across service levels; (4) staffing underserved locations: the rising of education, attractiveness and teleservice; (5) adapt policy options to different contexts (e.g. rural vs urban), even within a country; and (6) develop international solutions, within an interdependent world. Conclusions: Concrete examples of feasible local, global and research action toward meeting the Six Rehab-Workforce Challenges are provided. Altogether, these may help advance a policy and research agenda for ensuring that an adequate rehabilitation workforce can meet the current and future rehabilitation health needs.

We test 53 micro variables using extreme bound analysis on a pooled cross-section data from the World Value Survey representing 98 countries between 1989 and 2014. Several standard variables frequently included in SWB regressions are controlled for. The test variables are broadly categorized as demographic, personal-economic, individual traits and values, social attitudes and collectivism, social relationships and perceptions of control. We find subjective health status, household income rank, family savings, religiosity, most perceptions of control and several social attitudes and collectivism measures to be universal LS determinants. Generally, the determinants of LS vary by a country's level of economic development. In particular, we provide suggestive evidence that as countries develop, certain needs are satisfied and stop being important contributors to LS while others take their place.

J	Carapinha, JL				Carapinha, Joao L.			A comparative review of the pharmacoeconomic guidelines in South Africa	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS			English	Review						South Africa; Pharmacoeconomics; Comparative review; National health insurance; Research practice standards ISPOR; Pharmaceutical pricing		Objective: To compare the pharmacoeconomic guidelines in South Africa (SA) with other middle-and high-income countries. Methods: A comparative review of key features of the pharmacoeconomic guidelines in SA was undertaken using the Comparative Table of Pharmacoeconomic Guidelines developed by the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, and published country-level pharmacoeconomics guidelines. A random sample of guidelines in high-and middle-income countries were analyzed if data on all key features were available. Key features of the pharmacoeconomic guidelines in SA were compared with those in other countries, and divergent features were identified and elaborated. Results: Five upper middle-income countries (Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Malaysia, and Mexico), one lower middle-income country (Egypt), and six high-income countries (Germany, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Taiwan, and the Netherlands) were analyzed. The pharmacoeconomic guidelines in SA differ in important areas when compared with other countries. In SA, the study perspective and costs are limited to private health-insurance companies, complex modelling is discouraged and models require pre-approval, equity issues are not explicitly stated, a budget impact analysis is not required, and pharmacoeconomic submissions are voluntary. Conclusions: Future updates to the pharmacoeconomic guidelines in SA may include a societal perspective with limitations, incentivize complex and transparent models, and integrate equity issues. The pharmacoeconomic guidelines could be improved by addressing conflicting objectives with policies on National Health Insurance, incentivize private health insurance companies to disclose reimbursement data, and require the inclusion of a budget impact analysis in all pharmacoeconomic submissions. Further research is also needed on the impact of mandatory pharmacoeconomic submissions in middle-income countries.

Given the critical role of research to determine what works, we aimed to identify research gaps as part of a broader priority setting exercise on integrating gender equality and human rights approaches in SRH programmes and policies. A systematic literature review of reviews was conducted to examine the question: what do we know about how research in the context of SRH programmes and policies has addressed gender equality and human rights and what are the current gaps in research. We searched three data-bases for reviews that addressed the research question, were published between 19942014, and met methodological standards for systematic reviews, qualitative meta-syntheses and other reviews of relevance to the research question. Additional grey literature was identified based on expert input. Articles were appraised by the primary author and examined by an expert panel. An abstraction and thematic analysis process was used to synthesize findings. Of the 3,073 abstracts identified, 56 articles were reviewed in full and 23 were included along with 10 from the grey literature. The majority focused on interventions addressing gender inequalities; very few reviews explicitly included human rights based interventions. Across both topics, weak study designs and use of intermediate outcome measures limited evidence quality. Further, there was limited evidence on interventions that addressed marginalized groups. Better quality studies, longer-term indicators, and measurement of unintended consequences are needed to better understand the impact of these types of interventions on SRH outcomes. Further efforts are needed to cover research on gender equality and human rights issues as they pertain to a broader set of SRH topics and populations.

Health, Social, and Economic Variables Associated with Depression Among Older People in Low and Middle Income Countries: World Health Organization Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						depression; geriatric psychiatry; developing countries; socioeconomic factors	ELDERLY PERSONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVALENCE; DETERMINANTS; EXPENDITURE; DISORDERS; PROGNOSIS; SYMPTOMS; DISEASES; POVERTY	Objective: Although depression among older people is an important public health problem worldwide, systematic studies evaluating its prevalence and determinants in low and middle income countries (LMICs) are sparse. The biopsychosocial model of depression and prevailing socioeconomic hardships for older people in LMICs have provided the impetus to determine the prevalence of geriatric depression; to study its associations with health, social, and economic variables; and to investigate socioeconomic inequalities in depression prevalence in LMICs. Methods: The authors accessed the World Health Organization Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health Wave 1 data that studied nationally representative samples from six large LMICs (N = 14,877). A computerized algorithm derived depression diagnoses. The authors assessed hypothesized associations using survey multivariate logistic regression models for each LMIC and pooled their risk estimates by meta-analyses and investigated related socioeconomic inequalities using concentration indices. Results: Cross-national prevalence of geriatric depression was 4.7% (95% CI: 1.9%-11.9%). Female gender, illiteracy, poverty, indebtedness, past informal-sector occupation, bereavement, angina, and stroke had significant positive associations, whereas pension support and health insurance showed significant negative associations with geriatric depression. Pro-poor inequality of geriatric depression were documented in five LMICs. Conclusions: Socioeconomic factors and related inequalities may predispose, precipitate, or perpetuate depression among older people in LMICs. Relative absence of health safety net places socioeconomically disadvantaged older people in LMICs at risk. The need for population-based public health interventions and policies to prevent and to manage geriatric depression effectively in LMICs cannot be overemphasized.

Assistive Technology in Australia: Integrating theory and evidence into action	AUSTRALIAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY JOURNAL			English	Article						assistive technology; disability policy; ICF; occupational therapy; outcomes measurement	OUTCOMES; PERSPECTIVES; MOBILITY	Background: Occupational therapists use a range of strategies to influence the relationship between person, environment and occupation and facilitate people's participation and inclusion in society. Technology is a fundamental environmental factor capable of enabling inclusion, and occupational therapy models articulate a role for assistive technology (AT) devices and services, but there is a gap between theory, research and practice. The context of AT provision in Australia presents systemic barriers that prevent optimal application of AT devices and services for societal health promotion and in individualised solutions. Methods: The Integrating Theory, Evidence and Action method (ITEA) was used to answer the question 'How can occupational therapy support AT provision to enable older people and people with disability?' A wide range of sources were systematically analysed to explore the complexities of AT provision in Australia. Results: The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and IMPACT(2) model are used as frameworks to reconstruct evidence into statements that summarise the theory, process and outcomes of AT provision. Analysis of the influence of the global disability rights and local policies and AT provision systems is used to highlight important aspects for occupational therapists to consider in research and practice. Pragmatic recommendations are provided to enable practitioners to translate theory and evidence into action. Conclusion: AT provision can be improved by focusing on evidence for and congruence between theory, process and outcomes, rather than isolated interventions. Occupational therapists should consider the influence of contextual factors on practice, and work with consumers to improve access and equity in AT provision systems.

J	Lougarre, C				Lougarre, Claire			Using the Right to Health to Promote Universal Health Coverage: A Better Tool for Protecting Non-Nationals' Access to Affordable Health Care?	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								Five years ago, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on universal health coverage, followed a year later by a resolution from the United Nations General Assembly. In these resolutions, states promised to deliver affordable health care for everyone, referring to notions of equity and human rights law, particularly a human right to health. However, the explosion of migration coupled with the post-2008 bleak economic climate have led societies worldwide to restrict, or at least challenge, the affordability of access to national health systems for non-nationals. It is in this light that the claims of universality made by universal health coverage should be challenged. This article, therefore, will question the effectiveness of this global health policy in guaranteeing access to affordable health care for non-nationals and will ask whether and how legal avenues such as the right to health should be used to address potential weaknesses.

J	Gómez, EJ				Gomez, Eduardo J.			Confronting Health Inequalities in the BRICS: Political Institutions, Foreign Policy Aspirations and State-civil Societal Relationships	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; AFRICA; CHINA; AIDS	The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) have emerged as potentially robust economies with considerable international influence. Nevertheless, essentially all of these nations have fallen short of simultaneously developing strong economies and health care systems, contributing to the emergence of health care inequalities, such as inadequate access to medicine, health care treatment and out-of-pocket spending. This is puzzling considering that most of these nations' economies burgeoned during the 1990s and early-2000s, thus potentially providing additional revenue for health care spending, while constitutional guarantees of universal access to health care and the presence of democratic electoral institutions in most nations should have incentivized governments to successfully address these inequality issues. Nevertheless, with the exception of South Africa, this study finds that waning political commitment to health care spending, increased foreign aid commitments and tenuous state-civil societal relationships accounted for these ongoing inequality challenges.

This focus repeatedly excluded marginalized ethnic and linguistic minorities, including people of refugee backgrounds and other vulnerable non-nationals that resided within a States' borders. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to be truly transformative by being made operational in all countries, and applied to all, nationals and non-nationals alike. Global migration and its diffuse impact has intensified due to escalating conflicts and the growing violence in war-torn Syria, as well as in many countries in Africa and in Central America. This massive migration and the thousands of refugees crossing borders in search for safety led to the creation of two-tiered, ad hoc, refugee health care systems that have added to the sidelining of non-nationals in MDG-reporting frameworks. Conclusion: We have identified four ways to promote the protection of vulnerable non-nationals' health and well being in States' application of the post-2015 SDG framework: In setting their own post-2015 indicators the UN Member States should explicitly identify vulnerable migrants, refugees, displaced persons and other marginalized groups in the content of such indicators. Our second recommendation is that statisticians from different agencies, including the World Health Organization's Gender, Equity and Human Rights programme should be actively involved in the formulation of SDG indicators at both the global and country level. In addition, communities, civil society and health justice advocates should also vigorously engage in country's formulation of post-2015 indicators. Finally, we advocate that the inclusion of non-nationals be anchored in the international human right to health, which in turn requires appropriate financing allocations as well as robust monitoring and evaluation processes that can hold technocratic decision-makers accountable for progress.

Valdemar			Multidimensional poverty and catastrophic health spending in the mountainous regions of Myanmar, Nepal and India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Multidimensional poverty; Catastrophic health spending; India; Nepal; Myanmar	SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; CARE; COUNTRIES; POOR; IMPOVERISHMENT; EXPENDITURE; PAYMENTS; DISEASE; BURDEN	Background: Economic burden to households due to out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) is large in many Asian countries. Though studies suggest increasing household poverty due to high OOPE in developing countries, studies on association of multidimensional poverty and household health spending is limited. This paper tests the hypothesis that the multidimensionally poor are more likely to incur catastrophic health spending cutting across countries. Data and methods: Data from the Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA) Survey carried out by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has been used in the analyses. The PVA survey was a comprehensive household survey that covered the mountainous regions of India, Nepal and Myanmar. A total of 2647 households from India, 2310 households in Nepal and 4290 households in Myanmar covered under the PVA survey. Poverty is measured in a multidimensional framework by including the dimensions of education, income and energy, water and sanitation using the Alkire and Foster method. Health shock is measured using the frequency of illness, family sickness and death of any family member in a reference period of one year. Catastrophic health expenditure is defined as 40% above the household's capacity to pay. Results: Results suggest that about three-fifths of the population in Myanmar, two-fifths of the population in Nepal and one-third of the population in India are multidimensionally poor. About 47% of the multidimensionally poor in India had incurred catastrophic health spending compared to 35% of the multidimensionally non-poor and the pattern was similar in both Nepal and Myanmar. The odds of incurring catastrophic health spending was 56% more among the multidimensionally poor than among the multidimensionally non-poor [95% CI: 1.35-1.76]. While health shocks to households are consistently significant predictors of catastrophic health spending cutting across country of residence, the educational attainment of the head of the household is not significant. Conclusion: The multidimensionally poor in the poorer regions are more likely to face health shocks and are less likely to afford professional health services. Increasing government spending on health and increasing households' access to health insurance can reduce catastrophic health spending and multidimensional poverty.

In this article, we will critically examine aspects of globalisation and the relationships between health inequalities and social inequalities and the implications for social work practice. Giles called on social workers to develop a health equality imagination'; however, the challenge for practitioners on a day-to-day basis is how to integrate such an imagination into their work. A number of suggested approaches towards a greater engagement in addressing health inequalities in social work practice, education and research are also presented.

J	Pratt, B; Hyder, AA				Pratt, Bridget; Hyder, Adnan A.			How can health systems research reach the worst-off? A conceptual exploration	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Review							JUSTICE	Background: Health systems research is increasingly being conducted in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Such research should aim to reduce health disparities between and within countries as a matter of global justice. For such research to do so, ethical guidance that is consistent with egalitarian theories of social justice proposes it ought to (amongst other things) focus on worst-off countries and research populations. Yet who constitutes the worst-off is not well-defined. Methods and Results: By applying existing work on disadvantage from political philosophy, the paper demonstrates that (at least) two options exist for how to define the worst-off upon whom equity-oriented health systems research should focus: those who are worst-off in terms of health or those who are systematically disadvantaged. The paper describes in detail how both concepts can be understood and what metrics can be relied upon to identify worst-off countries and research populations at the sub-national level (groups, communities). To demonstrate how each can be used, the paper considers two real-world cases of health systems research and whether their choice of country (Uganda, India) and research population in 2011 would have been classified as amongst the worst-off according to the proposed concepts. Conclusions: The two proposed concepts can classify different countries and sub-national populations as worst-off. It is recommended that health researchers (or other actors) should use the concept that best reflects their moral commitments-namely, to perform research focused on reducing health inequalities or systematic disadvantage more broadly. If addressing the latter, it is recommended that they rely on the multidimensional poverty approach rather than the income approach to identify worst-off populations.

The necessity to distinguish between the notions factors affecting mortality rates and factors affecting mortality (longevity) is specified. Mortality rates are significantly affected by demographic processes (birth rate, mortality, migration), while mortality depends on a complex of factors, the significance of each of which is still undetermined and, in the opinion of the authors, varies substantially in various populations depending on combinations of these factors.

This paper sheds light on the environmental factors that influence gender and HIV activities in this context. A multisite ethnographic study including 150 hours of participant observation and 32 in-depth interviews was conducted with 26 NGOs carrying out gender and HIV prevention interventions. Using thematic network analysis, 108 different intervention activities were identified, categorised and further analysed to explore environmental factors that influence the design and delivery of these activities. The findings highlight how practitioners draw on different theories of change about how to address the gender inequalities that contribute to HIV risk and vulnerability, which in turn influence the way interventions are delivered. Despite these theoretical differences, commonalities arise in practitioners' use of popular narratives about the right to health and lived experiences of AIDS to ensure interventions are contextually relevant and to gain buy-in from participants. Other environmental factors influencing intervention activities include the role that insecure funding for gender plays in undermining the capacity of practitioners to design interventions based on their local knowledge and experience by forcing NGOs to adapt to the priorities of international donors.

These groups were cross tabulated with primary diagnoses, types of plans to support RTW, as well as categories of social functioning and motivation, for which sensitivity and specificity scores in detecting work disability were calculated.Results: Only about half of the jobseekers had good work ability, 27% were found unable to work in the open labour market and 15% even eligible for a disability pension. For 20%, care or rehabilitation was seen necessary to enable RTW. Poor supervisor- and self-rated performance at work or poor social functioning appeared as sensitive measures in detecting work disability.Conclusions: Work disabilities and unmet needs for health care and rehabilitation are highly prevalent among jobseekers, as depicted using a multidimensional work ability assessment procedure inspired by the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). Further development of work ability assessment practices is clearly needed.

J	Antioch, KM; Drummond, MF; Niessen, LW; Vondeling, H				Antioch, Kathryn M.; Drummond, Michael F.; Niessen, Louis W.; Vondeling, Hindrik			International lessons in new methods for grading and integrating cost effectiveness evidence into clinical practice guidelines	COST EFFECTIVENESS AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION			English	Review							CRITERIA DECISION-ANALYSIS; PRACTICES TASK-FORCE; HEALTH; QUALITY; CHECKLIST; DRUGS	Economic evidence is influential in health technology assessment world-wide. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) can enable economists to include economic information on health care provision. Application of economic evidence in CPGs, and its integration into clinical practice and national decision making is hampered by objections from professions, paucity of economic evidence or lack of policy commitment. The use of state-of-art economic methodologies will improve this. Economic evidence can be graded by 'checklists' to establish the best evidence for decision making given methodological rigor. New economic evaluation checklists, Multi-Criteria Decision Analyses (MCDA) and other decision criteria enable health economists to impact on decision making world-wide. We analyse the methodologies for integrating economic evidence into CPG agencies globally, including the Agency of Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) in the USA, National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Australian political reforms. The Guidelines and Economists Network International (GENI) Board members from Australia, UK, Canada and Denmark presented the findings at the conference of the International Health Economists Association (IHEA) and we report conclusions and developments since. The Consolidated Guidelines for the Reporting of Economic Evaluations (CHEERS) 24 item check list can be used by AHRQ, NHMRC, other CPG and health organisations, in conjunction with the Drummond ten-point check list and a questionnaire that scores that checklist for grading studies, when assessing economic evidence. Cost-effectiveness Analysis (CEA) thresholds, opportunity cost and willingness-to-pay (WTP) are crucial issues for decision rules in CEA generally, including end-of-life therapies. Limitations of inter-rater reliability in checklists can be addressed by including more than one assessor to reach a consensus, especially when impacting on treatment decisions. We identify priority areas to generate economic evidence for CPGs by NHMRC, AHRQ, and other agencies. The evidence may cover demand for care issues such as involved time, logistics, innovation price, price sensitivity, substitutes and complements, WTP, absenteeism and presentism. Supply issues may include economies of scale, efficiency changes, and return on investment. Involved equity and efficiency measures may include cost-ofillness, disease burden, quality-of-life, budget impact, cost-effective ratios, net benefits and disparities in access and outcomes. Priority setting remains essential and trade-off decisions between policy criteria can be based on MCDA, both in evidence based clinical medicine and in health planning.

The target group is patients of working age with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), expected to return to work or remain at work after rehabilitation. Much attention in the evaluations has been on patient outcomes and on processes. We lack knowledge about how factors related to health care providers and community can have an impact on how patients have access to MMR. The aim of this study was therefore to study the impact of health care provider and community related factors on referrals to MMR in patients with MSD applying for health care in primary health care. Methods: This was a primary health care-based cohort study based on prospectively ascertained register data. All primary health care centres (PHCC) contracted in Region Skane in 2010-2012, referring to MMR were included (n = 153). The health care provider factors studied were: community size, PHCC size, public or private PHCC, whether or not the PHCCs provided their own MMR, burden of illness and the community socioeconomic status among the registered population at the PHCCs. The results are presented with descriptive statistics and for the analysis, non-parametric and multiple linear regression analyses were applied. Results: PHCCs located in larger communities sent more referrals/1000 registered population (p = 0.020). Private PHCCs sent more referrals/1000 registered population compared to public units (p = 0.035). Factors related to more MMR referrals/1000 registered population in the multiple regression analyses were PHCCs located in medium and large communities and with above average socioeconomic status among the registered population at the PHCCs, private PHCC and PHCCs providing their own MMR. The explanation degree for the final model was 24.5%. Conclusions: We found that referral rates to MMR were positively associated with PHCCs located in medium and large sized communities with higher socioeconomic status among the registered population, private PHCCs and PHCCs providing their own MMR. Patients with MSD are thus facing significant inequities and were thus not offered the same opportunities for referrals to rehabilitation regardless of which PHCC they visited.

The Grandest Challenge of All: The Role of Environmental Engineering to Achieve Sustainability in the World's Developing Regions	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						environment; global competency; greenhouse gas; hygiene; sanitation; sustainable development; water	WATER-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; WASTE-WATER; DRINKING-WATER; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS; SMALL CITIES; SOLID-WASTE; SANITATION; RECOVERY	The environmental engineering discipline has focused much of its historical efforts in developing regions of the world on advancing environmental sustainability through improving provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. However, the skills and expertise that reside within the discipline of environmental engineering are fundamental to achieve a much broader range of sustainable development goals, including those related to health, climate, water, energy, and food security; economic development; and reduction of social inequalities. Accordingly, this article critically reviews several focus areas where environmental engineering should assume a more active presence in the global community that seeks to achieve sustainability in developing regions of the world. The 10 environmental engineering Grand Challenges for the developing world covered are: (1) understand the historical perspective of the discipline's connection with public health as the field transitions forward; (2) integrate the differences encountered when operating over rural to urban locations; (3) address emissions of greenhouse gases and other important carbon-containing pollutants; (4) understand the link between development and health to better connect health outcomes and reduction in risk with ecosystem management and other development interventions; (5) address the complex interactions of water energy systems; (6) integrate the synergy inherent in development/sustainability goals of WASH, food security, and resource recovery; (7) transition to a green economy; (8) advance monitoring, evaluation, and assessment activities that include life cycle assessment, (9) integrate culture, perception, and behavior with advances in science and technology, and (10) educate globally competent engineers. Our hope is that this discussion leads to a better world through monumental improvements in the environment and human well-being and drives new innovations and opportunities in research, education, practice, and service.

This study used the concept of liminality to explore the experiences of a group of women breastfeeding long-term in the United Kingdom, building on Mahon-Daly and Andrews. Over 80 breastfeeding women were included within the study, which used micro-ethnographic methods (participant observation in breastfeeding support groups, face-to-face interviews and online asynchronous interviews via email). Findings about women's experiences are congruent with the existing literature, although it is mostly dated and from outside the United Kingdom. Liminality was found to be useful in providing insight into women's experiences of long-term breastfeeding in relation to both time and place. Understanding women's experience of breastfeeding beyond current usual norms can be used to inform work with breastfeeding mothers and to encourage more women to breastfeed for longer.

Its aim was to evaluate the implementation of quality indicators for headache care Europe-wide in specialist headache centres (level-3 according to the EHF/LTB standard). Methods: Employing previously-developed instruments in 14 such centres, we made enquiries, in each, of health-care providers (doctors, nurses, psychologists, physiotherapists) and 50 patients, and analysed the medical records of 50 other patients. Enquiries were in 9 domains: diagnostic accuracy, individualized management, referral pathways, patient's education and reassurance, convenience and comfort, patient's satisfaction, equity and efficiency of the headache care, outcome assessment and safety. Results: Our study showed that highly experienced headache centres treated their patients in general very well. The centres were content with their work and their patients were content with their treatment. Including disability and quality-of-life evaluations in clinical assessments, and protocols regarding safety, proved problematic: better standards for these are needed. Some centres had problems with follow-up: many specialised centres operated in one-touch systems, without possibility of controlling long-term management or the success of treatments dependent on this. Conclusions: This first Europe-wide quality study showed that the quality indicators were workable in specialist care. They demonstrated common trends, producing evidence of what is majority practice. They also uncovered deficits that might be remedied in order to improve quality. They offer the means of setting benchmarks against which service quality may be judged. The next step is to take the evaluation process into non-specialist care (EHF/LTB levels 1 and 2).

The first part describes the incorporation of abortion rights in international human rights documents and in the opinions and reports of human rights bodies. The second part discusses why courts increasingly cite human rights texts in national opinions, noting courts' invocation of universal values, consensus on limited abortion permission, and state duties to protect women's rights. The third part examines on-the-ground obstacles to implementing court judgments and national abortion laws. This essay argues that human rights reasoning, rooted in claims to universalism and modernity, may minimize the problems that follow legal change, particularly in places with weak health-care infrastructures. The conclusion considers public health law research that keeps in view the differences among countries' health-care systems.

Methods: Using the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (2005-2014) in 45 Gavi-supported countries, we measured inequalities in vaccination coverage across seven dimensions of social stratification and of vulnerability to poor health outcomes. We quantified inequalities using pairwise comparisons (risk differences and ratios) and whole spectrum measures (slope and relative indices of inequality). To contrast measurement approaches, we pooled the estimates using random-effects meta-analyses, ranked countries by the magnitude of inequality and compared agreement in country ranks. Results: At the aggregate level, maternal education, multidimensional poverty, and wealth index poverty were the dimensions associated with the largest inequalities. In 36 out of 45 countries, inequalities were substantial, with a difference in coverage of 10 percentage points or more between the top and bottom of at least one of these social dimensions. Important inequalities by child sex, child malnutrition and urban/ rural residence were also found in a smaller set of countries. The magnitude of inequality and ranking of countries differed across dimension and depending on the measure used. Pairwise comparisons could not be estimated in certain countries. The slope and relative indices of inequality were estimated in all countries and produced more stable country rankings, and should thus facilitate more reliable international comparisons. Conclusions: Inequalities in vaccination coverage persist in a large majority of Gavi-supported countries. Inequalities should be monitored across multiple dimensions of vulnerability. Using whole spectrum measures to quantify inequality across multiple ordered social groups has important advantages. We illustrate these findings using an equity dashboard designed to support decision-making in the Sustainable Development Goals period. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigated whether birth weight and other factors are determinants of neonatal BCG vaccination in order to identify infants underserved by vaccination. Methods We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted ORs (AORs) for the association between birth weight (categorised as non-low birth weight (NLBW) (>= 2.50 kg) and low birth weight (LBW) (2-2.49 kg, 1.50-1.99 kg and <1.50 kg)) and non-vaccination with BCG at the end of the neonatal period (0-27 days). We assessed whether this association varied by place of delivery and infant illness. We calculated how BCG timing and uptake would improve by ensuring the vaccination of all facility-born infants prior to discharge. Results There was a strong dose-response relationship between LBW and not receiving BCG in the neonatal period (p-trend< 0.0001). Infants weighing 1.50-1.99 kg had odds of non-vaccination 1.6 times (AOR 1.64; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.08), and those weighing < 1.50 kg 2.4 times (AOR 2.42; 95% CI 1.50 to 3.88) those of NLBW infants. Other determinants included place of delivery, distance to the health facility and socioeconomic status. Neither place of delivery nor infant illness modified the association between birth weight and vaccination (p-interaction all >0.19). Facility-born infants were vaccinated at a mean of 6 days, suggesting that they were not vaccinated in the facility at birth but were referred for vaccination. Conclusions LBW is a risk factor for neonatal under-vaccination, even for facility-born infants. Ensuring vaccination at facility births would substantively improve timing and equitable BCG vaccination.

BIOETHICS			English	Article						global justice; global health; reasonable availability; international research ethics; social value	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CLINICAL-RESEARCH; HEALTH; CARE; RESPONSIBILITY; REQUIREMENT; BENEFITS; JUSTICE; VIRUS	According to prominent bioethics scholars and international guidelines, researchers and sponsors have obligations to ensure that the products of their research are reasonably available to research participants and their communities. In other words, the claim is that research is unethical unless it has local social value. In this article, we argue that the existing conception of reasonable availability should be replaced with a social value obligation that extends to the global poor (and not just research participants and host communities). To the extent the social value requirement has been understood as geographically constrained to the communities that host research and the countries that can afford the products of research, it has neglected to include the global poor as members of the relevant society. We argue that a new conception of social value obligations is needed for two reasons. First, duties of global beneficence give reason for researchers, sponsors, and institutions to take steps to make their products more widely accessible. Second, public commitments made by many institutions acknowledge and engender responsibilities to make the products of research more accessible to the global poor. Future research is needed to help researchers and sponsors discharge these obligations in ways that unlock their full potential.

Standard clinical prevention and treatment is based on studies from the early antimicrobial era, as research investment halted soon after the virtual eradication of the disease from developed countries. The emergence of new global data on disease burden, new technologies, and a global health equity platform have revitalized interest and investment in RHD. This article surveys past and current evidence for standard RHD diagnosis and treatment, highlighting gaps in knowledge.

Methods: Data from the Fourth and Fifth Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey on 17,549 Korean adults aged 50 years or older were analyzed. The study design was cross-sectional. Tooth loss was defined as either edentulism (0 teeth) or severe tooth loss (< 20 teeth). Parental education, own education, and income were used as indicators of early childhood SEP, adolescent SEP, and adulthood SEP, respectively. The association between the lifecourse SEPs and tooth loss was estimated with three different lifecourse models: the independent impact model for three different lifecourse SEPs, the cumulative impact model using the sum of the three SEP scores, and the social mobility model using the pathway information of the three SEPs. The covariates were demographic factors and health behaviors. The prevalence ratios (PRs), slope index of inequality (SII), and relative index of inequality (RII) for tooth loss were estimated with log-binomial regression analyses. Results: In the independent impact model, significant associations of each SEP with edentulism (SII= 3.61%, 4.76%, 2.17% and RII= 1.67, 1.52, 1.41 for parental education, own education, and income, respectively) and severe tooth loss (SII= 8.03%, 17.73%, 12.73% and RII= 1.26, 1.72, 1.42 for parental education, own education, and income, respectively) were found after adjusting for all covariates. For the cumulative impact model, stepwise patterns of PRs according to the summed SEP scores were found. In addition, in the social mobility model, the PR of tooth loss was greatest in the persistently low SEP group over the life course (PR= 2.10 for edentulism and 2.33 for severe tooth loss). The other mobile groups in lifecourse SEPs also presented higher PRs of tooth loss than the persistently high SEP group. Conclusion: Parental education was independently associated with edentulism in later life, and own education showed the strongest associations with tooth loss. The cumulative and social mobility models for the social impacts of life course on oral health should be considered in oral epidemiological studies.

For progress in implementing the SDGs, ensuring policy coherence for sustainable development will be essential. We conducted a health impact assessment to identify potential incoherences between contemporary regional trade agreements (RTAs) and nutrition and health-related SDGs. Our findings suggest that obligations in RTAs may conflict with several of the SDGs. Areas of policy incoherence include the spread of unhealthy commodities, threats to equitable access to essential health services, medicines and vaccines, and reduced government regulatory flexibility. Scenarios for future incoherence are identified, with recommendations for how these can be avoided or mitigated. While recognising that governments have multiple policy objectives that may not always be coherent, we contend that states implementing the SDGs must give greater attention to ensure that binding trade agreements do not undermine the achievement of SDG targets.

In this paper we aim to use highly recent data (2014) to examine educational inequalities in risky health behaviour in 21 European countries from all regions of the continent to map cross-national variation in the extent to which educational level is associated with risky health behaviour. We focus on four dimensions of risky health behaviour: smoking, alcohol use, lack of physical activity and lack of fruit and vegetable consumption. Methods: We make use of recent data from the 7th wave of the European Social Survey (2014), which contains a special rotating module on the social determinants of health. We performed logistic regression analyses to examine the associations between educational level and the risky health behaviour indicators. Educational level was measured through a three-category version of the harmonized International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Results: Our findings show substantial and mostly significant inequalities in risky health behaviour between educational groups in most of the 21 European countries examined in this paper. The risk of being a daily smoker is higher as respondents' level of education is lower (Low education (L): OR=4.24 (95% CI: 3.83-4.68); Middle education (M): OR=2.91 (95% CI: 2.65-3.19)). Respondents have a lower risk of consuming alcohol frequently if they have a low level of education (L: OR=0.59 (95% CI: 0.54-0.64); M: OR=0.70 (95% CI: 0.65-0.76)), but a higher risk of binge drinking frequently (L: OR=1.29 (95% CI: 1.161.44); M: OR=1.15 (95% CI: 1.04-1.27)). People are more likely to be physically active at least 3 days in the past week when they have a higher level of education (M: OR=1.42 (95% CI: 1.34-1.50); H: OR=1.67 (95% CI: 1.55-1.80)). Finally, people are more likely to consume fruit and vegetables at least daily if they have a higher level of education (fruit: M: OR=1.09 (95% CI: 1.03-1.16); H: OR=1.77 (95% CI: 1.63-1.92); vegetables: M: OR=1.34 (95% CI: 1.26-1.42); H: OR=2.35 (95% CI: 2.16-2.55)). However, we also found considerable cross-national variation in the associations between education and risky health behaviour. Conclusions: Our results yield a complex picture: the lowest educational groups are more likely to smoke and less likely to engage in physical activity and to eat fruit and vegetables, but the highest educational groups are at greater risk of frequent alcohol consumption. Additionally, inequalities in risky health behaviour do not appear to be systematically weakest in the South or strongest in the North and West of Europe.

The objective of this study was to develop methods for obtaining unit prices for the valuation of ICBs.Methods: By conducting an exploratory literature study and expert interviews, several generic methods were developed. The methods' feasibility was assessed through application in the Netherlands. Results were validated in an expert meeting, which was attended by policy makers, public health experts, health economists and HTA-experts, and discussed at several international conferences and symposia.Results: The study resulted in four methods, including the opportunity cost method (A) and valuation using available unit prices (B), self-constructed unit prices (C) or hourly labor costs (D).Discussion: The methods developed can be used internationally and are valuable for the broad international field of HTA.

J	Corburn, J				Corburn, Jason			Urban Place and Health Equity: Critical Issues and Practices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						urban health; cities; toxic stress; environmental justice; place	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; STRESS; COMMUNITY; BENEFITS	Urban places and health equity are two of the most challenging concepts for 21st century environmental health. More people live in cities than at any other time in human history and health inequities are increasing. Health inequities are avoidable differences in the social, environmental and political conditions that shape morbidity and mortality, and disproportionately burden the poor, racial, ethnic and religious minorities and migrants. By linking urban place and health inequities, research and action brings into sharp relief the challenges of achieving urban environmental justice. This article briefly reviews the complex definitions of urban places and how they can shape health equity in cities. I suggest that a more relational or integrated approach to defining urban places and acting on health equity can complement other approaches and improve the ability of public health to meet 21st century challenges. I close with suggestions for research and practice that might focus environmental public health on healthy urban place making. The practices include community driven map making, Health in All Policies (HiAP), promoting urban ecosystem services for health, and participatory and integrated approaches to urban slum upgrading. I conclude that if the global community is serious about the sustainable development goals (SDGs), greater attention must be paid to understanding and acting to improve urban places, living conditions and the social and economic conditions that can promote health equity.

Global Trends in Adolescent Fertility, 1990-2012, in Relation to National Wealth, Income Inequalities, and Educational Expenditures	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH			English	Article						Socioeconomic status; Income inequalities; Gini index; Adolescent birth rate; Adolescent fertility	HEALTH; COUNTRIES; DETERMINANTS	Purpose: National wealth, income inequalities, and expenditures on education can profoundly influence the health of a nation's women, children, and adolescents. We explored the association of trends in national socioeconomic status (SES) indicators with trends in adolescent birth rates (ABRs), by nation and region. Methods: An ecologic research design was employed using national-level data from the World Bank on birth rates per 1,000 women aged 15-19 years, national wealth (per capita gross domestic product or GDP), income inequality (Gini index), and expenditures on education as a percentage of GDP (EduExp). Data were available for 142 countries and seven regions for 1990-2012. Multiple linear regression for repeated measures with generalized estimating equations was used to examine independent associations. Results: ABRs in 2012 varied >200-folddwith the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and lowest rates in the Western Europe/Central Asia region. The median national ABR fell 40% from 72.4/1,000 in 1990 to 43.6/1,000 in 2012. The largest regional declines in ABR occurred in South Asia (70%), Europe/Central Asia (63%), and the Middle East/North Africa (53%)-regions with lower income inequality. In multivariable analyses considering change over time, ABRs were negatively associated with GDP and EduExp and positively associated with greater income inequality. Conclusions: ABRs have declined globally since 1990. Declines closely followed rising socioeconomic status and were greater where income inequalities were lower in 1990. Reducing poverty and income inequalities and increasing investments in education should be essential components of national policies to prevent adolescent childbearing.

In this study, we estimated the national and subnational levels and causes of child mortality in China annually from 1996 to 2015 to draw implications for achievement of the SDGs for China and other low-income and middle-income countries. Methods In this systematic analysis, we adjusted empirical data on levels and causes of child mortality collected in the China Maternal and Child Health Surveillance System to generate representative estimates at the national and subnational levels. In adjusting the data, we considered the sampling design and probability, applied smoothing techniques to produce stable trends, fitted livebirth and age-specific death estimates to natvional estimates produced by the UN for international comparison, and partitioned national estimates of infrequent causes produced by independent sources to the subnational level. Findings Between 1996 and 2015, the under-5 mortality rate in China declined from 50.8 per 1000 livebirths to 10.7 per 1000 livebirths, at an average annual rate of reduction of 8.2%. However, 181 600 children still died before their fi fth birthday, with 93 400 (51.5%) deaths occurring in neonates. Great inequity exists in child mortality across regions and in urban versus rural areas. The leading causes of under-5 mortality in 2015 were congenital abnormalities (35 700 deaths, 95% uncertainty range [UR] 28 400-45 200), preterm birth complications (30 900 deaths, 24 200-40 800), and injuries (26 600 deaths, 21 000-33 400). Pneumonia contributed to a higher proportion of deaths in the western region of China than in the eastern and central regions, and injury was a main cause of death in rural areas. Variations in cause-of-death composition by age were also examined. The contribution of preterm birth complications to mortality decreased after the neonatal period; congenital abnormalities remained an important cause of mortality throughout infancy, whereas the contribution of injuries to mortality increased after the first year of life. Interpretation China has achieved a rapid reduction in child mortality in 1996-2015. The decline has been widespread across regions, urban and rural areas, age groups, and cause-of-death categories, but great disparities remain. The western region and rural areas and especially western rural areas should receive most attention in improving child survival through enhanced policy and programmes in the Sustainable Development Goals era. Continued investment is crucial in primary and secondary prevention of deaths due to congenital abnormalities, preterm birth complications, and injuries nationally, and of deaths due to pneumonia in western rural areas. The study also has implications for improving child survival and civil registration and vital statistics in other low-income and middle-income countries.

Using the attributes and variables featured in the development of these countries and synthetic indexes, it analyzes the relationship between wealth levels and estimates of social development. First we use the indicators estimated by UNDP. Using UNDP methodology and multivariate statistical methods such as factor analysis, we then turn to complementary estimators. Our results not only allow us to identify which countries are better (or worse) at turning economic growth into social development but they also contribute to detecting the dimensions of development behind position changes across various rankings.

J	Walsh, A; Brugha, R; Byrne, E				Walsh, Aisling; Brugha, Ruairi; Byrne, Elaine			"<i>The way the country has been carved up by researchers</i>": ethics and power in north-south public health research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Zambia; Research partnerships; Situated research ethics; Power; Bourdieu	INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; RESEARCH CAPACITY; INFORMED-CONSENT; MEDICAL-RESEARCH; REFLECTIONS; CHALLENGES; COMMITTEES; LESSONS; AFRICA	Background: Despite the recognition of power as being central to health research collaborations between high income countries and low and middle income countries, there has been insufficient detailed analysis of power within these partnerships. The politics of research in the global south is often considered outside of the remit of research ethics. This article reports on an analysis of power in north-south public health research, using Zambia as a case study. Methods: Primary data were collected in 2011/2012, through 53 in-depth interviews with: Zambian researchers (n = 20), Zambian national stakeholders (n = 8) and northern researchers who had been involved in public health research collaborations involving Zambia and the global north (n = 25). Thematic analysis, utilising a situated ethics perspective, was undertaken using Nvivo 10. Results: Most interviewees perceived roles and relationships to be inequitable with power remaining with the north. Concepts from Bourdieu's theory of Power and Practice highlight new aspects of research ethics: Northern and southern researchers perceive that different habituses exist, north and south - habituses of domination (northern) and subordination (Zambian) in relation to researcher relationships. Bourdieu's hysteresis effect provides a possible explanation for why power differentials continue to exist. In some cases, new opportunities have arisen for Zambian researchers; however, they may not immediately recognise and grasp them. Bourdieu's concept of Capitals offers an explanation of how diverse resources are used to explain these power imbalances, where northern researchers are often in possession of more economic, symbolic and social capital; while Zambian researchers possess more cultural capital. Conclusions: Inequities and power imbalances need to be recognised and addressed in research partnerships. A situated ethics approach is central in understanding this relationship in north-south public health research.

However, there are limited studies on spatial epidemiology of child undernutrition in Ethiopia. This study was aimed to identify the SaTScan spatial clusters of child undernutrition in Ethiopia. Methods: Nutritional indices of children (0-59 months) with Global Positioning System (GPS) location data were accessed from the 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) after getting permission from the MEASURES Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) Program. The Bernoulli Model was fitted using SaTScan (TM) software, version 9.4. for SaTScan cluster analysis. Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) test was used for each SaTScan cluster and size of the scanning SaTScan cluster to test the alternative hypothesis that there is an elevated risk within the SaTScan cluster compared to outside the SaTScan cluster. Less than 0.05 for LLR was considered as statistically significant level. Results: The SaTScan spatial analysis result detected Liben, Afder and Borena administrative zones around the South East Ethiopia as the most likely primary spatial SaTScan clusters (LLR = 28.98, p < 0.001) for wasting. In the Northern, Middle, North East and North West areas of Ethiopia particularly from all administrative zones of Amhara, Tigray, Afar, Ben. Gumz regional states and East Welega and North Showa zones from Oromiya Regional State (LLR = 60.27, p < 0.0001) were detected as the most likely primary SaTScan clusters for child underweight. Also in the Northern, Middle, North East and North West areas of all administrative zones of Tigray, Amhara, Ben. Gumz and Afar regional states and West and North Showa and East Welega from Oromiya Regional States (LLR = 97.28, P < 0.0001) were primary SaTScan clusters for child stunting. Conclusion: The study showed geographical variability of child stunting, underweight and wasting in the Country which demands risk based local nutritional interventions. Further study will be important to assess the temporal nature of the problem and to identify community level factors that create this spatial variation.

The present study aimed to describe the financing strategies and mechanisms to improve access to public health for all, identify the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches, and showed evidence on equity improvement among different regions. Methods: We reviewed the relevant literatures and identified 208 articles after screening and quality assessment and conducted six key informants' interviews. Secondary data on national and local government health expenditures, NEPHSP coverage and health indicators in 2003-2014 were collected, descriptive and equity analyses were used. Results: Before 2009, the government subsidy to primary care institutions (PCIs) were mainly used for basic construction and a small part of personnel expenses. Since 2009, the new funds for NEPHSP have significantly expanded service coverage and population coverage. These funds have been allocated by central, provincial, municipal and county governments at different proportions in China's tax distribution system. Due to the fiscal transfer payment, the Central Government allocated more subsides to less-developed western regions and all the funds were managed in a specific account. Several types of payment methods have been adopted including capitation, pay for performance (P4P), pay for service items, global budget and public health voucher, to address issues from both the supply and demand sides. The equalization of NEPHSP did well through the establishment of health records, systematic care of children and maternal women, etc. Our data showed that the gap between the eastern, central and western regions narrowed. However the coverage for migrants was still low and performance was needed improving in effectiveness of managing patients with chronic diseases. Conclusions: The delivery of essential public health services was highly influenced by public fiscal policy, and the implementation of health reform since 2009 has led the public health development towards the right direction. However China still needs to increase the fiscal investments to expand service coverage as well as promote the quality of public health services and equality among regions. Independent scientific monitoring and evaluation are also needed.

OH has been used to develop strategies for zoonotic Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID). However, the ethical case for OH as an alternative to more traditional public health approaches is largely absent from the discourse. To study the ethics of OH, we examined perceptions of the human health and ecological priorities for the management of zoonotic EID in the Southeast Asia country of Singapore. Methods We conducted a mixed methods study using a modified Delphi technique with a panel of 32 opinion leaders and 11 semi-structured interviews with a sub-set of those experts in Singapore. Panellists rated concepts of OH and priorities for zoonotic EID preparedness planning using a series of scenarios developed through the study. Interview data were examined qualitatively using thematic analysis. Findings We found that panellists agreed that OH is a cross-disciplinary collaboration among the veterinary, medical, and ecological sciences, as well as relevant government agencies encompassing animal, human, and environmental health. Although human health was often framed as the most important priority in zoonotic EID planning, our qualitative analysis suggested that consideration of non-human animal health and welfare was also important for an effective and ethical response. The panellists also suggested that effective pandemic planning demands regional leadership and investment from wealthier countries to better enable international cooperation. Conclusion We argue that EID planning under an OH approach would benefit greatly from an ethical ecological framework that accounts for justice in human, animal, and environmental health.

J	Brada, BB				Brada, Betsey Behr			The Contingency of Humanitarianism: Moral Authority in an African HIV Clinic	AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST			English	Article							HEALTH-CARE; AIDS; ANTHROPOLOGY; PARTNERSHIPS; PERSPECTIVE; GOVERNANCE; HIV/AIDS; BOTSWANA; LANGUAGE; POLITICS	One consequence of the recent expansion of anthropological interest in humanitarianism is the seeming obviousness and conceptual stability of humanitarianism itself. In this article, I argue that, rather than being a stable concept and easily recognizable phenomenon, humanitarianism only becomes apparent in relation to other categories. In short, humanitarianism is contingent: it depends on circumstance and varies from one context to another. Furthermore, its perceptibility rests on individuals' capacity to mobilize categorical similarities and distinctions. One cannot call a thing or person humanitarian without denying the humanitarian character of someone or something else. Drawing on research conducted in clinical spaces where Botswana's national HIV treatment program and private US institutions overlapped, I examine the processes by which individuals claimed people, spaces, and practices as humanitarian, the contrasts they drew to make these claims, and the moral positions they attempted to occupy in the process. More than questions of mere terminology, these processes of categorization and contradistinction serve as crucibles for the larger struggles over sovereignty, inequality, and the legacies of colonialism that haunt US-driven global health interventions. [humanitarianism, global health, expertise, semiotics, Botswana, HIV/AIDS] RESUME Une des consequences du recent progres de l'interet des anthropologues pour l'humanitarisme est l'apparente evidence et stabilite conceptuelle de << l'humanitarisme >> lui-meme. Dans cet article, je soutiens que l'humanitarisme n'est pas un concept stable et un phenomene aisement identifiable mais ne devient apparent que mis en relation avec d'autres categories. En somme, l'humanitarisme est contingent: il depend des circonstances et varie d'un contexte a l'autre. Par surcroit, sa perceptibilite repose sur la capacite des individus a faire valoir des similarites et distinctions categorielles. Une personne ou un objet ne peuvent etre appeles << humanitaire >> sans que ne soit nie le caractere humanitaire d'un autre objet ou personne. En me fondant sur des recherches menees dans des espaces cliniques oU se chevauchent le programme national botswanais de traitement du VIH et les institutions privees etasuniennes, j'examine les processus par lesquels les individus declarent << humanitaires >> des personnes, des espaces et des pratiques, les contrastes qu'ils constituent pour soutenir leurs declarations et les positions morales qu'ils tentent ce faisant de prendre. Davantage que des questions simplement terminologiques, ces processus de categorisations et d'oppositions servent de creuset aux luttes sur des questions de souverainete, d'inegalite et d'heritages coloniaux qui hantent les interventions de sante globale definies par les Etats-Unis. [humanitarisme, sante mondial, competence, semiotique, Botswana, VIH/SIDA] RESUMEN Una consecuencia de la expansion reciente del interes antropologico en el humanitarismo es la aparente obviedad y estabilidad conceptual del humanitarismo en si mismo.

Mas que cuestiones de mera terminologia, estos procesos de categorizacion y contra distincion sirven como crisoles para las luchas mayores sobre soberania, desigualdad, y los legados de colonialismo que persiguen las intervenciones globales de salud impulsadas por los Estados Unidos.

J	Bernabé, E; Masood, M; Vujicic, M				Bernabe, Eduardo; Masood, Mohd; Vujicic, Marko			The impact of out-of-pocket payments for dental care on household finances in low and middle income countries	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Cost of illness; Dental care; Developing countries; Multilevel analysis	CATASTROPHIC HEALTH EXPENDITURE; GLOBAL BURDEN; POVERTY IMPACTS; IMPOVERISHMENT; DISEASES; METAREGRESSION; INEQUALITY; INSURANCE; WEIGHTS	Background: Dental care is extremely costly and beyond most people means in developing countries. The primary aim of this study was to determine the impact of out-of-pocket payments for dental care on household finances in 40 low and middle income countries. A second aim was to compare the burden of payments for dental care with that for other health services. Methods: We used data from 174,257 adults, aged 18 years and above, who reported their total and itemized household expenditure in the past four weeks as part of the World Health Surveys. The financial burden on households was measured using the catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment approaches. A household was classified as facing CHE if it spent 40% or more of its capacity to pay, and as facing impoverishment if it fell below the country-specific poverty line after spending on health care was subtracted from household expenditure. The odds of experiencing CHE and impoverishment due to expenditure on dental care were estimated from two-level logistic regression models, controlling for various individual-and country-level covariates. Results: Households that paid for dental care had 1.88 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.78-1.99) greater odds of incurring CHE and 1.65 (95% CI: 1.52-1.80) greater odds of facing impoverishment, after adjustment for covariates. Furthermore, the impact of paying for dental care was lower than that for medications or drugs, inpatient care, outpatient care and laboratory tests but similar to that of health care products, traditional medicine and other health services. Conclusion: Households with recent dental care spending were more likely to use a large portion of their disposable income and fall below the poverty line. Policy makers ought to consider including dental care as part of universal health care and advocate for the inclusion of dental care coverage in health insurance packages.

Embodying pervasive discrimination: a decomposition of sexual orientation inequalities in health in a population-based cross-sectional study in Northern Sweden	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Sexual orientation; LGBQ; Health inequality; Mental health; Self-reported health; Decomposition analysis	BLINDER-OAXACA DECOMPOSITION; MENTAL-HEALTH; FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE; DISPARITIES; ADULTS; GAY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PERSPECTIVE; VALIDITY; ISSUES	Background: Studies from Sweden and abroad have established health inequalities between heterosexual and non-heterosexual people. Few studies have examined the underpinnings of such sexual orientation inequalities in health. To expand this literature, the present study aimed to employ decomposition analysis to explain health inequalities between people with heterosexual and non-heterosexual orientation in Sweden, a country with an international reputation for heeding the human rights of non-heterosexual people. Methods: Participants (N = 23,446) came from a population-based cross-sectional survey in the four northernmost counties in Sweden in 2014. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires, covering sexual orientation, mental and general physical health, social conditions and unmet health care needs, and sociodemographic data was retrieved from total population registers. Sexual orientation inequalities in health were decomposed by Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis. Results: Results showed noticeable mental and general health inequalities between heterosexual and non-heterosexual orientation groups. Health inequalities were partly explained (total explained fraction 64-74%) by inequalities in degrading treatment (24-26% of the explained fraction), but to a considerable degree also by material conditions (38-45%) and unmet care needs (25-43%). Conclusions: Psychosocial experiences may be insufficient to explain and understand health inequalities by sexual orientation in a reputedly 'gay-friendly' setting. Less overt forms of structural discrimination may need to be considered to capture the pervasive material discrimination that seems to underpin the embodiment of sexual minority inequalities. This ought to be taken into consideration in research, policy-making and monitoring aiming to work towards equity in health across sexual orientations.

Despite a relatively small number of Ebolarelated cases and deaths (compared to other causes), Ebola vaccines suddenly leapt to highest priority among international health agencies and vaccine developers. Clearly, earlier cost-effectiveness analyses badly missed some factors affecting real world decisions. Multi-criteria systems analysis can improve evaluation and prioritization of vaccine development and also of many other health policy and investment decisions. Neither cost-effectiveness nor cost-benefit analysis can capture important aspects of problems such as Ebola or the emerging threat of Zika, especially issues of inequality and disparity issues that dominate the planning of many global health and economic organizations. Cost-benefit analysis requires assumptions about the specific value of life an idea objectionable to many analysts and policy makers. Additionally, standard cost-effectiveness calculations cannot generally capture effects on people uninfected with Ebola for example, but nevertheless affected through such factors as contagion, herd immunity, and fear of dread disease, reduction of travel and commerce, and even the hope of disease eradication. Using SMART Vaccines, we demonstrate how systems analysis can visibly include important "other factors" and more usefully guide decision making and beneficially alter priority setting processes.

In these sections of the International Journal of Health Services, we present some of the main findings of the SOPHIE Project. We include both articles that summarize all the evidence already published in the project on a thematic area (such as labor market, gender, or housing) and articles that present new, unpublished evidence on a specific health inequality or policy.

A cohort study of regional migration and the risks of attempted suicide and violent assault injury	INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article							RURAL-URBAN DIFFERENCES; MENTAL-HEALTH; SOCIAL SUPPORT; INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS; IMMIGRANT POPULATION; INCOME INEQUALITY; CANADA; RATES; HOMICIDE; RESIDENCE	Objectives We study the association between changing residence and risks of attempted suicide and violent assault injury in Alberta, Canada. Our primary objective is to understand whether a change in residence between urban, rural and semiurban areas is associated with increased risk of intentional injury. Methods Study subjects are a cohort of residents linked to data on emergency department and inpatient hospital admissions between 1999 and 2010. We used generalised estimating equations to model the effects of changing residence on risk of intentional injury while controlling for the influence of age, sex, socio-economic status, Aboriginal status and history of intentional injury. Results Changing residence is associated with an increase in the risk of both attempted suicide and violent assault injury. In the case of attempted suicide, this effect is strongest for persons between 20 and 35years of age. For violent assault injuries, persons from rural regions that have recently moved to urban regions have higher risk of injuries, and women of rural origin are at higher risk of violent assault injury than women of urban origin. Conclusions Our findings reveal an association between risk of intentional injuries and change of residence adjusting for geographical differences in injury risk. These findings suggest that intentional injury risk is associated with change in community at intraregional scales and that these populations may benefit from support that helps integrate them into their new communities.

J	Pate, RR; Flynn, JI; Dowda, M				Pate, Russell R.; Flynn, Jennifer I.; Dowda, Marsha			Policies for promotion of physical activity and prevention of obesity in adolescence	JOURNAL OF EXERCISE SCIENCE & FITNESS			English	Review						active transport; adolescent sports; built environment; early childcare; healthcare; physical education	2014 REPORT CARD; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CHILD-CARE; SCHOOL; INTERVENTIONS; METAANALYSIS; PRESCHOOLERS; TRENDS; YOUTH; TRANSPORTATION	Obesity rates among children and adolescents in developed countries have increased dramatically since the 1970s. During that same period, numerous secular changes have combined to reduce the demand for physical activity in day- to-day life, and many barriers to physical activity are now evident. As a consequence, most children and adolescents do not meet the accepted public health guidelines for physical activity. Accordingly, public health interventions are needed to increase physical activity in adolescence. Such interventions, if successfully implemented, can be expected to improve fitness and health as well as reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity in young people. Promotion of physical activity in populations of children and adolescents will require comprehensive strategic planning and adoption of new policies in multiple societal sectors. This paper highlights nine initiatives that can address the problem of physical activity in children. The initiatives are to: establish comprehensive school physical activity programming; demand high quality physical education; require physical activity in early child care and education; require physical activity in afterschool programs; create equity in community resources; activate youth sports programs; re-normalize active transport to school; institutionalize clinic-based physical activity assessment and counseling; and build activity-friendly homes. A case will be made for comprehensive national and international strategic planning aimed at effective and large-scale implementation of these initiatives and tactics.

Socio-economic inequalities in health and health service use among older adults in India: results from the WHO Study on Global AGEing and adult health survey	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Socio-economic factors; Concentration index; Healthcare inequalities; Older adults; India	SELF-RATED HEALTH; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; ECONOMIC BURDEN; EQUITY; EXPENDITURE; DISPARITIES; POPULATION; DISABILITY; MORTALITY	Objective: The objectives of this study were to measure socio-economic inequalities in self reported health (SRH) and healthcare visits and to identify factors contributing to health inequalities among older people aged 50-plus years. Study design: This study is based on a population-based, cross-sectional survey. Methods: We accessed data of 7150 older adults from the World Health Organization's Study on Global AGEing and adult health Indian survey. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the correlates of poor SRH. We estimated the concentration index to measure socio-economic inequalities in SRH and healthcare visits. Regression-based decomposition analysis was employed to explore the correlates contributing to poor SRH inequality. Results: About 19% (95% CI: 18%, 20%) reported poor health (n = 1368) and these individuals were significantly less wealthy. In total, 5134 (71.8%) participants made at least one health service visit. Increasing age, female gender, low social caste, rural residence, multi morbidity, absence of pension support, and health insurance were significant correlates of poor SRH. The standardized concentration index of poor SRH -0.122 (95% CI: -0.102; -0.141) and healthcare visits 0.364 (95% CI: 0.324, 0.403) indicated pro-poor and pro-rich inequality, respectively. Economic status (62.3%), pension support (11.5%), health insurance coverage (11.5%), social caste (10.7%) and place of residence (4.1%) were important contributors to inequalities in poor health. Conclusion: Socio-economic disparities in health and health care are major concerns in India. Achievement of health equity demand strategies beyond health policies, to include pro-poor, social welfare policies among older Indians. (C) 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health.

The latter invites the world community to collaborate in an inclusive, long-ranging vision for the future, highlighting our interdependence and collective responsibility for humanity's future. A growing awareness that preventing violence does not just reduce death and disability but promotes creativity, economic growth, and general well-being is at the heart of this "movement". An integration not only of the major disciplines but of various practical approaches is timely, and for this to occur, we require a broader overview of our existing societal structures. In this context, the remainder of this fifteen article series after a Global Health Studies course entitled, "Violence: Causes and Cures," will review the mechanisms that society has used in an attempt to stem violence. This article, the tenth of the series, will briefly cover the criminal justice system in the United States and around the world. While the criminal justice system has played a major role in the effort to reduce violence, we learn that systemic failures and perceived injustices can diminish deterrent effect, while community-based intervention, individualized programs, and alternative justice approaches show greater promise. Similarly, punitive measures such as solitary confinement and the death penalty require reconsideration for reversing trends of self-defeating, irrational practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This widening diversity of schools prompts questions over the social-class and, ethnic differences of families served, and whether educational quality varies in consequential ways. We first describe the attributes of pupils enrolled in and qualities of 135 Jeddah middle schools, then estimate the extent to which school auspice predicts three elements of school quality (associated with pupil achievement) length of instructional time, the principal's focus on instructional rigor, and organizational cohesion among teachers. These estimates take into account pupil attributes, enrollment size, and the adequacy of material inputs. We find that private middle schools serve more advantaged pupils and display higher quality, compared with government-run schools, but no quality advantages for schools run by international sponsors were observed. Levels of instructional materials displayed little relation to the intensity of principal leadership or the social cohesion of teachers inside schools. Implications for equity and government policy are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analyzing the interview transcripts through the theoretical lens of Pierre Bourdieu's forms of capital, this study expands on previous research by offering a more precise and theoretically grounded understanding of how NNES authors perceive the value of English proficiency in relation to their success as scientific researchers. This theorization of the varying ways in which authors perceive the value of English proficiency affords new perspectives on the inequities that NNES authors encounter in the global publishing economy and their rhetorical strategies for overcoming these inequities. The study concludes by reflecting on theoretical and practical implications for researchers, teachers, and other stakeholders in the global publishing industry.

Only countries with more than one survey were included, allowing us to cross-examine surveys and correct for biases. We first show that average height varies significantly according to location, from 148.3 cm in Guatemala to 158.8 cm in Haiti. The evolution of heights over these decades behaves like indicators of human development, showing a steady increase of 2.6 cm from the 1950s to the 1990s. Such gains compare favorably to other developing regions of the world, but not so much with recently developed countries. Height gains were not evenly distributed in the region, however. Countries that achieved.higher levels of income, such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, gained on average 0.9 cm per decade, while countries with shrinking economies, such as Haiti and Guatemala, only gained 0.25 cm per decade.

In most cases, these disorders are neither identified nor treated properly, with the majority of them being chronic and difficult to treat. In many countries, the prevalence rates of psychopathology in male young offenders are still unknown and no psychotherapeutic interventions are delivered. Therefore, the main goal of the present study was to assess mental health problems in Portuguese male young offenders placed in either custodial or community-based programs and discuss treatment implications within the juvenile justice interventions. Methods: Participants in this study included 217 male young offenders aged between 14 and 20 years old that were randomly selected using a random number table. From the total sample, 122 (56.3 %) participants were placed in juvenile detention facilities, and 95 (43.7 %) were receiving community-based programs. Participants were interviewed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents, a structured interview that assesses DSM-IV Axis I Mental Disorders. Participants aged 18 years or older were also assessed with the antisocial personality disorder section from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders. Results: Results showed a high prevalence of mental health disorders, with a global prevalence of 91.2 % in the total sample. In both groups, global prevalence rates were equally high (93.4 % in youth in custodial versus 88.4 % in youth in community-based programs). Substance-related disorders were more prevalent in youth placed in juvenile facilities, whereas anxiety and mood disorders were more often found in the community-based group. Moreover, oppositional defiant disorder was more prevalent in youth from the community, whereas antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder were less prevalent than expected in this same group. A high comorbidity rate was also found, with the majority of participants from both groups' fulfilling criteria for two or more disorders. Additionally, participants with conduct disorder were over four times more likely to fulfill criteria for substance abuse. Conclusions: Our findings inform about specific needs concerning mental health intervention that should be taken into account when deciding and planning rehabilitation programs for male young offenders, either from custodial or community-based programs.

Populations served by midwives value internationally educated midwives from their countries of origin. The International Midwifery Pre-Registration Program at Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario, provides assessment, midwifery workplace orientation, and accelerated education for internationally educated midwives on behalf of the regulatory College of Midwives of Ontario. Between 2003 and 2015, midwives from 41 countries participated in the bridging program, and 214 (80%) successfully completed the program and qualified for licensure. Of these 214 graduates, 100% passed the Canadian Midwifery Registration Examination and 193 (90%) were employed full time as midwives within 4 months of graduation. The program curriculum enables the integration of these midwives into health care workplaces utilizing innovative approaches to assessment and competency enhancement. Critical to the bridging process are simulation-based practices to develop effective psychomotor learning, virtual and real primary care community placements, and coaching in empathetic, client-centered communication. Cultural sensitivity is embedded into the multiple assessment and learning modalities, and addresses relevant barriers faced by immigrant midwives in the workplace. Findings from the 13 years of the program may be applicable to increase diversity in other North American midwifery settings. This article describes the process, content, outcomes, and findings of the program. Midwifery educators and regulators may consider the utility of these approaches for their settings.

Toward a decolonial turn in resilience thinking in disasters: Example of the Mapuche from southern Chile on the frontlines and faultlines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Disasters; Resilience; Transdisciplinary; Decolonization; Mapuche-Chilean conflict; Earthquakes	HISTORICAL TRAUMA; MENTAL-HEALTH; CONFLICT; RECOVERY; FAMILIES; DECADES	Resilience thinking has moved into the forefront of global discourses on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and emergency response and recovery. Social justice frameworks have long been part of resilience thinking, conceptualizing multifaceted disasters as caused by interplays between physical, psychological, and sociopolitical dynamics that disproportionately impact marginalized communities, particularly in the Global South. Southern Chile is a poignant example, whereby marginalized indigenous communities, such as the Mapuche, are exposed to recurrent socionatural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and volcanic eruptions. Resilience in Mapuche communities, however, does not only include responses to these repeated major 'rapid onset' disasters, but also to complex legacies of systematic marginalization and daily 'slow onset' sociopolitical disasters including histories of settler colonization and ongoing inequities. Pathways toward resilience in many Mapuche communities do not simply rely on capacities of individuals or collectives to reduce risks to ahistoricized and depoliticized disasters. On the contrary, the very complexities of and intersections across environmental crises and racialized post colonial politics are manifest in daily indigenous family and community life. Thus, in an effort to improve frameworks useful for exploring complex dynamics in multifaceted disasters, the current paper provides a brief literature review outlining three general themes or Waves' of research on human resilience that have emerged throughout the decades. Key historical and contextual elements in the Mapuche-Chilean conflict are also introduced, supporting arguments for incorporating decolonization frameworks into the increasingly transdisciplinary projects of DRR with particular sensitivity and applicability to historically colonized groups and marginalized communities across the Global South.

The experiences of survivors and trauma counselling service providers in northern Uganda: Implications for mental health policy and legislation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Counselling; Experiences; Trauma; Uganda; Mental health policy; Legislation	CONSEQUENCES; PTSD	Previous research in northern Uganda found high levels of trauma-related difficulties amongst the conflict-affected population. There is international evidence that psychological therapy can reduce depression, as one of the psychological effects of trauma, but very limited literature regarding the experiences of trauma counselling in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current British Academy and Leverhulme-funded research investigated the experiences of service users and providers of trauma services in Kitgum and Gulu, northern Uganda. It also examined their implications for mental health policy and legislation. A decision was made to utilise qualitative methodology to highlight the in-depth experiences of participants. The researcher's carried out interviews with 10 women and 10 men survivors attending trauma services in Kitgum and Gulu. The researchers also interviewed 15 key informants in Kitgum, Gulu and Kampala including trauma counselling service providers, ministers, cultural leaders and mental health professionals. The authors report the findings of the research based on thematic analysis of the interviews. Themes included the experiences of survivors, bearing witness and instilling hope, constraints to service provision, stigma and abuse, holistic approach, service providers doing their best, specialist populations, limited understanding, training and skills development, gaps in service provision and mental health policy and legislation. The interviews resulted in a clear indication that counselling and medication was valued by service users, and that service providers felt the treatments that were provided improved depression, and increased empowerment and engagement in social activities. However, the authors argue that there was a limit to the benefits that could be achieved without using the holistic approach that the survivors requested. Thus, in cases of trauma arising from conflict, there is a clear need for the state to ensure reparation and/or justice for the atrocities witnessed by and perpetrated against survivors. This might include the provision of compensation, which would help to meet social needs and reduce feelings of shame and anger. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data on the prevalence and management of refugees with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are scant. Nevertheless, the impact of refugees in need for renal replacement can be as high for the patient as for the receiving centers. The International Society of Nephrology and the European Renal Association/European Dialysis and Transplant Association surveyed their membership through Survey Monkey questionnaires to obtain data on epidemiology and management practices of refugees with ESKD. Refugees represent 1.5% of the dialysis population, but their geographic distribution is very skewed: coproduct 60% of centers treat 0, 15% treat 1, and a limited number of centers treat >20 refugees. Knowledge on financial and legal management of these patients is low. There is a lack of a structured approach by the government. Most respondents stated we have a moral duty to treat refugee patients with ESKD. Cultural rather than linguistic differences were perceived as a barrier for optimal care. Provision of dialysis for refugees with ESKD seems sustainable and logistically feasible, as they are only 1.5% of the regular dialysis population, but the skewed distribution potentially threatens optimal care. There is a need for education on financial and legal aspects of management of refugees with ESKD. Clear guidance from governing bodies should avoid unacceptable ethical dilemmas for the individual physician. Such strategies should balance access to care for all with equity and solidarity without jeopardizing the health care of the local population.

Witnessing this remarkable growth should compel health educators to question whether the training and guidance that we provide to students today is appropriate, and whether it will be applicable in the next decade and beyond. Given that "global health" did not exist as an academic discipline in the United States 20 years ago, what can we expect it will look like 20 years from now and how can we prepare for that future? Discussion: Most clinicians and trainees today recognize the importance of true partnership and capacity building in both directions for successful international collaborations. The challenge is in the execution of these practices. There are projects around the world where this is occurring and equitable partnerships have been established. Based on our experience and observations of the current landscape of academic global health, we share a perspective on principles of engagement, highlighting instances where partnerships have thrived, and examples of where we, as a global community, have fallen short. Conclusions: As the world moves beyond the charity model of global health (and its colonial roots), it is evident that the issue underlying ethical global health practice is partnership and the pursuit of health equity. Thus, achieving equity in global health education and practice ought to be central to our mission as educators and advisors when preparing trainees for careers in this field. Seeking to eliminate health inequities wherever they are ingrained will reveal the injustices around the globe and in our own cities and towns.

Every year there are more than 1000 deaths and many hundreds cases of injuries among Nepalese workers in these countries excluding India. A postmortem examination of migrant workers is not carried out in most of these countries, and those with work-related injuries are often sent back to home. Uninsured migrant workers also do not have easy access to health care services in host countries due to the high medical and hospital fees. Greater efforts are needed to protect the health and well-being, labor rights, and human rights of migrant workers from Nepal and other South-Asian nations. There is a need to enforce universal labor laws in these countries and to develop accurate records of mortality and morbidity and their causes.

BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						Human rights; Maternal health; Dignity	QUALITY-OF-CARE; PATIENT AUTONOMY; RURAL TANZANIA; HEALTH-CARE; DIGNITY; ABUSE; CHILDBIRTH; EXPERIENCES; DISRESPECT; DELIVERY	Background: A human rights approach to maternal health is considered as a useful framework in international efforts to reduce maternal mortality. Although fundamental human rights principles are incorporated into legal and medical frameworks, human rights have to be translated into measurable actions and outcomes. So far, their substantive applications remain unclear. The aim of this study is to explore women's perspectives and experiences of maternal health services through a human rights perspective in Magu District, Tanzania. Methods: This study is a qualitative exploration of perspectives and experiences of women regarding maternity services in government health facilities. The point of departure is a Human Rights perspective. A total of 36 semi-structured interviews were held with 17 women, between the age of 31 and 63, supplemented with one focus group discussion of a selection of the interviewed women, in three rural villages and the town centre in Magu District. Data analysis was performed using a coding scheme based on four human rights principles: dignity, autonomy, equality and safety. Results: Women's experiences of maternal health services reflect several sub-standard care factors relating to violations of multiple human rights principles. Women were aware that substandard care was present and described a range of ways how the services could be delivered that would venerate human rights principles. Prominent themes included: 'being treated well and equal', 'being respected' and 'being given the appropriate information and medical treatment'. Conclusion: Women in this rural Tanzanian setting are aware that their experiences of maternity care reflect violations of their basic rights and are able to voice what basic human rights principles mean to them as well as their desired applications in maternal health service provision.

Public stewardship of private for-profit healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							CLINICAL-TRAINING UNIT; PHARMACY PRACTICE; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION; MALARIA TREATMENT; CASE-MANAGEMENT; DRUG SHOPS; SECTOR; QUALITY; IMPACT	Background Governments use different approaches to ensure that private for-profit healthcare services meet certain quality standards. Such government guidance, referred to as public stewardship, encompasses government policies, regulatory mechanisms, and implementation strategies for ensuring accountability in the delivery of services. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not been the subject of a systematic review. Objectives To assess the effects of public sector regulation, training, or co-ordination of the private for-profit health sector in low-and middle-income countries. Search methods For related systematic reviews, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) 2015, Issue 4; Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) 2015, Issue 1; Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) 2015, Issue 1; all part of The Cochrane Library, and searched 28 April 2015. For primary studies, we searched MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily and MEDLINE 1946 to Present, OvidSP (searched 16 June 2016); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index 1987 to present, and Emerging Sources Citation Index 2015 to present, ISI Web of Science (searched 3May 2016 for papers citing included studies); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2015, Issue 3, part of The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register) (searched 28 April 2015); Embase 1980 to 2015 Week 17, OvidSP (searched 28 April 2015); Global Health 1973 to 2015 Week 16, OvidSP (searched 30 April 2015); WHOLIS, WHO (searched 30 April 2015); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index 1975 to present, ISI Web of Science (searched 30 April 2015); Health Management, ProQuest (searched 22 November 2013). In addition, in April 2016, we searched the reference lists of relevant articles, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and various electronic databases of grey literature. Selection criteria Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, interrupted time series studies, or controlled before-after studies. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data, comparing their results and resolving discrepancies by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), where appropriate, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). We did not conduct meta-analysis because of heterogeneity of interventions and study designs. Main results We identified 20,177 records, 50 of them potentially eligible. We excluded 39 potentially eligible studies because they did not involve a rigorous evaluation of training, regulation, or co-ordination of private for-profit healthcare providers in LMICs; five studies identified after the review was submitted are awaiting assessment; and six studies met our inclusion criteria. Two included studies assessed training alone; one assessed regulation alone; three assessed a multifaceted intervention involving training and regulation; and none assessed coordination. All six included studies targeted private for-profit pharmacy workers in Africa and Asia. Three studies found that training probably increases sale of oral rehydration solution (one trial in Kenya, 106 pharmacies: RR 3.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.75; and one trial in Indonesia, 87 pharmacies: RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.93) and dispensing of anti-malarial drugs (one trial in Kenya, 293 pharmacies: RR 8.76, 95% CI 0.94 to 81.81); moderate-certainty evidence. One study conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic shows that regulation of the distribution and sale of registered pharmaceutical products may improve composite pharmacy indicators (one trial, 115 pharmacies: improvements in four of six pharmacy indicators; low-certainty evidence). The outcome in three multifaceted intervention studies was the quality of pharmacy practice; including the ability to ask questions, give advice, and provide appropriate treatment. The trials applied regulation, training, and peer influence in sequence; and the study design does not permit separation of the effects of the different interventions. Two trials conducted among 136 pharmacies in Vietnam found that the multifaceted intervention may improve the quality of pharmacy practice; but the third study, involving 146 pharmacies in Vietnam and Thailand, found that the intervention may have little or no effects on the quality of pharmacy practice (low-certainty evidence). Only two studies (both conducted in Vietnam) reported cost data, with no rigorous assessment of the economic implications of implementing the interventions in resource-constrained settings. No study reported data on equity, mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, satisfaction, or attitudes. Authors' conclusions Training probably improves quality of care (i.e. adherence to recommended practice), regulation may improve quality of care, and we are uncertain about the effects of co-ordination on quality of private for-profit healthcare services in LMICs. The likelihood that further research will find the effect of training to be substantially different from the results of this review is moderate; implying that monitoring of the impact is likely to be needed if training is implemented. The low certainty of the evidence for regulation implies that the likelihood of further research finding the effect of regulation to be substantially different from the results of this review is high. Therefore, an impact evaluation is warranted if government regulation of private for-profit providers is implemented in LMICs. Rigorous evaluations of these interventions should also assess other outcomes such as impacts on equity, cost implications, mortality, morbidity, and adverse effects.

'One Health' refers to the collaboration of multiple disciplines and sectors working locally, nationally and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment. One Health offers the opportunity to acknowledge shared interests, set common goals, and drive toward team work to benefit the overall health of a nation. As in most countries, the health of Rwanda's people and economy are highly dependent on the health of the environment. Recently, Rwanda has developed a One Health strategic plan to meet its human, animal and environmental health challenges. This approach drives innovations that are important to solve both acute and chronic health problems and offers synergy across systems, resulting in improved communication, evidence-based solutions, development of a new generation of systems-thinkers, improved surveillance, decreased lag time in response, and improved health and economic savings. Several factors have enabled the One Health movement in Rwanda including an elaborate network of community health workers, existing rapid response teams, international academic partnerships willing to look more broadly than at a single disease or population, and relative equity between female and male health professionals. Barriers to implementing this strategy include competition over budget, poor communication, and the need for improved technology. Given the interconnectedness of our global community, it may be time for countries and their neighbours to follow Rwanda's lead and consider incorporating One Health principles into their national strategic health plans.

But the South-South label elucidates little about the actual content of the cooperation and conflates the "where" with the "who, what, how, and why". While there have been some attempts to theorize global health diplomacy and South-South cooperation generally, these efforts do not sufficiently distinguish among the different kinds of practices and political values that fall under the South-South rubric, ranging from economic and geopolitical interests to social justice forms of solidarity. In the spirit of deepening theoretical, historical, and social justice analyses of SSC, this article: (1) critically revisits international relations theories that seek to explain SSC, exploring Marxian and other heterodox theories ignored in the mainstream literature; (2) traces the historical provenance of a variety of forms of SSC; and (3) introduces the concept of social justice-oriented South-South.

The study resulted from a non-systematic literature review, based on the scoping review proposal. We begin by presenting a brief contextualization of the social welfare state systems in these European countries, highlighting the principal specificities and differences in relation to other European welfare state systems. Next, we describe the health systems in the four countries, emphasizing the respective reform processes and the main health inequalities that have characterized them before and during the economic crisis. The crisis and austerity policies have greatly increased the level of dissatisfaction with healthcare provision in these countries, particularly in Greece and Portugal. In this sense, we conduct a comparative discussion of the health inequalities, identifying both common trends and differences. In the four countries, the social gradient (particularly in education, income, and labor) represents the principal determinant of health inequalities, while not ruling out geographic inequalities in access to health services as the result of different levels of economic development in the various regions. Finally, we discuss the recent debate in the international literature on the relationship between different welfare state systems and health inequalities, and precisely the critique of the use of welfare state typologies as a determinant of health and health inequalities.

This region faces unique challenges in combating the disease including lack of funding for noncommunicable diseases, lack of availability of studies and guidelines specific to the population, lack of availability of medications, differences in urban and rural patients, and inequity between public and private sector health care. Because of these challenges, diabetes has a greater impact on morbidity and mortality related to the disease in sub-Saharan Africa than any other region in the world. In order to address these unacceptably poor trends, contextualized strategies for the prevention, identification, management, and financing of diabetes care within this population must be developed. This narrative review provides insights into the policy landscape, epidemiology, pathophysiology, care protocols, medication availability, and health care systems to give readers a comprehensive summary of many factors in these domains as they pertain to diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to providing a review of the current evidence available in these domains, potential solutions to address the major gaps in care will be proposed to reverse the negative trends seen with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa.

Measles and rubella elimination: learning from polio eradication and moving forward with a diagonal approach	EXPERT REVIEW OF VACCINES			English	Review						Elimination; eradication; immunizations; measles; polio; rubella; vaccine-preventable diseases	MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; GLOBAL MEASLES; HEALTH-CARE; LABORATORY NETWORK; REGIONAL MEASLES; DISEASE OUTBREAK; UNITED-STATES; IMMUNIZATION; VACCINE; WORLDWIDE	Introduction: In 1988, an estimated 350,000 children were paralyzed by polio and 125 countries reported polio cases, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution to achieve polio eradication by 2000, and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was established as a partnership focused on eradication. Today, following eradication efforts, polio cases have decreased >99% and eradication of all three types of wild polioviruses is approaching. However, since polio resources substantially support disease surveillance and other health programs, losing polio assets could reverse progress toward achieving Global Vaccine Action Plan goals.Areas covered: As the end of polio approaches and GPEI funds and capacity decrease, we document knowledge, experience, and lessons learned from 30years of polio eradication.Expert commentary: Transitioning polio assets to measles and rubella (MR) elimination efforts would accelerate progress toward global vaccination coverage and equity. MR elimination feasibility and benefits have long been established. Focusing efforts on MR elimination after achieving polio eradication would make a permanent impact on reducing child mortality but should be done through a diagonal approach' of using measles disease transmission to identify areas possibly susceptible to other vaccine-preventable diseases and to strengthen the overall immunization and health systems to achieve disease-specific goals.

Economic interventions have become a central approach to preventing IPV and HIV. Objective/Methods: We undertook a comprehensive scoping review of published evaluations of economic interventions that sought to prevent IPV and/or HIV risk behaviours. Results: Forty-five separate analyses of interventions met our criteria. Broadly, unconditional cash transfer interventions showed either flat or positive outcomes; economic strengthening interventions had mixed outcomes, with some negative, flat and positive results reported; interventions combining economic strengthening and gender transformative interventions tended to have positive outcomes. Conclusions: The review highlighted a number of gaps. Specifically, there were limited studies evaluating the impact of economic interventions on female sex workers, young women, and men. In addition, there were missed opportunities, with many evaluations only reporting either IPV- or HIV-related outcomes, rather than both, despite overlaps.

We compared patterns of health utilisation and expenditure among HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults over 50. Methods: Data were drawn from the Study on global AGEing and adult health in South Africa with analysis focusing on individual and household-level data of 147 HIV-positive and 2725 HIV-negative respondents. Results: HIV-positive respondents reported lower utilisation of private health-care facilities (11.8%) than HIV-negative respondents (25.0%) (p=.03) and generally had more negative attitudes towards health system responsiveness than HIV-negative counterparts. Less than 10% of HIV-positive and HIV-negative respondents experienced catastrophic health expenditure (CHE). Women (OR 1.8; p<.001) and respondents from rural settings (OR 2.9; p<.01) had higher odds of CHE than men or respondents in urban settings. Over half the respondents in both groups indicated that they had received free health care. Conclusions: These findings suggest that although HIV-positive and HIV-negative older adults in South Africa are protected to some extent from CHE, inequalities still exist in access to and quality of care available at health-care services - which can inform South Africa's development of a national health insurance scheme.

J	Rudrum, S				Rudrum, Sarah			Pregnancy and birth in the global South: a review of critical approaches to sociocultural risk illustrated with fieldwork data from northern Uganda	HEALTH RISK & SOCIETY			English	Article						risk; global South; pregnancy; maternity care; low-income countries	WOMENS EXPERIENCES; HEALTH; CARE; GLOBALIZATION; MIDWIFERY; SETTINGS; TALKING	In this article, I examine whether a critical approach to risk is relevant to pregnancy and maternity care in global South settings and I illustrate my review of current literature with examples from fieldwork I conducted in northern Uganda in 2012. Coxon, in a Health, Risk & Society editorial entitled 'Risk in pregnancy and birth: are we talking to ourselves?' (2014, Health, Risk & Society, 16(6), 481-493), noted that the analysis of risk in pregnancy has tended to focus on 'relatively privileged women in high-income countries' (p. 490), a narrow lens that in her view not only led to an account that was 'highly partial' but also contributed to theory in this area being overly focused on individual accounts, rather than structural inequalities. In this article, I draw on my experiences researching and writing about maternity care in Uganda, to consider whether and how a critical approach to sociocultural risk is relevant in low-income global South countries, as well as how a shift in lens to include less privileged women in low-income countries also shifts the theoretical contribution of a critical risk approach. I examine screening and surveillance as well as risk subjectivity, areas central to the discussion of risk and pregnancy, and find that a critical approach to risk offers insight into new forms of control and new discourses of responsibility. At the same time, I note that the social, political and medical contexts shaping both clinical and critical sociocultural approaches to risk have not occurred universally, and the critiques developed by scholars in and of the global North are not directly transferable to global South settings. Overall, I find that a critical approach to risk is indeed relevant and points to specific cases and discourses where such a lens is particularly valuable.

Weight-control interventions, including drug treatment, in pregnant women who are obese or overweight have not had sufficient impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes, which suggests that the focus for intervention should include preconception or post-partum periods. Further research is needed into the long-term effects of nutritional and lifestyle interventions before conception. To improve preconception health, an integrated approach, including pregnancy prevention, planning, and preparation is needed, involving more than the primary health-care sector and adopting an ecological approach to risk reduction that addresses personal, societal, and cultural influences. Raising awareness of the importance of good health in the period before pregnancy will require a new social movement: combining bottom-up mobilisation of individuals and communities with a top-down approach from policy initiatives. Interventions to reduce or prevent obesity before conception and during pregnancy could contribute substantially to achievement of the global Sustainable Development Goals, in terms of health, wellbeing, productivity, and equity in current and future generations.

Early antiretroviral therapy initiation: access and equity of viral load testing for HIV treatment monitoring	LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							RESOURCE-LIMITED SETTINGS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; RESISTANCE	Scaling up access to HIV viral load testing for individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy in low-resource settings is a global health priority, as emphasised by research showing the benefits of suppressed viral load for the individual and the whole population. Historically, large-scale diagnostic test implementation has been slow and incomplete because of service delivery and other challenges. Building on lessons from the past, in this Personal View we propose a new framework to accelerate viral load scale-up and ensure equitable access to this essential test. The framework includes the following steps: (1) ensuring adequate financial investment in scaling up this test; (2) achieving pricing agreements and consolidating procurement to lower prices of the test; (3) strengthening functional tiered laboratory networks and systems to expand access to reliable, high-quality testing across countries; (4) strengthening national leadership, with prioritisation of laboratory services; and (5) demand creation and uptake of test results by clinicians, nurses, and patients, which will be vital in ensuring viral load tests are appropriately used to improve the quality of care. The use of dried blood spots to stabilise and ship samples from clinics to laboratories, and the use of point-of-care diagnostic tests, will also be important for ensuring access, especially in settings with reduced laboratory capacity. For countries that have just started to scale up viral load testing, lessons can be learnt from countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand, which have already established viral load programmes. This framework might be useful for guiding the implementation of viral load with the aim of achieving the new global HIV 90-90-90 goals by 2020.

Lower socioeconomic position (SEP) in both childhood and adulthood is associated with higher adult BMI, but how these associations have changed across time is poorly understood. We used longitudinal data to examine how childhood and adult SEP relates to BMI across adulthood in three national British birth cohorts. Methods and Findings The sample comprised up to 22,810 participants with 77,115 BMI observations in the 1946 MRC National Survey of Health and Development (ages 20 to 60-64), the 1958 National Child Development Study (ages 23 to 50), and the 1970 British Cohort Study (ages 26 to 42). Harmonized social class-based SEP data (Registrar General's Social Class) was ascertained in childhood (father's class at 10/11 y) and adulthood (42/43 years), and BMI repeatedly across adulthood, spanning 1966 to 2012. Associations between SEP and BMI were examined using linear regression and multilevel models. Lower childhood SEP was associated with higher adult BMI in both genders, and differences were typically larger at older ages and similar in magnitude in each cohort. The strength of association between adult SEP and BMI did not vary with age in any consistent pattern in these cohorts, but were more evident in women than men, and inequalities were larger among women in the 1970 cohort compared with earlier-born cohorts. For example, mean differences in BMI at 42/43 y amongst women in the lowest compared with highest social class were 2.0 kg/m(2) (95% CI: -0.1, 4.0) in the 1946 NSHD, 2.3 kg/m(2) (1.1, 3.4) in the 1958 NCDS, and 3.9 kg/m(2) (2.3, 5.4) the in the 1970 BCS; mean (SD) BMI in the highest and lowest social classes were as follows: 24.9 (0.8) versus 26.8 (0.7) in the 1946 NSHD, 24.2 (0.4) versus 26.5 (0.4) in the 1958 NCDS, and 24.2 (0.3) versus 28.1 (0.8) in the 1970 BCS. Findings did not differ whether using overweight or obesity as an outcome. Limitations of this work include the use of social class as the sole indicator of SEP-while it was available in each cohort in both childhood and adulthood, trends in BMI inequalities may differ according to other dimensions of SEP such as education or income. Although harmonized data were used to aid inferences about birth cohort differences in BMI inequality, differences in other factors may have also contributed to findings-for example, differences in missing data. Conclusions Given these persisting inequalities and their public health implications, new and effective policies to reduce inequalities in adult BMI that tackle inequality with respect to both childhood and adult SEP are urgently required	[Bann, David] UCL Inst Educ, Ctr Longitudinal Studies, London, England; [Johnson, William] Univ Loughborough, Sch Sport Exercise & Hlth Sci, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Li, Leah] UCL Inst Child Hlth, Populat Policy & Practice, London, England; [Kuh, Diana; Hardy, Rebecca] UCL, MRC Unit Lifelong Hlth & Ageing, London, England	University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education; Loughborough University; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London	Bann, D (corresponding author), UCL Inst Educ, Ctr Longitudinal Studies, London, England.	david.bann@ucl.ac.uk	Hardy, Rebecca/AFR-1989-2022; Kuh, Diana/L-6019-2014	Hardy, Rebecca/0000-0001-9949-0799; Bann, David/0000-0002-6454-626X; Kuh, Diana/0000-0001-7386-2857	ESRC [ES/K000357/1, ES/M008584/1]; UK Medical Research Council [MC_UU_12019/1, MC_UU_12019/2]; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M001660/1]; ESRC [ES/K000357/1, ES/M008584/1, ES/M001660/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MC_UU_12019/1, MC_UU_12019/2] Funding Source: UKRI	ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); UK Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))	This project is part of a collaborative research programme entitled Cohorts and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources (CLOSER).

We conceptualise the economy as a complex system made up of underlying approaches, regulation from institutions, markets, finance, labour, the public-private balance as well as production and distributional effects, which collectively impact on health through the effect of moderators. This protocol details the methods for an umbrella review to explore the macro-economic factors, strategies, policies and interventions that affect health outcomes and health inequalities. Methods: We will identify relevant systematic reviews using search terms derived from the Journal of Economic Literature classification. Reviews will be included if they meet the Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects criteria for systematic reviews. Reviews of studies with and without controls will be included; both association and intervention studies will be included. Primary outcomes will include but are not limited to morbidity, mortality, prevalence and incidence of conditions and life expectancy. Secondary outcomes will include health inequalities by gender, ethnicity or socio-economic status. Six databases will be searched using tailored versions of our piloted search strategy to locate relevant reviews. Data will be extracted using a standardized pro forma, and the findings will be synthesized into a conceptual framework to address our review aim. Discussion: Our umbrella review protocol provides a robust method to systematically appraise the evidence in this field, using new conceptual models derived specifically to address the study question. This will yield important information for policymakers, practitioners and researchers at the local, national and international level. It will also help set the future research agenda in this field and guide the development of interventions. Systematic review registration: This umbrella review protocol has been registered with PROSPERO CRD42017068357.

Health behaviours cluster in adolescence and track to adulthood. Very little is known about similar and contrasting influences on young people's eating behaviours and alcohol use. Whilst there are bodies of literature which explore the influences on young people's eating behaviour and alcohol consumption respectively, no qualitative studies have been identified with an explicit and concurrent focus on adolescent eating behaviours and alcohol consumption. This review will identify and synthesise qualitative research evidence to provide insight into common underlying factors which influence alcohol use and unhealthy eating behaviours amongst young people aged 10-17. This will involve bringing together two separate bodies of literature to enable analysis and comparison across two associated fields of study. Methods: We will conduct searches in MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts (via ProQuest social science premium collection), CINAHL, ERIC, IBSS (via ProQuest social science premium collection), ASSIA (via ProQuest social science premium collection), and Web of Science Core Collection. Studies reporting primary data of any qualitative design, for example, ethnographic studies, studies that used a phenomenological or grounded theory approach, or participatory action research will be included in the review. Database searches will be supplemented with searches of Google Scholar, hand searches of key journals, and backward and forward citation searches of reference lists of identified papers. Search records will be independently screened by two researchers, with full text copies of potentially relevant papers retrieved for in-depth review against the inclusion criteria. Reporting of identified studies will be assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Qualitative Research Checklist. GRADE-CERQual will also be used to assess confidence in the findings arising from our review. Qualitative synthesis will involve three core phases: line-by-line coding of findings; development of descriptive themes; and development of analytical themes. Findings from papers will be examined for overlaps, similarities and differences. Discussion: This synthesis will interpret individual studies by identification of second-order constructs (interpretations offered by the original researchers) and third-order constructs (development of new interpretations beyond those offered in individual studies) by way of the development of a 'model structure' of shared influences upon both unhealthy eating behaviours and alcohol use. It is anticipated that this 'model structure' will aid subsequent co-design and piloting of a future intervention to help reduce health risk and social inequalities due to excess weight gain and alcohol consumption.

Alcohol use peaks in early adulthood. Alcohol consumption can also exacerbate weight gain. A high body mass index and heavy drinking are independently associated with liver disease but, in combination, they produce an intensified risk of damage, with individuals from lower socio-economic status groups disproportionately affected. Methods: We will conduct searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, ASSIA, Web of Knowledge (WoK), Scopus, CINAHL via EBSCO, LILACS, CENTRAL and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses for studies that assess targeted preventative interventions of any length of time or duration of follow-up that are focused on reducing unhealthy eating behaviour and linked risky alcohol use in 18-25-year-olds. Primary outcomes will be reported changes in: (1) dietary, nutritional or energy intake and (2) alcohol consumption. We will include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster RCTs; randomised trials; non-randomised controlled trials; interrupted time series; quasi-experimental; cohort involving concurrent or historical controls and controlled before and after studies. Database searches will be supplemented with searches of Google Scholar, hand searches of key journals and backward and forward citation searches of reference lists of identified papers. Search records will be independently screened by two researchers, with full-text copies of potentially relevant papers retrieved for in-depth review against the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality of RCTs will be evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Other study designs will be evaluated using the Cochrane Public Health Review Group's recommended Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Studies will be pooled by meta-analysis and/or narrative synthesis as appropriate for the nature of the data retrieved. Discussion: It is anticipated that exploration of intervention effectiveness and characteristics (including theory base, behaviour change technique; modality, delivery agent(s) and training of intervention deliverers, including their professional status; and frequency/duration of exposure) will aid subsequent co-design and piloting of a future intervention to help reduce health risk and social inequalities due to excess weight gain and alcohol consumption.

J	Zhong, A; Darren, B; Dimaras, H				Zhong, Adrina; Darren, Benedict; Dimaras, Helen			Ethical, social, and cultural issues related to clinical genetic testing and counseling in low-and middle-income countries: protocol for a systematic review	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Genetic testing; Global health; Health equity; Genetic counseling; Ethics; Society; Culture	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS; MEDICAL-STUDENTS; PHYSICIANS; ATTITUDES; DISEASE; GENOME; RETINOBLASTOMA; MUTATIONS; KNOWLEDGE	Background: There has been little focus in the literature on how to build genetic testing and counseling services in low-and middle-income countries in a responsible, ethical, and culturally appropriate manner. It is unclear to what extent this area is being explored and what form further research should take. The proposed knowledge synthesis aims to fill this gap in knowledge and mine the existing data to determine the breadth of work in this area and identify ethical, social, and cultural issues that have emerged. Methods/design: An integrated knowledge translation approach will be undertaken by engaging knowledge users throughout the review to ensure relevance to their practice. Electronic databases encompassing various disciplines, such as healthcare, social sciences, and public health, will be searched. Studies that address clinical genetic testing and/or counseling and ethical, social, and/or cultural issues of these genetic services, and are performed in low-and middle-income countries as defined by World Bank will be considered for inclusion. Two independent reviewers will be involved in a two-stage literature screening process, data extraction, and quality appraisal. Studies included in the review will be analyzed by thematic analysis. A narrative synthesis guided by the social ecological model will be used to summarize findings. Discussion: This systematic review will provide a foundation of evidence regarding ethical, social, and cultural issues related to clinical genetic testing and counseling in low-and middle-income countries. Using the social ecological model as a conceptual framework will facilitate the understanding of broader influences of the sociocultural context on an individual's experience with clinical genetic testing and counseling, thereby informing interdisciplinary sectors in future recommendations for practice and policy.

J	Bauer, IL				Bauer, Irmgard L.			Improving global health - is tourism's role in poverty elimination perpetuating poverty, powerlessness and 'ill-being'?	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Tourism impact; community health; health inequalities; social structures and health; international aid and development	PRO-POOR TOURISM; COMMUNITY; INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; JUSTICE; WORLD	The spectrum of challenges for public health in a global context is ever expanding. It is difficult for health professionals to keep informed about details of key issues affecting global health determinants such as poverty. Tourism is seen as one strategy to eliminate poverty in developing countries and to improve global health, but the industry struggles with keeping its promise. Apart from often negative impacts on the well-being of local communities, it also turns out not to be as altruistic as it appears at first sight. Discourses largely focus on power and control of the non-poor over the poor despite all the rhetoric to the contrary. Economic aspects still dictate the debate rather than local people's understanding of well-being. Only with a major shift in the approach to local populations, acknowledging the communities' right to self-determination and accepting them as equal partners with access to genuine benefits, will this disturbing imbalance be redressed and allow better health for more people possible. Public health professionals should question claims about the beneficial influence of tourism in poor regions and not lower their vigilance for poverty-related health problems, so that the poor are not overlooked when all other stakeholders are busy with their own agenda.

J	Ooms, G; Hammonds, R				Ooms, Gorik; Hammonds, Rachel			Global constitutionalism, applied to global health governance: uncovering legitimacy deficits and suggesting remedies	Globalization and Health			English	Article						Global health governance; Global constitutionalism; Health security; Right to health	WORLD-HEALTH; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CARE; ORGANIZATION; JUSTICE; FUND	Background: Global constitutionalism is a way of looking at the world, at global rules and how they are made, as if there was a global constitution, empowering global institutions to act as a global government, setting rules which bind all states and people. Analysis: This essay employs global constitutionalism to examine how and why global health governance, as currently structured, has struggled to advance the right to health, a fundamental human rights obligation enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It first examines the core structure of the global health governance architecture, and its evolution since the Second World War. Second, it identifies the main constitutionalist principles that are relevant for a global constitutionalism assessment of the core structure of the global health governance architecture. Finally, it applies these constitutionalist principles to assess the core structure of the global health governance architecture. Discussion: Leading global health institutions are structurally skewed to preserve high incomes countries' disproportionate influence on transnational rule-making authority, and tend to prioritise infectious disease control over the comprehensive realisation of the right to health. Conclusion: A Framework Convention on Global Health could create a classic division of powers in global health governance, with WHO as the law-making power in global health governance, a global fund for health as the executive power, and the International Court of Justice as the judiciary power.

Health Systems Research <i>Consortia</i> and the Promotion of Health Equity in Low and Middle-Income Countries	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						Research ethics; global justice; health equity; health systems research; research consortia; low and middle-income countries	INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; RESEARCH ETHICS; GLOBAL JUSTICE; EXPLORATION	Health systems research is widely identified as an indispensable means to achieve the goal of health equity between and within countries. Numerous health systems research consortia comprised of institutions from high-income countries and low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are currently undertaking programs of research in LMICs. These partnerships differ from collaborations that carry out single projects in the multiplicity of their goals, scope of their activities, and nature of their management. Recent conceptual work has explored what features might be necessary for health systems research consortia and their research programs to promote health equity. Identified features include selecting research priorities that focus on improving access to high-quality health services and/or financial protection for disadvantaged populations in LMICs and conducting research capacity strengthening that promotes the independent conduct of health systems research in LMICs. Yet, there has been no attempt to investigate whether existing consortia have such characteristics. This paper describes the results of a survey undertaken with health systems research consortia leaders worldwide to assess how consistent current practice is with the proposed ethical guidance. The findings suggest that consortia may be fairly well organised to promote health equity, but have scope for improvement, particularly in terms of achieving inclusive priority-setting.

Aim: To assess rates of patient discussion about sexuality with health care providers after cancer. Methods: We used data from the representative French nationwide 2012 VICAN survey, which included 4,349 adults 18 to 82 years old who were still alive 2 years after diagnosis at 12 cancer sites. Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported rates of discussion about sexuality with health care providers were assessed, and associated factors were tested after systematic adjustment for a sexual health indicator (created from six items of the Relationship and Sexuality Scale). Results: Of 4,181 respondents to the question on a discussion about sexuality, 54.7% reported that nobody had proposed a discussion to them, 21.9% did not want any discussion, and 23.4% had had a discussion. Women had less discussion about sexuality with health care providers (11.1% vs 36.7% of men, P < .001) and were more likely to request a discussion at their own initiative (62.9% vs 48.0% of men, P < .001). Discussion about sexuality was more frequent with patients with prostate (56.3%) and cervical (39.6%) cancer, but increasing age was associated with a greater reluctance to discuss this issue (odds ratio = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.04-1.2). The likelihood of discussion increased with severe sexual problems, radiotherapy, general sequelae, having an information-seeker profile, previous professional psychological help, and initial treatment in private centers. Patients initially wishing for psychological help were more likely to desire a discussion about sexuality. Conclusion: Sexuality receives little attention in French patients with cancer. Inequalities in the discussion about sexuality were observed in relation to the type of care center where the patient was initially managed. Information on supportive interventions, including more systematic referral for professional psychological help, should be developed to facilitate discussion and should be offered to all patients, irrespective of severity of sexual problems, age, sex, cancer site, and care center.

The article is structured around four major themes: (1) the Maoist insurgency or 'People's War'; (2) state formation and transformation; (3) identity politics; and (4) territorial and ecological consciousness. We also address the dynamics of migration and mobility in relation to all of these themes. Ultimately, we consider the Maoist movement as one element in a much broader process of transformation, which with the benefit of hindsight we can situate in relation to several other contemporaneous trajectories, including: democratization, identitybased mobilization, constitutional nationalism, international intervention, territorial restructuring, migration and the remittance economy, and the emergence of ecological and other new forms of consciousness. By looking across the disciplines at scholarship published on all of these themes, we aim to connect the dots between long-standing disciplinary traditions of scholarship on Nepal and more recent approaches to understanding the country's transformation.

This paper follows international standards in documenting recent trends in Taiwan's medical spending by category, relying on official statistics, Surveys of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE) data and administrative reimbursement panel data from the NHI Universal Database (NHIUD). Two findings are noteworthy. First, we find a rapidly widening gap since 1996 between rich and poor in terms of out-of-pocket payments and those by private health insurance; meanwhile, the gap between them in terms of NHI expenditure has remained roughly constant. This trend can be attributed mainly to a positive income gradient in personal health care expenditure among elderly individuals (aged 65 or older). Second, end-of-life hospital spending is large in both magnitude and proportion. Average end-of-life hospital spending is more than 30 times average hospital spending by the total population, and it accounts for 15.9 per cent of total hospital care expenditure (or 5.0 per cent of overall medical spending), even though the population near death accounts for only 0.51 per cent of the overall population. Two-thirds of end-of-life hospital spending is on the elderly, who also constitute two-thirds of the population near death. For both the elderly and working-age adults, the share of end-of-life hospital spending strikingly aligns with the share of deaths.

The aim of this article was to investigate the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and dental caries experience in children living in Dili. Four out of 6 Dili subdistricts and 40 schools were randomly selected. Equal numbers of school children from 4 age groups (6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17 years) were invited to participate. Data were gathered via a questionnaire and an oral examination by dental practitioners. In bivariate analysis, decayed, missing, and filled teeth index for deciduous + permanent teeth (dmft) was higher in children from mid-to high-SES than low-SES schools (1.1, 2.2, P = .001). With age, having had a toothache and dental visiting in the past 12 months in the multivariable model, higher dmft was found in children from mid-to high-to low-SES schools (P < .001). The primary dental caries experience was greater among children from mid-to high-than low-SES schools, which may be explained by high sugar consumption.

Safety distribution across populations is unequal, while public health research has identified aspects of community environments that affect the likelihood of violence, or risk and resilience factors. An overwhelming number of risk factors have accumulated in some US communities, disproportionately impacting young people of color. US policies, systems, and institutions powerfully shape how and where these factors manifest. Violence is preventable, not inevitable. We argue that comprehensive strategies for improving community environments can reduce violence and promote health equity. We present lessons, tools, and frameworks that UNITY cities use to adapt for international application, including multi-sector collaboration, strategies for influencing policy and legislation, and strengthening local violence prevention efforts.

As part of the Post-2015 sustainable development agenda, the UN has issued a global call-to-action: to eliminate violence against children. Essential to preventing violence against children is guidance to countries on using the best available evidence to address this problem. THRIVES provides this evidence. It represents a framework of complementary strategies that, taken together, have potential to achieve and sustain efforts to prevent violence against children. These strategies, which span health, social services, education, and justice sectors, include Training in parenting, Household economic strengthening, Reduced violence through legislative protection, Improved services, Values and norms that protect children, Education and life skills, and Surveillance and evaluation. For each THRIVES area, we review evidence for effectiveness and identify programmatic or policy examples. This framework will facilitate commitments to effective, sustainable, and scalable action.

J	Manthorpe, J; Samsi, K				Manthorpe, Jill; Samsi, Kritika			Person-centered dementia care: current perspectives	CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING			English	Review						person-centered care; personalization; personhood; person-centered planning; dementia	CONSUMER-DIRECTED CARE; ARKANSAS CASH; OLDER; EXPERIENCES; PEOPLE; CAREGIVERS; AUTONOMY; BUDGETS; POLICY; VIEWS	Person-centered dementia care is widely accepted as a value-based commitment to supporting people with dementia and is a guiding principle in care services. Policy ambitions to put people at the center of their own care are being developed internationally. These may be seen as part of the evolution of person-centered care which has its origins in critical perspectives on practice and social responses to people with dementia. In England, one further development of person-centered care has been personalization - a government policy to extend individuals' choice and control over their social care and, latterly, ways to meet their health care needs. This paper charts the evolution of the concept of person-centered care to the policy of personalization (which has international comparators) and summarizes emerging and conflicting evidence about the implications of personal budgets in England on older people with mental health problems such as dementia and their families. It focuses on the evidence base of personalization and on emerging lessons for practice, drawing from the implementation of personalization and the adoption of personal budgets by this group. While personalization may be one policy initiative, the values and practices of person-centered dementia care remain fundamental to practice and are inspiring new ideas related to rights and justice for people with dementia.

A key part of the solution is city planning that reduces non-communicable diseases and road trauma while also managing rapid urbanisation. This Series of papers considers the health impacts of city planning through transport mode choices. In this, the first paper, we identify eight integrated regional and local interventions that, when combined, encourage walking, cycling, and public transport use, while reducing private motor vehicle use. These interventions are destination accessibility, equitable distribution of employment across cities, managing demand by reducing the availability and increasing the cost of parking, designing pedestrian-friendly and cycling-friendly movement networks, achieving optimum levels of residential density, reducing distance to public transport, and enhancing the desirability of active travel modes (eg, creating safe attractive neighbourhoods and safe, affordable, and convenient public transport). Together, these interventions will create healthier and more sustainable compact cities that reduce the environmental, social, and behavioural risk factors that affect lifestyle choices, levels of traffic, environmental pollution, noise, and crime. The health sector, including health ministers, must lead in advocating for integrated multisector city planning that prioritises health, sustainability, and liveability outcomes, particularly in rapidly changing low-income and middle-income countries. We recommend establishing a set of indicators to benchmark and monitor progress towards achievement of more compact cities that promote health and reduce health inequities.

With its aim to answer questions about how to improve access to interventions that have been shown to work but have not reached many of the people who could benefit from them, IR involves a range of particular ethical considerations that have not yet been comprehensively covered in international guidelines on health research ethics. The fundamental ethical principles governing clinical research apply equally in IR, but the application of these principles may differ depending on the IR question, context, and the nature of the proposed intervention. IR questions cover a broad range of topics that focus on improving health system functioning and improving equitable and just access to effective health care interventions. As such, IR designs are flexible and often innovative, and ethical principles cannot simply be extrapolated from their applications in clinical research. Meaningful engagement with all stakeholders including communities and research participants is a fundamental ethical requirement that cuts across all study phases of IR and links most ethical concerns. Careful modification of the informed consent process may be required in IR to permit study of a needed intervention. The risks associated with IR may be difficult to anticipate and may be very context-specific. The benefits of IR may not accrue to the same groups who participate in the research, therefore justifying the risks versus benefits of IR may be ethically challenging. The expectation that knowledge generated through IR should be rapidly translated into health policy and practice necessitates up-front commitments from decision-makers to sustainability and scalability of effective interventions. Greater awareness of the particular ethical implications of the features of IR is urgently needed to facilitate optimal ethical conduct of IR and uniform ethical review.

One key factor is household wealth, which may enable or limit a household's ability to access health care services and adequately control such a chronic condition. This study aims to describe the scale and patterns of wealth-related inequalities in the awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in 21 countries using baseline data from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology study. Methods: A cross-section of 163,397 adults aged 35 to 70 years were recruited from 661 urban and rural communities in selected low-, middle- and high-income countries (complete data for this analysis from 151,619 participants). Using blood pressure measurements, self-reported health and household data, concentration indices adjusted for age, sex and urban-rural location, we estimate the magnitude of wealth- related inequalities in the levels of hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in each of the 21 country samples. Results: Overall, the magnitude of wealth- related inequalities in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control was observed to be higher in poorer than in richer countries. In poorer countries, levels of hypertension awareness and treatment tended to be higher among wealthier households; while a similar pro-rich distribution was observed for hypertension control in countries at all levels of economic development. In some countries, hypertension awareness was greater among the poor (Sweden, Argentina, Poland), as was treatment (Sweden, Poland) and control (Sweden). (Continued on next page) Conclusion: Inequality in hypertension management outcomes decreased as countries became richer, but the considerable variation in patterns of wealth-related inequality - even among countries at similar levels of economic development - underscores the importance of health systems in improving hypertension management for all. These findings show that some, but not all, countries, including those with limited resources, have been able to achieve more equitable management of hypertension; and strategies must be tailored to national contexts to achieve optimal impact at population level.

"In"-sights about food banks from a critical interpretive synthesis of the academic literature	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						Critical; Food banks; Review; Policy; Poverty; Synthesis	NUTRITIONAL QUALITY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ASSISTANCE; INSECURITY; SECURITY; HUNGER; RESPONSES; WELFARE; SUPPORT; POLICY	The persistence, and international expansion, of food banks as a non-governmental response to households experiencing food insecurity has been decried as an indicator of unacceptable levels of poverty in the countries in which they operate. In 1998, Poppendieck published a book, Sweet charity: emergency food and the end of entitlement, which has endured as an influential critique of food banks. Sweet charity's food bank critique is succinctly synthesized as encompassing seven deadly "ins" (1) inaccessibility, (2) inadequacy, (3) inappropriateness, (4) indignity, (5) inefficiency, (6) insufficiency, and (7) instability. The purpose of this paper is to examine if and how the contemporary food bank critique differs from Sweet charity's "ins" as a strategy for the formulation of synthesizing arguments for policy advocacy. We used critical interpretive synthesis methodology to identify relationships within and/or between existing critiques in the peer-reviewed literature as a means to create "'synthetic constructs' (new constructs generated through synthesis)" of circulating critiques. We analyzed 33 articles on food banks published since Sweet charity, with the "ins" as a starting point for coding. We found that the list of original "ins" related primarily to food bank operations has been consolidated over time. We found additional "ins" that extend the food bank critique beyond operations (ineffectiveness, inequality, institutionalization, invalidation of entitlements, invisibility). No synthetic construct emerged linking the critique of operational challenges facing food banks with one that suggests that food banks may be perpetuating inequity, posing a challenge for mutually supportive policy advocacy.

Investing in life saving vaccines to guarantee life of future generations in Africa	VACCINE			English	Article						Access; Africa; Conference; Equity; Immunization; Ministerial; Universal; Vaccine	IMMUNIZATION	The World Health Organization's Regional Offices for Africa and for the Eastern Mediterranean in conjunction with the African Union and the Government of Ethiopia hosted a ministerial conference on immunization in Africa from 24 to 25 February 2016 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia under the theme "towards universal immunization coverage as a cornerstone for health and development in Africa". The conference brought together African leaders - including health and finance ministers, and parliamentarians thus creating a powerful platform for governments to demonstrate their commitment to advancing universal access to immunization on the continent in line with the Global Vaccine Action Plan. The event also brought together advocates, technical experts, policymakers, partner agencies, donors and journalists to examine how best to drive forward immunization across Africa, ensuring every child has access to the vaccines they need. Key points highlighted throughout conference were: universal access to immunization is at the forefront of enabling Africa to reach its full potential - by improving health, driving economic growth and empowering future generations; it is one of the most cost-effective solutions in global health, with clear benefits for health and development; and immunization brings economic benefits too, reducing health care costs and increasing productivity. At the close of the conference, 46 African countries signed a historic ministerial declaration on "Universal Access to Immunization as a Cornerstone for Health and Development in Africa" signaling fierce determination among African leaders to secure the health and prosperity of their societies through immunization.

ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD			English	Article							RESTRAINT-USE; SAFETY; BURDEN; POPULATION; CRASHES; INTERVENTIONS; PREVENTION; COUNTRIES; REVIEWS; DRIVERS	Road traffic injuries (RTI) impose a substantial health burden among children. Globally, 186 300 children (under 18 years) die from RTI each year. It is the fourth leading cause of death among children aged 5-9 years, third among children aged 10-14 years and first among children aged 15-17 years. At the regional level, subSaharan Africa accounts for 35.2% of global child deaths caused by RTI; that number is still increasing. Male children are about two times more likely to die due to RTI than female children. RTI are also related to socioeconomic inequalities; low-income and middle income countries (LMIC) account for 95% of global child RTI deaths, and children from poor households are more likely to fall victims to RTI. Intervention strategies promoted in the five pillars of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 are available to prevent mortality and morbidity caused by RTI, though validation and implementation of such interventions are urgently needed in the LMIC. Through concerted efforts to cultivate strong political will, build action and advocacy capacity, increase global funding and enhance multisectoral collaboration promoted by the Sustainable Development Goals, the world is challenged to do better in saving children from RTI.

J	Mariner, WK; Annas, GJ				Mariner, Wendy K.; Annas, George J.			A Culture Of Health And Human Rights	HEALTH AFFAIRS			English	Article							PUBLIC-HEALTH; DETERMINANTS	A culture of health can be seen as a social norm that values health as the nation's priority or as an appeal to improve the social determinants of health. Better population health will require changing social and economic policies. Effective changes are unlikely unless health advocates can leverage a framework broader than health to mobilize political action in collaboration with non-health sector advocates. We suggest that human rights-the dominant international source of norms for government responsibilities-provides this broader framework. Human rights, as expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and enforceable treaties, require governments to assure their populations nondiscriminatory access to food, water, education, work, social security, and a standard of living adequate for health and wellbeing. The policies needed to realize human rights also improve population health, well-being, and equity. Aspirations for human rights are strong enough to endure beyond inevitable setbacks to specific causes.

Measurement of Early Childhood Development and Learning under the Sustainable Development Goals	JOURNAL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND CAPABILITIES			English	Article						Education; Environment; Measurement; Sustainability; Inequality		Children's early development serves as the foundation for later health, learning and well-being. The inclusion of early childhood development (ECD) in the Sustainable Development Goals implies that countries must report on the percentage of children under 5 years of age who are developmentally on track. This note briefly reflects on the history of global ECD goals and their measurement and outlines the challenge ahead: creating a workable strategy for ECD measurement that balances the need for national relevance with globally comparable data. The global variation in the timing and nature of early childhood skills acquisition presents an important opportunity as countries set their own standards for what it means to be developmentally on track. Country-driven measurement and standard setting, derived from measurement approaches that meet international expectations for quality, can have an important influence on policy and practice. Countries can measure the development of their youngest citizens in a way that is most relevant and useful to them, so that they may use those data to ensure that all children have the opportunity to fulfill their potential.

M.; De Vries, Raymond			The state of the art of twinning, a concept analysis of twinning in healthcare	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Healthcare professionals; International collaboration; Midwives; Nurses; Physicians; Reciprocity; Twinning	EMPOWERMENT; STRENGTHEN; CAPACITY	Background: Inequities in health have garnered international attention and are now addressed in Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3), which seeks to 'promote well-being for all'. To attain this goal globally requires innovative approaches, one of which is twinning. According to the International Confederation of Midwives, twinning focusses on empowering professionals, who can subsequently be change-agents for their communities. However, twinning in healthcare is relatively new and because the definition and understanding of twinning lacks clarity, rigorous monitoring and evaluation are rare. A clear definition of twinning is essential for the development of a scientific base for this promising form of collaboration. Method: We conducted a Concept Analysis (CA) of twinning in healthcare using Morse's method. A qualitative study of the broad literature was performed, including scientific papers, manuals, project reports, and websites. We identified relevant papers through a systematic search using scientific databases, backtracking of references, and experts in the field. Results: We found nineteen papers on twinning in healthcare. This included twelve peer reviewed research papers, four manuals on twinning, two project reports, and one website. Seven of these papers offered no definition of twinning. In the other twelve papers definitions varied. Our CA of the literature resulted in four main attributes of twinning in healthcare. First, and most frequently mentioned, was reciprocity. The other three attributes were that twinning: 2) entails the building of personal relationships, 3) is dynamic process, 4) is between two named organisations across different cultures. The literature also indicated that these four attributes, and especially reciprocity, can have an empowering effect on healthcare professionals. Conclusions: Based on these four attributes we developed the following operational definition: Twinning is a cross-cultural, reciprocal process where two groups of people work together to achieve joint goals. A greater understanding and a mature definition of twinning results in clear expectations for participants and thus more effective twinning. This can be the starting point for new collaborations and for further international studies on the effect of twinning in healthcare.

A UN Commission on Information and Accountability, established to ensure oversight and accountability on women's and children's health, outlined a framework with three processes: monitor, review, and act. This paper assesses progress on these processes. Effective monitoring depends on a functional civil registration and vital statistics system. Review requires counting all deaths and identifying contributing factors. The final, critical step is action to prevent similar deaths. Maternal death surveillance and response includes these steps and strengthens accountability. Strategies are underway to improve accountability for severe maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality. The post 2015 agenda adds greater focus on reducing inequalities, increasing availability of quality, disaggregated data, and accountability for human rights. This agenda requires engagement with communities and health providers the foundation of accountability for women's and children's health. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

RHD has been almost eliminated with improved social and health infrastructure in affluent countries while it remains a neglected disease with major cause of morbidity and mortality in many low-and middle-income countries, and resource-limited regions of high-income countries. Despite our evolving understanding of the pathogenesis of RHD, there have not been any significant advances to prevent or halt progression of disease in recent history. Long-term penicillin-based treatment and surgery remain the backbone of a RHD control program in the absence of an effective vaccine. The advent of echocardiographic screening algorithms has improved the accuracy of diagnosing RHD and has shed light on the enormous burden of disease. Encouragingly, this has led to a rekindled commitment from researchers in the most affected countries to advocate and take bold actions to end this disease of social inequality.

Recognising that a continuum of care from the adolescent girl, woman, or mother to child is needed, the volume includes details of preventive and therapeutic health interventions in integrated packages: Maternal and Newborn Health and Child Health ( along with folic acid supplementation, a key reproductive health intervention). Scaling up all interventions in these packages from coverage in 2015 to hypothetically immediately achieve 90% coverage would avert 149 000 maternal deaths, 849 000 stillbirths, 1 498 000 neonatal deaths, and 1 515 000 additional child deaths. In alternative calculations that consider only the effects of reducing the number of pregnancies by provision of contraceptive services as part of a Reproductive Health package, meeting 90% of the unmet need for contraception would reduce global births by almost 28 million and consequently avert deaths that could have occurred at 2015 rates of fertility and mortality. Thus, 67 000 maternal deaths, 440 000 neonatal deaths, 473 000 child deaths, and 564 000 stillbirths could be averted from avoided pregnancies. Particularly effective interventions in the Maternal and Newborn Health and Child Health packages would be management of labour and delivery, care of preterm births, and treatment of serious infectious diseases and acute malnutrition. Nearly all of these essential interventions can be delivered by health workers in the community or in primary health centres, which can increase population access to needed services. The annual incremental cost of immediately scaling up these essential interventions would be US$ 6.2 billion in low-income countries, $ 12.4 billion in lower-middle-income countries, and $ 8.0 billion in upper-middle-income countries. With the additional funding, greater focus on high-effect integrated interventions and innovations in service delivery, such as task shifting to other groups of health workers and supply and demand incentives, can help rectify major gaps in accessibility and quality of care. In recent decades, reduction of avoidable maternal and child deaths has been a global priority. With continued priority and expansion of essential reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions to high coverage, equity, and quality, as well as interventions to address underlying problems such as women's low status in society and violence against women, these deaths and substantial morbidity can be largely eliminated in another generation.

Advisory Board Natl Osteo	A systematic review of intervention thresholds based on FRAX A report prepared for the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group and the International Osteoporosis Foundation	ARCHIVES OF OSTEOPOROSIS			English	Review						Assessment guidelines; Calibration; Discrimination; FRAX; Intervention threshold	FRACTURE RISK-ASSESSMENT; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY; BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; ASSESSMENT TOOL; HIP FRACTURE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; EXTERNAL VALIDATION; POSITION STATEMENT	A Summary This systematic review identified assessment guidelines for osteoporosis that incorporate FRAX. The rationale for intervention thresholds is given in a minority of papers. Intervention thresholds (fixed or age-dependent) need to be country-specific. Introduction In most assessment guidelines, treatment for osteoporosis is recommended in individuals with prior fragility fractures, especially fractures at spine and hip. However, for those without prior fractures, the intervention thresholds can be derived using different methods. The aim of this report was to undertake a systematic review of the available information on the use of FRAX (R) in assessment guidelines, in particular the setting of thresholds and their validation. Methods We identified 120 guidelines or academic papers that incorporated FRAX of which 38 provided no clear statement on how the fracture probabilities derived are to be used in decision-making in clinical practice. The remainder recommended a fixed intervention threshold (n = 58), most commonly as a component of more complex guidance (e. g. bone mineral density (BMD) thresholds) or an age-dependent threshold (n = 22). Two guidelines have adopted both age-dependent and fixed thresholds. Results Fixed probability thresholds have ranged from 4 to 20% for a major fracture and 1.3-5 % for hip fracture. More than one half (39) of the 58 publications identified utilised a threshold probability of 20 % for a major osteoporotic fracture, many of which also mention a hip fracture probability of 3 % as an alternative intervention threshold. In nearly all instances, no rationale is provided other than that this was the threshold used by the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA. Where undertaken, fixed probability thresholds have been determined from tests of discrimination (Hong Kong), health economic assessment (USA, Switzerland), to match the prevalence of osteoporosis (China) or to align with pre-existing guidelines or reimbursement criteria (Japan, Poland). Age-dependent intervention thresholds, first developed by the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG), are based on the rationale that if a woman with a prior fragility fracture is eligible for treatment, then, at any given age, a man or woman with the same fracture probability but in the absence of a previous fracture (i.e. at the 'fracture threshold') should also be eligible. Under current NOGG guidelines, based on age-dependent probability thresholds, inequalities in access to therapy arise especially at older ages (>= 70 years) depending on the presence or absence of a prior fracture. An alternative threshold using a hybrid model reduces this disparity. Conclusion The use of FRAX (fixed or age-dependent thresholds) as the gateway to assessment identifies individuals at high risk more effectively than the use of BMD. However, the setting of intervention thresholds needs to be country-specific.

Among full-time workers aged 25-54, approximately 27 percent are overeducated and 15 percent are undereducated. Our results reveal that, after controlling for omitted variable bias and measurement errors, return to an additional year of overeducation is significantly less than that to a year of required education, whereas undereducated workers do not appear to suffer wage penalties associated with their deficit schooling. The findings also show that returns to a year of overeducation vary across fields of study. The returns to overeducation for college graduates from health and welfare, engineering and manufacturing, and social sciences, business and law are relatively high compared with those in agriculture, services, and humanities and arts.

Quantification of the spatial and temporal variation of health impacts attributable to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has important implications for China's policies on air pollution control. In this study, we evaluated the spatial distribution of premature deaths in China between 2000 and 2010 attributable to ambient PM2.5 in accord with the Global Burden of Disease based on a high resolution population density map of China, satellite retrieved PM2.5 concentrations, and provincial health data. Our results suggest that China's anthropogenic ambient PM2.5 led to 1,255,400 premature deaths in 2010, 42% higher than the level in 2000. Besides increased PM2.5 concentration, rapid urbanization has attracted large population migration into the more developed eastern coastal urban areas, intensifying the overall health impact. In addition, our analysis implies that health burdens were exacerbated in some developing inner provinces with high population density (e. g. Henan, Anhui, Sichuan) because of the relocation of more polluting and resource-intensive industries into these regions. In order to avoid such national level environmental inequities, China's regulations on PM2.5 should not be loosened in inner provinces. Furthermore policies should create incentive mechanisms that can promote transfer of advanced production and emissions control technologies from the coastal regions to the interior regions.

Conceptualizing and operationalizing human wellbeing for ecosystem assessment and management	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Human wellbeing; Indicators; Ecosystem-based management; Integrated ecosystem assessment; Social-ecological system; Sustainability	ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; FISHING COMMUNITIES; SOCIAL-SCIENCE; HEALTH; CONSERVATION; INDICATORS; SERVICES; IMPACTS; COASTAL; US	There is growing interest in assessing the effects of changing environmental conditions and management actions on human wellbeing. A challenge is to translate social science expertise regarding these relationships into terms usable by environmental scientists, policymakers, and managers. Here, we present a comprehensive, structured, and transparent conceptual framework of human wellbeing designed to guide the development of indicators and a complementary social science research agenda for ecosystem-based management. Our framework grew out of an effort to develop social indicators for an integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA) of the California Current large marine ecosystem. Drawing from scholarship in international development, anthropology, geography, and political science, we define human wellbeing as a state of being with others and the environment, which arises when human needs are met, when individuals and communities can at meaningfully to pursue their goals, and when individuals and communities enjoy a satisfactory quality of life. We propose four major social science-based constituents of wellbeing: connections, capabilities, conditions, and cross-cutting domains. The latter includes the domains of equity and. justice, security, resilience, and sustainability, which may be assessed through cross-cutting analyses of other constituents. We outline a process for identifying policy-relevant attributes of wellbeing that can guide ecosystem assessments. To operationalize the framework, we provide a detailed table of attributes and a large database of available indicators, which may be used to develop measures suited to a variety of management needs and social goals. Finally, we discuss four guidelines for operationalizing human wellbeing measures in ecosystem assessments, including considerations for context, feasibility, indicators and research, and social difference. Developed for the U.S. west coast, the framework may be adapted for other regions, management needs, and scales with appropriate modifications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Murphy, A; Jakab, M; Mckee, M; Richardson, E				Murphy, Adrianna; Jakab, Melitta; McKee, Martin; Richardson, Erica			Persistent low adherence to hypertension treatment in Kyrgyzstan: How can we understand the role of drug affordability?	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Access to medications; coarsened exact matching; health care equity; Kyrgyzstan; non-communicable diseases; out-of-pocket payments	GLOBAL BURDEN; HEALTH-CARE; DISEASE; TRENDS	It is well known that cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a growing cause of mortality and morbidity in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). While hypertension (HTN), a leading risk factor for CVD, can be easily managed with widely available medicines, there is a huge gap in treatment for HTN in many LMIC. One such country is Kyrgyzstan, where HTN is a major public health concern and adherence to medication is low. The reasons for low adherence in Kyrgyzstan are not well understood, but some evidence suggests that HTN medicines may be unaffordable for low-income families, resulting in inequitable access to HTN treatment. With data from the 2010 Kyrgyzstan Integrated Household Survey, we estimate the prevalence and factors associated with adherence to HTN medication in Kyrgyzstan. We then investigate the hypothesis that affordability may be an important factor in adherence to HTN medication. Using the coarsened exact matching approach, we estimate the economic burden faced by households with at least one member with elevated blood pressure (EBP) in Kyrgyzstan and their risk of catastrophic spending on health care. We find that EBP households have significantly higher total expenditure on health, as well as on medicines, and are more likely to experience catastrophic health spending, suggesting that out-of-pocket expenditure for EBP may be prohibitively expensive for the poorest in Kyrgyzstan. Our findings also reveal a high prevalence of self-medication (i.e. purchasing and using medication without a doctor's prescription), and increased expenditure due to self-medication, among those with EBP. Our research suggests that affordability of HTN medicines may be an important factor in low adherence to treatment in Kyrgyzstan. Low affordability may be due partly to the prescription of medicines that are not reimbursable under the national drug benefit plan, but more research is needed to identify solutions to the affordability problem.

Data sources: We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for healthcare or pharmaceutical policies relevant to reducing the burden of falsified medicines in LMIC. Results: Our initial search identified 660 unique studies, of which 203 met title/abstract inclusion criteria and were categorised according to their primary focus: international; national; local pharmacy; internet pharmacy; drug analysis tools. Eighty-four were included in the qualitative synthesis, along with 108 articles and website links retrieved through secondary searches. Discussion: On the international stage, we discuss the need for accessible pharmacovigilance (PV) global reporting systems, international leadership and funding incorporating multiple stakeholders (healthcare, pharmaceutical, law enforcement) and multilateral trade agreements that emphasise public health. On the national level, we explore the importance of establishing adequate medicine regulatory authorities and PV capacity, with drug screening along the supply chain. This requires interdepartmental coordination, drug certification and criminal justice legislation and enforcement that recognise the severity of medicine falsification. Local healthcare professionals can receive training on medicine quality assessments, drug registration and pharmacological testing equipment. Finally, we discuss novel technologies for drug analysis which allow rapid identification of fake medicines in low-resource settings. Innovative point-of-purchase systems like mobile phone verification allow consumers to check the authenticity of their medicines. Conclusions: Combining anti-falsifying strategies targeting different levels of the pharmaceutical supply chain provides multiple barriers of protection from falsified medicines. This requires the political will to drive policy implementation; otherwise, people around the world remain at risk.

Why, and how? To answer these questions, we draw on a book we recently contributed, Healthcare Reform, Quality and Safety: Perspectives, Participants, Partnerships and Prospects in 30 Countries. We analyse the impact that these health-reform initiatives have had on the quality and safety of care in an international context-that is, in low-,middle- and high-income countries-Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Denmark, England, Ghana, Germany, the Gulf states, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Myanmar, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Papua New Guinea (PNG), South Africa, the USA, Scotland and Sweden. Popular reforms in less well-off countries include boosting equity, providing infrastructure, and reducing mortality and morbidity in maternal and child health. In countries with higher GDP per capita, the focus is on new IT systems or trialling innovative funding models. Wealthy or less wealthy, countries are embracing ways to enhance quality of care and keep patients safe, via mechanisms such as accreditation, clinical guidelines and hand hygiene campaigns. Two timely reminders are that, first, a population's health is not determined solely by the acute system, but is a product of inter-sectoral effort-that is, measures to alleviate poverty and provide good housing, education, nutrition, running water and sanitation across the population. Second, all reformers and advocates of better-quality of care should include well-designed evaluation in their initiatives. Too often, improvement is assumed, not measured. That is perhaps the key message.

This study aimed to explore the client and service characteristics associated with abstinence 52 weeks after quitting. A prospective cohort study of 3057 SSS clients in nine different areas of England who began their quit attempt between March 2012 and March 2013 was conducted. Important determinants of long-term quitting were assessed through quit rates and multivariable logistic regression. Our results showed that the overall weighted carbon monoxide validated quit rate for clients at 52 weeks was 7.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.6-9.0). The clients of advisors, whose main role was providing stop-smoking support, were more likely to quit long-term than advisors who had a generalist role in pharmacies or general practices (odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% CI 1.2-4.6)). Clients were more likely to achieve abstinence through group support than one-to-one support (OR 3.4 (95% CI 1.7-6.7)). Overall, one in thirteen people who set a quit date with the National Health Service (NHS) Stop-Smoking Service maintain abstinence for a year. Improving abstinence is likely to require a greater emphasis on providing specialist smoking cessation support. Results from this study suggest that over 18,000 premature deaths were prevented through longer-term smoking cessation achieved by smokers who accessed SSS in England from March 2012 to April 2013, but outcomes varied by client characteristic and the type of support provided.

Although this virus has been reported for a long time, its significance within the burden of diseases in West Africa is not obvious, especially in Burkina Faso. Our objective was to evaluate flavivirus presence in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) and the link between anti-flavivirus antibody seroprevalence and urbanization modes. A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted and 3015 children were enrolled from Ouagadougou districts with different types and degrees of urbanization (with/without equipment and high/low building density). Flavivirus (FLAV) IgM MAC-ELISA and FLAV indirect IgG ELISA were performed. Associations between FLAV IgG presence (sign of past infection) and various independent variables were assessed using the chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The apparent prevalence of past flavivirus infections among the enrolled children was 22.7% (95% CI: 22.4-26.7) (n = 685). Eleven children (0.4%; 95% CI: 0.61-2.14) were positive for FLAV IgM, indicating active transmission. Factors associated with flavivirus infection were identified among the enrolled children (age, sex), householders (educational level, asset index) and in the environment (building density, water access, waste management and house appearance); however, they showed great variability according to the city districts. The water access modality did not significantly influence FLAV IgG positivity. Conversely, apparently good practices of waste management had unexpected consequences (increased risk related to municipal dumpsters). Given the scale of ongoing urbanization and the spread of arboviral diseases, close collaboration between health and city stakeholders is needed.

Its guiding principles emphasise building resilience through inter-sectoral collaboration, as well as partnerships that facilitate community empowerment and address underlying risk factors. Both public health and the emergency management sector face similar challenges related to developing and implementing strategies that involve structural change, facilitating community resilience and addressing individual risk factors. Familiarity with public health principles enables an understanding of the holistic approach to risk reduction that is outlined within the Sendai Framework. We present seven concepts that resonate with contemporary public health practice, namely: the social determinants of health; inequality and inequity; the inverse care law; community-based and community development approaches; hard to reach communities and services; the prevention paradox; and the inverse prevention law. These ideas from public health provide a useful conceptual base for the "new" agenda in disaster risk management that underpins the 2015 Sendai Framework. The relevance of these ideas to disaster risk management and research is illustrated through drawing on the Sendai Framework, disaster literature and exemplars from the 2010-2011 earthquakes in Canterbury, New Zealand.

Challenges to the Mediterranean diet at a time of economic crisis	NUTRITION METABOLISM AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES			English	Review						Mediterranean diet; Economic crisis; Socioeconomic status; Health disparities; Food cost; Dietary diversity; Organic foods; Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; VEGETABLE INTAKE; 5-YEAR INCIDENCE; ORGANIC FOODS; ADHERENCE; VARIETY; PATTERNS; HABITS; INTERVENTION	Aims: The traditional Mediterranean diet (MD) is reportedly associated with lower risk of major chronic diseases and long considered to contribute to the reduced rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and to the highest life expectancy in adults who lived near the Mediterranean Sea. But despite its widely documented health benefits, adherence to this dietary pattern has been rapidly declining over the last decades due to a clear socioeconomic influence. The present review provides an overview of the evidence on the current major determinants of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, with a particular emphasis on Mediterranean Countries at a time of economic crisis; second it explores emerging socioeconomic inequalities in other domains of healthy dietary behaviours such as dietary variety, access to organic foods and food purchasing behaviour. Data synthesis: According to ecological evidence, the Mediterranean Countries that used to have the highest adherence to the Mediterranean pattern in the Sixties, more recently experienced the greatest decrease, while Countries in Northern Europe and some other Countries around the world are currently embracing a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern. A potential cause of this downward trend could be the increasing prices of some food items of the Mediterranean diet pyramid. Recent evidence has shown a possible involvement of the economic crisis, material resources becoming strong determinants of the adherence to the MD just after the recession started in 2007-2008. Beyond intake, the MD also encourages increasing dietary diversity, while international dietary recommendations suggest replacing regular foods with healthier ones. Conclusions: Socioeconomic factors appear to be major determinants of the adherence to MD and disparities also hold for other indices of diet quality closely related to this dietary pattern.

In this context, personalized medicine, precision medicine, and stratified medicine are related concepts attributed to what is essentially targeted therapeutics and companion diagnostics, aimed at improving safety and effectiveness of health interventions. We report here, to the best of our knowledge, the first comparative clinical pharmacogenomics study, in an Ecuadorian population sample, of five key CYP450s involved in drug metabolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In 139 unrelated, medication-free, and healthy Ecuadorian subjects, we measured the phenotypic activity of these drug metabolism pathways using the CEIBA multiplexed phenotyping cocktail. The subjects were genotyped for each CYP450 enzyme gene as well. Notably, based on the CYP450 metabolic phenotypes estimated by the genotype data, 0.75% and 3.10% of the subjects were genotypic poor metabolizers (gPMs) for CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, respectively. Additionally, on the other extreme, genotype-estimated ultrarapid metabolizer (gUMs) phenotype was represented by 15.79% of CYP2C19, and 5.43% of CYP2D6. There was, however, considerable discordance between directly measured phenotypes (mPMs and mUMs) and the above genotype-estimated enzyme phenotypes. For example, among individuals genotypically carrying enhanced activity alleles (gUMs), many showed a lower actual drug metabolism capacity than expected by their genotypes, even lower than individuals with reduced or no activity alleles. In conclusion, for personalized medicine in the Ecuadorian population, we recommend CYP450 multiplexed phenotyping, or genotyping and phenotyping in tandem, rather than CYP450 genotypic tests alone. Additionally, we recommend, in consideration of equity, ethical, and inclusive representation in global science, further precision medicine research and funding in support of neglected or understudied populations worldwide.

Basic measures such as life expectancy and infant and under-five mortality remain divergent, with preventable deaths being unacceptably high, despite significant efforts to reduce these disparities. We examine the impact of empowerment, measured by Freedom House's ratings of country's political rights and civil liberties, while controlling for per capita gross domestic product, secondary school enrollment, and income inequality, on national health outcomes. Using data from 1970 to 2013 across 149 countries, our results suggest, quite strongly, that higher levels of empowerment have a significant positive association with life expectancy, particularly for females, and lower rates of infant and under-five mortality. Our results point to the need for efforts to stimulate economic growth be accompanied with reforms to increase the levels empowerment through increasing political rights and civil liberties.

J	Pritchard, C; Keen, S				Pritchard, Colin; Keen, Steven			Child mortality and poverty in three world regions (the West, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa) 1988-2010: Evidence of relative intra-regional neglect?	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Child mortality; poverty; international comparisons	HEALTH EXPENDITURE; UK	Aims: Poverty kills children. This study assesses the relationship between poverty and child mortality rates (CMRs) in 71 societies from three world regions to determine whether some countries, relative to their region, neglect their children. Methods: Spearman rank order correlations were calculated to determine any association between the CMR and poverty data, including income inequality and gross national income. A current CMR one standard deviation (SD) above or below the regional average and a percentage change between 1988 and 2010 were used as the measures to assess the progress of nations. Results: There were positive significant correlations between higher CMRs and relative poverty measures in all three regions. In Western countries, the current CMRs in the USA, New Zealand and Canada were 1 SD below the Western mean. The narrowest income inequalities, apart from Japan, were seen in the Scandinavian nations alongside low CMRs. In Asia, the current CMRs in Pakistan, Myanmar and India were the highest in their region and were 1 SD below the regional mean. Alongside South Korea, these nations had the lowest percentage reductions in CMRs. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the current CMRs in Somalia, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola were the highest in their region and were 1 SD below the regional mean. Conclusions: Those concerned with the pursuit of social justice need to alert their societies to the corrosive impact of poverty on child mortality. Progress in reducing CMRs provides an indication of how well nations are meeting the needs of their children. Further country-specific research is required to explain regional differences.

J	Hoffman, SJ; Sritharan, L; Tejpar, A				Hoffman, Steven J.; Sritharan, Lathika; Tejpar, Ali			Is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Impacting Mental Health Laws and Policies in High-Income Countries? A Case Study of Implementation in Canada	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						Psychosocial Disabilities; Human Rights; International Law; Mental Health Law	UNITED-NATIONS CONVENTION; CHALLENGES; LIGHT	Background: Persons with psychosocial disabilities face disparate access to healthcare and social services worldwide, along with systemic discrimination, structural inequalities, and widespread human rights abuses. Accordingly, many people have looked to international human rights law to help address mental health challenges. On December 13, 2006, the United Nations formally adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) - the first human rights treaty of the 21st century and the fastest ever negotiated. Methods: This study assesses the CRPD's potential impact on mental health systems and presents a legal and public policy analysis of its implementation in one high-income country: Canada. As part of this analysis, a critical review was undertaken of the CRPD's implementation in Canadian legislation, public policy, and jurisprudence related to mental health. Results: While the Convention is clearly an important step forward, there remains a divide, even in Canada, between the Convention's goals and the experiences of Canadians with disabilities. Its implementation is perhaps hindered most by Canada's reservations to Article 12 of the CRPD on legal capacity for persons with psychosocial disabilities. The overseeing CRPD Committee has stated that Article 12 only permits "supported decision-making" regimes, yet most Canadian jurisdictions maintain their "substitute decision-making" regimes. This means that many Canadians with mental health challenges continue to be denied legal capacity to make decisions related to their healthcare, housing, and finances. But changes are afoot: new legislation has been introduced in different jurisdictions across the country, and recent court decisions have started to push policymakers in this direction. Conclusion: Despite the lack of explicit implementation, the CRPD has helped to facilitate a larger shift in social and cultural paradigms of mental health and disability in Canada. But ratification and passive implementation are not enough. Further efforts are needed to implement the CRPD's provisions and promote the equal enjoyment of human rights by all Canadian citizens - and presumably for all other people too, from the poorest to the wealthiest countries.

The workshop featured international and national speakers on ageing and vaccinology. The workshop was attended by health service providers, stakeholders in immunisation, ageing, primary care, researchers, government and non-government organisations, community representatives, and advocacy groups. The aims of the workshop were to: provide an update on the latest evidence around immunisation for the older adults; address barriers for prevention of infection in the older adults; and identify immunisation needs of these groups and provide recommendations to inform policy. There is a gap in immunisation coverage of funded vaccines between adults and infants. The workshop reviewed provider misconceptions, lack of Randomised Control Trials (RCT) and cost-effectiveness data in the frail elderly, loss of autonomy, value judgements and ageism in health care and the need for an adult vaccination register. Workshop recommendations included recognising the right of elderly people to prevention, the need for promotion in the community and amongst healthcare workers of the high burden of vaccine preventable diseases and the need to achieve high levels of vaccination coverage, in older adults and in health workers involved in their care. Research into new vaccine strategies for older adults which address poor coverage, provider attitudes and immunosenescence is a priority. A well designed national register for tracking vaccinations in older adults is a vital and basic requirement for a successful adult immunisation program. Eliminating financial barriers, by addressing inequities in the mechanisms for funding and subsidising vaccines for the older adults compared to those for children, is important to improve equity of access and vaccination coverage. Vaccination coverage rates should be included in quality indicators of care in residential aged care for older adults. Vaccination is key to healthy ageing, and there is a need to focus on reducing the immunisation gap between adults and children.	[MacIntyre, C.

Of the many factors operating to render some more vulnerable than others, human rights and gender equality play vital roles, as the international community learned in response to HIV/AIDS.

Links between poverty and development are mediated by the timing and extent of exposure to both risk factors nested under poverty and to protective influences which can attenuate the impact of risk. While children from high-, middle-, and low-income countries are exposed to similar types of developmental risks, children from low- and middle-income countries are exposed to a greater number, more varied and more intense risks. Given these contextual differences, cumulative risk models may provide a better fit than mediated models for understanding the nature of pathways linking economic insufficiency and developmental inequality in low- and middle-income countries, and for designing interventions to promote development of children from these countries. New evidence from a large scale UNICEF data set illustrates the application of a cumulative risk/protective perspective in low- and middle-income countries.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Article						public-private mix; tuberculosis; global progress; prospects	TB STRATEGY; HOSPITALS; HEALTH; EQUITY; CHINA; MODEL	BACKGROUND: Public-private mix (PPM) for tuberculosis (TB) care implies working with all relevant public and private health care providers to ensure that high quality TB care is offered to all who need it. Despite significant global progress in PPM expansion and in TB control in general, a large proportion of care providers in high-incidence countries remain unengaged, and one third of the estimated TB cases go unnotified or undetected. OBJECTIVE: To present a global perspective on the progress and prospects of expanding PPM for TB care and prevention. DISCUSSION: People with TB in high-incidence countries approach diverse care providers. Productive working collaborations between national TB programmes and other care providers have been scaled up in many countries. However, a large proportion of private providers still do not participate in collaboration or follow recommended TB management practices. Persisting challenges include weak commitment and capacity to work together within both public and private sectors, poor enforcement of essential regulations and inadequate investments. CONCLUSION: Scaling up PPM programmes is critical to ending the TB epidemic. Investing in implementing bold policies that harness public and private sector capacity, combine collaborative and regulatory approaches and promote modern digital tools to simplify care delivery is the logical way forward.

Data from the World Values Survey and gathered from 3 030 Rwandese (age ranging 16 to 90 years, mean age = 34.2, SD = 12.7; females = 50.5%) were pooled for the analysis. For the comparison, international World Values Survey data were utilised. A fixed effects multilevel regression model was used to predict happiness and life satisfaction from gender, health, socio-economic, and some subjective measures. Males had greater self-rated happiness and life satisfaction scores than females. State of health and sense of freedom of choice predicted both happiness and life satisfaction. Valuing of friends, weekly religious attendance, and national pride positively predicted happiness, whereas household's financial satisfaction, full-time employment, high-income group, being a student, and sense of trust predicted life satisfaction. This study suggests that health status, household's financial satisfaction and emancipative values could maximise subjective well-being in Rwanda.

We quantify the degree to which the deliberately designed structure of derivatives and investments is key to its liquidity. Research megafunds with comprehensive in silico and laboratory validation protocols and ability to issue both debt, and equity as well as hybrid financial products may enable conservative investors including pension funds and sovereign government funds to profit from unique securitization opportunities. Thus, while hedging investor's longevity risk, such well-validated megafunds will contribute to health, well being and longevity of the global population.

Background The determination of the factors affecting performance and productivity is important for providing efficient nursing services. These factors have been investigated in the literature independently, but the relationship among them has not been clearly identified. Methods This cross-sectional questionnaire study included 772 nurses working in a University Hospital accredited by Joint Commission International. Results The professional attitude score of the nurses was high (4.35 +/- 0.63). However, their organisational justice (2.22 +/- 1.26) and organisational culture (2.47 +/- 0.71) scores were low. Nurses were subjected to mobbing at a high level (0.82 +/- 0.78). As the organisational justice increased, the organisational culture increased and the mobbing decreased. As the organisation culture decreased, the mobbing increased. Conclusions There was a positive correlation between organisation culture and organisational justice of the nurses and a negative correlation with mobbing. Implications for nursing management The results of the study are essential for improving nurses' performance and productivity.

However, documentation of country experiences in the use of HRIS to improve strategic planning and management has been lacking. The purpose of this case presentation is to document for the first time Mozambique's novel approach to HRIS, sharing key success factors and contributing to the scant global knowledge base on HRIS. Case presentation: Core components of the system are a Government of Mozambique (GOM) registry covering all workers in the GOM payroll and a "health extension" which adds health-sector-specific data to the GOM registry. Separate databases for pre-service and in-service training are integrated through a business intelligence tool. The first aim of the HRIS was to identify the following: who and where are Mozambique's health workers? As of July 2015, 95 % of countrywide health workforce deployment information was populated in the HRIS, allowing the identification of health professionals' physical working location and their pay point. HRIS data are also used to quantify chronic issues affecting the Ministry of Health (MOH) health workforce. Examples include the following: HRIS information was used to examine the deployment of nurses trained in antiretroviral therapy (ART) vis-a-vis the health facilities where ART is being provided. Such results help the MOH align specialized skill sets with service provision. Twenty-five percent of the MOH health workforce had passed the 2-year probation period but had not been updated in the MOH information systems. For future monitoring of employee status, the MOH established a system of alerts in semi-monthly reports. As of August 2014, 1046 health workers were receiving their full salary but no longer working at the facilities. The MOH is now analyzing this situation to improve the retirement process and coordination with Social Security. Conclusion: The Mozambican system is an important example of an HRIS built on a local platform with local staff. Notable models of strategic data use demonstrate that the system is empowering the MOH to improve health services delivery, health workforce allocation, and management. Combined with committed country leadership and ownership of the program, this suggests strong chances of sustainability and real impact on public health equity and quality.

Physical and Sexual Violence Predictors 20 Years of the Women's Interagency HIV Study Cohort	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; GLOBAL PREVALENCE; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; DATING VIOLENCE; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE; HEALTH; RISK; VICTIMIZATION; EXPERIENCES	Introduction: Gender-based violence (GBV) threatens women's health and safety. Few prospective studies examine physical and sexual violence predictors. Baseline/index GBV history and polyvictimization (intimate partner violence, non-partner sexual assault, and childhood sexual abuse) were characterized. Predictors of physical and sexual violence were evaluated over follow-up. Methods: HIV-infected and uninfected participants (n=2,838) in the Women's Interagency HIV Study provided GBV history; 2,669 participants contributed 26,363 person years of follow-up from 1994 to 2014. In 2015-2016, multivariate log-binomial/Poisson regression models examined violence predictors, including GBV history, substance use, HIV status, and transactional sex. Results: Overall, 61% reported index GBV history; over follow-up, 10% reported sexual and 21% reported physical violence. Having experienced all three forms of past GBV posed the greatest risk (adjusted incidence rate ratio [AIRR](physical)=2.23, 95% CI=1.57, 3.19; AIRR(sexual)=3.17, 95% CI=1.89, 5.31). Time-varying risk factors included recent transactional sex (AIRR(physical)=1.29, 95% CI=1.03, 1.61; AIRR(sexual)=2.98, 95% CI=2.12, 4.19), low income (AIRR(physical)=1.22, 95% CI=1.01, 1.45; AIRR(sexual)=1.38, 95% CI=1.03, 1.85), and marijuana use (AIRR(physical)=1.43, 95% CI=1.22, 1.68; AIRR(sexual)=1.57, 95% CI=1.19, 2.08). For physical violence, time-varying risk factors additionally included housing instability (AIRR=1.37, 95% CI=1.15, 1.62); unemployment (AIRR=1.38, 95% CI=1.14, 1.67); exceeding seven drinks/week (AIRR=1.44, 95% CI=1.21, 1.71); and use of crack, cocaine, or heroin (AIRR=1.76, 95% CI=1.46, 2.11). Conclusions: Urban women living with HIV and their uninfected counterparts face sustained GBV risk. Past experiences of violence create sustained risk. Trauma-informed care, and addressing polyvictimization, structural inequality, transactional sex, and substance use treatment, can improve women's safety.

Coverage and equity in reproductive and maternal health interventions in Brazil: impressive progress following the implementation of the Unified Health System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Maternal health; Health inequalities; Socioeconomic factors; Brazil	CESAREAN-SECTIONS; CARE	Background: The Brazilian SUS (Unified Health System) was created in 1988 within the new constitution, based on the premises of being universal, comprehensive, and equitable. The SUS offers free health care, independent of contribution or affiliation. Since then, great efforts and increasing investments have been made for the system to achieve its goals. We assessed how coverage and equity in selected reproductive and maternal interventions progressed in Brazil from 1986 to 2013. Methods: We reanalysed data from four national health surveys carried out in Brazil in 1986, 1996, 2006 and 2013. We estimated coverage for six interventions [ use of modern contraceptives; antenatal care (ANC) 1+ visits by any provider; ANC 4+ visits by any provider; first ANC visit during the first trimester of pregnancy; institutional delivery; and Caesarean sections] using standard international definitions, and stratified results by wealth quintile, urban or rural residence and country regions. We also calculated two inequality indicators: the slope index of inequality (SII) and the concentration index (CIX). Results: All indicators showed steady increases in coverage over time. ANC 1+ and 4+ and institutional delivery reached coverage above 90 % in 2013. Prevalence of use of modern contraceptives was 83 % in 2013, indicating nearly universal satisfaction of need for contraception. On a less positive note, the proportion of C-sections has also grown continuously, reaching 55 % in 2013. There were marked reductions in wealth inequalities for all preventive interventions. Inequalities were significantly reduced for all indicators except for the C-section rate (p = 0.06), particularly in absolute terms (SII). Conclusions: Despite the difficulties faced in the implementation of SUS, coverage of essential interventions increased and equity has improved dramatically, due in most cases to marked increase in coverage among the poorest 40 %. An increase in unnecessary Caesarean sections was also observed during the period. Further evaluation on the quality of healthcare provided is needed.	[Franca, Giovanny V.

Method: Data were from two nationally representative surveys that measured a variety of sociodemographic, health behaviors and health care indicators. We used Poisson regression models to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios and the Horizontal Equity Index (HEI) standardized by health needs to measure inequity in the utilization of doctor and dentist visits, hospitalizations and reporting of a usual source of care (USC) for those 18 and older. To estimate the HEI, we ranked the population from the poorest to the richest using a wealth index. We also decomposed the HEI into its different components and assessed changes from 2008 to 2013. Results: The population proportion with doctor and dentist visits in the past year and a USC increased between 2008 and 2013, while hospitalizations declined. In 2013, pro-rich inequity in doctor visits increased significantly while the distribution of hospitalizations shifted from pro-rich in 2008 to neutral in 2013. Dentist visits were highly pro-rich and USC was slightly pro-rich; the distribution of dentist visits and USC did not change over time. Health need was a strong predictor of health care utilization regardless of the type of coverage (public or private). Education, wealth, and private health plans were associated with the pro-rich orientation of doctor and dentist visits. Private health plans contributed to the pro-rich orientation of all outcomes, while the Family Health Strategy contributed to the pro-poor orientation of all outcomes. Conclusion: The results of this study support the claim that Brazil's population continued to see absolute gains in access to care despite recent economic crises. However, gains in equity have slowed and may even decline if investments are not maintained as the country enters deeper financial and political crises.

With the growth of multi -jurisdictional and multicultural global health partnerships, the adequacy of the. prevailing bioethical paradigm guiding the conduct of global health research and practice is being increasingly challenged. In response to ethical challenges and conflicts confronted by decision makers in global health research and practice, we propose an innovative methodology that could be developed to bridge the gap between polarized systems of ideas and values (metaphysical, epistemological, moral, and political). Our inter-philosophies methodology provides the potential to construct a new, shared paradigm for global health ethics, thereby increasing the capacity for solidarity and shared decision-making in global health research and practice.

Considering the rate of world changes, foresighting the influence of future events and possible trends on social health could bring about advantageous information for social policy makers. Methods: This is a qualitative study of futurology with cross impact analysis approach. After studying possible trends and events in future, they were categorized in four domains including population, resources, climate changes, and globalization and 12 groups of events; and they were used to design a questionnaire. It was given to experts and their opinions were collected through depth interviews between May 2013 and Sep 2013. Results: Analysis of experts' opinions reveals that future trends in four main potential domains may have some positive and more negative impacts on Iranians' social health. Conclusion: The global "resource challenge" is the most important incoming event, considering to the four domains of global events and its final and potential effects will be the increase of inequalities leading to social threat. Since inequalities are considered the most important risk factor of health in the societies, the solution for dispel the impact of world trends on Iranians' social health is managing the crisis of inequalities which is started with fore sighting and adopting preventive strategies in all four domains.

L.; Lozano, Rafael			Dissonant health transition in the states of Mexico, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013	LANCET			English	Article							CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRANSITION; INJURIES; DEATH; DISABILITY; OBESITY; LIFE; PREVALENCE; HOMICIDES; MORTALITY	Background Child and maternal health outcomes have notably improved in Mexico since 1990, whereas rising adult mortality rates defy traditional epidemiological transition models in which decreased death rates occur across all ages. These trends suggest Mexico is experiencing a more complex, dissonant health transition than historically observed. Enduring inequalities between states further emphasise the need for more detailed health assessments over time. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2013 (GBD 2013) provides the comprehensive, comparable framework through which such national and subnational analyses can occur. This study offers a state-level quantification of disease burden and risk factor attribution in Mexico for the first time. Methods We extracted data from GBD 2013 to assess mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE) in Mexico and its 32 states, along with eight comparator countries in the Americas. States were grouped by Marginalisation Index scores to compare subnational burden along a socioeconomic dimension. We split extracted data by state and applied GBD methods to generate estimates of burden, and attributable burden due to behavioural, metabolic, and environmental or occupational risks. We present results for 306 causes, 2337 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Findings From 1990 to 2013, life expectancy from birth in Mexico increased by 3.4 years (95% uncertainty interval 3.1-3.8), from 72.1 years (71.8-72.3) to 75.5 years (75.3-75.7), and these gains were more pronounced in states with high marginalisation. Nationally, age-standardised death rates fell 13.3% (11.9-14.6%) since 1990, but state-level reductions for all-cause mortality varied and gaps between life expectancy and years lived in full health, as measured by HALE, widened in several states. Progress in women's life expectancy exceeded that of men, in whom negligible improvements were observed since 2000. For many states, this trend corresponded with rising YLL rates from interpersonal violence and chronic kidney disease. Nationally, age-standardised YLL rates for diarrhoeal diseases and protein-energy malnutrition markedly decreased, ranking Mexico well above comparator countries. However, amid Mexico's progress against communicable diseases, chronic kidney disease burden rapidly climbed, with age-standardised YLL and DALY rates increasing more than 130% by 2013. For women, DALY rates from breast cancer also increased since 1990, rising 12.1% (4.6-23.1%). In 2013, the leading five causes of DALYs were diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, low back and neck pain, and depressive disorders; the latter three were not among the leading five causes in 1990, further underscoring Mexico's rapid epidemiological transition. Leading risk factors for disease burden in 1990, such as undernutrition, were replaced by high fasting plasma glucose and high body-mass index by 2013. Attributable burden due to dietary risks also increased, accounting for more than 10% of DALYs in 2013. Interpretation Mexico achieved sizeable reductions in burden due to several causes, such as diarrhoeal diseases, and risks factors, such as undernutrition and poor sanitation, which were mainly associated with maternal and child health interventions. Yet rising adult mortality rates from chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cirrhosis, and, since 2000, interpersonal violence drove deteriorating health outcomes, particularly in men. Although state inequalities from communicable diseases narrowed over time, non-communicable diseases and injury burdens varied markedly at local levels. The dissonance with which Mexico and its 32 states are experiencing epidemiological transitions might strain health-system responsiveness and performance, which stresses the importance of timely, evidence-informed health policies and programmes linked to the health needs of each state.

In particular, the article compares both similarities and differences in suicide prevention between maori in New Zealand and indigenous peoples in Canada. It emphasises that the problem of indigenous suicide is not being indigenous but coping with losses secondary to colonisation. A useful way to translate this into helpful clinical conversations and actions is to think about loss of belonging. Culture and belonging are key components of identity and as such should be considered in all psychiatric encounters, not just in those who are considered minorities or other. The article concludes by suggesting how some of the experiences of addressing health inequalities and suicide in maori may be applied in Canada.

J	Deribew, A; Ojal, J; Karia, B; Bauni, E; Oteinde, M				Deribew, Amare; Ojal, John; Karia, Boniface; Bauni, Evasius; Oteinde, Mark			Under-five mortality rate variation between the Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) and Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) approaches	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							AFRICA; KENYA; MALARIA	Background: Several low and middle-income countries (LMIC) use Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and/or Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) to monitor the health of their population. The level and trends of under-five mortality rates could be different in the HDSS sites compared to the DHS reports. In this study, we investigated the change in under-five mortality rates overtime in the HDSS sites and the corresponding DHS reports in eight countries and 13 sites. Methods: Under-five mortality rates in the HDSS sites were determined using number of under-five deaths (numerator) and live births (denominator). The trends and annualized rate of change (ARC) of under-five mortality rates in the HDSS sites and the DHS reports were compared by fitting exponential function. Results: Under-five mortality rates declined substantially in most of the sites during the last 10-15 years. Ten out of 13 (77 %) HDSS sites have consistently lower under-five mortality rates than the DHS under-five mortality rates. In the Kilifi HDSS in Kenya, under-five mortality rate declined by 65.6 % between 2003 and 2014 with ARC of 12.2 % (95 % CI: 9.4-15.0). In the same period, the DHS under-five mortality rate in the Coastal region of Kenya declined by 50.8 % with ARC of 6 % (95 % CI: 2.0-9.0). The under-five mortality rate reduction in the Mlomp (78.1 %) and Niakhar (80.8 %) HDSS sites in Senegal during 1993-2012 was significantly higher than the mortality decline observed in the DHS report during the same period. On the other hand, the Kisumu HDSS in Kenya had lower under-five mortality reduction (15.8 %) compared to the mortality reduction observed in the DHS report (27.7 %) during 2003-2008. Under-five mortality rate rose by 27 % in the Agincourt HDSS in South Africa between 1998 to 2003 that was contrary to the 18 % under-five mortality reduction in the DHS report during the same period. Conclusions: The inconsistency between HDSS and DHS approaches could have global implication on the estimation of child mortality and ethical issues on mortality inequalities. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the reasons of child mortality variation between the HDSS and the DHS approaches.

J	Verguet, S; Memirie, ST; Norheim, OF				Verguet, Stephane; Memirie, Solomon Tessema; Norheim, Ole Frithjof			Assessing the burden of medical impoverishment by cause: a systematic breakdown by disease in Ethiopia	BMC MEDICINE			English	Article						Medical impoverishment; Catastrophic health expenditure; Out-of-pocket costs; Direct medical payments; Financial risk protection; Poverty; Ethiopia	COST-EFFECTIVENESS; CASE-FATALITY; HEALTH-CARE; TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT; STROKE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MORTALITY; CANCER; RISK; INTERVENTIONS	Background: Out-of-pocket (OOP) medical expenses often lead to catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment in low- and middle-income countries. Yet, there has been no systematic examination of which specific diseases and conditions (e.g., tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease) drive medical impoverishment, defined as OOP direct medical costs pushing households into poverty. Methods: We used a cost and epidemiological model to propose an assessment of the burden of medical impoverishment in Ethiopia, i.e., the number of households crossing a poverty line due to excessive OOP direct medical expenses. We utilized disease-specific mortality estimates from the Global Burden of Disease study, epidemiological and cost inputs from surveys, and secondary data from the literature to produce a count of poverty cases due to OOP direct medical costs per specific condition. Results: In Ethiopia, in 2013, and among 20 leading causes of mortality, we estimated the burden of impoverishment due to OOP direct medical costs to be of about 350,000 poverty cases. The top three causes of medical impoverishment were diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, and road injury, accounting for 75 % of all poverty cases. Conclusions: We present a preliminary attempt for the estimation of the burden of medical impoverishment by cause for high mortality conditions. In Ethiopia, medical impoverishment was notably associated with illness occurrence and health services utilization. Although currently used estimates are sensitive to health services utilization, a systematic breakdown of impoverishment due to OOP direct medical costs by cause can provide important information for the promotion of financial risk protection and equity, and subsequent design of health policies toward universal health coverage, reduction of direct OOP payments, and poverty alleviation.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of malnutrition among children under-five seen at Bagamoyo District Hospital (BDH) and three rural health facilities ranging between 25 and 55 km from Bagamoyo: Kiwangwa, Fukayosi, and Yombo. Methods: A total of 63,237 children under-five presenting to Bagamoyo District Hospital and the three rural health facilities participated in the study. Anthropometric measures of age, height/length and weight and measurements of mid-upper arm circumference were obtained and compared with reference anthropometric indices to assess nutritional status for patients presenting to the hospital and health facilities. Results: Overall proportion of stunting, underweight and wasting was 8.37, 5.74 and 1.41 % respectively. Boys were significantly more stunted, under weight and wasted than girls (p-value < 0.05). Children aged 24-59 months were more underweight than 6-23 months (p-value = < 0.0001). But, there was no statistical significance difference between the age groups for stunting and wasting. Children from rural areas experienced increased rates of stunting, underweight and wasting than children in urban areas (p-value < 0.05). The results of this study concur with other studies that malnutrition remains a problem within Tanzania; however our data suggests that the population presenting to BDH and rural health facilities presented with decreased rates of malnutrition compared to the general population. Conclusions: Hospital and facility attending populations of under-five children in and around Bagamoyo suffer moderately high rates of malnutrition. Current nutrition programs focus on education for at risk children and referral to regional hospitals for malnourished children. Even though the general population has even greater malnutrition than the population presenting at the hospital, in areas of high malnutrition, hospital-based interventions should also be considered as centralized locations for reaching thousands of malnourished children under-five.

Medical discoveries are frequently licensed exclusively to one producer, allowing a monopoly and inequitable pricing. Similarly, research is often published in ways that make it inaccessible. Universities can adopt policies and practices to overcome neglect and ensure equitable access to research and its products. Methods: For 25 United Kingdom universities, data on health research funding were extracted from the top five United Kingdom funders' databases and coded as research on neglected diseases (NDs) and/or health in low-and lower-middle-income countries (hLLMIC). Data on intellectual property licensing policies and practices and open-access policies were obtained from publicly available sources and by direct contact with universities. Proportions of research articles published as open-access were extracted from PubMed and PubMed Central. Results: Across United Kingdom universities, the median proportion of 2011-2014 health research funds attributable to ND research was 2.6% and for hLLMIC it was 1.7%. Overall, 79% of all ND funding and 74% of hLLMIC funding were granted to the top four institutions within each category. Seven institutions had policies to ensure that technologies developed from their research are affordable globally. Mostly, universities licensed their inventions to third parties in a way that confers monopoly rights. Fifteen institutions had an institutional open-access publishing policy; three had an institutional open-access publishing fund. The proportion of health-related articles with full-text versions freely available online ranged from 58% to 100% across universities (2012-2013); 23% of articles also had a creative commons CC-BY license. Conclusion: There is wide variation in the amount of global health research undertaken by United Kingdom universities, with a large proportion of total research funding awarded to a few institutions. To meet a level of research commitment in line with the global burden of disease, most universities should seek to expand their research activity. Most universities do not license their intellectual property in a way that is likely to encourage access in resource-poor settings, and lack policies to do so. The majority of recent research publications are published open-access, but not as gold standard (CC-BY) open-access.

J	Bates, I; John, C; Bruno, A; Fu, P; Aliabadi, S				Bates, Ian; John, Christopher; Bruno, Andreia; Fu, Pamela; Aliabadi, Shirin			An analysis of the global pharmacy workforce capacity	HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH			English	Article						Pharmacy workforce; Global; Capacity; Healthcare		Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there is a global healthcare workforce shortage of 7.2 million, which is predicted to grow to 12.9 million by 2035. Globally, people are living longer with multiple co-morbidities and require increased access and use of medicines. Pharmacists are a key component of the healthcare workforce, and in many countries, pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare profession. This paper identifies key issues and current trends affecting the global pharmacy workforce, in particular workforce distribution, country economic status, capacity, and workforce gender balance. Methods: National professional pharmacy leadership bodies, together with other contacts for professional bodies, regulatory bodies, and universities, were approached to provide country-level data on pharmacy workforce. A descriptive and comparative analysis was conducted to assess each country's pharmacy workforce. Results: A total of 89 countries and territories responded to the survey. To standardise the capacity measure, an analysis of the population density of pharmacists (per 10 000 population) was performed. The sample mean was 6 pharmacists per 10 000 population (n = 80). There is considerable variation between the surveyed countries/ territories ranging from 0.02 (Somalia) to 25.07 (Malta) pharmacists per 10 000 population. African nations have significantly fewer pharmacists per capita. Pharmacist density correlates with gross national income (GNI) and health expenditure. The majority of pharmacists are employed in community settings, followed by hospital, industry-related, academia, and regulation. There is a greater proportion of females in the pharmacy workforce globally, with some WHO regions showing female representation of more than 65 % with an increasing trend trajectory. Conclusions: Pharmacy workforce capacity varies considerably between countries and regions and generally correlates with population-and country-level economic indicators. Those countries and territories with lower economic indicators tend to have fewer pharmacists and pharmacy technicians; this has implications for inequalities regarding access to medicines and medicine expertise.

Implementing international sexual counselling guidelines in hospital cardiac rehabilitation: development of the CHARMS intervention using the Behaviour Change Wheel	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Behaviour change; Intervention development; Complex intervention; Implementation; Cardiac rehabilitation; Cardiovascular disease; Sexual counselling	AMERICAN-HEART-ASSOCIATION; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; GENERAL-PRACTITIONER; CONSENSUS DOCUMENT; ESC COUNCIL; HEALTH; QUALITY; INDIVIDUALS; MANAGEMENT; PARTNERS	Background: Decreased sexual activity and sexual problems are common among people with cardiovascular disease, negatively impacting relationship satisfaction and quality of life. International guidelines recommend routine delivery of sexual counselling to cardiac patients. The Cardiac Health and Relationship Management and Sexuality (CHARMS) baseline study in Ireland found, similar to international findings, limited implementation of sexual counselling guidelines in practice. The aim of the current study was to develop the CHARMS multi-level intervention to increase delivery of sexual counselling by healthcare professionals. We describe the methods used to develop the CHARMS intervention following the three phases of the Behaviour Change Wheel approach: understand the behaviour, identify intervention options, and identify content and implementation options. Survey (n = 60) and focus group (n = 14) data from two previous studies exploring why sexual counselling is not currently being delivered were coded by two members of the research team to understand staff's capability, opportunity, and motivation to engage in the behaviour. All potentially relevant intervention functions to change behaviour were identified and the APEASE (affordability, practicability, effectiveness, acceptability, side effects and equity) criteria were used to select the most appropriate. The APEASE criteria were then used to choose between all behaviour change techniques (BCTs) potentially relevant to the identified functions, and these BCTs were translated into intervention content. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was used to specify details of the intervention including the who, what, how and where of proposed intervention delivery. Results: Providing sexual counselling group sessions by cardiac rehabilitation staff to patients during phase III cardiac rehabilitation was identified as the target behaviour. Education, enablement, modelling, persuasion and training were selected as appropriate intervention functions. Twelve BCTs, linked to intervention functions, were identified for inclusion and translated into CHARMS intervention content. Conclusions: This paper details the use of Behaviour Change Wheel approach to develop an implementation intervention in an under-researched area of healthcare provision. The systematic and transparent development of the CHARMS intervention will facilitate the evaluation of intervention effectiveness and future replication and contribute to the advancement of a cumulative science of implementation intervention design.

Many of these deaths are due to postpartum haemorrhage and are preventable with access to essential obstetric care. Where there are barriers to access, maternal deaths could be prevented if community-level misoprostol was available. The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions of stakeholders regarding misoprostol use in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, a setting with high maternal mortality. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 35 stakeholders in the capital, Vientiane and in one northern province identified as a site for a possible intervention. The sample included international and national stakeholders involved in policy-making and providing maternal and reproductive health services. Findings Most stakeholders supported a pilot program for community distribution of misoprostol but levels of awareness of the drug's use in preventing postpartum haemorrhage and level of influence over policy direction varied considerably. Some international organizations, all identified as powerful in influencing policy, were ambivalent about the use of community distribution of misoprostol. Concerns related to the capacity of village health workers or lay people to safely administer misoprostol, whether its distribution would undermine efforts to improve access to safe delivery services and active management of the third stage of labour, the ease with which prescription drugs can be bought over the counter, and technical, logistical, and financial constraints. Conclusion Access to appropriate oxytocic drugs is a matter of health equity. In settings without access to essential obstetrical care, misoprostol represents a viable solution for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage. Understanding stakeholders' perspectives and their legitimate concerns on misoprostol can inform interventions in order to assuage these concerns and enable disadvantaged women to access misoprostol and its potentially life-saving benefits.

J	Clark, R				Clark, Rob			Examining Mobility in International Development	SOCIAL PROBLEMS			English	Article						economic growth; inequality; international development; mobility; world system	WORLD-SYSTEM POSITION; NETWORK ANALYSIS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INCOME; INEQUALITY; TRADE; GLOBALIZATION; CONVERGENCE; EXPANSION; EDUCATION	International development scholars routinely test for convergence across a range of outcomes, including income, health, and education. However, the extent to which countries have reordered themselves along the development hierarchy receives less attention. Accordingly, the present analysis features a systematic examination of cross-national mobility in international development. I first introduce a generic model of mobility in which country-level movement is a function of several factors, including initial inequality, growth dynamics, and temporal span. I then show that observed mobility rates across several development indicators (gross domestic product per capita [GDP PC], human development index [HDI], and life expectancy) are significantly lower than what the generic model predicts. An investigation of longitudinal trends shows that mobility rates have been declining since the 1980s and that the discrepancy between expected and observed mobility has grown wider during this time. Mobility rates appear to be hindered by the lack of large-scale mobility among upper tier countries (where mobility patterns are more favorable than expected) and lower tier countries (where mobility patterns are less favorable than expected). Overall, the results are consistent with propositions derived from world-system theory regarding the relative stability of the core/periphery hierarchy. In sum, the analysis of mobility can serve as a useful complement to existing research and produces an image of development and change not typically found in convergence studies.

The aim of the study was to analyze the insight of nine core dimensions of Polish PC system: "Economic conditions", "Workforce", "Accessibility", "Comprehensiveness", "Continuity", "Coordination", "Quality of care","Efficiency" and "Equity" and to identify the characteristics of the providing physicians that influence their perception of the quality of care. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted as part of an international QUALICOPC project. In Poland a nationally representative sample of 220 PC physicians was selected from the database of Polish National Health Fund by a stratified random sampling procedure. The research tool was a standardized 64-item questionnaire. Each of the respondents' answers were assigned a numerical value ranging from-1 (extremely negative) to +1 (extremely positive). The quality indicators were calculated as an arithmetic mean of variables representing particular PC dimensions. Results: The mean scores for the majority of the dimensions had negative values. Accessibility of care was perceived as the best dimension, while the economic conditions were evaluated most negatively. Only a small part of variation in quality evaluation could be explained by physicians' characteristics. Conclusions: The negative evaluation of primary care reflects the growing crisis in the health care system in Poland. There is an urgent need to apply complex recovery measures to improve the quality of primary care.

A Model for Enhancing Midwifery Education With a Global Health Certificate	JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH			English	Article						global health; education; midwifery students; interdisciplinary collaboration	EXPERIENCE; WOMEN	Global health is centered on promoting health equity for all populations. There is a growing need for midwives to receive education in the field of global health in order to be equipped to care for diverse populations within the United States and internationally. Midwifery students benefit from the opportunity to complete global health coursework and a global health practicum, as these experiences help them learn how to reduce local and global health disparities through interdisciplinary collaboration and international partnerships. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of how a graduate certificate in global health can be used to enhance and enrich midwifery education. The article evaluates the numerous benefits of the global health certificate for midwifery students, and it discusses the logistical challenges of implementation, including potential areas for improvement. By collaborating together, midwifery education programs can expand the breadth of global health courses and practicum experiences available to midwifery students and prepare them to engage in global health projects that improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes in the United States and around the world.

We examined the potential for spatial clustering of swine CAFOs in certain parts of the state and used spatial regression techniques to determine the relationships of high swine concentrations to these EJ variables. We found that while swine CAFOs do cluster in certain regions and watersheds of Iowa, these high densities of swine are not associated with traditional EJ populations of low income and minority race/ethnicity. Instead, the potential for environmental injustice in the negative impacts of intensive swine production require a more complex appraisal. The clustering of swine production in watersheds, the presence of antibiotics used in swine production in public waterways, the clustering of manure spills, and other findings suggest that a more literal and figurative downstream approach is necessary. We document the presence and location of antibiotics used in animal production in the public waterways of the state. At the same time, we suggest a more upstream understanding of the structural, political and economic factors that create an environmentally unjust landscape of swine production in Iowa and the Upper Midwest is also crucial. Finally, we highlight the important role of publicly accessible and high quality data in the analysis of these upstream and downstream EJ questions.

Decision rules for allocation of finances to health systems strengthening	JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						Global health; Health systems strengthening; Resource allocation; Cost effectiveness analysis; Economic analysis	COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; CARE RESOURCES; SCOPE; PRIORITIZATION; EFFICIENCY; ECONOMIES; AFRICA; EQUITY; SCALE	A key dilemma in global health is how to allocate funds between disease-specific "vertical projects" on the one hand and "horizontal programmes" which aim to strengthen the entire health system on the other. While economic evaluation provides a way of approaching the prioritisation of vertical projects, it provides less guidance on how to prioritise between horizontal and vertical spending. We approach this problem by formulating a mathematical program which captures the complementary benefits of funding both vertical projects and horizontal programmes. We show that our solution to this math program has an appealing intuitive structure. We illustrate our model by computationally solving two specialised versions of this problem, with illustrations based on the problem of allocating funding for infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. We conclude by reflecting on how such a model may be developed in the future and used to guide empirical data collection and theory development. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

The present study examined the prevalent trends in overweight and obesity among rural children and adolescents over the past 29 years (1985-2014) in Shandong, China. Methods Data for this study were obtained from six cross-sectional surveys (1985, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014) of schoolchildren in Shandong Province, China. A total of 27,840 rural students aged 7-18 years were included in this study. Body mass index cut-off points recommended by the Working Group on Obesity in China (WGOC), the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) were used to define overweight and obesity. Results The prevalence of overweight and obesity has been increasing continually in rural areas over the past 29 years (1985-2014). Using WGOC criteria, for boys, the prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 0.74% and 0.03% in 1985 to 16.35% and 17.20% in 2014, and for girls it increased from 1.45% and 0.12% in 1985 to 13.91% and 9.11% in 2014, respectively. A similar increasing trend was observed by IOTF and WHO criteria. Conclusion The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents in Shangdong rural areas increased rapidly between 1985 and 2014. Rural areas should not be neglected in obesity intervention, policy-makers and experts should pay more attention to the new tendency.

The present study examined the change trend of urban-rural disparity in childhood overweight and obesity from 1985 to 2014 in Shandong, China. Methods: Data for this study were obtained from four cross-sectional surveys of school children carried out in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2014 in Shandong Province, China. In this study, 39 943 students aged 7-18 years were included (14 458 in 1985, 7198 in 1995, 8568 in 2005 and 9719 in 2014). Height and weight of all subjects were measured; body mass index (BMI) was calculated from their height and weight. The BMI cutoff points recommended by the International Obesity Task Force were used to define overweight and obesity. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was increasing continuously both in urban and rural areas over the past 29 years (1985-2014). The prevalence of combined overweight and obesity was significantly higher in urban than in rural children and adolescents in 1985, 1995 and 2005 (p < 0.01). However, a rapid increase in the prevalence of combined overweight and obesity was observed in rural areas after 2005; as a result, the urban-rural disparity was getting narrower, and no significant urban-rural disparity was observed in 2014 (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The change trend of urban-rural disparity should be concerned in the future; policies and interventions focused on childhood overweight and obesity should pay attention to rural areas.

J	Pavel, CE				Pavel, Carmen E.			A LEGAL CONVENTIONALIST APPROACH TO POLLUTION	LAW AND PHILOSOPHY			English	Article							PROPERTY	There are no moral entitlements with respect to pollution prior to legal conventions that establish them, or so I will argue. While some moral entitlements precede legal conventions, pollution is part of a category of harms against interests that stands apart in this regard. More specifically, pollution is a problematic type of harm that creates liability only under certain conditions. Human interactions lead to harm and to the invasion of others' space regularly, and therefore we need an account of undue harm as a basis of assigning legal protections (rights) and obligations (duties) to different agents, which creates standards for holding those agents responsible for harm. Absent such positive standards with respect to pollution at the domestic or international level, it does not make sense to hold agents responsible. This fact has two fundamental implications. First, contrary to what some defenders of environmental justice argue, we cannot hold people responsible for polluting without a system of legal rights in place that assigns entitlements, protections, and obligations, and second, contrary to what opponents of environmental regulation claim, the lack of moral entitlements to pollute creates room for quite extensive legal restrictions on people's ability to pollute for the sake of the environment and human health. Indeed the scope of those restrictions is wide and open-ended.

Throughout these transitions, there has been a progressive population explosion and net ecosystem loss and degradation. Climate change now gathers pace, exacerbated by ecological dysfunction. Our health status has been challenged by a developing people-environment mismatch. We have regarded ecological conquest and innovative technology as solutions, but have not understood how ecologically dependent and integrated we are. We are ecological creatures interfaced by our sensoriness, microbiomes, shared regulatory (endocrine) mechanisms, immune system, biorhythms and nutritional pathways. Many of us are 'nature-deprived'. We now suffer what might be termed ecological health disorders (EHD). If there were less of us, nature's resilience might cope, but more than 9 billion people by 2050 is probably an intolerable demand on the planet. Future food must increasingly take into account the pressures on ecosystem-dependent food systems, with foods probably less biodiverse, although eating in this way allows optimal health; energy dysequilibrium with less physical activity and foods inappropriately energy dense; and less socially-conducive food habits. 'Personalised Nutrition', with extensive and resource-demanding nutrigenomic, metabolomic and microbiomic data may provide partial health solutions in clinical settings, but not be justified for ethical, risk management or sustainability reasons in public health. The globally prevalent multidimensional malnutritional problems of food insecurity, quality and equity require local, regional and global action to prevent further ecosystem degradation as well as to educate, provide sustainable livelihoods and encourage respectful social discourse and practice about the role of food.

Treating the host response to emerging virus diseases: lessons learned from sepsis, pneumonia, influenza and Ebola	ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Review						Emerging viruses; Ebola; influenza; sepsis; statins; angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs); angiopoietin (Angpt); angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); WHO	ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME; ACUTE LUNG INJURY; VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; ALVEOLAR EPITHELIAL-CELLS; TYPE-1 RECEPTOR BLOCKADE; SPECIAL-ISSUE SEPSIS; UP-REGULATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; STATIN THERAPY; HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER	There is an ongoing threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases that could be caused by influenza, Ebola or other emerging viruses. It will be difficult and costly to develop new drugs that target each of these viruses. Statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been effective in treating patients with sepsis, pneumonia and influenza, and a statin/ARB combination appeared to dramatically reduce mortality during the recent Ebola outbreak. These drugs target (among other things) the endothelial dysfunction found in all of these diseases. Most scientists work on new drugs that target viruses, and few accept the idea of treating the host response with generic drugs. A great deal of research will be needed to show conclusively that these drugs work, and this will require the support of public agencies and foundations. Investigators in developing countries should take an active role in this research. If the next Public Health Emergency of International Concern is caused by an emerging virus, a "top down" approach to developing specific new drug treatments is unlikely to be effective. However, a "bottom up" approach to treatment that targets the host response to these viruses by using widely available and inexpensive generic drugs could reduce mortality in any country with a basic health care system. In doing so, it would make an immeasurable contribution to global equity and global security.

Socioeconomic Deprivation and Survival After Heart Transplantation in England An Analysis of the United Kingdom Transplant Registry	CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES			English	Article						England; heart failure; heart transplantation; proportional hazards models	CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; LONG-TERM SURVIVAL; LUNG TRANSPLANTATION; INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY; FAILURE; HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; RECIPIENTS; INSURANCE; CARE	Background-Socioeconomic deprivation (SED) is associated with shorter survival across a range of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases. The association of SED with survival after heart transplantation in England, where there is universal healthcare provision, is unknown. Methods and Results-Long-term follow-up data were obtained for all patients in England who underwent heart transplantation between 1995 and 2014. We used the United Kingdom Index of Multiple Deprivation (UK IMD), a neighborhood level measure of SED, to estimate the relative degree of deprivation for each recipient. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between SED and overall survival and conditional survival (dependant on survival at 1 year after transplantation) during follow-up. Models were stratified by transplant center and adjusted for donor and recipient age and sex, ethnicity, serum creatinine, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure cause. A total of 2384 patients underwent heart transplantation. There were 1101 deaths during 17 040 patient-year follow-up. Median overall survival was 12.6 years, and conditional survival was 15.6 years. Comparing the most deprived with the least deprived quintile, adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 1.27 (1.04-1.55; P = 0.021) and 1.59 (1.22-2.09; P = 0.001) in the overall and conditional models, respectively. Median overall survival and conditional survival were 3.4 years shorter in the most deprived quintile than in the least deprived. Conclusions-Higher SED is associated with shorter survival in heart transplant recipients in England and should be considered when comparing outcomes between centers. Future research should seek to identify modifiable mediators of this association.	[Evans, Jonathan D. W.; Lewis, Clive; Parameshwar, K.

Local adaptations to a global health initiative: penalties for home births in Zambia	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Global health initiative; maternal health; Zambia; traditional leader; local adaptation; penalties	FACILITY-BASED DELIVERY; CARE; SERVICES; BARRIERS; UGANDA	Global health initiatives (GHIs) are implemented across a variety of geographies and cultures. Those targeting maternal health often prioritise increasing facility delivery rates. Pressure on local implementers to meet GHI goals may lead to unintended programme features that could negatively impact women. This study investigates penalties for home births imposed by traditional leaders on women during the implementation of Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) in Zambia. Forty focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted across four rural districts to assess community experiences of SMGL at the conclusion of its first year. Participants included women who recently delivered at home (3 FGDs/district), women who recently delivered in a health facility (3 FGDs/district), community health workers (2 FGDs/district) and local leaders (2 FGDs/district). Findings indicate that community leaders in some districts-independently of formal programme directive-used fines to penalise women who delivered at home rather than in a facility. Participants in nearly all focus groups reported hearing about the imposition of penalties following programme implementation. Some women reported experiencing penalties firsthand, including cash and livestock fines, or fees for child health cards that are typically free. Many women who delivered at home reported their intention to deliver in a facility in the future to avoid penalties. While communities largely supported the use of penalties to promote facility delivery, the penalties effectively introduced a new tax on poor rural women and may have deterred their utilization of postnatal and child health care services. The imposition of penalties is thus a punitive adaptation that can impose new financial burdens on vulnerable women and contribute to widening health, economic and gender inequities in communities. Health initiatives that aim to increase demand for health services should monitor local efforts to achieve programme targets in order to better understand their impact on communities and on overall programme goals.

Methods: Data collected through repeated cross-sectional surveys conducted in the Kassena-Nankana east and west districts from 2003-2009 were used in a secondary analysis. All childbirths that occurred in this period were included. Univariate time series were used to describe trends in home deliveries. Significant trends were investigated using the X-2 test for trends, and changes in inequalities across subgroups were assessed by fitting simple linear regressions. Results: A total of 25 539 deliveries were recorded, of which 58.1% occurred at home. The incidence of home deliveries declined from 69.1% in 2003 to 36.5% in 2009 (P < 0.001). This declining pattern was consistently observed within all subgroups defined by wealth index, and educational and residential status. Larger declines were observed in poor and rural residents compared with rich and urban residents (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The incidence of home deliveries halved during the study period and there was a significant reduction in previous inequalities.

Methods: We analysed data on 1925 adults aged 16-65 years, from the East London Oral Health Inequality (ELOHI) Study, which included a random sample of adults living in an ethnically diverse and socially deprived area. Participants completed a questionnaire and were clinically examined for the number of teeth with periodontal pocket depth (PPD)>= 4 mm and loss of attachment (LOA)>= 4 mm. Ethnic inequalities in periodontal measures were assessed in negative binomial regression models before and after adjustment for demographic (gender and age groups) and SEP indicators (education and socioeconomic classification). Results: Compared to White British, Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi and Asian Others had more teeth with PPD >= 4 mm whereas White East European, Black African and Bangladeshi had more teeth with LOA >= 4 mm, after adjustments for demographic and SEP measures. The association of ethnicity with periodontal disease was moderated by education, but not by socioeconomic classification. Stratified analysis showed that ethnic disparities in the two periodontal measures were limited to more educated groups. Conclusion: This study showed considerable ethnic disparities in periodontal disease between and within the major ethnic categories.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Narrative review conducted at Piedmont Heart Institute, United States. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched for stroke AND "Latin America" AND epidemiology (between January 2009 and March 2015). Further studies in the SciELO, World Health Organization and Pan-American Health Organization databases were used to address specific points. RESULTS: Countries categorized as low or middle-income nations by the World Bank, which includes most of Latin America, account for two-thirds of all strokes. Globally, fewer than half of patients (median treatment level: 43.9%) with atrial fibrillation receive adequate anticoagulation to reduce stroke risk, which correlates with data from Latin America, where 46% of outpatients did not receive guideline-compliant anticoagulation, ranging from 41.8% in Brazil to 54.8% in Colombia. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation-related stroke carries a heavy burden. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anti-coagulants provide options for reducing the risk of atrial fibrillation-related stroke. However, cost-effectiveness comparisons with warfarin are warranted before observational health-economics study results can be applied clinically. Initiatives to remedy inequalities and improve access to care across Latin America should accompany risk factor modification and guideline-based prevention.

Examples of action are cited in the four main areas of global threats: planetary climate change, global divides and inequity, global insecurity and violent conflicts, and global instability and financial crises. In conclusion, a stable health systems policy framework would greatly enhance success. However, such organizational framework dries out if not linked to public debates channeling fresh thoughts and controversial proposals: the structural stabilization is essential but has to serve not to dominate bottom-up activities. In other words, a horizontal management is required, a balanced equilibrium between bottom-up initiative and top-down support. Last but not least, rewarding voluntary and charity work by public acknowledgment is essential.

TLTL describes care with inadequate resources, below evidence-based standards, or care withheld or unavailable until too late to help. TLTL is an underlying problem associated with high maternal mortality and morbidity. TMTS describes the routine over-medicalisation of normal pregnancy and birth. TMTS includes unnecessary use of non-evidence-based interventions, as well as use of interventions that can be life saving when used appropriately, but harmful when applied routinely or overused. As facility births increase, so does the recognition that TMTS causes harm and increases health costs, and often concentrates disrespect and abuse. Although TMTS is typically ascribed to high-income countries and TLTL to low-income and middle-income ones, social and health inequities mean these extremes coexist in many countries. A global approach to quality and equitable maternal health, supporting the implementation of respectful, evidence-based care for all, is urgently needed. We present a systematic review of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for routine antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care, categorising them as recommended, recommended only for clinical indications, and not recommended. We also present prevalence data from middle-income countries for specific clinical practices, which demonstrate TLTL and increasing TMTS. Health-care providers and health systems need to ensure that all women receive high-quality, evidence-based, equitable and respectful care. The right amount of care needs to be offered at the right time, and delivered in a manner that respects, protects, and promotes human rights.

However, a disproportionate burden of COPD occurs in people of low socioeconomic status (SES) due to differences in health behaviors, sociopolitical factors, and social and structural environmental exposures. Tobacco use, occupations with exposure to inhalant toxins, and indoor biomass fuel (BF) exposure are more common in low SES populations. Not only does SES affect the risk of developing COPD and etiologies, it is also associated with worsened COPD health outcomes. Effective interventions in these people are needed to decrease these disparities. Efforts that may help lessen these health inequities in low SES include 1) better surveillance targeting diagnosed and undiagnosed COPD in disadvantaged people, 2) educating the public and those involved in health care provision about the disease, 3) improving access to cost-effective and affordable health care, and 4) markedly increasing the efforts to prevent disease through smoking cessation, minimizing use and exposure to BF, and decreasing occupational exposures. COPD is considered to be one the most preventable major causes of death from a chronic disease in the world; therefore, effective interventions could have a major impact on reducing the global burden of the disease, especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.

J	Komp, K; Johansson, S				Komp, Kathrin; Johansson, Stina			Population ageing in a lifecourse perspective: developing a conceptual framework	AGEING & SOCIETY			English	Article						population ageing; demography; lifecourse; social inequalities; long-term effects; model; theory; Germany	2ND DEMOGRAPHIC-TRANSITION; LIFE-COURSE; WELFARE-STATE; INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; GERMANY; FERTILITY; EUROPE; COUNTRIES; HEALTH; AGE	Population ageing is a global trend that affects individual life plans, family arrangements, market structures, care provisions and pension schemes. We combine insights from demography and lifecourse research to understand better the causes of population ageing. Demography explains population ageing by describing changes in fertility, mortality and migration rates. Lifecourse research argues that these rates are interconnected because they are embedded in the lifecourses of individuals. An individual's experiences at an early age can influence behaviours at a later age, thereby creating continuity throughout the lifecourse. Additionally, lifecourse research underlines that social networks - such as families - and countries influence lifecourse. Thus, historical events and past experiences have already set the course for today's demographic changes. Moreover, the effects of policies that strive to influence population ageing will not be evident for years or even decades to come. This paper introduces a conceptual framework that explains how the lifecourse perspective can be applied to the phenomenon of population ageing and illustrates the framework through a case study of Germany. The case study highlights that insights from the micro-, meso- and macro-levels need to be combined to achieve a deeper understanding of population ageing. Scholars can use the framework presented in this paper as a guideline for merging arguments from demography and lifecourse research in future studies.

J	Graham, GN				Graham, Garth N.			Why Your ZIP Code Matters More Than Your Genetic Code: Promoting Healthy Outcomes from Mother to Child	BREASTFEEDING MEDICINE			English	Article								Health equity has long been the dominant theme in the work of the Aetna Foundation. Recent data have focused on disparities through another lens, particularly the correlation between where people live (i.e., ZIP code) and their quality-and length-of life. In various cities across America, average life expectancies in certain communities are 20-30 years shorter than those mere miles away. In general, health disparities are founded on a complex interplay of racial, economic, educational, and other social factors. For example, breastfeeding rates in the United States differ significantly depending upon the race and income of the mother. Government policy makers are acutely aware of these disparities, but recent health system reforms have focused predominately on the processes used to administer, finance, and deliver care. What is needed is an approach that considers the health and wellness of all people in a geographic area, beyond established patients, and that measures more than clinical factors-such as genetics, environmental health, social circumstances, and individual behaviors. Solutions also must extend beyond the traditional healthcare arena. In particular, novel technological innovations show promise to bridge gaps between our healthcare capabilities and the needs of underserved populations. Digital tools are poised to revolutionize measurement, diagnostics, treatment, and global aspect of our healthcare system. The Aetna Foundation views technology as a core strategy in reducing health inequities through an approach that addresses both clinical and social factors in populations to dismantle the persistent paradigm of ZIP code as personal health destiny.

J	O'Sullivan, D				O'Sullivan, Dominic			Indigenous health: Capabilities and freedom	ETHNICITIES			English	Article						Capabilities approach to development; Indigenous citizenship; differentiated citizenship; Indigenous self-determination; Indigenous politics	SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; SELF-DETERMINATION; POLITICS	The life expectancy differential between Indigenous and other Australians is in the order of 11 years and requires far-reaching, complex and multifaceted policy responses. Theories and instruments of international human rights are among those that have helped to shape responsive policy discourses. Developing these often abstract rights into people's substantive capacities to make meaningful choices about how they will live is difficult, but the article shows how this is possible with reference to a general theory of capabilities as self-determination. Such a theory, proceeds from Sen and Nussbaum's extension of Aristotle's concern for human flourishing' where the political right to self-determination, affirmed at international law, presumes certain essentialist capabilities to secure, people's political agency. These essentialist capabilities suggest a distribution of authority on the basis of equal opportunities to make choices of personal value, rather than just an egalitarian concern for equality of outcomes.

Health care system reform to improve access and quality is greatly needed to address this inequity. The inclusion of consumers of mental health services as co-investigators in research is likely to enhance service reform. In light of this, the current paper reviews mental health consumer focussed research conducted to date, addressing the neglect of physical health in mental health care and initiatives with the aim of improving physical health care. The international literature on physical healthcare in the context of mental health services was searched for articles, including mental health consumers in research roles, via Medline, CINAHL and Google Scholar, in October 2015. Four studies where mental health consumers participated as researchers were identified. Three studies involved qualitative research on barriers and facilitators to physical health care access, and a fourth study on developing technologies for more effective communication between GPs and patients. This review found that participatory mental health consumer research in physical health care reform has only become visible in the academic literature in 2015. Heightened consideration of mental health consumer participation in research is required by health care providers and researchers. Mental health nurses can provide leadership in increasing mental health consumer research on integrated care directed towards reducing the health gap between people with and without mental illness.

J	Smith, SL; Shiffman, J				Smith, Stephanie L.; Shiffman, Jeremy			Setting the global health agenda: The influence of advocates and ideas on political priority for maternal and newborn survival	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Global health; Policy agenda; Political priority; Networks; Framing; Maternal; Newborn	INTERNATIONAL NORM DYNAMICS; NEONATAL-MORTALITY; ATTENTION; EMERGENCE; NETWORKS	This study investigates a puzzle concerning global health priorities why do comparable issues receive differential levels of attention and resources? It considers maternal and neonatal mortality, two high burden issues that pertain to groups at risk at birth and whose lives could be saved with effective intrapartum care. Why did maternal survival gain status as a global health priority earlier and to a greater degree than newborn survival? Higher mortality and morbidity burdens among newborns and the cost-effectiveness of interventions would seem to predict that issue's earlier and higher prioritization. Yet maternal survival emerged as a priority two decades earlier and had attracted considerably more attention and resources by the close of the Millennium Development Goals era. This study uses replicative process-tracing case studies to examine the emergence and growth of political priority for these two issues, probing reasons for unexpected variance. The study finds that maternal survival's grounding as a social justice issue spurred growth of a strong and diverse advocacy network and aligned the issue with powerful international norms (e.g. expectations to advance women's rights and the Millennium Development Goals), drawing attention and resources to the issue over three decades. Newborn survival's disadvantage stems from its long status as an issue falling under the umbrellas of maternal and child survival but not fully adopted by these networks, and with limited appeal as a public health issue advanced by a small and technically focused network; network expansion and alignment with child survival norms have improved the issue's status in the past few years.

J	Kingori, P; Gerrets, R				Kingori, Patricia; Gerrets, Rene			Morals, morale and motivations in data fabrication: Medical research fieldworkers views and practices in two Sub-Saharan African contexts	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Fieldworkers; Data fabrication; Research integrity; Global health; Ethics; Morals; Morale; Motivation	SCIENTIFIC MISCONDUCT; PUBLIC-HEALTH; INTEGRITY; SCIENCE	Data fabrication, incorrect collection strategies and poor data management, are considered detrimental to high-quality scientific research. While poor data management have been occasionally excused, fabrication constitutes a cardinal sin scientific misconduct. Scholarly examinations of fabrication usually seek to expose and capture its prevalence and, less frequently, its consequences and causes. Most accounts centre on high-income countries, individual senior researchers and scientists who are portrayed as irrational, immoral or deceptive. We argue that such accounts contain limitations in overlooking data collected in 'the field', in low-income countries, by junior researchers and non-scientists. Furthermore, the processes and motivations for fabrication and subversive practices are under-examined. Drawing on two separate ethnographies, conducted in 2004-2009 in medical research projects in sub-Saharan Africa, this paper investigates fabrication among fieldworkers using data from observations and informal conversations, 68 interviews and 7 Focus Group Discussions involving diverse stakeholders. Based on an interpretative approach, we examined fieldworkers' accounts that fabrications were motivated by irreconcilable moral concerns, faltering morale resulting from poor management, and inadequate institutional support. To fieldworkers, data fabrication constituted a 'tool' for managing their quotidian challenges. Fabrications ranged from active to passive acts, to subvert, resist and readdress tensions deriving from employment inequalities and challenging socio-economic conditions. We show that geographical and hierarchical distance between high-ranking research actors and fieldworkers in contemporary configurations of international medical research can compartmentalise, and ultimately undermine, the relationships necessary to produce high-quality data. In focusing on fieldworkers, we argue for the inclusion of wide-ranging perspectives in examinations of data fabrication. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Baird, K				Baird, Katherine			High Out-of-Pocket Medical Spending among the Poor and Elderly in Nine Developed Countries	HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Out-of-pocket; insurance design; financing equity; access; international comparison	HEALTH-CARE; BURDEN; ACCESS; INCOME; INEQUALITIES; HOUSEHOLDS; ADHERENCE; SERVICES; DISEASE; EQUITY	Objective. The design of health insurance, and the role out-of-pocket (OOP) payments play in it, is a key policy issue as rising health costs have encouraged greater cost-sharing measures. This paper compares the percentage of Americans spending large amounts OOP to meet their health needs with percentages in eight other developed countries. By disaggregating by age and income, the paper focuses on the poor and elderly populations within each. Data Source. The study uses nationally representative household survey data made available through the Luxembourg Income Study. It includes nations with high, medium, and low levels of OOP spending. Study Design. Households have high medical spending when their OOP expenditures exceed a threshold share of income. I calculate the share of each nation's population, as well as subpopulations within it, with high OOP expenditures. Principal Findings. The United States is not alone in exposing large numbers of citizens to high OOP expenses. In six of the other eight countries, one-quarter or more of low-income citizens devoted at least 5 percent of their income to OOP expenses, and in all but two countries, more than 1 in 10 elderly citizens had high medical expenses. Conclusions. For some populations in the sample nations, health insurance does not provide adequate financial protection and likely contributes to inequities in health care delivery and outcomes.

This qualitative study was the first to use the Leffers and Mitchell Conceptual Model for Partnership and Sustainability in Global Health to elicit global host partners perspectives regarding effective collaboration for Canadian community health nursing placements in the Dominican Republic. Design and Sample: Focus group and semi-structured interview methodology was conducted with Dominican Republic (Dominican and Haitian) host partners (n = 23) about the engagement processes and host partner factors for effective partnership. Results: Dominican (83%) and Haitian (17%) participants, comprised similar numbers of male and female adults aged 18-60 years (mean age = 36 years), represented the full range of the Dominican Republic host partners (e. g., teachers, health professionals). Interpretive analysis revealed themes that included (1) the unique role of the cultural broker; (2) relational collaboration in a collective society; (3) reciprocal approaches that honor local expertise; and (4) contextual socioeconomic and cultural factors that influence partnerships. Conclusions: Future research and implications at the individual, community, and policy levels are discussed.

A sustainable social business financial model was used. The project is a collaboration between Glasgow Caledonian University and the Grameen Health Care Trust. It contributes to the UN development agenda, eradication of poverty, sustainability and the development of global partnerships. Background: There is an acute shortage of nurses in Bangladesh but many young women who wish to become nurses are unable to do so. Women are discriminated against, have few leadership opportunities and poverty affects large proportions of rural society. Development: The collaboration between the University and the Trust provides the necessary input to ensure a quality nursing programme. A business plan was developed, competency-based teaching introduced, infrastructure and financial management processes were set-up and an evaluation framework was put in place. Evaluation: The systems evaluation framework monitors the financial status of the College and the effects of the programme on students. The social business model, providing access to educational loans, has enabled 118 students to graduate into employment. The College is currently on target to be financially sustainable by 2016. Discussion: This project outlines a business model that tackles poverty, gender equality and contributes to the human resource deficit. Young women are equipped as change agents and leaders. Conclusion and implications for nursing and health policy: The social business model provides a mechanism for releasing funds for education to those who are impoverished. It provides a viable option for increasing the number of well-educated nurse leaders in developing countries.

We assessed the integration of FPS into routine care of HIV-infected mothers by evaluating the uptake and barriers of contraception and PMTCT services. Methods: We conducted an interventional study using the interrupted time series approach in the health care facilities located in Yaounde, Cameroon. First, structured questionnaires related to family planning use, PMTCT services use, and infection risk of the sexual partner were administered to the first trimester pregnant women who were HIV infected and living with uninfected partners. Second, 2 weeks before the delivery date, the women were interviewed according to the prior counseling interventions received, in order to assess their behavior on FPS, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, delivery option, and infant nourishment to be adopted. P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant in the statistical analyses. Results: Of 94 HIV-infected women, 69% were stable couples. Only 13% of women had attended FPS before conception. Although the vast majority were knowledgeable about modern and traditional contraception methods, only 19% had experienced effective contraceptive methods. However, 66% preferred condom use, 45% having three children still expressed a desire to conceive, while 44% reported abortions, 65% had tried to avoid the current pregnancy, and 12% of women were ART naive. Several predictors such as education, abortion rate, unplanned pregnancies, and partners' decision were associated with the nonuse of effective contraceptive methods. Moreover, barriers including sex inequity, lack of partner support, ART shortages, and lack of HIV viral load monitoring were prevalent among the participants (P=0.001). However FPS use, ART compliance, and safe options to PMTCT significantly increased after the educational counseling interventions (P=0.001). Conclusion: Scaling up the FPS by incorporating routine PMTCT services into reproductive health care should contribute to preventing both horizontal and vertical transmission of HIV.

However, studies that have investigated this association have been limited in their national scope, have analyzed different components of SES separately, and have not used standardized definitions or measurements across populations. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between SES and depression across three European countries that represent different regions across Europe, using standardized procedures and measurements and a composite score for SES. Method: Nationally-representative data on 10,800 individuals aged >= 18 from the Collaborative Research on Ageing in Europe (COURAGE) survey conducted in Finland, Poland and Spain were analyzed in this cross-sectional study. An adapted version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to identify the presence of depression, and SES was computed by using the combined scores of the total number of years educated (0-22) and the quintiles of the country-specific income level of the household (1-5). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between SES and depression. Results: Findings reveal a significant association between depression and SES across all countries (p <= 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, the odds of depression were significantly decreased for every unit increase in the SES index for Finland, Poland and Spain. Additionally, higher education significantly decreased the odds for depression in each country, but income did not. Conclusion: The SES index seems to predict depression symptomatology across European countries. Taking SES into account may be an important factor in the development of depression prevention strategies across Europe.

Forecasted trends in vaccination coverage and correlations with socioeconomic factors: a global time-series analysis over 30 years	LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							MATERNAL EDUCATION; DECISION-MAKING; WESTERN KENYA; IMMUNIZATION; CHILDREN; TRUST; INEQUALITIES; DETERMINANTS; PERCEPTION; CONFIDENCE	Background Incomplete immunisation coverage causes preventable illness and death in both developing and developed countries. Identification of factors that might modulate coverage could inform effective immunisation programmes and policies. We constructed a performance indicator that could quantitatively approximate measures of the susceptibility of immunisation programmes to coverage losses, with an aim to identify correlations between trends in vaccine coverage and socioeconomic factors. Methods We undertook a data-driven time-series analysis to examine trends in coverage of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccination across 190 countries over the past 30 years. We grouped countries into six world regions according to WHO classifications. We used Gaussian process regression to forecast future coverage rates and provide a vaccine performance index: a summary measure of the strength of immunisation coverage in a country. Findings Overall vaccine coverage increased in all six world regions between 1980 and 2010, with variation in volatility and trends. Our vaccine performance index identified that 53 countries had more than a 50% chance of missing the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) target of 90% worldwide coverage with three doses of DTP (DTP3) by 2015. These countries were mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, but Austria and Ukraine also featured. Factors associated with DTP3 immunisation coverage varied by world region: personal income (Spearman's rho=0.66, p=0.0011) and government health spending (0.66, p<0.0001) were informative of immunisation coverage in the Eastern Mediterranean between 1980 and 2010, whereas primary school completion was informative of coverage in Africa (0.56, p<0.0001) over the same period. The proportion of births attended by skilled health staff correlated significantly with immunisation coverage across many world regions. Interpretation Our vaccine performance index highlighted countries at risk of failing to achieve the GVAP target of 90% coverage by 2015, and could aid policy makers' assessments of the strength and resilience of immunisation programmes. Weakening correlations with socioeconomic factors show a need to tackle vaccine confidence, whereas strengthening correlations point to clear factors to address. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

J	Greenberg, A; Kiddell-Monroe, R				Greenberg, Alexandra; Kiddell-Monroe, Rachel			ReRouting biomedical innovation: observations from a mapping of the alternative research and development (R&D) landscape	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Global health; Pharmaceutical innovation; Access to medicines; Biomedical research and development (R&D); Intellectual property		In recent years, the world has witnessed the tragic outcomes of multiple global health crises. From Ebola to high prices to antibiotic resistance, these events highlight the fundamental constraints of the current biomedical research and development (R&D) system in responding to patient needs globally. To mitigate this lack of responsiveness, over 100 self-identified "alternative" R&D initiatives, have emerged in the past 15 years. To begin to make sense of this panoply of initiatives working to overcome the constraints of the current system, UAEM began an extensive, though not comprehensive, mapping of the alternative biomedical R&D landscape. We developed a two phase approach: (1) an investigation, via the RE: Route Mapping, of both existing and proposed initiatives that claim to offer an alternative approach to R&D, and (2) evaluation of those initiatives to determine which are in fact achieving increased access to and innovation in medicines. Through phase 1, the RE: Route Mapping, we examined 81 initiatives that claim to redress the inequity perpetuated by the current system via one of five commonly recognized mechanisms necessary for truly alternative R&D. Preliminary analysis of phase 1 provides the following conclusions: 1. No initiative presents a completely alternative model of biomedical R&D. 2. The majority of initiatives focus on developing incentives for drug discovery. 3. The majority of initiatives focus on rare diseases or diseases of the poor and marginalized. 4. There is an increasing emphasis on the use of push, pull, pool, collaboration and open mechanisms alongside the concept of delinkage in alternative R&D. 5. There is a trend towards public funding and launching of initiatives by the Global South. Given the RE: Route Mapping's inevitable limitations and the assumptions made in its methodology, it is not intended to be the final word on a constantly evolving and complex field; however, its findings are significant. The Mapping's value lies in its timely and unique insight into the importance of ongoing efforts to develop a new global framework for biomedical R&D. As we progress to phase 2, an evaluation tool for initiatives focused on identifying which approaches have truly achieved increased innovation and access for patients, we aim to demonstrate that there are a handful of initiatives which represent some, but not all, of the building blocks for a new approach to R&D. Through this mapping and our forthcoming evaluation, UAEM aims to initiate an evidence-based conversation around a truly alternative biomedical R&D model that serves people rather than profits.

J	Hushie, M				Hushie, Martin			Public-non-governmental organisation partnerships for health: an exploratory study with case studies from recent Ghanaian experience	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Public-non-governmental organisation partnerships; Ghana; Health reforms; Health sector; Global health; Qualitative research	NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS; SERVICES; NGOS	Background: The last few decades have seen a dramatic increase in public-non-governmental organisation (NGO) partnerships in the health sector of many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) as a means of improving the public's health. However, little research has focused to date on the nature, facilitators and barriers of these partnerships. Methods: In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 17 participants from five different NGOs and their collaboration with state partners in the Ghanaian health sector at the national and local levels in four regions of the country (Northern, Upper East, Greater Accra, and Eastern) to explore the drivers and nature of these partnerships and their advantages and disadvantages in the effort to improve the public's health. Results: Major findings reveal that: 1) each collaboration between civil society organisations (CSOs) and the state in the health sector demands different partnerships; 2) partnership types can range from equal, formal contractual, decentralized to advocacy ones; 3) commitment by the state and NGOs to work in collaboration lead to improved service delivery, reduced health inequities and disparities; 4) added value of NGOs lies in their knowledge, expertise, community legitimacy, ability to attract donor funding and implementation capacity to address health needs in geographical areas or communities where the government does not reach and for services, which it does not provide and 5) success factors and challenges to be considered, moving forward to promote such partnerships in other LMICs. Conclusions: Recommendations are offered for NGOs, governments, donors, and future research including studying the organisational effectiveness and sustainability of these partnerships to deliver effective and efficient health outcomes to recommend universal best practices in health care.

The impact of cigarette smoking on life expectancy between 1980 and 2010: a global perspective	TOBACCO CONTROL			English	Article						Global health; Smoking Caused Disease; Low; Middle income country; Disparities	ATTRIBUTABLE MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; TOBACCO; TRENDS; COUNTRIES; COHORT; INEQUALITIES; HAZARDS; DEATHS	Introduction Tobacco smoking is among the leading causes of preventable mortality worldwide. We assessed the impact of smoking on life expectancy worldwide between 1980 and 2010. Methods We retrieved cause-specific mortality data from the WHO Mortality Database by sex, year and age for 63 countries with high or moderate quality data (1980-2010). Using the time of the peak of the smoking epidemic by country, relative risks from the three waves of the Cancer Prevention Study were applied to calculate the smoking impact ratio and population attributable fraction. Finally, we estimated the potential gain in life expectancy at age 40 if smoking-related deaths in middle age (40-79years) were eliminated. Results Currently, tobacco smoking is related to approximately 20% of total adult mortality in the countries in this study (24% in men and 12% in women). If smoking-related deaths were eliminated, adult life expectancy would increase on average by 2.4years in men (0.1 in Uzbekistan to 4.8years in Hungary) and 1year in women (0.1 in Kyrgyzstan to 2.9years in the USA). The proportion of smoking-related mortality among men has declined in most countries, but has increased in the most populous country in the world, that is, China from 4.6% to 7.3%. Increases in the impact of tobacco on life expectancy were observed among women in high-income countries. Conclusions Recent trends indicate a substantial rise in the population-level impact of tobacco smoking on life expectancy in women and in middle-income countries. High-quality local data are needed in most low-income countries.

The emergence of artemisinin resistance of Plasmodium falciparum strains in the Greater Mekong Subregion is a matter of great concern. China has effectively controlled cross-border transmission of malaria and artemisinin resistance of P. falciparum along the China-Myanmar border. Methods: A combined quantitative and qualitative study was used to collect data, and then an integrated impact evaluation was conducted to malaria control along the China-Myanmar border during 2007-2013. Results: The parasite prevalence rate (PPR) in the five special regions of Myanmar was decreased from 13.6 % in March 2008 to 1.5 % in November 2013. Compared with the baseline (PPR in March 2008), the risk ratio was only 0.11 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.09-0. 14) in November 2013, which is equal to an 89 % reduction in the malaria burden. Annual parasite incidence (API) across 19 Chinese border counties was reduced from 19.6 per 10 000 person-years in 2006 to 0.9 per 10 000 person-years in 2013. Compared with the baseline (API in 2006), the API rate ratio was only 0.05(95 % CI, 0.04-0.05) in 2013, which equates to a reduction of the malaria burden by 95.0 %. Meanwhile, the health service system was strengthened and health inequity of marginalized populations reduced along the international border. Conclusion: The effective collaboration between China, Myanmar and the international non-governmental organization promptly carried out the core interventions through simplified processes. The integrated approaches dramatically decreased malaria burden of Chinese-Myanmar border.

The objective of this study is to assess the infrastructure and staffing of publicly financed labor and birth care in Brazil and its adequacy according to clinical and obstetric conditions potentially associated with obstetric emergencies. Methods: Nationwide cross-sectional hospital-based study "Birth in Brazil: national survey into labor and birth" conducted in 2011-2012. Data from 209 hospitals classified as public (public funding and management) or mixed (public or private funding and private management) that generate estimates for 1148 Brazilian hospitals. Interview with hospital managers provided data for the structure adequacy assessment covering four domains: human resources, medications, equipment for women emergency care and support services. We conducted analysis of the structure adequacy rate according to type of hospital (public or mixed), availability of ICU and the woman obstetric risk using the X-2 test to detect differences in categorical variables with the level of statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results: Global rate of adequacy of 34.8 %: 42.2 % in public hospitals and 29.0 % in mixed hospitals (p < 0.001). Public and mixed hospitals with ICU had higher scores of adequacy than hospitals without ICU (73.3 % x 24.4 % public hospitals; 40.3 % x 10.6 % mixed hospitals). At a national level, 32.8 % of women with obstetric risk were cared for in hospitals without ICU and 29.5 % of women without risk were cared for in hospitals with ICU. Inequalities were observed with the North, Northeast and non-capital regions having the lower rates of hospitals with ICU. Conclusions: The majority of maternity wards across the country have a low rate of adequacy that can affect the quality of labor and birth care. This holds true for women at high obstetric risk, who suffer the possibility of having their care compromised by failures of hospital infrastructure, and for women at low obstetric risk, who may not receive the appropriate care to support the natural evolution of their labor when in a technological hospital environment.

Patients admitted to a university hospital for diagnosis and treatment of cancer provided data on their education, vocational training, income, employment, job, health insurance and postcode. Tumor stage was classified according to the Union International Contre le Cancer (UICC). To analyze disparities in the likelihood of late-stage (UICC III/IV vs. I/II) diagnoses, logistic regression models adjusting for age and gender were used. Out of 1,012 patients, 572 (59%) had late-stage cancer. Separately tested, increased odds of advanced disease were associated with post-compulsory education compared to college degrees, with apprenticeship and no vocational training, with unemployment, disability pension, jobs with a low hierarchy level, blue collar jobs and with low income. Health insurance and community size were not related with late-stage cancer. Jointly modelled, there was evidence for an independent effect of unemployment (odds ratio (OR) 1.7, CI 1.0-2.8), disability pension (OR 1.8, CI 1.0-3.2) and very low income (OR 2.6, CI 1.1-6.1) on the likelihood of advanced disease stage. It is of great concern that these socioeconomic gradients occur even in systems with equal access to health care.

J	Parker, M; Kingori, P				Parker, Michael; Kingori, Patricia			Good and Bad Research Collaborations: Researchers' Views on Science and Ethics in Global Health Research	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GOVERNANCE	There has been a dramatic rise in the scale and scope of collaborative global health research. A number of structural and scientific factors explain this growth and there has been much discussion of these in the literature. Little, if any, attention has been paid, however, to the factors identified by scientists and other research actors as important to successful research collaboration. This is surprising given that their decisions are likely to play a key role in the sustainability and effectiveness of global health research initiatives. In this paper, we report on qualitative research with leading scientists involved in major international research collaborations about their views on good and bad collaborations and the factors that inform their decision-making about joining and participating actively in research networks. We identify and discuss eight factors that researchers see as essential in judging the merits of active participation in global health research collaborations: opportunities for active involvement in cutting-edge, interesting science; effective leadership; competence of potential partners in and commitment to good scientific practice; capacity building; respect for the needs, interests and agendas of partners; opportunities for discussion and disagreement; trust and confidence; and, justice and fairness in collaboration. Our findings suggest that the sustainability and effectiveness of global health research collaborations has an important ethical or moral dimension for the research actors involved.

J	Ilie, S; Rose, P				Ilie, Sonia; Rose, Pauline			Is equal access to higher education in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa achievable by 2030?	HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Article						Higher education; International development; Educational access; Inequality; sub-Saharan Africa; South Asia	EXPANSION; EQUITY	Higher education is back in the spotlight, with post-2015 sustainable development goals emphasising equality of access. In this paper, we highlight the long distance still to travel to achieve the goal of equal access to higher education for all, with a focus on poorer countries which tend to have lower levels of enrolment in higher education. Analysing Demographic and Health Survey data from 35 low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, we show wide wealth inequalities in particular, with few if any of the poorest gaining access to higher education in some countries. We further identify that wealth and gender inequalities interact and tend to be wider in countries where levels of higher education are higher. This implies that expansion in access to higher education may predominantly benefit the rich, unless measures are taken to tackle inequalities. We find that that the rates of increase necessary for the attainment of the equal access goal by 2030 are particularly high. They pose a particularly difficult challenge given the access inequalities present from primary and secondary education in a wide majority of countries in our analysis. We therefore suggest that any measures aimed at attaining the goal need to tackle inequalities in access within a system-wide approach, focusing on the level of education at which inequalities initially manifest, alongside higher education.

We propose a radical egalitarian definition of the right to health as the basis for the discussion of a republican egalitarian perspective on bioethics that redefines autonomy and stresses the importance of equality, political participation, and the common good. The violations of the right to health in unrecognized Bedouin villages in Israel are analyzed to exemplify the possibilities opened by the republican egalitarian approach.

Findings from four types of MDFT studies are discussed: hybrid efficacy/effectiveness randomized controlled trials, therapy process studies, cost analyses, and implementation trials. This research has evaluated various versions of MDFT. These studies have systematically tested adaptations of MDFT for diverse treatment settings in different care sectors (mental health, substance abuse, juvenile justice, and child welfare), as well as adaptations according to treatment delivery features and client impairment level, including adolescents presenting with multiple psychiatric diagnoses. Many published scientific reviews, including meta-analyses, national and international government publications, and evidence-based treatment registries, offer consistent conclusions about the clinical effectiveness of MDFT compared with standard services as well as active treatments. The diverse and continuing MDFT research, the favorable, multi-source independent evaluations, combined with the documented receptivity of youth, parents, community-based clinicians and administrators, and national and international MDFT training programs (U.S.-based organization is MDFT International, www.mdft.org; and Europe-based organization is www.mdft.nl) all support the potential for continued transfer of MDFT to real-world clinical settings.

Although it is acknowledged that such movements are inevitable, given the current globalized economy, the movement of health professionals from their country of training raises questions about equity of access and quality of care. Concerns arise if migration occurs from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to high-income countries (HICs). The actions of HICs receiving medical practitioners from LMICs are examined through the global justice theories of John Rawls and Immanuel Kant. These theories were initially proposed by Pogge (1988) and Tan (1997) and, in this work, are extended to the issue of medical migration. Global justice theories propose that instead of looking at health needs and workforce issues within their national boundaries, HICs should be guided by principles of justice relevant to the needs of health systems on a global scale. Issues of individual justice are also considered within the framework of rights and social responsibilities of individual medical practitioners. Local and international policy changes are suggested based on both global justice theories and the ideals of individual justice.

J	Sivaramakrishnan, G; Sridharan, K				Sivaramakrishnan, Gowri; Sridharan, Kannan			CLINICAL TRIALS IN DENTISTRY: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION-INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY PLATFORM	JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED DENTAL PRACTICE			English	Article						Dental research; CAM; Evidence based dentistry	QUALITY	Introduction Clinical trials are the back bone for evidence-based practice (EBP) and recently EBP has been considered the best source of treatment strategies available. Clinical trial registries serve as databases of clinical trials. As regards to dentistry in specific data on the number of clinical trials and their quality is lacking. Hence, the present study was envisaged. Method Clinical trials registered in WHO-ICTRP (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/AdvSearch.aspx) in dental specialties were considered. The details assessed from the collected trials include: Type of sponsors; Health condition; Recruitment status; Study design; randomization, method of randomization and allocation concealment; Single or multi-centric; Retrospective or prospective registration; and Publication status in case of completed studies. Results A total of 197 trials were identified. Maximum trials were from United States (n = 30) and United Kingdom (n = 38). Seventy six trials were registered in Clinical Trials. gov, 54 from International Standards of Reporting Clinical Trials, 13 each from Australia and New Zealand Trial Register and Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials, 10 from German Clinical Trial Registry, eight each from Brazilian Clinical Trial Registry and Nederland's Trial Register, seven from Japan Clinical Trial Registry, six from Clinical Trial Registry of India and two from Hong Kong Clinical Trial Registry. A total of 78.7% studies were investigator-initiated and 64% were completed while 3% were terminated. Nearly four-fifths of the registered trials (81.7%) were interventional studies of which randomized were the large majority (94.4%) with 63.2% being open label, 20.4% using single blinding technique and 16.4% were doubled blinded. Conclusion The number, methodology and the characteristics of clinical trials in dentistry have been noted to be poor especially in terms of being conducted multicentrically, employing blinding and the method for randomization and allocation concealment. More emphasis has to be laid down on the quality of trials being conducted in order to provide justice in the name of EBP.

Animal nutrition in a 360-degree view and a framework for future R&D work: towards sustainable livestock production	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						feed and feeding; holistic animal nutrition; R&D framework; sustainable livestock production	SPECIAL TOPICS-MITIGATION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI O157-H7; NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; MANURE-AMENDED SOIL; DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION; SALMONELLA-ENTERICA; METHANE MITIGATION; PROTEIN; HEALTH; ACID	As a result of a growing population, national economies and urbanisation the consumption of animal products has risen sharply and will also rise substantially in the future, leading to a huge demand for animal feed. This paper illustrates that feed impacts almost all sectors and services of the livestock sector and its sustainability hinges on how feed is produced and fed. A 360-degree view of animal nutrition is presented, illustrating linkages between animal nutrition and various other domains of the livestock sector, for example productivity, reproductive efficiency, environment including biodiversity, land degradation and land-use change, animal welfare and health, food-fuel-feed competition, product safety and quality, among others. Based on the 360-degree view a framework for future research and development work in animal nutrition is presented. This framework has three components: the first one seeks better knowledge and in-depth analysis of the impact of feed and feeding on various domains of the livestock production system; the second one focuses on the impact of ongoing changes such as climate change, increases in cost of and volatility in feed prices, decreases in water and arable land availability, global trade of feedingstuffs, and high food losses; and the third one deals with providing solutions to challenges through technology, policy and institutional development measures. A multi- and trans-disciplinary approach is suggested for implementation of the framework. Application of the framework would contribute towards producing adequate, safe and nutritious food in a humane way in the face of rapid population growth; reducing impact on the environment and biodiversity; and promoting social equity.

J	Fusheini, A; Eyles, J				Fusheini, Adam; Eyles, John			Achieving universal health coverage in South Africa through a district health system approach: conflicting ideologies of health care provision	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Universal Health Coverage; District Health System; Inequity; Ideology; South Africa	HUMAN-RESOURCES; HOSPITALS; PATH	Background: Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has emerged as a major goal for health care delivery in the post-2015 development agenda. It is viewed as a solution to health care needs in low and middle countries with growing enthusiasm at both national and global levels. Throughout the world, however, the paths of countries to UHC have differed. South Africa is currently reforming its health system with UHC through developing a national health insurance (NHI) program. This will be practically achieved through a decentralized approach, the district health system, the main vehicle for delivering services since democracy. Methods: We utilize a review of relevant documents, conducted between September 2014 and December 2015 of district health systems (DHS) and UHC and their ideological underpinnings, to explore the opportunities and challenges, of the district health system in achieving UHC in South Africa. Results: Review of data from the NHI pilot districts suggests that as South Africa embarks on reforms toward UHC, there is a need for a minimal universal coverage and emphasis on district particularity and positive discrimination so as to bridge health inequities. The disparities across districts in relation to health profiles/demographics, health delivery performance, management of health institutions or district management capacity, income levels/socioeconomic status and social determinants of health, compliance with quality standards and above all the burden of disease can only be minimised through positive discrimination by paying more attention to underserved and disadavantaged communities. Conclusions: We conclude that in South Africa the DHS is pivotal to health reform and UHC may be best achieved through minimal universal coverage with positive discrimination to ensure disparities across districts in relation to disease burden, human resources, financing and investment, administration and management capacity, service readiness and availability and the health access inequalities are consciously implicated. Yet ideological and practical issues make its achievement problematic.

The latter is a global public health challenge. Very little is known about the social determinants of infant's frequency of free sugars intake, particularly in low-income countries. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the association between the frequency of free sugars intake among 1-year-old Syrian infants and each of parents' socioeconomic position (SEP), maternal frequency of free sugars intake and knowledge of infant's oral health behaviour. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, 323 1-year-old infants, attending vaccination clinics in 3 maternal and child health centres (MCHCs) in Damascus, Syria, were selected. A systematic random sampling was applied using the MCHCs' monthly vaccination registries. The 3 MCHCs were located in affluent, moderate and deprived areas. Infants' mothers completed a structured questionnaire on socio-demographics, infant's and mother's frequency of free sugars intake from cariogenic foods and beverages, and mother's knowledge about infant's oral health behaviour. Binary and multiple regression analyses were performed. The level of significance was set at 5 %. Results: The response rate was 100 %. Overall, 42.7 % of infants had high frequency of free sugars intake (>4times a day). Infants whose fathers were not working were more likely to have high frequency of free sugars intake. Similarly, infants whose mothers had low level of knowledge about infant's oral health behaviour, or high frequency of free sugars intake were more likely to have high frequency of free sugars intake. The association between father's occupation and infant's frequency of free sugars intake attenuated after adjustment for mother's knowledge and frequency of free sugars intake (adjusted OR = 1.5, 1.8, 3.2; 95% CI = 0.5-4.8, 1.1-3, 1.4-7.4; respectively). Conclusions: There are socioeconomic inequalities in the frequency of free sugars intake among Syrian 1-year-old infants. Integrated pre/post-natal interventions, targeting mothers from low SEP and aiming at reducing their free sugars intake and improving their knowledge about infant's oral health behaviour, will potentially reduce socioeconomic inequalities in infant's frequency of free sugars intake.

J	Malmqvist, E				Malmqvist, Erik			Does the ethical appropriateness of paying donors depend on what body parts they donate?	MEDICINE HEALTH CARE AND PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Assisted reproduction; Biomedical research; Donation; Ethics; Payment; Transplantation	KIDNEY VENDORS; ORGAN; JUSTICE; SALES; GIFT	The idea of paying donors in order to make more human bodily material available for therapy, assisted reproduction, and biomedical research is notoriously controversial. However, while national and international donation policies largely oppose financial incentives they do not treat all parts of the body equally: incentives are allowed in connection to the provision of some parts but not others. Taking off from this observation, I discuss whether body parts differ as regards the ethical legitimacy of incentives and, if so, why. I distinguish two approaches to this issue. On a "principled" approach, some but not all body parts are inherently special in a way that proscribes payment. On a "pragmatic" approach, the appropriateness of payment in relation to a specific part must be determined through an overall assessment of e.g. the implications of payment for the health and welfare of providers, recipients, and third parties, and the quality of providers' consent. I argue that the first approach raises deep and potentially divisive questions about the good life, whereas the second approach invokes currently unsupported empirical assumptions and requires difficult balancing between different values and the interests of different people. This does not mean that any attempt to distinguish between body parts in regard to the appropriateness of payment necessarily fails. However, I conclude, any plausible such attempt should either articulate and defend a specific view of the good life, or gather relevant empirical evidence and apply defensible principles for weighing goods and interests.

This is a subject that has been neglected both by mainstream European studies on party politics and by gender scholars who work on political parties. Drawing on the insights of these two research traditions, we build toward an analytical framework to study gender and transnational party politics. Our empirical analysis focuses on two policy issues, the economic crisis and the sexual and reproductive health and rights, analyzing European Parliament reports, debates and voting on the issues from 2009 to 2014. By focusing on gender equality constructions and the way in which consensus and contestation are built around them within and between party groups, we argue that shared constructions about gender equality are issue specific and change over time.

J	Martínez, R				Martinez, Ricardo			Inequality Decomposition and Human Development	JOURNAL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND CAPABILITIES			English	Article						World; Human development; Inequality; Inequality decomposition; Theil index	INCOME INEQUALITY; WORLD	The human development index (HDI), which takes into account achievements in health, education, and income, is considered a good measure of the social attainments of a country. The global cross-country distribution of human development is imbalanced and the degree of convergence is low. This inequality has varied during recent years. In this paper we present evidence that improvements in the convergence of human development across countries are mostly attributed to education, whereas health and income have made poor contributions. To do this we exploit the multiplicative structure of the HDI and several decompositions of the Theil inequality index.

Gain-of-Function Research: Ethical Analysis	SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS			English	Article						Gain-of-function research; Dual-use research; Biosafety; Biosecurity; Risk-benefit assessment; Decision theory	INFLUENZA; VIRUS	Gain-of-function (GOF) research involves experimentation that aims or is expected to (and/or, perhaps, actually does) increase the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogens. Such research, when conducted by responsible scientists, usually aims to improve understanding of disease causing agents, their interaction with human hosts, and/or their potential to cause pandemics. The ultimate objective of such research is to better inform public health and preparedness efforts and/or development of medical countermeasures. Despite these important potential benefits, GOF research (GOFR) can pose risks regarding biosecurity and biosafety. In 2014 the administration of US President Barack Obama called for a "pause" on funding (and relevant research with existing US Government funding) of GOF experiments involving influenza, SARS, and MERS viruses in particular. With announcement of this pause, the US Government launched a "deliberative process" regarding risks and benefits of GOFR to inform future funding decisions-and the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) was tasked with making recommendations to the US Government on this matter. As part of this deliberative process the National Institutes of Health commissioned this Ethical Analysis White Paper, requesting that it provide (1) review and summary of ethical literature on GOFR, (2) identification and analysis of existing ethical and decision-making frameworks relevant to (i) the evaluation of risks and benefits of GOFR, (ii) decision-making about the conduct of GOF studies, and (iii) the development of US policy regarding GOFR (especially with respect to funding of GOFR), and (3) development of an ethical and decision-making framework that may be considered by NSABB when analyzing information provided by GOFR risk-benefit assessment, and when crafting its final recommendations (especially regarding policy decisions about funding of GOFR in particular). The ethical and decision-making framework ultimately developed is based on the idea that there are numerous ethically relevant dimensions upon which any given case of GOFR can fare better or worse (as opposed to there being necessary conditions that are either satisfied or not satisfied, where all must be satisfied in order for a given case of GOFR to be considered ethically acceptable): research imperative, proportionality, minimization of risks, manageability of risks, justice, good governance (i.e., democracy), evidence, and international outlook and engagement. Rather than drawing a sharp bright line between GOFR studies that are ethically acceptable and those that are ethically unacceptable, this framework is designed to indicate where any given study would fall on an ethical spectrum-where imaginable cases of GOFR might range from those that are most ethically acceptable (perhaps even ethically praiseworthy or ethically obligatory), at one end of the spectrum, to those that are most ethically problematic or unacceptable (and thus should not be funded, or conducted), at the other. The aim should be that any GOFR pursued (and/or funded) should be as far as possible towards the former end of the spectrum.

J	Reidy, DA				Reidy, David A.			A right to health care? Participatory politics, progressive policy, and the price of loose language	THEORETICAL MEDICINE AND BIOETHICS			English	Article						Human rights; Health; Health care; Justice; International law		This article begins by clarifying and noting various limitations on the universal reach of the human right to health care under positive international law. It then argues that irrespective of the human right to health care established by positive international law, any system of positive international law capable of generating legal duties with prima facie moral force necessarily presupposes a universal moral human right to health care. But the language used in contemporary human rights documents or human rights advocacy is not a good guide to the content of this rather more modest universal moral human right to health care. The conclusion reached is that when addressing issues of justice as they inevitably arise with respect to health policy and health care, both within and between states, there is typically little to gain and much to risk by framing deliberation in terms of the human right to health care.

J	Tasioulas, J; Vayena, E				Tasioulas, John; Vayena, Effy			The place of human rights and the common good in global health policy	THEORETICAL MEDICINE AND BIOETHICS			English	Article						Global health; Justice; Human rights; Right to health; Common goods; Public health		This article offers an integrated account of two strands of global health justice: health-related human rights and health-related common goods. After sketching a general understanding of the nature of human rights, it proceeds to explain both how individual human rights are to be individuated and the content of their associated obligations specified. With respect to both issues, the human right to health is taken as the primary illustration. It is argued that (1) the individuation of the right to health is fixed by reference to the subject matter of its corresponding obligations, and not by the interests it serves, and (2) the specification of the content of that right must be properly responsive to thresholds of possibility and burden. The article concludes by insisting that human rights cannot constitute the whole of global health justice and that, in addition, other considerations-including the promotion of health-related global public goods-should also shape such policy. Moreover, the relationship between human rights and common goods should not be conceived as mutually exclusive. On the contrary, there sometimes exists an individual right to some aspect of a common good, including a right to benefit from health-related common goods such as programmes for securing herd immunity from diphtheria.

J	Ruthven, JS				Ruthven, Jessica S.			"Making it personal": ideology, the arts, and shifting registers in health promotion	AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV			English	Article						Care; governmentality; HIV/AIDS; interpellation; South Africa; theatre	SELF; BIRTH; AIDS; HIV	In South Africa, health promotion related to HIV/AIDS has been characterised as a component of public health prevention. It has heavily utilised global health ideology to construct promotional messages that rely on neoliberal models of individual, responsible health citizenship. However, after nearly 30 years of public health messaging, there have been only minor shifts in the country's HIV prevalence rates; it has become apparent that there is disconnect between policy, programmes, and target audiences. Debates about where this disconnect occurs tend to focus on the role of problems in biomedical knowledge translation or with structural inequalities that lead to health inequity. As debates increase, artists involved in health have emerged to address an additional reason: audience interpellation. In this article, I interrogate relationships between health promotion ideology and processes of interpellation. I suggest that disconnect between the two has roots in the tone of programming, the ways sociality is constructed within health promotion, and the kind of subject which global prevention programmes seek to constitute. Using a case study, I illustrate how public health ideology is made actionable through arts practice. While conventional health promotion programmes address populations in a way that allows individuals to distance themselves, members of South Africa's arts sector have worked to integrate prevention and care in a way that bolsters interpellation through making messages personal. The case study presents one performance but is informed by my broader research with over 20 theatrical groups conducted during 18 months of fieldwork. Analysis of the production reveals that artists act as mediators between population-level public health messages and individuals through the embodied technologies of applied theatre. However, I argue that artists also create space for participants to reimagine configurations of care, responsibility, and intimacy within health practices.

We also invite readers to consider the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's ambition for physical education in light of preliminary findings from an Australian-led research project exploring national and international patterns of outsourcing HPE curricula. Data were sourced from this international research project through a mixed-methods approach. Each external provider engaged in 4 phases of research activity: (a) Web audits, (b) interviews with external providers, (c) network diagrams, and (d) school partner interviews and observations. We then used these data to pose what we believe to be three emerging lines of inquiry and challenge for a socially just school HPE in neoliberal times. In particular, our data indicate that the marketization of school HPE is strengthening an emphasis on individual responsibility for personal health, thereby elevating expectations that schools and teachers will "fill the welfare gap" and, finally, influencing the nature and purchase of educative HPE programs in schools. The apparent proliferation of external providers of health work and HPE resources and services reflects the rise and pervasiveness of neoliberalism in education. We conclude that this global HPE landscape warrants attention to investigate the extent to which external providers' resources are compatible with schooling's educative and inclusive mandates.

Many Indigenous communities have flourished, however, the impact of colonialism continues to have profound health effects for Indigenous peoples in Canada and internationally. Despite increasing evidence of health status inequities affecting Indigenous populations, health services often fail to address health and social inequities as routine aspects of health care delivery. In this paper, we discuss an evidence-based framework and specific strategies for promoting health care equity for Indigenous populations. Methods: Using an ethnographic design and mixed methods, this study was conducted at two Urban Aboriginal Health Centres located in two inner cities in Canada, which serve a combined patient population of 5,500. Data collection included in-depth interviews with a total of 114 patients and staff (n = 73 patients; n = 41 staff), and over 900 h of participant observation focused on staff members' interactions and patterns of relating with patients. Results: Four key dimensions of equity-oriented health services are foundational to supporting the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples: inequity-responsive care, culturally safe care, trauma-and violence-informed care, and contextually tailored care. Partnerships with Indigenous leaders, agencies, and communities are required to operationalize and tailor these key dimensions to local contexts. We discuss 10 strategies that intersect to optimize effectiveness of health care services for Indigenous peoples, and provide examples of how they can be implemented in a variety of health care settings. Conclusions: While the key dimensions of equity-oriented care and 10 strategies may be most optimally operationalized in the context of interdisciplinary teamwork, they also serve as health equity guidelines for organizations and providers working in various settings, including individual primary care practices. These strategies provide a basis for organizational-level interventions to promote the provision of more equitable, responsive, and respectful PHC services for Indigenous populations. Given the similarities in colonizing processes and Indigenous peoples' experiences of such processes in many countries, these strategies have international applicability.

Our study explores how inequalities in perceived general and mental health, and alcohol and tobacco use changed after the recession started. Methods: We used data from the Dutch Health Interview Surveys: 2006-2008 (pre-crisis period) and 2009-2013 (crisis period). Respondents aged 25-64 were divided into socioeconomic groups based on labour status, income level and income change. Inequalities in health and stimulant use among these socioeconomic groups were described by period and changes between the pre-crisis and crisis period were investigated using logistic regression models. Results: Most inequalities did not change, with some exceptions. For perceived general health, inequalities between employed persons and persons not in the labour force were larger in the crisis period (unfavourable trends for those not in the labour force). For smoking, inequalities between unemployed and employed persons were larger in the crisis period (decreasing smoking rates only for those employed), as did inequalities between persons with low and high income levels (decreasing smoking rates for those with higher income levels). Excessive drinking decreased among employed persons and persons with a decrease in income, while it remained stable among persons not in the labour force and among persons with an increase in income. Conclusion: The widening of some socioeconomic inequalities in health and stimulant use might suggest an enhanced vulnerability of lower socioeconomic groups to the post-2008 crisis.

J	Bhandari, B; Newton, JT; Bernabé, E				Bhandari, Bishal; Newton, Jonathon T.; Bernabe, Eduardo			Social inequalities in adult oral health in 40 low- and middle-income countries	INTERNATIONAL DENTAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Socio-economic factors; oral health; tooth loss	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEYS; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; CHRONIC DISEASE; MEXICAN ADULTS; GLOBAL BURDEN; TRENDS; CARIES; STATES; METAREGRESSION	Objective: This study evaluated social inequalities in adult oral health across several low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We used data from 40 countries that participated in the World Health Surveys. Participants' socio-economic position was assessed using the wealth index. Oral health was assessed using two perceived measures, namely total tooth loss and whether they had any problems with their mouth and/or teeth during the last 12 months (perceived needs). Absolute and relative wealth inequalities in oral health were measured using the slope index of inequality (SII) and the relative index of inequality (RII), respectively, after adjusting for participants' sex, age and education. Results: There were wealth inequalities in total tooth loss and perceived needs in most countries. However, significant monotonic gradients were found in 21 countries for total tooth loss and in 18 countries for perceived needs. Two distinctive patterns of social inequality in oral health were found across countries using the RII and the SII. For total tooth loss, pro-rich inequality was found in 25 countries (significant RII/SII in eight countries) and pro-poor inequality was found in 15 (significant RII/SII in three countries). For perceived needs, pro-poor inequality was found in 26 countries (significant RII/SII in six countries) and pro-rich inequality was found in 14 (significant RII/SII in five countries). Conclusions: The well-documented social gradient in adult oral health favouring the rich was not present in all low-and middle-income countries. Pro-poor inequalities in total tooth loss, and particularly in perceived dental-treatment needs, were observed in some countries.

J	Tausch, A				Tausch, Arno			Is globalization really good for public health?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						globalization; infant mortality; inequality	LESS-DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES; CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS; CHILD-MORTALITY; INEQUALITY; DEPENDENCY; DEMOCRACY; INVESTMENT; GROWTH	ObjectivesIn the light of recent very prominent studies, especially that of Mukherjee and Krieckhaus (), one should be initially tempted to assume that nowadays globalization is a driver of a good public health performance in the entire world system. Most of these studies use time series analyses based on the KOF Index of Globalization. We attempt to re-analyze the entire question, using a variety of methodological approaches and data. Our re-analysis shows that neoliberal globalization has resulted in very important implosions of public health development in various regions of the world and in increasing inequality in the countries of the world system, which in turn negatively affect health performance. DesignWe use standard ibm/spss ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, time series and cross-correlation analyses based on aggregate, freely available data. Main outcomesDifferent components of the KOF Index, most notably actual capital inflows, affect public health negatively. The decomposition of the available data suggests that for most of the time period of the last four decades, globalization inflows even implied an aggregate deterioration of public health, quite in line with globalization critical studies. We introduce the effects of inequality on public health, widely debated in global public health research. Our annual time series for 99 countries show that globalization indeed leads to increased inequality, and this, in turn, leads to a deteriorating public health performance. In only 19 of the surveyed 99 nations with complete data (i.e., 19.1%), globalization actually preceded an improvement in the public health performance. Far from falsifying globalization critical research, our analyses show the basic weaknesses of the new pro-globalization literature in the public health profession.

J	Kelly-Reif, K; Wing, S				Kelly-Reif, Kaitlin; Wing, Steve			Urban-rural exploitation: An underappreciated dimension of environmental injustice	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Article						Environmental injustice; Rural; Public health; Industrialized agriculture; Nuclear energy	RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANT; NORTH-CAROLINA; OCCUPATIONAL ASTHMA; SWINE PRODUCTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; AIR-POLLUTION; COMMUNITY; JUSTICE; OPERATIONS	Relationships in which populations benefit from practices that harm other populations are environmentally unjust. Environmental injustice commonly occurs due to disparities in economic and political power, and it is typically analyzed along dimensions of race and class. However, an urban-rural dimension of environmental injustice exists, one that intersects with race and class. Rural environmental injustice can be characterized as a parasitic relationship between urban and rural communities because urban populations obtain most of their food and energy from rural areas and return their wastes to rural areas. We explore the negative consequences of agricultural and energy production in rural areas through two examples: industrial hog production in eastern North Carolina and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan. The negative public health impacts of urban-rural environmental injustice come from human exposure to specific pollutants, degradation of the built environment, limits on popular democracy, and ultimately, suppression of the feedback between consumption and production that could lessen global environmental problems. Pressure to control the effects of industrial energy and agriculture systems is lessened because the urban majority does not experience environmental degradation that affects rural populations. A basic step towards reducing rural environmental injustice is to develop the scientific framework needed to monitor pollutants and health outcomes in rural places through partnerships between researchers and rural community members that promote broader goals of economic, racial and social justice.

This paper focuses on drinking water quality in the centralized water supply network of Lilongwe, the capital of Malawi. It shows how microbial contamination of drinking water is unequally distributed to consumers in low-income (unplanned areas) and higher-income neighbourhoods (planned areas). Microbial contamination and residual disinfectant concentration were measured in 170 water samples collected from in-house taps in high-income areas and from kiosks and water storage facilities in low-income areas between November 2014 and January 2015. Faecal contamination (Escherichia coli) was detected in 10% of the 40 samples collected from planned areas, in 59% of the 64 samples collected from kiosks in the unplanned areas and in 75% of the 32 samples of water stored at household level. Differences in water quality in planned and unplanned areas were found to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. Finally, the paper shows how the inequalities in microbial contamination of drinking water are produced by decisions both on the development of the water supply infrastructure and on how this is operated and maintained.

Building upon the work of the Commission on Investing in Health and published estimates of feasible global mortality SDG3 targets, we analysed Mexico's mortality to assess the feasibility of reducing premature (0-69 years) mortality and propose a path to meet SDG3. Methods We developed a baseline scenario applying 2010 age-specific and cause-specific mortality rates from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) to the 2030 UN Population Division (UNPD) population projections. In a second scenario, INEGI age-specific and cause-specific trends in death rates from 2000 to 2014 were projected to 2030 and adjusted to match the UNPD 2030 mortality projections. A third scenario assumed a 40% reduction in premature deaths across all ages and causes. By comparing these scenarios we quantified shortfalls in mortality reductions by age group and cause, and forecasted life expectancy pathways for Mexico to converge to better performing countries. Findings UNPD-projected death rates yield a 25.9% reduction of premature mortality for Mexico. Accelerated reductions in adult mortality are necessary to reach a 40% reduction by 2030. Mortality declines aggregated across all age groups mask uneven gains across health disorders. Injuries, particularly road traffic accidents and homicides, are the main health challenge for young adults (aged 20-49 years) whereas unabated diabetes mortality is the single most important health concern for older adults (aged 50-69 years). Interpretation Urgent action is now required to control non-communicable diseases and reduce fatal injuries in Mexico, making a 40% reduction in premature mortality by 2030 feasible and putting Mexico back on a track of substantial life expectancy convergence with better performing countries. Our study provides a roadmap for setting national health priorities. Further analysis of the equity implications of following the suggested pathway remains a subject of future research.

J	Goodman, B				Goodman, Benny			Developing the concept of sustainability in nursing	NURSING PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						sustainability; climate change; concept analysis; political economy; determinants of health; nursing	ECOLOGICAL PUBLIC-HEALTH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLOBAL HEALTH; COMMISSION; UNIVERSITY; FUTURE; THREAT; NEED	Sustainability, and the related concept of climate change, is an emerging domain within nursing and nurse education. Climate change has been posited as a serious global health threat requiring action by health professionals and action at international level. Anaker & Elf undertook a concept analysis of sustainability in nursing based on Walker and Avant's framework. Their main conclusions seem to be that while defining attributes and cases can be established, there is not enough research into sustainability in the nursing literature. This paper seeks to develop their argument to argue that sustainability in nursing can be better understood by accessing non-nursing and grey literature and, for example, the literature in the developing web-based 'paraversity'. Without this understanding, and application in nursing scholarship, nurses will have a rather narrow understanding of sustainability and its suggested links with social and health inequalities and the dynamics underpinning unsustainable neoliberalist political economy. This understanding is based on the social and political determinants of health approach and the emerging domain of planetary health. However, this is a major challenge as it requires a critical reflection on what counts as nursing knowledge, a reflection which might reject sustainability and political economy as irrelevant to much of nursing practice.

Researchers', Regulators', and Sponsors' Views on Pediatric Clinical Trials: A Multinational Study	PEDIATRICS			English	Article							ETHICS; DRUG; LEGISLATION; STANDARDS; CHILDRENS; BENEFIT	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The last decade has seen dramatic changes in the regulatory landscape to support more trials involving children, but child-specific challenges and inequitable conduct across income regions persist. The goal of this study was to describe the attitudes and opinions of stakeholders toward trials in children, to inform additional strategies to promote more high-quality, relevant pediatric trials across the globe. METHODS: Key informant semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders (researchers, regulators, and sponsors) who were purposively sampled from low-to middle-income countries and high-income countries. The transcripts were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five stakeholders from 10 countries were interviewed. Five major themes were identified: addressing pervasive inequities (paucity of safety and efficacy data, knowledge disparities, volatile environment, double standards, contextual relevance, market-driven forces, industry sponsorship bias and prohibitive costs); contending with infrastructural barriers (resource constraints, dearth of pediatric trial expertise, and logistical complexities); navigating complex ethical and regulatory frameworks ("draconian" oversight, ambiguous requirements, exploitation, excessive paternalism and precariousness of coercion versus volunteerism); respecting uniqueness of children (pediatric research paradigms, child-appropriate approaches, and family-centered empowerment); and driving evidence-based child health (advocacy, opportunities, treatment access, best practices, and research prioritization). CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders acknowledge that changes in the regulatory environment have encouraged more trials in children, but they contend that inequities and political, regulatory, and resource barriers continue to exist. Embedding trials as part of routine clinical care, addressing the unique needs of children, and streamlining regulatory approvals were suggested. Stakeholders recommended increasing international collaboration, establishing centralized trials infrastructure, and aligning research to child health priorities to encourage trials that address global child health care needs.

Presence, characteristics and equity of access to breast cancer screening programmes in 27 European countries in 2010 and 2014. Results from an international survey	PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Early detection of cancer; Breast neoplasms; Socioeconomic factors; Europe	PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; MAMMOGRAPHY; MORTALITY; NETWORK; ART	The European Union Council Recommendation of 2 December 2003 on cancer screening suggests the implementation of organised, population- based breast cancer screening programmes based on mammography every other year for women aged 50 to 69 years, ensuring equal access to screening, taking into account potential needs for targeting particular socioeconomic groups. A European survey on coverage and participation, and key organisational and policy characteristics of the programmes, targeting years 2010 and 2014, was undertaken in 2014. Overall, 27 countries contributed to this survey, 26 of the 28 European Union member states (92.9%) plus Norway. In 2014, 25 countries reported an ongoing population- based programme, one country reported a pilot programme and another was planning a pilot. In eight countries, the target age range was broader than that proposed by the Council Recommendation, and in three countries the full range was not covered. Fifteen countries reported not reaching some vulnerable populations, such as immigrants, prisoners and people without health insurance, while 22 reported that participation was periodically monitored by socioeconomic variables (e.g. age and territory). Organised, population- based breast cancer screening programmes based on routine mammograms are in place in most EU member states. However, there are still differences in the way screening programmes are implemented, and participation by vulnerable populations should be encouraged. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Male and female physical intimate partner violence and socio-economic position: a cross-sectional international multicentre study in Europe	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Violence; Gender; Social inequalities	CONFLICT-TACTICS-SCALES; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; SEXUAL COERCION; RISK-FACTORS; WOMEN; MEN; RELIABILITY; PREVALENCE; COUNTRIES	Objectives: This work explores the association between socio-economic position (SEP) and intimate partner violence (IPV) considering the perspectives of men and women as victims, perpetrators and as both (bidirectional). Study design: Cross-sectional international multicentre study. Methods: A sample of 3496 men and women, (aged 18-64 years), randomly selected from the general population of residents from six European cities was assessed: Athens; Budapest; London; Ostersund; Porto; and Stuttgart. Their education (primary, secondary and university), occupation (upper white collar, lower white collar and blue collar) and unemployment duration (never, <= 12 months and >12 months) were considered as SEP indicators and physical IPV was measured with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales. Results: Past year physical IPV was declared by 17.7% of women (3.5% victims, 4.2% perpetrators and 10.0% bidirectional) and 19.8% of men (4.1% victims, 3.8% perpetrators and 11.9% bidirectional). Low educational level (primary vs university) was associated with female victimisation (adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 3.2; 1.3-8.0) and with female bidirectional IPV (4.1, 2.4-7.1). Blue collar occupation (vs upper white) was associated with female victimisation (2.1, 1.1-4.0), female perpetration (3.0, 1.3-6.8) and female bidirectional IPV (4.0, 2.3-7.0). Unemployment duration was associated with male perpetration (>12 months of unemployment vs never unemployed: 3.8; 1.7-8.7) and with bidirectional IPV in both sex (women: 1.8, 1.2-2.7; men: 1.7, 1.0-2.8). Conclusions: In these European centres, physical IPV was associated with a disadvantaged SEP. A consistent socio-economic gradient was observed in female bidirectional involvement, but victims or perpetrators-only presented gender specificities according to levels of education, occupation differentiation and unemployment duration potentially useful for designing interventions.

Priorities for action on the social determinants of health: Empirical evidence on the strongest associations with life expectancy in 54 low-income countries, 1990-2012	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Low-income countries; Social determinants of health; Extreme bound analysis; Model averaging; Life expectancy; Population health	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; EXTREME-BOUNDS; MIDDLE-INCOME; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; MORTALITY; GLOBALIZATION; GOVERNANCE; HOUSEHOLDS; WORLDWIDE	The WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health set out an impressive collection of policy proposals on the social determinants of health. However, a serious weakness for securing implementation is the difficulty for policymakers in identifying priorities for action. The objective of this study is to determine a small set of the most influential determinants using existing data and an empirical approach. 45 Indicators from the World Bank's World Development Indicators are selected to measure attainment for the determinants proposed by the Commission. Panel data models of life expectancy at birth for 54 low-income countries over the years 1990-2012 (1188 country-years) are estimated. Each determinant is subjected to a robustness test using Extreme Bound Analysis, to determine the stability of its estimated impact on life expectancy. For 20 robust and significant determinants the magnitude of association with life expectancy is determined. The largest average increases in life expectancy at 14.5 months per capita is associated with a one standard deviation reduction in HIV prevalence among children, followed by advances in gender equality at 9.4 months. Improvements in life expectancy between 6 and 9 months are associated with agricultural production, political stability, access to clean water and sanitation, good governance, and primary school enrolment. Improvements below 6 months are associated with increases in private health expenditure and overseas development assistance, and control of armed conflict and HIV prevalence among men. There is no evidence that national income, public spending on healthcare and education, secondary schooling, terms of international trade, employment, debt service and relief, out-of-pocket expenditures, agricultural ex- or imports, lifestock production, foreign investment, urbanization or environmental degradation are robustly associated with population health. Results provide support for the relevance of some proposed policies. The findings can inform priorities for future research and policy action on the social determinants of health.

This article reviews literature on the health effects of neoliberalism starting with the structural adjustment conditionalities mandated by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It continues with an analysis of how neoliberalism increases economic insecurity and inequality, and the effects on health, with a section specific to the health impacts of austerity measures undertaken after the financial crisis that began in 2007. The next section considers contemporary trade policy as an embodiment of neoliberal ideology, and reviews current and anticipated health effects. The article concludes with a brief examination of two paradoxes that are evident in the research literature on neoliberalism and health.

Data regarding disparities in injury are vital to inform injury prevention and trauma systems strengthening interventions targeted towards vulnerable populations, but are limited in LMICs. We aim to facilitate injury disparities research by generating a standardized methodology for assessing economic status in resource-limited country trauma registries where complex metrics such as income, expenditures, and wealth index are infeasible to assess. Methods: To address this need, we developed a cluster analysis-based algorithm for generating simple population-specific metrics of economic status using nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) household assets data. For a limited number of variables, g, our algorithm performs weighted k-medoids clustering of the population using all combinations of g asset variables and selects the combination of variables and number of clusters that maximize average silhouette width (ASW). Results: In simulated datasets containing both randomly distributed variables and "true" population clusters defined by correlated categorical variables, the algorithm selected the correct variable combination and appropriate cluster numbers unless variable correlation was very weak. When used with 2011 Cameroonian DHS data, our algorithm identified twenty economic clusters with ASW 0.80, indicating well-defined population clusters. Conclusions: This economic model for assessing health disparities will be used in the new Cameroonian six-hospital centralized trauma registry. By describing our standardized methodology and algorithm for generating economic clustering models, we aim to facilitate measurement of health disparities in other trauma registries in resource-limited countries.

Full environmental life cycle cost analysis of concentrating solar power technology: Contribution of externalities to overall energy costs	SOLAR ENERGY			English	Article						Monetization; LCA; Solar energy; LCC	SUSTAINABILITY; LCC	The aim of this work is to investigate the use of Full Environmental Life Cycle Costing (FeLCC) methodology to evaluate the economic performance of a 50 MW parabolic trough Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant operating in hybrid mode with different natural gas inputs (between 0% and 30%). The analysis is based on a plant located in Southern Spain and includes current financial incentives for the promotion of renewable energies. The analysis also incorporates an estimation of external costs associated with atmospheric emissions on six categories: Human Health, Loss of Biodiversity, Local and Global Damage to Crops, Damage to Materials and Climate Change. In a scenario where the project is funded through equity, the life cycle internal costs of the plant operating with solar energy only represent 82.8 epsilon/MW h, while revenues from electricity sales amount to 85.7 epsilon/MW h, resulting in a net present value of 2.95 epsilon/MW h. Internal costs are attributable primarily to the purchase of materials and equipment incurred mainly during the Extraction and Manufacturing life cycle phase. In this scenario, external costs (calculated using CASES damage costs methodology) represent less than 2.6% of all the internal costs considered. Hybridizing CSP with natural gas allows higher overall power outputs due to extended operating hours. However, this strategy involves higher internal costs, resulting in a significant reduction in the revenues (per unit of power generated) and in the net present value of the project. Thus, the existing regulatory system in Spain makes CSP hybridization with natural gas economically unattractive. In addition, the use of natural gas in CSP installations results in a rapid increase in environmental damage as evidenced by higher external costs. For instance, external unit costs of CSP with 30% natural gas were up to 8.6 times higher than in solar-only operation, due primarily to increased greenhouse gas emissions. When the analysis is extended to consider financing through bank loan under common market conditions, the same project shows economic viability for percentages of natural gas hybridization up to 14%. However, solar-only operation remains as the best option. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Schools of public health; Low and middle income countries; Universal health coverage; Social determinants of health; Healthcare; Public health education; Health research; Policy development; Collaboration; Partnerships	BUILDING CAPACITY; WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT; DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES; MASTERS PROGRAM; SOCIAL-SCIENCE; GLOBAL HEALTH; AFRICA; EDUCATION; UNIVERSITY; MEDICINE	Background: Public health has multicultural origins. By the close of the nineteenth century, Schools of Public Health (SPHs) began to emerge in western countries in response to major contemporary public health challenges. The Flexner Report (1910) emphasized the centrality of preventive medicine, sanitation, and public health measures in health professional education. The Alma Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care (PHC) in 1978 was a critical milestone, especially for low and middle-income countries (LMICs), conceptualizing a close working relationship between PHC and public health measures. The Commission on Social Determinants of Health (2005-2008) strengthened the case for SPHs in LMICs as key stakeholders in efforts to reduce global health inequities. This scoping review groups text into public health challenges faced by LMICs and the role of SPHs in addressing these challenges. Main text: The challenges faced by LMICs include rapid urbanization, environmental degradation, unfair terms of global trade, limited capacity for equitable growth, mass displacements associated with conflicts and natural disasters, and universal health coverage. Poor governance and externally imposed donor policies and agendas, further strain the fragile health systems of LMICs faced with epidemiological transition. Moreover barriers to education and research imposed by limited resources, political and economic instability, and unbalanced partnerships additionally aggravate the crisis. To address these contextual challenges effectively, SPHs are offering broad based health professional education, conducting multidisciplinary population based research and fostering collaborative partnerships. SPHs are also looked upon as the key drivers to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). Conclusion: SPHs in LMICs can contribute to overcoming several public health challenges being faced by LMICs, including achieving SDGs. Most importantly they can develop cadres of competent and well-motivated public health professionals: educators, practitioners and researchers who ask questions that address fundamental health determinants, seek solutions as agents of change within their mandates, provide specific services and serve as advocates for multilevel partnerships. Funding support, human resources, and agency are unfortunately often limited or curtailed in LMICs, and this requires constructive collaboration between LMICs and counterpart institutions from high income countries.

There is a clear need to better apply evidence in public health settings to tackle both behaviour-related factors and the underlying social and economic conditions. This article describes concepts of evidence-based public health (EBPH) and outlines a set of actions that are essential for successful global NCD prevention. The authors describe the importance of knowledge translation with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of public health services, relying on both quantitative and qualitative evidence. In particular, the role of capacity building is highlighted because it is fundamental to progress in controlling NCDs. Important challenges for capacity building include the need to bridge diverse disciplines, build the evidence base across countries and the lack of formal training in public health sciences. As brief case examples, several successful capacity-building efforts are highlighted to address challenges and further evidence-based decision making. The need for a more comprehensive public health approach, addressing social, environmental and cultural conditions, has led to government-wide and society-wide strategies that are now on the agenda due to efforts such as the WHO's NCD 2020 action plan and Health 2020: the European Policy for Health and Wellbeing. These efforts need research to generate evidence in new areas (e.g. equity and sustainability), training to build public health capacity and a continuous process of improvement and knowledge generation and translation.

J	Bates, J; Machin, A				Bates, Julia; Machin, Alison			Locality, loneliness and lifestyle: a qualitative study of factors influencing women's health perceptions	HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY			English	Article						asset-based; health and well-being; lifestyle; locality; loneliness; women	LAY EPIDEMIOLOGY; SMOKING; DEPRIVATION; CANDIDACY; MOTHERS; ASSETS; MODEL	The contribution of women to the achievement of global public health targets cannot be underestimated. It is well evidenced that within families, women are a key influence on the health and well-being of their children and partners. However, geographical differences in women's health inequalities persist and research focusing specifically on women's perceptions of locality factors influencing their own health and well-being is scarce. This paper presents an interpretive, qualitative research study undertaken in 2011 with a group of women living in one locality in the North East of England in the United Kingdom which aimed to better understand their health and well-being perceptions and locality influences on it. Fifteen women participated in two focus groups and six individual, semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis yielded four key themes: health and well-being perceptions; mental resilience; low income and choice; and influence of place. The influence of women's geographical location in relation to amenities and services and loneliness were recurring factors in the discussion, each influencing lifestyle. It was evident that women in their local context were themselves assets through which their own physical and mental health could be improved. However, women's perceptions of protective factors and their influences on health and well-being varied. Connecting with women in the context of their immediate living circumstances and understanding their perceptions as individuals are important first steps in the process of gaining consensus and mobilising their assets to collectively build healthy local communities.

Analyses are based on the European Social Survey, rounds three and six (N = 57,419). Depression is measured using the shortened Centre of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Education is coded by use of the International Standard Classification of Education. Country-specific logistic regressions are applied. Results point to an elevated risk of depressive symptoms among the lower educated. The cross-national patterns differ between absolute and relative measurements. For men, large relative inequalities are found for countries including Denmark and Sweden, but are accompanied by small absolute inequalities. For women, large relative and absolute inequalities are found in Belgium, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Results point to an empirical association between inequalities and the underlying prevalence rates. However, the strength of the association is only moderate. This research stresses the importance of including both measurements for comparative research and suggests the inclusion of the level of population health in research into inequalities in health.

The frequency and quality of health education during antenatal care is often low. Further studies are needed on how to improve the performance of health systems in low income settings to improve maternal and child health. Objectives: to assess the effectiveness of a participatory antenatal care intervention on health behaviours and to illuminate how the different socioeconomic groups responded to the intervention in Jimma, Ethiopia. Setting, intervention and measurements: an intervention was designed participatorily and comprised trainings, supervisions, equipment, health education material, and adaption of guidelines. It was implemented at public facilities. Household surveys, before (2008) and after (2010) intervention, were conducted amongst all women who had given birth within the previous 12 months. The effect of the intervention was assessed by comparing the change in health behaviours (number of antenatal visits, health facility delivery, breast feeding, preventive infant health check, and infant immunisation) from before to after the intervention period at intervention sites, relative to control sites, using logistic mixed effect regression. Results: on the basis of 1357 women included before and 2262 after the intervention, there were positive effects of the intervention on breast feeding practices (OR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.4; 3.6) and preventive infant health check (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5; 3.5). There was no effect on infant immunisation coverage and negative effect on number of antenatal visits. The effect on various outcomes was modified by maternal education, and results indicate increased health facility delivery (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 0.8; 6.9) and breast feeding practices (OR 18.2, 95% CI: 5.2;63.6) among women with no education. Key conclusions and implications for practice: the facility based intervention improved some, but not all health behaviours. The improvements indicated amongst the most disadvantaged antenatal care attendants in breast feeding and health facility delivery are encouraging and underline the need to scale up priority of antenatal care in the effort to reduce maternal and child health inequity.

Ethical considerations surrounding the response to Ebola: the Spanish experience	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Ebola; Ethics; Public health; Quarantine; Global justice; Informed consent	VIRUS DISEASE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; EPIDEMICS; PATIENT; LESSONS	Background: The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, with 28,646 reported cases and 11,323 deaths, was declared a public health emergency of international interest by the World Health Organisation. In Spain, a single reported case triggered a public health crisis of a markedly media-centred nature. The approach to the first EVD epidemic has given rise to various ethical considerations around the world. We address the most relevant ethical considerations emanating from the management of EVD in Spain. Main body: Firstly, for reasons of global justice and humanitarian assistance, rich countries have the duty to support poorer countries in building up their core public-health capacities. Secondly, quarantine for high-risk contacts might have been a disproportionate and not properly justified measure, which could have contributed to stigmatising contacts and spreading panic. Thirdly, when the first secondary case was reported in Spain, it is doubtful whether informed consent requirements were strictly complied with when disclosing information concerning the alleged accident potentially causing the contagion. Moreover, this information was used by the Regional Health Minister to blame the patient, evading his responsibility to ensure safe medical procedures for health workers. Finally, the patient received convalescent plasma for compassionate use from a colleague of the first missionary repatriated, who also participated in a research study in Spain, despite having previously been denied the chance of being transferred to Spain to receive treatment. This fact highlights the asymmetry in the relationship between rich and poor countries. Short conclusion: The management of this crisis highlighted the technical capacity of the health system and its professionals to respond effectively to public health emergencies caused by emerging diseases. This said, the failures in the protection of the EVD patient's privacy remind us that this aspect has to be borne in mind from the outset in crisis situations. Certain coercive measures, such as quarantine, should only be applied where there is some evidence that the benefit-risk balance could be favourable. Lastly, it is essential that research and interventions targeted at combating the fragility of the health systems in poor countries respond to reasons of global justice.

J	Bhugra, D				Bhugra, Dinesh			Mental health for nations	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Discrimination; global policy; mental health; national laws	PROFESSIONALISM; CONTRACT; SOCIETY; INDIA	Mental ill health is a universal phenomenon: that is, it is seen across all cultures and societies, even though the presentation may be culture-specific and affected by cultural norms and more. Governments have a moral and ethical duty to develop mental health services which are accessible, appropriate, and non-discriminatory. Equity in funding mental health services is critical. As globally services and their quality vary dramatically, one should be proposing and agreeing on minimum standards of care. In this paper the basic components and minimum standards of care are described. It is imperative that services are non-discriminatory. It is important that governments work with psychiatrists, other mental health professionals, and individuals with mental illness, their families, and carers to plan, develop, and deliver services with adequate funding. Employers and psychological first aid must also be remembered. Services must be geographically accessible. In this endeavour primary care services have a major role to play. Training and clinical decision-making must be part of the change in service delivery. It is imperative that every effort is made to keep the population mentally as well as physically healthy, and people who develop mental illness must have access to evidence-based treatment at the earliest possible opportunity.

This study examined whether existing laws pose structural barriers in the realization of right to work and employment of persons with mental health problems across the world. It reviewed disability-specific, human rights legislation, and labour laws of all UN Member States in the context of Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). It wes found that laws in 62% of countries explicitly mention mental disability/impairment/illness in the definition of disability. In 64% of countries, laws prohibit discrimination against persons with mental health during recruitment; in one-third of countries laws prohibit discontinuation of employment. More than half (56%) the countries have laws in place which offer access to reasonable accommodation in the workplace. In 59% of countries laws promote employment of persons with mental health problems through different affirmative actions. Nearly 50 years after the adoption of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and 10 years after the adoption of CRPD by the UN General Assembly, legal discrimination against persons with mental health problems continues to exist globally. Countries and policy-makers need to implement legislative measures to ensure non-discrimination of persons with mental health problems during employment.

In order to ensure that citizens receive the best treatments available it is important that socio-economic causes and gaps in treatment are identified and dealt with at national levels.

J	Kusuma, D; Cohen, J; McConnell, M; Berman, P				Kusuma, Dian; Cohen, Jessica; McConnell, Margaret; Berman, Peter			Can cash transfers improve determinants of maternal mortality? Evidence from the household and community programs in Indonesia	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Indonesia; Conditional cash transfers; Household; Community; Determinants of maternal mortality; Clustered-randomized trials	PRIMARY-HEALTH-CARE; IMPACT; OUTCOMES	Despite global efforts in maternal health, 303,000 maternal deaths still occurred globally in 2015. One explanation is a considerable inequality in maternal mortality and the sources such as nutritional status and health utilization. One strategy to fight health inequality due to poverty is conditional cash transfer (CCT). Taking advantage of two large clustered-randomized trials in Indonesia from 2007 to 2009, this paper provides evidence on the effects of household cash transfers (PKH) and community cash transfers (Generasi) on determinants of maternal mortality. The sample sizes are 14,000 households for PKH and 12,000 households for Generasi. After two years of implementation, difference-in-differences (DID) analyses show that the two programs can improve determinants of maternal mortality with Generasi provides positive impact in some aspects of determinants, but PKH does not. Generasi improves maternal health knowledge, reduces financial barriers to accessing health services and improves utilization of health services, increases utilization among higher-risk women, improves posyandu equipment, and increases nutritional intake. As for PKH, evidence shows its strongest effects only on utilization of health services. Both programs, however, are unlikely to have a large effect on maternal mortality due to design and implementation issues that might significantly reduce program effectiveness. While the programs improved utilization, they did so at community-based facilities not equipped with emergency obstetric care. In the midst of popularity of household cash transfer, our results show that community cash transfer offers a viable policy alternative to improve the determinants of maternal mortality by allowing more flexibility in activities and at lower cost by monitoring at community level.

Multistakeholder partnerships with the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea to improve childhood immunisation: A perspective from global health equity and political determinants of health equity	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						immunisation; health equity; North Korea; vaccine preventable diseases; vaccines; Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea; GAVI; International Vaccine Institute; UNICEF; child health; vaccination; equite en sante; Coree du Nord; maladies evitables par la vaccination; vaccins; RPDC; GAVI; IVI; UNICEF; sante des enfants; inmunizacion; equidad en salud; Corea del Norte; enfermedades prevenibles por vacunacion; vacunas; RPDK; GAVI; IVI; UNICEF; salud infantil	PUBLIC-HEALTH; NORTH-KOREA	ObjectiveTo examine the current partnerships to improve the childhood immunisation programme in the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the context of the political determinants of health equity. MethodsA literature search was conducted to identify public health collaborations with the DPRK government. Based on the amount of publicly accessible data and a shared approach in health system strengthening among the partners in immunisation programmes, the search focused on these partnerships. ResultsThe efforts by WHO, UNICEF, GAVI and IVI with the DPRK government improved the delivery of childhood vaccines (e.g. pentavalent vaccines, inactivated polio vaccine, two-dose measles vaccine and Japanese encephalitis vaccine) and strengthened the DPRK health system by equipping health centres, and training all levels of public health personnel for VPD surveillance and immunisation service delivery. ConclusionThe VPD-focused programmatic activities in the DPRK have improved the delivery of childhood immunisation and have created dialogue and contact with the people of the DPRK. These efforts are likely to ameliorate the political isolation of the people of the DPRK and potentially improve global health equity. ObjectifExaminer les partenariats actuels pour ameliorer le programme de vaccination des enfants en Republique Populaire Democratique de Coree (RPDC) dans le contexte des determinants politiques de l'equite en matiere de sante. MethodesUne recherche bibliographique a ete menee pour identifier les collaborations en sante publique avec le gouvernement de la RPDC. Sur base de la quantite des donnees accessibles publiquement et une approche commune dans le renforcement du systeme de sante parmi les partenaires dans les programmes de vaccination, la recherche a ete axee sur ces partenariats. Les mots-cles comprenaient: RPDC, sante, maladies evitables par la vaccination (MEV), GAVI, IVI, UNICEF, OMS, systeme de sante, Republique de Coree. ResultatsLes efforts deployes par l'OMS, l'UNICEF, GAVI et IVI avec le gouvernement de la RPDC ont ameliore la delivrance des vaccins de l'enfance (par ex: les vaccins pentavalents, le vaccin antipoliomyelitique inactive, le vaccin contre la rougeole a deux doses et le vaccin contre l'encephalite japonaise), renforce le systeme de sante de la RPDC en equipant les centres de sante et la formation a tous les niveaux du personnel de la sante publique pour la surveillance des programmes de delivrance des vaccins (PDV) et la prestation des services de vaccination. ConclusionLes activites programmatiques centrees sur les PDV en RPDC ont ameliore la delivrance de la vaccination des enfants et ont cree le dialogue et le contact avec le peuple de la RPDC. Ces efforts sont susceptibles d'ameliorer l'isolement politique du peuple de la RPDC, et potentiellement ameliorer l'equite mondiale en matiere de sante. ObjetivoExaminar las asociaciones actualmente existentes para mejorar el programa de inmunizacion infantil en la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea (RPDC), dentro del contexto de los determinantes politicos de equidad en salud. MetodosSe realizo una busqueda en la literatura para identificar las colaboraciones publicas en salud con el gobierno de la RPDC. Se buscaron asociaciones basandose en los datos publicamente disponibles y buscando aquellas en los que los socios en programas de inmunizacion compartieran el objetivo del fortalecimiento del sistema sanitario. Las palabras clave incluian RPDC, salud, enfermedades prevenibles por vacunacion (EPV), GAVI, IVI, UNICEF, OMS, sistema sanitario, Republica de Corea. ResultadosLos esfuerzos realizados por la OMS, UNICEF, GAVI e IVI con el gobierno de la RPDC trajeron mejoras al programa de vacunacion infantil (por ejemplo vacunas pentavalentes, vacuna inactivada de polio, vacuna del sarampion de dos dosis y vacuna para la encefalitis Japonesa) y fortalecieron el sistema sanitario de la RPDC mediante el equipamiento de centros sanitarios y el entrenamiento del personal sanitario de todos los niveles en la vigilancia de EPV y en la entrega del servicio de inmunizacion. ConclusionLas actividades programaticas enfocadas en las EPV en la RPDC han mejorado la entrega de la vacunacion infantil y han establecido un dialogo y el contacto con personas de la RPDC. Estos esfuerzos podrian contribuir a mejorar el aislamiento politico de las personas en la RPDC y potencialmente a mejorar la equidad en salud a nivel global.

In this article, we problematize the impact of international and temporary labor migration on the health of Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong by exploring their general patterns of health information acquisition. Through a series of focus group discussions with Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong, we found that employers serve as stakeholders in migration health, social networking sites can be a platform for participatory health promotion, and religious beliefs and behaviors can promote favorable health behaviors.

J	Maniyalath, N; Narendran, R				Maniyalath, Narendranathan; Narendran, Roshni			The human development index predicts female entrepreneurship rates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH			English	Article						Economic development; Human development; Gender equality; Female entrepreneurship; National income; Religion in entrepreneurship	WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS; GENDERED INSTITUTIONS; COUNTRY; DYNAMICS; CULTURE; HEALTH; IMPACT; GROWTH	Purpose - Past research has identified a negative association between national income and female entrepreneurship rates. Data from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2012 are analyzed to determine whether the Human Development Index (HDI) predicts female entrepreneurship rates. The purpose of this paper is to indicate how other socioeconomic variables that measure human development interact with national income to predict female entrepreneurship rates. Design/methodology/approach - Data were drawn from the 2012 GEM data set, which provides information on female entrepreneurship rates in 61 countries. To test relevant hypotheses, dependent and socio-demographic variables were sourced from international databases to perform quantitative cross-country regression analyses. Findings - National income significantly predicted female entrepreneurship rates in the univariate analysis. However, this relationship became non-significant when development indices were added to the model. In contrast, the HDI, the Gender Inequality Index, and national religious composition were robust, significant predictors. Practical implications - This study presents evidence that human and gender development indices, and national religious composition, are better predictors of female entrepreneurship rates than national income. Thus, studies on female entrepreneurship rates should account and adjust for human development and gender equality indices. As religiosity continues to be pervasive within multiple nations, policymakers should consider this when developing interventions geared toward promoting female entrepreneurship. Originality/value - This paper identifies factors other than economic determinism to explain variance in female entrepreneurship rates and demonstrates that human development and gender inequality indices are better predictors of female entrepreneurship rates.

Unpacking the Black Box: A Formative Research Approach to the Development of Theory-Driven, Evidence-Based, and Culturally Safe Text Messages in Mobile Health Interventions	JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH			English	Article						Aboriginal people; behavioral change wheel; cultural safety; grounded theory; mobile phone; semiotics; SMS; Tanzania; text messages	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; BEHAVIOR-CHANGE; RECOMMENDATIONS; COMMUNITIES; PREVENTION; TOOL	Background: Mobile-cellular subscriptions have increased steadily over the past decade. The accessibility of SMS messages over existing mobile networks is high and has almost universal availability even on older and unsophisticated mobile phones and in geographic settings where wireless coverage is weak. There is intensive exploration of this inexpensive mobile telecommunication technology to improve health services and promote behavior change among vulnerable populations. However, a neglected area of research is the documentation and critical analysis of the formative research process required in the development and refinement of effective SMS messages. Objective: The objective of this qualitative research study was to identify major factors that may impact on the effectiveness of evidence-based SMS messages designed to reduce health inequities in hypertension management in low resource settings, including Aboriginal populations in high-income countries and rural populations in low-income countries. Specifically, we were interested in uncovering the range of mediators that impact on appropriate message content transmission and, ultimately, on health behavior improvements in a range of these sociocultural settings. Methods: Collaborative qualitative research with Canadian Aboriginal and Tanzanian participants was conducted to deconstruct the content and transmission of evidence-based health information contained in SMS messages in the context of an international research project designed to address health inequalities in hypertension, and to develop a grounded theory of the major factors that mediate the effectiveness of this communication. We also examined the interrelationship of these mediators with the three essential conditions of the behavior system of the Behavioral Change Wheel model (capability, opportunity, and motivation) and cultural safety. Results: Four focus groups with a total of 45 participants were conducted. Our grounded theory research revealed how discrepancies develop between the evidence-based text message created by researchers and the message received by the recipient in mobile health interventions. These discrepancies were primarily generated by six mediators of meaning in SMS messages: (1) negative or non-affirming framing of advocacies, (2) fear-or stress-inducing content, (3) oppressive or authoritarian content, (4) incongruity with cultural and traditional practices, (5) disconnect with the reality of the social determinants of health and the diversity of cultures within a population, and (6) lack of clarity and/or practicality of content. These 6 mediators of meaning provide the basis for sound strategies for message development because they impact directly on the target populations' capability, opportunity, and motivation for behavior change. Conclusions: The quality of text messages impacts significantly on the effectiveness of a mobile health intervention. Our research underscores the urgent need for interventions to incorporate and evaluate the quality of SMS messages and to examine the mediators of meaning within each targeted cultural and demographic group. Reporting on this aspect of mobile health intervention research will allow researchers to move away from the current black box of SMS text message development, thus improving the transparency of the process as well as the quality of the outcomes.

J	Duarte, F				Duarte, Fabio			Disassembling Bike-Sharing Systems: Surveillance, Advertising, and the Social Inequalities of a Global Technological Assemblage	JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						bike-sharing; technological assemblage; surveillance; advertising	PRIVACY	The rapid expansion of bike-share systems worldwide has been praised as a sign of the environmental movement, with positive consequences for transportation, the economy, and health in urban areas. But is it really possible that politicians, information-technology companies, and global players such as banks and advertising firms have suddenly joined the ranks of those advocating bicycle use for the sake of the environment and a better quality of life in cities? Bike-share systems, like any other artifact, are a technological assemblage formed by technical, cultural, economic, and social factors and actors. When this assemblage stabilizes and is socially accepted, debate cools down and some unresolved features are put aside. We argue that disassembly of the bike-share system, highlighting the use of electronic keys, credit cards, and the strategic location of docks in upmarket urban areas, may enable us to unveil some of its features and reveal a more complex sociotechnical assemblage.

Specific features of time to diagnosis studies, such as how participants were selected and how time to diagnosis was defined and measured, are poorly reported. The present study aims to derive a reporting guideline for studies on time to diagnosis. Methods: Each item of a list previously used to evaluate the completeness of reporting of studies on time to diagnosis was independently evaluated by a core panel of international experts (n = 11) for relevance and readability before an open electronic discussion allowed consensus to be reached on a refined list. The list was then submitted with an explanatory document to first, last and/or corresponding authors (n = 98) of published systematic reviews on time to diagnosis (n = 45) for relevance and readability, and finally approved by the core expert panel. Results: The refined reporting guideline consists of a 19-item checklist: six items are about the process of participant selection (with a suggested flowchart), six about the definition and measurement of time to diagnosis, and three about optional analyses of associations between time to diagnosis and participant characteristics and health outcomes. Of 24 responding authors of systematic reviews, more than 21 (>= 88 %) rated the items as relevant, and more than 17 (>= 70 %) as readable; 19 of 22 (86 %) authors stated that they would potentially use the reporting guideline in the future. Conclusions: We propose a reporting guideline (REST) that could help authors, reviewers, and editors of time to diagnosis study reports to improve the completeness and the accuracy of their reporting.

However, applied research to overcome its adversity has been quite limited. The goal of this study is to explore the role of physical activity in improving the health of widows. A cohort of 446,582 adults in Taiwan who successively participated in a comprehensive medical screening program starting in 1994, including 232,788 women, was followed up for mortality until 2008. Each individual provided detailed health history, and extensive lab tests results. The number of widows increased with time trend. Every other woman above age 65 was a widow (44%). Widows were less active, more obese, and smoked and drank more, had sleep problems, were more depressed with taking sedatives or psychoactive drugs, leading to more suicides. In the global development of health policies by World Health Organization (WHO), physical activity is one of the main factors to reverse poor health. The poor health of inactive widow was mitigated when becoming fully active in this study. Exercise not only reduced the observed 18% increase in all-cause mortality, but also gained 4 years and as much as 14% mortality advantage over the married but inactive. More importantly, becoming physically active energized their mental status, improved sleep quality and quantity, reduced depressions and the need for psychoactive drugs, and increased socialization circles. Widows, a rapidly growing and socially stigmatized group, suffered from social and financial inequality and tended to develop poorer health. Sustained physical activity could be one of the ways for them to overcome and reverse some of the physical and mental adversities of widowhood, and improve their quality and quantity of life.

J	Philipov, D; Scherbov, S				Philipov, Dimiter; Scherbov, Sergei			Differences by union status in health and mortality at older ages: Results for 16 European countries	DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH			English	Article							MARITAL-STATUS; LIFE EXPECTANCY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; INEQUALITIES; RETIREMENT; SELECTION; SURVIVAL; MARRIAGE; FINLAND; BURDEN	BACKGROUND Married people live longer than the unmarried; micro-level research indicates that they enjoy better health. Macro-level research does not combine mortality, marital status, and health. OBJECTIVE We provide international comparisons of healthy and unhealthy life years at ages 50 and higher combining mortality, marital status, and health. METHODS We examine differences in healthy and unhealthy life years for married and cohabiting (i.e., partnered) and for single men and women and break these down into mortality and disability. EU-SILC and Eurostat data for 2011 are used for 16 European countries. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Our analyses show that partnered people, both men and women, are healthier than singles. However, these differences in unhealthy life are varied. For the length of healthy life, the effect of disability dominates the effect of mortality for women strongly and for men weakly, while the effect of mortality is more important for the length of unhealthy life of women. Populations in Eastern Europe are more disadvantaged than those in Western Europe with respect to length of life and of healthy life; these differences are larger for singles and lower for the partnered. CONTRIBUTION We extend previous macro-level studies on healthy and unhealthy life at older ages by introducing the additional dimension of partner status. We provide rich information in terms of life expectancies for 16 countries in Europe, with special attention on Eastern European countries and specifically on singles in these countries.

J	Kim, EY; Park, J; Kim, B				Kim, Eun Young; Park, Jiung; Kim, Bongseog			Type of childhood maltreatment and the risk of criminal recidivism in adult probationers: a cross-sectional study	BMC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Types of childhood maltreatment; Criminal recidivism; Adult probationers; Mental-health problem	JUVENILE-DELINQUENCY; ABUSE; ADOLESCENT; RESILIENCE; BEHAVIOR; STRESS; NEGLECT; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; VICTIMIZATION; RELIABILITY	Background: Childhood maltreatment is strongly associated with delinquency and the repeated crime. Specific types of childhood maltreatment have been found to have differential effects on recidivism in juvenile offenders, but studies of adult probationers have not been performed. This study investigated the relationship between having a history of childhood maltreatment and mental-health problems and the independent contribution of specific types of maltreatment and mental-health problems to the criminal recidivism of adult probationers. Method: This study included 183 adult probationers (107 males and 76 females) with a mean age of 40.1 (SD = 11.8) years. Type of childhood maltreatment was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, which consists of five subscales (emotional neglect and abuse, physical neglect and abuse, and sexual abuse). Additionally, we used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to assess participants for the presence of psychiatric disorders and assessed levels of emotional dysregulation and resilience. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether the types of childhood maltreatment were independently associated with repeated crime, after adjusting for demographic factors and mental-health problems. Results: The overall prevalence of mental illness in the childhood maltreatment group was significantly higher than in the no childhood maltreatment group (56.1 % vs. 38.2 %, p = 0.017). The maltreated group had a higher rate of major depressive disorder, a higher level of emotional dysregulation, and a lower level of resilience than the group that was not maltreated. Recidivism was uniquely associated with physical neglect (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR], 2.862; 95 % Confidence Interval [95 % CI], 1.213-6.752) and the presence of at least one psychiatric disorder (AOR, 3.791; 95 % CI, 1. 703-8.443). Conclusions: Childhood maltreatment deserves further attention in adult probationers because it is potentially associated with higher rates of psychiatric morbidity and recidivism. In particular, physical neglect during childhood plays a critical role in repeated crime, independent of mental-health problems for high-risk adults involved with the criminal justice system. Rigorous evaluations of the relevance of childhood maltreatment in the assessment and treatment of criminal offenders are needed.

We implemented a unique approach to examining HRH management practices by comparing perspectives offered by mid-level providers (MLPs) of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) in Tanzania to those presented by local health authorities, known as council health management teams (CHMTs). Methods: This study was guided by the basic strategic human resources management (SHRM) component model. A convergent mixed-method design was utilized to assess qualitative and quantitative data from the Health Systems Strengthening for Equity: The Power and Potential of Mid-Level Providers project. Survey data was obtained from 837 mid-level providers, 83 of whom participated in a critical incident interview whose aim was to elicit negative events in the practice environment that induced intention to leave their job. HRH management practices were assessed quantitatively in 48 districts with 37 members of CHMTs participating in semi-structured interviews. Results: The eight human resources management practices enumerated in the basic SHRM component model were implemented unevenly. On the one hand, members of CHMTs and mid-level providers agreed that there were severe shortages of health workers, deficient salaries, and an overwhelming workload. On the other hand, members of CHMTs and mid-level providers differed in their perspectives on rewards and allocation of opportunities for in-service training. Although written standards of performance and supervision requirements were available in most districts, they did not reflect actual duties. Members of CHMTs reported high levels of autonomy in key HRH management practices, but mid-level providers disputed the degree to which the real situation on the ground was factored into job-related decision-making by CHMTs. Conclusions: The incongruence in perspectives offered by members of CHMTs and mid-level providers points to deficient HRH management practices, which contribute to poor practice environments in acute obstetric settings in Tanzania. Our findings indicate that members of CHMTs require additional support to adequately fulfill their HRH management role. Further research conducted in low-income countries is necessary to determine the appropriate package of interventions required to strengthen the capacity of members of CHMTs.

The acute myocardial infarction (MI) in hospital death rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina is three fold higher than in European Union countries before the enlargement in 2004. There is also a striking difference in mortality between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Central and East European countries that joined the EU in 2004. Rapid development of high technology treatment procedures, which followed the economic recovery of the European Union countries, still have only limited influence on the overall control of MI death rate. Large potential to control MI death rate lies in developing PCI capable network with target to rapid reperfusion therapy in MI patients. The hypothesis that social factors may contribute to explain high MI death rate is attractive, but still is an assumption. However, if confirmed, transforming such knowledge into a practical health policy would be a great challenge. A resource-saving balanced assessment approach to health technology development is warrant in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An international help is needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We analysed HF temporal trends during the Bone and Joint Decade in Portugal (BJD-Portugal), 2000-2010, by regional socioeconomic status (SES), sex and age. Methods We selected registers of patients aged 50+ years with HF (International Classification of Diseases, V.9-Clinical Modification, ICD9-CM) caused by traumas of low/moderate energy, from the National Hospital Discharge Database. Annual time series of age-specific incidence rates were calculated by sex and regional SES (deprived, medium, affluent). Generalised additive models were fitted to identify shape/turning points in temporal trends. Results We selected 96 905 HF (77.3% in women). Women were older than men at admission (81.2 +/- 8.5 vs 78.2 +/- 10.1 years-old, p<0.001). For women 65-79 years, a continuously decreasing trend (1.7%/year) only in affluent and increasing trends (3.3-3.4%/year) after 2006/2007 in medium and deprived was observed. For men, trends were stable or increased in almost all age/SES groups (only two decreasing periods). For the oldest women, all SES present similar trends: turning points around 2003 (initiating decreasing periods: 1.8-2.9%/year) and around 2007 (initiating increasing periods: 3.7-3.3%/year). Conclusions There were SES-sex-age inequalities in temporal trends during BJD-Portugal: marked SES inequalities among women aged 65-79 years (a persistent, decreasing trend only in the affluent) vanished among the oldest women; the same was not observed in men, for them, there were almost no declining periods; women aged >= 80 years, presented increasing trends around 2007, as in most deprived/age/sex groups.

Comparing the case mix and survival of women receiving breast cancer care from one private provider with other London women with breast cancer: pilot data exchange and analyses	BMC CANCER			English	Article						Breast cancer; Survival; Inequalities; Health care organisation	SECTOR TREATMENT CENTERS; NHS PROVIDERS; DIAGNOSIS; STAGE	Background: Data from providers of private cancer care are not yet formally included in English cancer registration data. This study aimed to test the exchange of breast cancer data from one Hospital Corporation of America International (HCAI) hospital in London with the cancer registration system and assess the suitability of these data for comparative analyses of case mix and adjusted survival. Methods: Data on 199 London women receiving 'only HCAI care', 278 women receiving 'some HCAI care' (HCAI and other services), and 31,234 other London women diagnosed between 2005 and 2011 could be identified and compared. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was used to adjust for age, socioeconomic deprivation, year of diagnosis, stage of disease and recorded treatment. Results: Women receiving 'only HCAI care' were younger, lived in areas of higher affluence (47.8 % vs 27.6 %) and appeared less likely to be recorded as having screen-detected (2.5 % vs 25.0 %) disease than other London women. Women receiving 'some HCAI care' were more similar to 'HCAI only' women. Although HCAI stage of disease data completeness improved during the study period, this was less complete overall than cancer registration data and limited the comparative survival analyses. An apparent survival advantage for 'HCAI only' women compared with other London women (hazard ratio 0.48, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.32-0.74) was attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjustment (0.79, 95 % CI: 0.51-1.21). Women receiving 'some HCAI care' appeared to have higher survival (hazard ratio 0.24, 95 % CI 0.14-0.41) which was attenuated to 0.48 (95 % CI: 0.28-0.80) in the fully adjusted model. Conclusions: Exchange of data between the private cancer sector and the English cancer registration service can identify patients who receive all or some private care. The better survival of women receiving only or some HCAI breast cancer care appears to be at least partly explained by demographic, disease, and treatment factors. However, larger studies using similarly quality assured datasets and more complete staging data from the private sector are needed to produce definitive comparative results.

Sounding the Alarm: Health in the Anthropocene	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Anthropocene; limits to growth; planetary boundaries; health inequalities; eco-social tipping points; future health; Health-Earth	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; GROWTH; COUNTRIES; DROUGHT; POPULATION; CONFLICT; POVERTY; LIMITS	There is growing scientific and public recognition that human actions, directly and indirectly, have profoundly changed the Earth system, in a still accelerating process, increasingly called the "Anthropocene". Planetary transformation, including of the atmosphere, climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, has enormous implications for human health, many of which are deeply disturbing, especially in low-income settings. A few health consequences of the Anthropocene have been partially recognized, including within environmental epidemiology, but their long-term consequences remain poorly understood and greatly under-rated. For example Syria could be a "sentinel" population, giving a glimpse to a much wider dystopian future. Health-Earth is a research network, co-founded in 2014, which seeks, with other groups, to catalyse a powerful curative response by the wider health community. This paper builds on a symposium presented by Health-Earth members at the 2015 conference of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology. It reviews and synthesizes parts of the large literature relevant to the interaction between the changing Earth system and human health. It concludes that this topic should be prominent within future environmental epidemiology and public health. Created by our species, these challenges may be soluble, but solutions require far more understanding and resources than are currently being made available.

J	Khan, SA				Khan, Sabaa Ahmad			Aligning Transnational Climate Action with International Climate Governance: The Road fromParis	REVIEW OF EUROPEAN COMPARATIVE & INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW			English	Article							PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY; ELECTRONIC WASTE; CHAINS; FLOWS	Electronic waste is recognized as the fastest growing hazardous waste stream of the twenty-first century. Because e-waste streams contain highly valuable precious metals and other secondary resources as well as hazardous toxic substances, the issue of their regulation lies at a liminal space between products and wastes. This complex legal interface engages the distinct and sometimes contradictory international regimes of liberalized trade and environmental protection. With most global flows of e-waste being treated by informal recycling industries in developing countries, and given the continued structural exclusion of these marginalized e-waste recycling sectors from official waste governance paradigms, the globalization of e-waste raises important environmental justice and North-South development issues. The present article examines the discussion of e-waste within international environmental law. In particular, it assesses new guideline developments under the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal. It is argued that despite its overarching objectives in relation to human health and environmental protection, the Basel Convention and the newly adopted Technical Guidelines on E-waste primarily ensure the continued circulation of obsolete electronic commodities in conditions that reproduce international externalities. The impossibility of this international environmental regime to foster any meaningful and authoritative notion of accountability over hazardous wastes that are generated through transboundary flows of 'products' inevitably limits its potential to curb the externalization of hazardous waste pollution to vulnerable populations who suffer the most acute health risks of global hi-tech production, consumption and reproduction. In essence, the success of this international regime over 'wastes' depends very critically on its coupling with national legislative controls over 'products' and more importantly, necessitates serious reflection on the legal dimensions of the notion of sustainable consumption.

This paper seeks to explain conflicting results with MTFC by testing the hypotheses that it benefits antisocial young people more than others and does so through its effects on their behaviour. Hard-to-manage young people in English foster or residential homes were assessed at entry to a randomised and case-controlled trial of MTFC (n = 88) and usual care (TAU) (n = 83). Primary outcome was the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) at 12 months analysed according to high (n = 112) or low (n = 59) baseline level of antisocial behaviour on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents. After adjusting for covariates, there was no overall treatment effect on CGAS. However, the High Antisocial Group receiving MTFC gained more on the CGAS than the Low group (mean improvement 9.36 points vs. 5.33 points). This difference remained significant (p < 0.05) after adjusting for propensity and covariates and was statistically explained by the reduced antisocial behaviour ratings in MTFC. These analyses support the use of MTFC for youth in public care but only for those with higher levels of antisocial behaviour. Further work is needed on whether such benefits persist, and on possible negative effects of this treatment for those with low antisocial behaviour.

Yet most evidence is from high-income countries. Oral health has many of the same social and behavioural risk factors as other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which are increasing rapidly in low- and middle-income countries with ageing populations. The "common risk factor approach" (CRFA) for oral health addresses risk factors shared with NCDs within the broader social and economic environment. Methods: The aim is to improve understanding of edentulism prevalence, and association between common risk factors and edentulism in adults aged 50 years and above using nationally representative samples from China (N = 11,692), Ghana (N = 4093), India (N = 6409) and South Africa (N = 2985). The data source is the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 1 (2007-2010). Multivariable logistic regression describes association between edentulism and common risk factors reported in the literature. Results: Prevalence of edentulism: in China 8.9 %, Ghana 2.9 %, India 15.3 %, and South Africa 8.7 %. Multivariable analysis: in China, rural residents were more likely to be edentulous (OR 1.36; 95 % CI 1.09-1.69) but less likely to be edentulous in Ghana (OR 0.53; 95 % CI 0.31-0.91) and South Africa (OR 0.52; 95 % CI 0.30-0.90). Respondents with university education (OR 0.31; 95 % CI 0.18-0.53) and in the highest wealth quintile (OR 0.68; 95 % CI 0.52-0.90) in China were less likely to be edentulous. In South Africa respondents with secondary education were more likely to be edentulous (OR 2.82; 95 % CI 1.52-5.21) as were those in the highest wealth quintile (OR 2.78; 95 % CI 1.16-6.70). Edentulism was associated with former smokers in China (OR 1.57; 95 % CI 1.10-2.25) non-drinkers in India (OR 1.65; 95 % CI 1.11-2.46), angina in Ghana (OR 2.86; 95 % CI 1.19-6.84) and hypertension in South Africa (OR 2.75; 95 % CI 1.72-4.38). Edentulism was less likely in respondents with adequate nutrition in China (OR 0.68; 95 % CI 0.53-0.87). Adjusting for all other factors, compared with China, respondents in India were 50 % more likely to be edentulous. Conclusions: Strengthening the CRFA should include addressing common determinants of health to reduce health inequalities and improve both oral and overall health.

J	Mensah, GA				Mensah, George A.			THE INAUGURAL ELIJAH B. SAUNDERS MEMORIAL LECTURE: THE GLOBAL CONSEQUENCES OF HYPERTENSION AND RELATED DISPARITIES	ETHNICITY & DISEASE			English	Article						Hypertension; Blood Pressure; Prevalence; Control Rate; Mortality; Disparities; Global; Low- and Middle-Income Countries	EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; RISK-FACTORS; PREVALENCE; CANADA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PARTNERSHIP; AWARENESS; DISEASE; BURDEN; HEART	This inaugural memorial lecture provides an opportunity to celebrate the life of Elijah B. Saunders, MD, FACC and pays tribute to his pioneering spirit in the quest to advance health equity in the prevention and control of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. It also enables an assessment of the state of the global burden of hypertension and related disparities. Despite the remarkable biomedical research progress made over the last half-century, hypertension remains the leading risk factor for global disease burden and the major preventable contributor to cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Additionally, disparities in hypertension-related morbidity and mortality remain pervasive worldwide. National hypertension control rates showing progress often mask important suboptimal treatment and control in population groups defined by sex, race, ethnicity, geography, and social and environmental determinants. Within these groups, many hypertension-related disparities remain largely unchanged while other gaps have widened. In essence, current research has been relatively ineffective in guiding largescale, sustained elimination of hypertension-related disparities. An important explanation for these observations may be the significant advances made in observational epidemiological research, especially in improved surveillance and data collection that document the extent of disparities in marked contrast to the relative paucity of interventional disparities research. The paucity of these interventional research studies remains a continuing challenge. The time has come for renewed efforts in building strategic partnerships that leverage transdisciplinary, multi-sectoral expertise to provide global leadership in interventional implementation research for hypertension control and elimination of related disparities. Developing an appropriately skilled implementation research workforce will be crucial. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and its biomedical research funding partners remain committed to a strategic agenda of implementation research, training, and education for the prevention and control of hypertension and elimination of related disparities.

J	Kidman, R; Heymann, J				Kidman, Rachel; Heymann, Jody			Caregiver supportive policies to improve child outcomes in the wake of the HIV/AIDS epidemic: an analysis of the gap between what is needed and what is available in 25 high prevalence countries	AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV			English	Article						HIV-affected children; caregiving; social policy; HIV; AIDS	ORPHANED CHILDREN; PRIMARY-EDUCATION; MINIMUM-WAGES; HIV; HEALTH; CARE; COMMUNITY; ADULTS; WORK; STRATEGIES	In the wake of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, caregivers are struggling to support HIV-affected children. For reasons of equity and efficiency, their needs can be best met through strong social protections and policies. This paper presents a conceptual framework to help address the needs of HIV-affected caregivers and to prioritize policies. We describe the needs that are common across diverse caregiving populations (e.g., economic security); the needs which are intensified (e.g., leave to care for sick children) or unique to providing care to HIV-affected children (e.g., ARV treatment). The paper then explores the types of social policies that would facilitate families meeting these needs. We outline a basic package of policies that would support HIV-affected families, and would meet goals agreed to by national governments. We examine the availability of these policies in 25 highly affected countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of countries guarantee short-term income protection during illness, free primary school, and educational inclusion of children with special needs. However, there are significant gaps in areas critical to family economic security and healthy child development. Fewer than half of the countries we analyzed guarantee a minimum wage that will enable families to escape poverty; only six have eliminated tuition fees for secondary school; and only three offer paid leave to care for sick children. Filling these policy gaps, as well as making mental health and social services more widely available, is essential to support caregiving by families for HIV-affected children. As part of the HIV agenda, the global community can help national governments advance towards their policy targets. This would provide meaningful protection for families affected by HIV, as well as for millions of other vulnerable families and children across the region.

This problem results from laws, policies, and policing practices that unjustly and discriminatorily detain individuals and fail to ensure continuity of prevention, care, and treatment upon detention, throughout imprisonment, and upon release. These government actions, and the failure to ensure humane prison conditions, constitute violations of human rights to be free of discrimination and cruel and inhuman treatment, to due process of law, and to health. Although interventions to prevent and treat HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and drug dependence have proven successful in prisons and are required by international law, they commonly are not available. Prison health services are often not governed by ministries responsible for national public health programmes, and prison officials are often unwilling to implement effective prevention measures such as needle exchange, condom distribution, and opioid substitution therapy in custodial settings, often based on mistaken ideas about their incompatibility with prison security. In nearly all countries, prisoners face stigma and social marginalisation upon release and frequently are unable to access health and social support services. Reforms in criminal law, policing practices, and justice systems to reduce imprisonment, reforms in the organisation and management of prisons and their health services, and greater investment of resources are needed.

HIV and tuberculosis in prisons in sub-Saharan Africa	LANCET			English	Article							SOUTH-AFRICA; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; ZAMBIAN PRISONS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; HUMAN-RIGHTS; INMATES; HEALTH; CARE; POPULATION; PREVALENCE	Given the dual epidemics of HIV and tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa and evidence suggesting a disproportionate burden of these diseases among detainees in the region, we aimed to investigate the epidemiology of HIV and tuberculosis in prison populations, describe services available and challenges to service delivery, and identify priority areas for programmatically relevant research in sub-Saharan African prisons. To this end, we reviewed literature on HIV and tuberculosis in sub-Saharan African prisons published between 2011 and 2015, and identified data from only 24 of the 49 countries in the region. Where data were available, they were frequently of poor quality and rarely nationally representative. Prevalence of HIV infection ranged from 2.3% to 34.9%, and of tuberculosis from 0.4 to 16.3%; detainees nearly always had a higher prevalence of both diseases than did the non-incarcerated population in the same country. We identified barriers to prevention, treatment, and care services in published work and through five case studies of prison health policies and services in Zambia, South Africa, Malawi, Nigeria, and Benin. These barriers included severe financial and human-resource limitations and fragmented referral systems that prevent continuity of care when detainees cycle into and out of prison, or move between prisons. These challenges are set against the backdrop of weak health and criminal-justice systems, high rates of pre-trial detention, and overcrowding. A few examples of promising practices exist, including routine voluntary testing for HIV and screening for tuberculosis upon entry to South African and the largest Zambian prisons, reforms to pre-trial detention in South Africa, integration of mental health services into a health package in selected Malawian prisons, and task sharing to include detainees in care provision through peer-educator programmes in Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and South Africa. However, substantial additional investments are required throughout sub-Saharan Africa to develop country-level policy guidance, build human-resource capacity, and strengthen prison health systems to ensure universal access to HIV and tuberculsosis prevention, treatment, and care of a standard that meets international goals and human rights obligations.

Disparities in length of life across developed countries: measuring and decomposing changes over time within and between country groups	POPULATION HEALTH METRICS			English	Article						Mortality disparities; Developed countries; East-West gap in life expectancy; Decomposition; Stepwise replacement algorithm	OLD-AGE MORTALITY; RUSSIAN MORTALITY; DIVERGING TRENDS; ADULT MORTALITY; CONVERGENCE; EXPECTANCY; DIVERGENCE; INEQUALITY; DECLINE; EUROPE	Background: Over the past half century the global tendency for improvements in longevity has been uneven across countries. This has resulted in widening of inter-country disparities in life expectancy. Moreover, the pattern of divergence appears to be driven in part by processes at the level of country groupings defined in geopolitical terms. A systematic quantitative analysis of this phenomenon has not been possible using demographic decomposition approaches as these have not been suitably adapted for this purpose. In this paper we present an elaboration of conventional decomposition techniques to provide a toolkit for analysis of the inter-country variance, and illustrate its use by analyzing trends in life expectancy in developed countries over a 40-year period. Methods: We analyze trends in the population-weighted variance of life expectancy at birth across 36 developed countries and three country groups over the period 1970-2010. We have modified existing decomposition approaches using the stepwise replacement algorithm to compute age components of changes in the total variance as well as variance between and within groups of Established Market Economies (EME), Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and the Former Soviet Union (FSU). The method is generally applicable to the decomposition of temporal changes in any aggregate index based on a set of populations. Results: The divergence in life expectancy between developed countries has generally increased over the study period. This tendency dominated from the beginning of 1970s to the early 2000s, and reversed only after 2005. From 1970 to 2010, the total standard deviation of life expectancy increased from 2.0 to 5.6 years among men and from 1.0 to 3.6 years among women. This was determined by the between-group effects due to polarization between the EME and the FSU. The latter contrast was largely fueled by the long-term health crisis in Russia. With respect to age, the increase in the overall divergence was attributable to between-country differences in mortality changes at ages 15-64 years compared to those aged 65 and older. The within-group variance increased, especially among women. This change was mostly produced by growing mortality differences at ages 65 and older. Conclusions: From the early 1970s to the mid-2000s, the strong divergence in life expectancy across developed countries was largely determined by the between-group variance and mortality polarization linked to the East-West geopolitical division.

Access to health for refugees in Greece: lessons in inequalities	International Journal for Equity in Health			English	Article						Access; Conflict; Greece; Inequality; Migrants; Refugee; Syria	INTERVENTIONS	Eastern Greek islands have been direct passageways of (mainly Syrian) refugees to the European continent over the past year. However, basic medical care has been insufficient. Despite calls for reform, the Greek healthcare system has for many years been costly and dysfunctional, lacking universal equity of access. Thus, mainly volunteers look after the refugee camps in the Greek islands under adverse conditions. Communicable diseases, trauma related injuries and mental health problems are the most common issues facing the refugees. The rapid changes in the epidemiology of multiple conditions that are seen in countries with high immigration rates, like Greece, demand pragmatic solutions. Best available knowledge should be used in delivering health interventions. So far, Greece is failed by international aid, and cross-border policies have not effectively tackled underlying reasons for ill-health in this context, like poverty, conflict and equity of access.

Ethnic variations in psychotic disorders in the criminal justice system: A systematic review	AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Psychotic disorders; Ethnic groups; Minority groups; Prisons; Criminal law; Mental health	MENTAL-HEALTH-SERVICES; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE; RISK-FACTORS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; IMMIGRANTS; VIOLENCE; MIGRATION; PREVALENCE; MINORITIES; PSYCHIATRY	Objective: To explore the relationship between ethnicity, psychotic disorders and criminal behavior by investigating differences in prevalence rates of psychotic disorders between detainees from Black and minority ethnic (BME) groups and non-BME detainees. Method: A systematic review of all empirical studies on the prevalence of psychotic disorders, comparing at least two ethnic groups in a psychiatric penitentiary or regular prison setting. No national or language restrictions were made. Results: Ten out of sixteen medium to high quality studies found higher prevalence rates of psychotic disorders in BME detainees compared to non-BME detainees. The country where a study was executed appeared to be irrelevant to the results. The overrepresentation of BME detainees with psychotic disorders was especially reported on psychiatric penitentiary units and less often on regular prison units. Conclusions: BME detainees show elevated prevalence rates of psychotic disorders compared to non-BME detainees. This phenomenon appears to be internationally relevant. Summations: The overrepresentation of BME patients is not restricted to certain countries but is of international significance. Future research needs to focus on why BME patients with psychotic disorders tend to be overrepresented in the criminal justice system and how it can be achieved to get BME patients into regular mental health care instead. Considerations: Only a small number of studies included in this review sufficiently controlled for confounding factors. Yet, in cultural research it is essential to take confounding factors into account. More high quality research is needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Denzel, A.

BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Millennium Development Goals; Maternal health; Neonatal health; Child health; Reproductive health; Coverage; Equity; Health systems; Health finance; Accountability	CHILD HEALTH; MATERNAL MORTALITY; NEONATAL SURVIVAL; PUBLIC-HEALTH; NEWBORN; INTERVENTIONS; STRATEGIES; SYSTEMS; CARE; PRIORITIES	Background: Countdown to 2015 was a multi-institution consortium tracking progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5. Case studies to explore factors contributing to progress (or lack of progress) in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) were undertaken in: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Niger, Pakistan, Peru, and Tanzania. This paper aims to identify cross-cutting themes on how and why these countries achieved or did not achieve MDG progress. Methods: Applying a standard evaluation framework, analyses of impact, coverage and equity were undertaken, including a mixed methods analysis of how these were influenced by national context and coverage determinants (including health systems, policies and financing). Results: The majority (7/10) of case study countries met MDG-4 with over two-thirds reduction in child mortality, but none met MDG-5a for 75 % reduction in maternal mortality, although six countries achieved >75 % of this target. None achieved MDG-5b regarding reproductive health. Rates of reduction in neonatal mortality were half or less that for post-neonatal child mortality. Coverage increased most for interventions administered at lower levels of the health system (e.g., immunisation, insecticide treated nets), and these experienced substantial political and financial support. These interventions were associated with similar to 30-40 % of child lives saved in 2012 compared to 2000, in Ethiopia, Malawi, Peru and Tanzania. Intrapartum care for mothers and newborns - which require higher-level health workers, more infrastructure, and increased community engagement - showed variable increases in coverage, and persistent equity gaps. Countries have explored different approaches to address these problems, including shifting interventions to the community setting and tasks to lower-level health workers. Conclusions: These Countdown case studies underline the importance of consistent national investment and global attention for achieving improvements in RMNCH. Interventions with major global investments achieved higher levels of coverage, reduced equity gaps and improvements in associated health outcomes. Given many competing priorities for the Sustainable Development Goals era, it is essential to maintain attention to the unfinished RMNCH agenda, particularly health systems improvements for maternal and neonatal outcomes where progress has been slower, and to invest in data collection for monitoring progress and for rigorous analyses of how progress is achieved in different contexts.

Countdown 2015 Hlth Syst Policies	Countdown to 2015 country case studies: systematic tools to address the "black box" of health systems and policy assessment	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Policy analysis; Health systems; Reproductive health; Newborn health; Maternal health; Child health; Tanzania; Peru	NEWBORN SURVIVAL; SCALE-UP; CHILD HEALTH; IMPLEMENTATION; MULTICOUNTRY; BOTTLENECKS; PREVENTION; FIDELITY; PROGRESS; AGENDA	Background: Evaluating health systems and policy (HSP) change and implementation is critical in understanding reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) progress within and across countries. Whilst data for health outcomes, coverage and equity have advanced in the last decade, comparable analyses of HSP changes are lacking. We present a set of novel tools developed by Countdown to 2015 (Countdown) to systematically analyse and describe HSP change for RMNCH indicators, enabling multi-country comparisons. Methods: International experts worked with eight country teams to develop HSP tools via mixed methods. These tools assess RMNCH change over time (e.g. 1990-2015) and include: (i) Policy and Programme Timeline Tool (depicting change according to level of policy); (ii) Health Policy Tracer Indicators Dashboard (showing 11 selected RMNCH policies over time); (iii) Health Systems Tracer Indicators Dashboard (showing four selected systems indicators over time); and (iv) Programme implementation assessment. To illustrate these tools, we present results from Tanzania and Peru, two of eight Countdown case studies. Results: The Policy and Programme Timeline tool shows that Tanzania's RMNCH environment is complex, with increased funding and programmes for child survival, particularly primary-care implementation. Maternal health was prioritised since mid-1990s, yet with variable programme implementation, mainly targeting facilities. Newborn health only received attention since 2005, yet is rapidly scaling-up interventions at facility-and community-levels. Reproductive health lost momentum, with re-investment since 2010. Contrastingly, Peru moved from standalone to integrated RMNCH programme implementation, combined with multi-sectoral, anti-poverty strategies. The HSP Tracer Indicators Dashboards show that Peru has adopted nine of 11 policy tracer indicators and Tanzania has adopted seven. Peru costed national RMNCH plans pre-2000, whereas Tanzania developed a national RMNCH plan in 2006 but only costed the reproductive health component. Both countries included all lifesaving RMNCH commodities on their essential medicines lists. Peru has twice the health worker density of Tanzania (15.4 vs. 7.1/10,000 population, respectively), although both are below the 22.8 WHO minimum threshold. Conclusions: These are the first HSP tools using mixed methods to systematically analyse and describe RMNCH changes within and across countries, important in informing accelerated progress for ending preventable maternal, newborn and child mortality in the post-2015 era.

An international surgical collaboration: humanitarian surgery in Brazil	HERNIA			English	Article						Humanitarian surgery; Hernia surgery; International collaboration	FAMILY-HEALTH-PROGRAM; INFANT-MORTALITY; IMPACT; CHALLENGES	Brazil is the fifth most populous country in the world with widespread regional and social inequalities. Regional disparities in healthcare are unacceptably large, with the remote and poor regions of the north and northeast having reduced life expectancy compared to the south region, where life expectancy approaches that of rich countries. We report our experience of a humanitarian surgery mission to the Amazonas state, in the northwest part of Brazil. In August 2014, a team of seven consultant surgeons, and two trainees with the charity 'International Hernia', visited three hospitals in the Amazonas state to provide hernia surgery and training. Results: Eighty-nine hernias were repaired in 74 patients (female = 22, male = 52) with a median age of 44 years (range 2-83 years). Nine patients underwent more than one type of hernia repair, and there were 9 laparoscopic inguinal and ventral incisional hernia repairs. Local doctors were trained in hernia repair techniques, and an International Hernia Symposium was held at the University of the State of Amazonas, Manaus. The humanitarian mission provided hernia surgery to an underserved population in Brazil and training to local doctors, building local sustainability. Continued cooperation between host and international surgeons for future missions to Brazil will ensure continuing surgical training and technical assistance.

Social protection spending and inequalities in depressive symptoms across Europe	SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Inequality; Depression; Socioeconomic factors; Europe; Employment	CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; MENTAL-HEALTH; LIFE-COURSE; WELFARE REGIMES; GREAT RECESSION; UNEMPLOYMENT; GENDER; POSITION; SUICIDES	Common mental disorders are an increasing global public health concern. The least advantaged in society experience a greater burden of mental illness, but inequalities in mental health vary by social, political, and economic contexts. This study investigates whether spending on different types of social protection alters the extent of social inequality in depressive symptoms. Data were obtained from the 2006 and 2012 cross-sectional waves of the European Social Survey, which included 48,397 individuals from 18 European countries. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D 8). Statistical interactions between country-level social protection spending and individuals' education level, employment and family status were explored using multilevel regression models. Higher spending on active labour market programmes was related to narrower inequality in depressive symptoms by education level. Compared to men with high education, the marginal effect of having low education was 1.67 (95 % CI, 1.46-1.87) among men in countries with lower spending and 0.85 (95 % CI, 0.66-1.03) in higher spending countries. Single parents exhibited fewer depressive symptoms, as spending on family policies increased. Little evidence was found for an overall association between spending on unemployment benefits and employment-related inequalities in depressive symptoms, but in 2012, unemployment spending appeared beneficial to mental health among the unemployed. Greater investment in social protection may act to reduce inequalities in depressive symptoms. Reductions in spending levels or increased conditionality may adversely affect the mental health of disadvantaged social groups.

J	Menigoz, K; Nathan, A; Turrell, G				Menigoz, Karen; Nathan, Andrea; Turrell, Gavin			Ethnic differences in overweight and obesity and the influence of acculturation on immigrant bodyweight: evidence from a national sample of Australian adults	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Obesity; BMI; Bodyweight; Ethnicity; Immigrant; Minority; Acculturation; Prevention; Inequality; Australia	BODY-MASS INDEX; UNITED-STATES; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE; HEALTH-STATUS; WEIGHT STATUS; US RESIDENCE; TRENDS; BMI; CHILDREN	Background: Despite growing international migration and documented ethnic differences in overweight and obesity in developed countries, no research has described the epidemiology of immigrant overweight and obesity at a national level in Australia, a country where immigrants comprise 28.1 % of the population. The aim of this study was to examine ethnic differences in body mass index (BMI) and overweight/obesity in Australia and the influence of acculturation on bodyweight among Australian immigrants. Methods: Data from the national Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey were used to examine mean BMI and odds of overweight/obesity comparing immigrants (n = 2 997) with Australian born (n = 13 047). Among immigrants, acculturation differences were examined by length of residence in Australia and age at migration. Data were modelled in a staged approach using multilevel linear and logistic regression, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables. Results: Relative to Australian born, men from North Africa/Middle East and Oceania regions had significantly higher BMIs, and men from North West Europe, North East Asia and Southern and Central Asia had significantly lower BMIs. Among women, the majority of foreign born groups had significantly lower BMIs compared with Australian born. Male and female immigrants living in Australia for 15 years or more had significantly higher BMIs and increased odds of being overweight/obese respectively, compared with immigrants living in Australia for less than 5 years. Male immigrants arriving as adolescents were twice more likely to be overweight/obese and had significantly higher BMIs than immigrants who arrived as adults. Male and female immigrants who arrived as children (<= 11 years) had significantly higher odds of adult overweight/obesity and BMIs. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of ethnic differences in overweight and obesity in Australia with male immigrants from North Africa/Middle East and Oceania regions being particularly vulnerable. In addition, this study suggests that greater acculturation may negatively impact immigrant bodyweight and recently arrived immigrants as well as those who arrive as children or adolescents may benefit from obesity prevention intervention. Public health policy targeted at and tailored to these immigrant cohorts will assist in the multi-pronged approach required to address the obesity epidemic.

J	Woodward, A; Sondorp, E; Witter, S; Martineau, T				Woodward, Aniek; Sondorp, Egbert; Witter, Sophie; Martineau, Tim			Health systems research in fragile and conflict-affected states: a research agenda-setting exercise	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Health systems research; Research agenda; Priority setting; Fragile states; Conflict affected states	HUMAN-RESOURCES; BASIC PACKAGE; SERVICES	Background: There is increasing interest amongst donors in investing in the health sectors of fragile and conflict-affected states, although there is limited research evidence and research funding to support this. Agreeing priority areas is therefore critical. This paper describes an 18-month process to develop a consultative research agenda and questions for health systems research, providing reflections on the process as well as its output. Methods: After a scoping review had been conducted, primary data was collected from August 2014 to September 2015. Data was collected using a mixture of methods, including an online survey (n = 61), two face-to-face group sessions (one with 11 participants; one with 17), email consultation (n = 18), a webinar (n = 65), and feedback via LinkedIn. Two steering committees of purposively selected experts guided the research process - a core steering committee (n = 10) and broad steering committee (n = 20). The process moved from developing broad topics and lists of research needs to grouping and honing them down into a smaller, prioritised agenda, with specific research questions associated to each topic. Results: An initial list of 146 topics was honed down to 25 research needs through this process, grouped thematically under transition and sustainability, resilience and fragility, gender and equity, accessibility, capacity building, actors and accountability, community, healthcare delivery, health workforce, and health financing. They were not ranked, as all health system areas are interdependent. The research agenda forms a starting point for local contextualisation and is not definitive. Conclusions: A wide range of stakeholders participated in the different stages of this exercise, which produced a useful starting point for health systems research agenda setting in fragile and conflict-affected states. The process of engagement may have been as valuable for building a community of researchers as the product. It is now important to drive forward the research agenda. Without both a higher profile and deeper focus for this area, there is a real risk that fragile and conflict-affected states will continue to fall behind in global health and development goals.

In 2003 both Brazilian and Peru governments have finished paving an international road connecting remotes areas in the Brazilian Amazon to the Pacific coast in Peru. Methods: The situation of prenatal care and child delivery with mothers of children under 5 years old living in the urban area of Assis Brasil, Acre was assessed in two cross-sectional studies performed in 2003 and 2011, corresponding to the period before and after the Pacific highway construction. Results: In 2003, most mothers were of black/Afro-American ethnicity, or "pardos" (the offspring of a Caucasian with a African descendant) (77.69 %), had more than 4 years of schooling (73.40 %) and had a mean age of 22.18 years. In 2011, the number of as a migration of indigenous women increased from 0 to 14.40 % of the respondents, because of migration from communities along the rivers to urban areas, with no other significant changes in maternal characteristics. No significant improvement in childbirth assistance was noticed between 1997 and 2011; only the percentage of in-hospital vaginal deliveries performed by doctors increased from 17.89 to 66.26 % (p < 0.001) during this period. Access to prenatal care was associated with white ethnicity in 2003, and higher socioeconomic level and white ethnicity in 2011, while the higher number of prenatal visits was associated with higher maternal education and higher socioeconomic levels in 2011. Vaginal child delivery at a hospital facility was associated with maternal age in 2003, and year of birth, being of white ethnicity and higher level of education in 2011. Conclusions: The indicators of prenatal care and child delivery were below the national average, showing that geographical isolation still affects women's health care in the Amazon, despite the construction of the highway and governmental health protocols adopted during this period.

The Debate that follows interrogates the role that capital and corporate institutions have assumed in defining and implementing global healthcare reforms. The contributors to the Debate do not agree on the legitimacy of the classic oppositions in design of healthcare state vs market or public vs private. Nor do they concur on the (in)compatibility between pragmatic collaboration with corporate institutions and realization of norms of social justice in health. Yet all do agree that unequal access to healthcare is only one of the structural determinants of inequalities in global health. Global capital is implicated in structural patterns of investment that have made jobs, wages and land-based livelihoods insecure and unhealthy, fouled air and water and profited from spiralling costs of drugs and treatment. On such an economically and politically conflictual terrain, it is unlikely that collaboration with corporate institutions is consistent with structural assault on the social determinants of global inequalities in health.

The authors illustrate and contextualize the different periods and approaches with examples from a range of Latin American countries, drawing on diverse political experiences and social struggles in the health arena. The analysis concludes with reflections about the region's experiences of resisting and challenging the neoliberal health agenda, in spite of domestic and global environments that have constrained these efforts, past and present. In this sense, the struggle for bona fide equity in health and health policy remains an important and ongoing priority.

J	Qadeer, I; Baru, R				Qadeer, Imrana; Baru, Rama			Shrinking Spaces for the "Public' in Contemporary Public Health	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article								This contribution joins the debate on the politics of global health, and specifically inequality in health. Focusing on three recent and pertinent reports, it examines two opposing perspectives for dealing with this inequality. Driven by the global financial crisis, one perspective attempts to validate the intervention of global capital through markets, technology and research funding in global health; it promotes a uniform model of universal health care based on medical care through insurances, public-private partnerships and a dominant private sector. The other perspective arises from the specific historical experiences of nation states in which health has been treated as a commodity. It highlights the negative impacts on global health of neoliberal reforms, such as reductions in welfare and increasing inequalities, and critiques the optimization of profits from health services, which undermines the government's role in health care. The article analyses the historical evolution of these perspectives and the two kinds of movements that emerged across the globe. Using the case of India, the authors argue that where neoliberalism prevails, health movements must link up with broader democratic and political movements that work for the realignment of structural inequalities and policy shifts for the well-being of the majority.

The article reflects on the tensions that arise as a result of the growing influence of business norms within health funding alongside what critics have termed the scientization' of global health, and it considers the gendered implications of these developments. It is argued that it is due to the under-valuation and marginalization of community-based work that provides spaces for women's voices in the design and delivery of health interventions that large-scale technical' interventions receive priority. The article examines what this means in terms of NGOs' ability to work towards producing transformative change around gender and indeed racial equality.

J	Hunsmann, M				Hunsmann, Moritz			Pushing "Global Health' out of its Comfort Zone: Lessons from the Depoliticization of AIDS Control in Africa	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article							HIV EPIDEMICS; POLICY; TRANSMISSION; CARE; PREVENTION; HIV/AIDS; POLITICS; DISEASE; PEOPLE	By affecting the lives and survival of numerous people, global health initiatives deeply alter local landscapes of inequality. They tackle some conditions at the origin of ill health while leaving others untouched, and they inevitably generate new inequalities. Yet, despite their inherently conflictual nature, global health players often minimize the political dimension of their interventions. Taking international AIDS control efforts in Tanzania as an example, this contribution discusses some modalities and political causes of the structural neglect of conflict in global health discourse and practice. It analyses how African HIV epidemics continue to be framed and managed in ways that obscure both the health inequalities at their origin, and those that result from efforts to control them. AIDS policy makers conceal inequalities by framing the epidemic as a problem of individual sexual behaviour, and by implicitly rationing access to HIV-prevention and -treatment services. Furthermore, the imposition of disease hierarchies set by international fora excludes broader health-related allocation decisions from domestic democratic debate. Drawing on a theoretical consideration of depoliticization as artificial deconflictualization, the article concludes by calling for a more open acknowledgement of conflict in global health policy making, and explores some analytical and practical implications of such a re-politicization of public health.

J	Amrith, M; Amrith, S				Amrith, Megha; Amrith, Sunil			Migration, Health and Inequality in Asia	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article							SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; UNIVERSAL HEALTH; MIGRANTS; COVERAGE; CITY	Focusing on health, migration and inequality, this contribution examines the role of citizenship in shaping migrants' experiences of health. The idea of national citizenship has frequently dominated the framing of debates about whether states or markets should play the dominant role in health. Yet, health inequalities are embedded in transnational flows of people, capital and ideas, which are themselves a product of history. Migration is thus essential to understanding the transnational production and reinforcement, or mitigation, of health inequalities. Adopting a focus on migration in Asia, past and present, this article argues that the health risks and vulnerabilities that migrants face are a result of both state and market failures. Migrants' exclusion from various forms of care and protection, and their political disenfranchisement, expose a fraught relationship between health and citizenship for those who move within and across borders. At the same time, both historical and contemporary experience demonstrates how migrants might contest these inequalities and allow us to reimagine alternative forms of citizenship. Efforts to ensure the health and well-being of migrants demonstrate diverse alliances at work, even if such alliances remain limited when confronted with the logic of the nation, borders and security.

The purpose of this report is to document progress in two of our research projects in Japan, which currently is the most aged society in the world. The Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) is one of the largest nation-wide research projects on aging, with more than 100 000 participants in 2010 and 2013. One of the notable findings is that community participation is a significant determinant of older people's health. We have also made progress in the development of the JAGES Health Equity Assessment and Response Tools (HEART), which is a management tool for developing age-friendly cities. This progress suggests that community perspective and management of health promotion in the communities are valuable and require further research.

INDIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Disability; persons with disability; persons with mental illness; right of persons with disabilities	GLOBAL BURDEN; HEALTH; DISORDERS; PEOPLE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; STIGMA; DEPENDENCE; SEVERITY	India ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in 2007. This is a welcome step towards realizing the rights of the persons with disability. The UNCRPD proclaims that disability results from interaction of impairments with attitudinal and environmental barriers which hinders full and active participation in society on an equal basis with others. Further, the convention also mandates the signatory governments to change their local laws, to identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers and to comply with the terms of the UNCRPD in order to protect the rights of the person with disabilities, hence the amendments of the national laws. Hence, the Government of India drafted two important bill the Right of Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2014 (RPWD Bill, 2014) and Mental Health Care Bill, 2013 (MHC Bill, 2013). There is no doubt that persons with mental illness are stigmatized and discriminated across the civil societies, which hinders full and active participation in society. This situation becomes worse with regard to providing mental health care, rehabilitation and social welfare measures to persons with mental illness. There is an urgent need to address this issue of attitudinal barrier so that the rights of persons with mental illness is upheld. Hence, this article discusses shortcomings in the Right of Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2014 (RPWD Bill, 2014) from the perspective of persons with mental illness. Further, the article highlights the need to synchronize both the RPWD Bill, 2014 and Mental Health Care Bill, 2013 to provide justice for persons with mental illness.

All athletes have a right to engage in safe sport', defined as an athletic environment that is respectful, equitable and free from all forms of non-accidental violence to athletes. Yet, these issues represent a blind spot for many sport organisations through fear of reputational damage, ignorance, silence or collusion. This consensus statement extends the 2007 IOC Consensus Statement on Sexual Harassment and Abuse in Sport, presenting additional evidence of several other types of harassment and abusepsychological, physical and neglect. All ages and types of athletes are susceptible to these problems but science confirms that elite, disabled, child and lesbian/gay/bisexual/trans-sexual (LGBT) athletes are at highest risk, that psychological abuse is at the core of all other forms and that athletes can also be perpetrators. Harassment and abuse arise from prejudices expressed through power differences. Perpetrators use a range of interpersonal mechanisms including contact, non-contact/verbal, cyber-based, negligence, bullying and hazing. Attention is paid to the particular risks facing child athletes, athletes with a disability and LGBT athletes. Impacts on the individual athlete and the organisation are discussed. Sport stakeholders are encouraged to consider the wider social parameters of these issues, including cultures of secrecy and deference that too often facilitate abuse, rather than focusing simply on psychopathological causes. The promotion of safe sport is an urgent task and part of the broader international imperative for good governance in sport. A systematic multiagency approach to prevention is most effective, involving athletes, entourage members, sport managers, medical and therapeutic practitioners, educators and criminal justice agencies. Structural and cultural remedies, as well as practical recommendations, are suggested for sport organisations, athletes, sports medicine and allied disciplines, sport scientists and researchers. The successful prevention and eradication of abuse and harassment against athletes rests on the effectiveness of leadership by the major international and national sport organisations.

The aims of this study were: a) to determine the prevalence of poor mental health in the working population of Spain in 2011; b) to identify the association of this prevalence with socioeconomic and work-related variables for men and women separately; c) to determine if the patterns differ by gender. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with data from the National Health Survey of Spain (2011). Of the 21,007 participants in the survey, we selected 7396 whose employment status was described as "working" The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used as a screening tool to detect poor mental health. Prevalences were calculated and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to verify the association between variables. Results: The prevalence of poor mental health was higher among women (19.9%) than men (13.9%), the overall prevalence being 16.8%. The variables associated with a higher prevalence were type of contract and work-related variables in men, and age and socioeconomic variables in women. Conclusions: This study shows that, in the working population of Spain, the prevalence of poor mental health and its related factors differ by gender. Poor mental health is mainly related to socioeconomic variables in women but is mostly associated with work-related variables in men. (C) 2016 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Grassroots volunteers in context: rewarding and adverse experiences of local women working on HIV and AIDS in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania	GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						Africa; collaboration; partnerships; communities; culture; ethnicity; women; global health; globalization; indigenous health; organizational development; organizational change	SUSTAINED VOLUNTEERISM; HEALTH-PROMOTION; PARTICIPATION; SYNERGY; AFRICA; CARE	Many nongovernmental organizations in Africa rely on grassroots volunteers to provide critical health services. Considering context and the interplay of individual, organizational, and societal influences on the experience of volunteers, this paper addresses three questions: What do grassroots volunteers contribute? What organizational processes promote volunteer engagement? What are the positive and negative consequences of volunteering? Eighteen members and staff of the Tanzanian HIV and AIDS NGO, KIWAKKUKI, were selected from 6000+ women volunteers to be interviewed. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes. Within KIWAKKUKI, volunteers contributed time and local knowledge, leading to an indigenous educational approach building on local norms and customs. Volunteers' engagement was motivated by the desire to support family members, reverse stigma, and work/socialize with other women. Benefits to volunteers included skills acquisition and community recognition; yet some volunteers also reported negative experiences including burnout, conferred stigma, and domestic violence. Positive organizational processes built on cultural practices such as collective decision-making and singing. The findings point to important considerations about context, including the synergistic effect training can have on local traditions of caring, complications of gender inequity, and how community health planning processes may need to be modified in extremely poor settings. This research also suggests good utility of the research framework (the Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning) that was used to analyze volunteer engagement for service delivery in sub-Saharan contexts.

This article analyses the particular relevance of gender for debates about global health and the role for international human rights law in supporting improved health outcomes during public health emergencies. Looking specifically at the recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks, what we find particularly troubling in both cases is the paucity of engagement with human rights language and the diverse backgrounds of women in these locations of crisis, when women-specific advice was being issued. We find the lessons that should have been learnt from the Ebola experience have not been applied in the Zika outbreak and there remains a disconnect between the international public health advice being issued and the experience of pervasive structural gender inequalities among those experiencing the crises. In both cases we find that responses at the outbreak of the crisis presume that women have economic, social or regulatory options to exercise the autonomy contained in international advice. The problem in the case of both Ebola and Zika has been that leaving structural gender inequalities out of the crisis response has further compounded those inequalities. The article argues for a contextual human rights analysis that takes into account gender as a social and economic determinant of health.

J	Cumberland, PM; Rahi, JS				Cumberland, Phillippa M.; Rahi, Jugnoo S.		UK Biobank Eye Vision Consortium	Visual Function, Social Position, and Health and Life Chances The UK Biobank Study	JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							BEAVER-DAM-EYE; UNITED-STATES; VISION LOSS; IMPAIRMENT; PREVALENCE; ADULTS; RISK; MAGNITUDE; COHORT	IMPORTANCE The adverse impact of visual impairment and blindness and correlations with socioeconomic position are known. Understanding of the effect of the substantially more common near-normal vision (mild impairment) and associations with social position as well as health and life chances is limited. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of visual health (across the full acuity spectrum) with social determinants of general health and the association between visual health and health and social outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional epidemiologic study was conducted using UK Biobank data from 6 regional centers in England and Wales. A total of 112 314 volunteers (aged 40-73 years) were assessed in June 2009 and July 2010. Data analysis was performed from May 20, 2013, to November 19, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Habitual (correction if prescribed) distance visual acuity was used to assign participants to 1 of 8 categories from bilateral normal visual acuity (logMAR, 0.2 or better; Snellen equivalent, 6/9.5 or better) to visual impairment or blindness (logMAR, 0.5 or worse; Snellen equivalent, 6/19 or worse) usingWorld Health Organization and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision taxonomy. Relationships between vision, key social determinants and health and social outcomes (including the main factors that define an individual's life-the social, economic, educational, and employment opportunities and outcomes experienced by individuals during their life course) were examined using multivariable regression. RESULTS Of the of 112 314 participants, 61 169 were female (54.5%); mean (SD) age was 56.8 (8.1) years. A total of 759 (0.7%) of the participants had visual impairment or blindness, and an additional 25 678 (22.9%) had reduced vision in 1 or both eyes. Key markers of social position were independently associated with vision in a gradient across acuity categories; in a gradient of increasing severity, all-cause impaired visual function was associated with adverse social outcomes and impaired general and mental health. These factors, including having no educational qualifications (risk ratio [RR], 1.86 [95% CI, 1.69-2.04]), having a higher deprivation score (RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.07-1.09]), and being in a minority ethnic group (eg, Asian) (RR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.83-2.30]), were independently associated with being in the midrange vision category (at legal threshold for driving). This level of vision was associated with an increased risk of being unemployed (RR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.31-1.84]), having a lower-status job (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.09-1.41]), living alone (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.10-1.39]), and having mental health problems (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04-1.20]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Impaired vision in adults is common, and even near-normal vision, potentially unrecognized without assessment, has a tangible influence on quality of life. Because inequalities in visual health by social position mirror other health domains, inclusion of vision in generic initiatives addressing health inequalities could address the existing significant burden of underrecognized and/or latent visual disability. Longitudinal investigations are needed to elucidate pathophysiologic pathways and target modifiable mechanisms.

Evidence on trends and determinants of disability-free life expectancies (DFLEs) are available in high-income countries but less in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study examines the levels of and inequalities in LE, disability and DFLE between men and women across different age groups aged 50 years and over in six countries with developing economies. Methods This study utilised the cross-sectional data (n=32724) from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation and South Africa in 2007-2010. Disability was measured with the activity of daily living (ADL) instrument. The DFLE was estimated using the Sullivan method based on the standard period life table and ADL-disability proportions. Results The disability prevalence ranged from 13% in China to 54% in India. The prevalence of disability was highest and occurred at younger age in both sexes in India. Women were more disadvantaged with higher prevalence of disability across all age groups, and the situation was worst among older women in Mexico and the Russian Federation. Though women had higher LE, their proportion of remaining LE free from disability was lower than men. Conclusions There are inequalities in the levels of disability and DFLE among men and women in different age groups among people aged over 50 years in these six countries. Countermeasures to decrease intercountry and gender gaps in DFLE, including improvements in health promotion and healthcare distribution, with a gender equity focus, are needed.

Impact of homicide and traffic crashes on life expectancy in the largest Latin American country	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						accidents; traffic; Brazil; Canada; homicide; life expectancy; mortality; violence	INCOME INEQUALITY; GLOBAL BURDEN; BRAZIL; HEALTH; MORTALITY; INJURIES; DISEASES; VIOLENCE	Background Brazil and Canada are on opposite poles of the spectrum for life expectancy in America. We identified factors underlying Brazil's lower life expectancy relative to Canada, with emphasis on the role of injury compared with other major causes. Methods We computed life expectancy at birth in Brazil and Canada in 2010 and identified the ages and causes of death responsible for the gap between both countries. The main outcome measure was the contribution of homicide and traffic accidents to the gap, compared with other causes of death. Results Relative to Canada, life expectancy was lower in Brazil by 8.2 years (men) and 5,2 years (women), Injury lowered life expectancy of men in Brazil by 2.2 years, or more than a quarter of the gap, mainly due to homicide and traffic accidents between ages 20 and 64 years. Homicide and traffic accidents contributed more than all circulatory diseases combined. In women, circulatory disease was the most important cause of lower life expectancy. Conclusions In 2010, homicides and traffic accidents were the principal cause for short life expectancy of men in Brazil. Improving life expectancy in Brazil requires addressing the root causes of inequalities that drive illicit drug trade, violence and accidents.

Prevention by a health model requires an ecological perspective. Previous work has found evidence that economic factors, including unemployment and relative poverty, as well as political culture and values, may affect violent death rates, including homicide and suicide. Nevertheless, wider political analyses of the effects that different regimes have on these variables have been notably absent, for understandable reasons given the sheer complexity of patterns of governance throughout the world. In view of the importance and scale of the problem, and implications of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we feel it is nevertheless important to bring regime types into the conversation of factors that can influence violent death.

In the second National Burden of Disease (NBD) study, we aimed to analyse cause of death data for 1997-2012 and develop national, population group, and provincial estimates of the levels and causes of mortality. Method We used underlying cause of death data from death notifications for 1997-2012 obtained from Statistics South Africa. These data were adjusted for completeness using indirect demographic techniques for adults and comparison with survey and census estimates for child mortality. A regression approach was used to estimate misclassified HIV/AIDS deaths and so-called garbage codes were proportionally redistributed by age, sex, and population group population group (black African, Indian or Asian descent, white [European descent], and coloured [of mixed ancestry according to the preceding categories]). Injury deaths were estimated from additional data sources. Age-standardised death rates were calculated with mid-year population estimates and the WHO age standard. Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation Global Burden of Disease (IHME GBD) estimates for South Africa were obtained from the IHME GHDx website for comparison. Findings All-cause age-standardised death rates increased rapidly since 1997, peaked in 2006 and then declined, driven by changes in HIV/AIDS. Mortality from tuberculosis, non-communicable diseases, and injuries decreased slightly. In 2012, HIV/AIDS caused the most deaths (29.1%) followed by cerebrovascular disease (7.5%) and lower respiratory infections (4.9%). All-cause age-standardised death rates were 1.7 times higher in the province with the highest death rate compared to the province with the lowest death rate, 2.2 times higher in black Africans compared to whites, and 1.4 times higher in males compared with females. Comparison with the IHME GBD estimates for South Africa revealed substantial differences for estimated deaths from all causes, particularly HIV/AIDS and interpersonal violence. Interpretation This study shows the reversal of HIV/AIDS, non-communicable disease, and injury mortality trends in South Africa during the study period. Mortality differentials show the importance of social determinants, raise concerns about the quality of health services, and provide relevant information to policy makers for addressing inequalities. Differences between GBD estimates for South Africa and this study emphasise the need for more careful calibration of global models with local data.

Sex Differences in Tuberculosis Burden and Notifications in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Review							SMEAR-POSITIVE TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; PREVALENCE SURVEY; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; INFECTIOUS TUBERCULOSIS; UNDETECTED TUBERCULOSIS; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; TRIBAL POPULATION; NATIONAL-SURVEY; MADHYA-PRADESH	Background Tuberculosis (TB) case notification rates are usually higher in men than in women, but notification data are insufficient to measure sex differences in disease burden. This review set out to systematically investigate whether sex ratios in case notifications reflect differences in disease prevalence and to identify gaps in access to and/or utilisation of diagnostic services. Methods and Findings In accordance with the published protocol (CRD42015022163), TB prevalence surveys in nationally representative and sub-national adult populations (age >= 15 y) in low-and middle-income countries published between 1 January 1993 and 15 March 2016 were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Global Health, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; review of abstracts; and correspondence with the World Health Organization. Random-effects meta-analyses examined male-to-female (M:F) ratios in TB prevalence and prevalence-to-notification (P:N) ratios for smear-positive TB. Meta-regression was done to identify factors associated with higher M: F ratios in prevalence and higher P: N ratios. Eighty-three publications describing 88 surveys with over 3.1 million participants in 28 countries were identified (36 surveys in Africa, three in the Americas, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, 28 in South-East Asia and 17 in the Western Pacific). Fifty-six surveys reported in 53 publications were included in quantitative analyses. Overall random-effects weighted M: F prevalence ratios were 2.21 (95% CI 1.92-2.54; 56 surveys) for bacteriologically positive TB and 2.51 (95% CI 2.07-3.04; 40 surveys) for smear-positive TB. M:F prevalence ratios were highest in South-East Asia and in surveys that did not require selfreport of signs/symptoms in initial screening procedures. The summary random-effects weighted M:F ratio for P:N ratios was 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.91; 34 surveys). We intended to stratify the analyses by age, HIV status, and rural or urban setting; however, few studies reported such data. Conclusions TB prevalence is significantly higher among men than women in low-and middle-income countries, with strong evidence that men are disadvantaged in seeking and/or accessing TB care in many settings. Global strategies and national TB programmes should recognise men as an underserved high-risk group and improve men's access to diagnostic and screening services to reduce the overall burden of TB more effectively and ensure gender equity in TB care.

This paper reviews studies analysing media coverage of non-communicable disease (NCD) debates, focusing on how the industries marketing commodities that increase NCD risk are represented. Methods: A scoping review identified 61 studies providing information on media representations of NCD risks, NCD policies and tobacco, alcohol, processed food and soft drinks industries. The data were narratively synthesized to describe the sample, media depictions of industries, and corporate and public health attempts to frame the media debates. Results: The findings indicate that: (i) the limited research that has been undertaken is dominated by a focus on tobacco; (ii) comparative research across industries/risk-factors is particularly lacking; and (iii) coverage tends to be dominated by two contrasting frames and focuses either on individual responsibilities ('market justice' frames, often promoted by commercial stakeholders) or on the need for population-level interventions ('social justice' frames, frequently advanced by public health advocates). Conclusions: Establishing the underlying frameworks is crucial for the analysis of media representation of corporations, as they reflect the strategies that respective actors use to influence public health debates and decision making. The potential utility of media research lies in the insights that it can provide for public health policy advocates about successful framing of public health messages and strategies to counter frames that undermine public health goals. A better understanding of current media debates is of paramount importance to improving global health.

Previous studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between levels of HIV knowledge with its prevalence. However, for Bangladesh such evidence is non-existent. In this study, we aimed to explore the extent of HIV knowledge in relation to the socio-demographic variables such as age, region, area of residence i.e., urban or rural, wealth index and education, and investigate the factors influencing the level of HIV knowledge among Bangladeshi women. Methods: We used data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) survey conducted in 2011. In total 12,512 women ageing between 15 and 49 ever hearing about HIV regardless of HIV status were selected for this study. HIV knowledge level was estimated by analyzing respondents' answers to a set of 11 basic questions indicative of general awareness and mode of transmission. Descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation and multinominal logistic regression were performed for data analysis. Results: Little over half the respondents had good knowledge regarding HIV transmission risks. The mean HIV knowledge score was -0.001 (SD 0.914). Average correct response rate about mode of transmission was higher than for general awareness. Educational level of women and sex of household head were found to be significantly associated with HIV knowledge in the high score group. Those with no education, primary education or secondary education were less likely to be in the high score group for HIV knowledge when compared with those with higher than secondary level of education. Similarly those with male as household head were less likely to be in the higher score group for HIV knowledge. Conclusions: Level of HIV knowledge among Bangladeshi women is quite low, and the limiting factors are rooted in various demographic and household characteristics. Education and sex of the household head have been found to be significantly correlated with the level of HIV knowledge and propound sound grounds for their incorporation in the future HIV prevention strategies. Education of women may also have wider ramifications allowing reduction in gender inequality, which in turn favors higher knowledge about HIV.

In sub-Saharan Africa, due to poverty and low policy coverage, older adults are not well catered for. The effect of socio-economic inequality in the use of healthcare services among older adult men and women in Ghana was investigated in this paper. Methods: The data employed in the study were drawn from Global Ageing and Adult Health survey SAGE Wave 1 Ghana and was based on the design for the World Health Survey 2003, SAGE Wave 0, Ghana. The survey was conducted in 2007-2008 and collected data on socio-economic characteristics and other variables of the 5573 individuals interviewed. Results: Using generalized logit model, the study found that health status is a very strong determinant of the type of healthcare services preferred by older adults Ghanaians. Men with higher income preferred the private health facilities, while those who completed tertiary education, those with health insurance and those who self-rated their health as very bad, bad or moderate preferred public facility. Self-employed men and those in informal employment, preferred other health facilities outside the formal public health service. Women with primary and secondary education, preferred the private health facilities. Women with health insurance, those in middle and upper class income quintiles or those with self-rated bad and moderate health status or being relatively younger preferred the public facility to other health services. Self-employed women and those in informal employment preferred traditional treatment. In Ghana, there are important socio-economic gradients in the use of some healthcare services. In both sexes, those without insurance and rural residents preferred the pharmacy and traditional treatment. Conclusion: These differences may be due to socio-economic inequities but could also indicate that the existing health facilities are not always used in an optimal way. Patient factors may be equally important as supply factors in explaining the differential use of health services. The public health systems in Ghana still have a major role in improving the health of older adults. National commitments in providing basic essential infrastructure and personnel to health centres for the citizenry is imperative. Policy readjustment of the national health insurance scheme to make it truly accessible to the aged is essential.	[Saeed, B. I. I.] Kumasi Polytech, Dept Math & Stat, Kumasi, Ghana; [Yawson, A.

The major purpose of this study was to measure the role of the Human Development Index (HDI) in the pattern of cervical cytological abnormalities (CCAs). Methods: This was an analytical sectional study involving a review of secondary cervical cytology data collected from women living in the state of Maranhao, Brazil, in 2007-2012 and collected from the Cervical Cancer Information System (Sistema de Informacao do Cancer do Colo do Utero - SISCOLO). The cervical screening results were classified according to the Brazilian Classification of Cervical Reporting (Nomenclatura Brasileira para Laudos Cervicais), an adaptation of the Bethesda System. The Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) was used, which is an adaptation of the global HDI. The association between CCAs and MHDI was evaluated using the chi-squared test and odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). The significance level used for all tests was 5 %. Results: We analysed 1,363,689 examinations of women living in the state of Maranhao. CCAs were identified in 2.0 % of smears in municipalities with high MHDI, 2.2 % in those with medium or low MHDI and 4.1 % in those with very low MHDI. In addition, potentially malignant changes and suspected cervical cancer (HSIL+) were 40.0 % more frequent (0.3 %) in municipalities with medium or low MHDI and 3.6 times more frequent (0.8 %) in municipalities with very low MHDI compared to those with high MHDI (0.2 %). Conclusion: The association between MHDI and the occurrence of CCAs and HSIL+ shows that more developed areas with more effective health services have a lower prevalence of these lesions. To control cervical cancer, it is necessary to reduce social inequality and improve the availability of health services.

J	Blay-Palmer, A				Blay-Palmer, Alison			Power Imbalances, Food Insecurity, and Children's Rights in Canada	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						rights; power; food insecurity; Canada; children; neoliberal	POLICY	Increasingly, food is provided through an industrial food system that separates people from the source of their food and results in high rates of food insecurity, particularly for the most vulnerable in society. A lack of food is a symptom of a lack of power in a system that privileges free market principles over social justice and the protection of human rights. In Canada, the high rates of food insecurity among Canadian children is a reflection of their lack of power and the disregard of their human rights, despite the adoption of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991 and ratification of the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights in 1976, which established the right to food for all Canadians. Dueling tensions between human rights and market forces underpin this unacceptable state of affairs in Canada. Gaventa's "power cube" that describes different facets of power - including spaces, levels, and forms - is used to help understand the power imbalances that underlie this injustice. The analysis considers the impact of neoliberal free market principles on the realization of human rights, and the negative impacts this can have on health and well-being for the most vulnerable in society. Canadian case studies from both community organizations provide examples of how power can be shifted to achieve more inclusive, rights-based policy and action. Given increased global pressures toward more open trade markets and national austerity measures that hollow out social supports, Canada provides a cautionary tale for countries in the EU and the US, and for overall approaches to protect the most vulnerable in society.

Method We studied fetal deaths in Brazil between 1996 and 2012 within the following five regions of the country: the North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Central-West, through an analysis of data obtained from the Unified Health System's (SUS) Informatics Department. The rates of stillbirth in Brazil and in these regions were calculated in relation to the maternal and gestational age and education, birth weight, type of pregnancy, delivery type, weight ranges and cause of death. Results There were 579,661 recorded fetal deaths and a decrease of 22.9 % in the stillbirth rate. In 2012, the overall rate was 10.0/1000 births; the North and Northeast regions had the highest rates (10.3 and 12.1, respectively) and the South region had the lowest rate (7.7/1000 births). Two-thirds of the deaths occurred in pregnancies of 28 or more weeks. Low education was an important risk factor, with rates of 24.3/1000 birth in women with no formal education and 4.7/1000 birth in women with 12 or more years of study in 2012. More than 40 % of the causes of deaths were nonspecific. Conclusions Despite the gradual decline in stillbirth rates, Brazil still has stillbirth rates that are nearly two times higher than those found in developed countries. There are inequalities between country regions portrayed by the significant variation in mortality rates specified by cause.

The impact of increasing income inequalities on educational inequalities in mortality - An analysis of six European countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Income inequality; Health inequality; Mortality; International comparison; Fixed-effects; Longitudinal analysis; Europe	HEALTH INEQUALITIES; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; LIFE EXPECTANCY; INFANT-MORTALITY; NEW-ZEALAND; OLDER MEN; TRENDS; POPULATIONS; SMOKING; DIFFERENTIALS	Background: Over the past decades, both health inequalities and income inequalities have been increasing in many European countries, but it is unknown whether and how these trends are related. We test the hypothesis that trends in health inequalities and trends in income inequalities are related, i.e. that countries with a stronger increase in income inequalities have also experienced a stronger increase in health inequalities. Methods: We collected trend data on all-cause and cause-specific mortality, as well as on the household income of people aged 35-79, for Belgium, Denmark, England & Wales, France, Slovenia, and Switzerland. We calculated absolute and relative differences in mortality and income between low- and high-educated people for several time points in the 1990s and 2000s. We used fixed-effects panel regression models to see if changes in income inequality predicted changes in mortality inequality. Results: The general trend in income inequality between high- and low-educated people in the six countries is increasing, while the mortality differences between educational groups show diverse trends, with absolute differences mostly decreasing and relative differences increasing in some countries but not in others. We found no association between trends in income inequalities and trends in inequalities in all-cause mortality, and trends in mortality inequalities did not improve when adjusted for rising income inequalities. This result held for absolute as well as for relative inequalities. A cause-specific analysis revealed some association between income inequality and mortality inequality for deaths from external causes, and to some extent also from cardiovascular diseases, but without statistical significance. Conclusions: We find no support for the hypothesis that increasing income inequality explains increasing health inequalities. Possible explanations are that other factors are more important mediators of the effect of education on health, or more simply that income is not an important determinant of mortality in this European context of high- income countries. This study contributes to the discussion on income inequality as entry point to tackle health inequalities. More research is needed to test the common and plausible assumption that increasing income inequality leads to more health inequality, and that one needs to act against the former to avoid the latter.

J	Secor-Turner, M; Schmitz, K; Benson, K				Secor-Turner, Molly; Schmitz, Kaitlin; Benson, Kristen			Adolescent Experience of Menstruation in Rural Kenya	NURSING RESEARCH			English	Article						adolescent; Africa; hygiene; Kenya; menstruation; qualitative research; reproductive health	SCHOOL ATTENDANCE; REFLECTIONS; GENDER; GIRL	Background: Although menstruation is a universal experience, girls in resource-poor areas face unique challenges related to menstruation management. In Kenya, girls miss nearly 3.5 million learning days per month because of limited access to sanitary products and lack of adequate sanitation. Global priorities to address gender inequality-especially related to education-often do not consider the impact of poverty on gendered experiences, such as menstruation. Objective: The aim of the study was to describe the experiences of menstruation from the perspective of adolescent girls living in rural Kenya. Methods: Data for this qualitative study were collected through 29 individual interviews with adolescent girls and separate field observations. Descriptive content analysis was used to identify themes reflective of the data from the individual interviews and field notes. Results: Four themes were developed to summarize the data: (a) receiving information about menstruation, (b) experiences of menstruation, (c) menstrual hygiene practices, and (d) social norms and the meaning of menstruation. Conclusions: Findings from this study describe the impact of menstruation on the lives of adolescent girls in rural Kenya. Menstrual hygiene management and its associated challenges may impact girls' academic continuity. Experiences of menstruation also reinforce gender inequality and further marginalize girls in low-income, rural areas of Kenya. Consideration of menstruation is critical to promote health and academic continuity for girls in rural Kenya.

J	Lee, BX				Lee, Bandy X.			Causes and cures VII: Structural violence	AGGRESSION AND VIOLENT BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Violence studies; Interpersonal violence; Collective violence; Structural violence	ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; COUNTRIES; DISPARITY; HEALTH; WORLD; WOMEN	The past two years have been a landmark moment for violence prevention, with the publication of The Global Status Report on Violence Prevention 2014; a historic resolution on violence by the 67th World Health Assembly; and the release of multiple documents on violence by international and United Nations entities, with a corresponding building of momentum in scholarship. Most notably, in September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, addressing the need for violence prevention at an unprecedented scale. In this context, more than ever, violence studies have become a field of its own right. Still, a systematic approach of the topic has been lacking, and no textbook yet synthesizes the knowledge of multiple disciplines toward a cogent understanding. This article is the seventh of a series of fifteen articles that will cover, as an example, an outline of the Global Health Studies course entitled, "Violence: Causes and Cures," reviewing the major bio-psycho-social and structural-environmental perspectives on violence. Structural violence refers to a form of violence wherein social structures or social institutions harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs. Although less visible, it is greater in scope and in implication than another type of violence and might include health, economic, gender, and racial disparities. The concepts behind structural violence can help guide a program for violence prevention that incorporates the notion of positive peace. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Paediatric Radiation Oncology Society (PROS) is the only internationally operating society for paediatric radiation oncology. The objectives of PROS are to set a world-wide standard of excellence with respect to radiation oncology aspects in curing children and adolescents with cancer, to provide a forum for communication between radiation oncologists, and to exchange information with all professionals involved in the management of paediatric and adolescent cancer. Challenges include the need to promote education and support practice in low and middle income countries (LMIC) as well as the cost and availability of modern treatment technologies for all but most especially these countries. Collaborations with other societies that include for example the education programmes provided jointly with ESTRO, and the upgraded technical platform of the PROS web site offer new possibilities to enhance the efficacy of PROS in education and support of paediatric radiation oncology practice world-wide. PROS has made an important contribution to the management of childhood malignancies over the past decade and new and developing collaborations between PROS and other societies or organizations will ultimately lead to a reduction in world-wide health care inequalities.

J	Weng, YQ; Li, MZ; Foo, CT				Weng, Yangqin; Li, Mingzhi; Foo, Check-Teck			Education inside China: a longitudinal (1989-2011) analysis	CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES			English	Article						Education in China; Institutional reform; Mincer equation; Return to schooling	URBAN CHINA; RETURNS; INEQUALITY; TRANSITION	Purpose - This paper aims to analyze the rates of returns on education in China and in the process raises issues relevant to the management of China's system of education. In the ongoing great transformation period of China, the rising rates of returns on education may have been indicators reflecting China's social progressiveness. However, very little research efforts have been devoted to the study of the impacts of such factors as geographical regions and genders, etc. The authors hope to fill these gaps in the literature. Design/methodology/approach - The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) database is used for this study (University of North Carolina). The longitudinal nature of the data sets covering 1989, 1991, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2011 provides a good basis for comparative analyses. The theory is grounded upon the Mincer equations through which econometric estimates are then made. Findings - Disparities in returns on education are found between genders and across geographical regions. The regression results show that the women's returns on education are consistently higher than those of men. However, the scales of such gender differences differ between the rural and urban areas: smaller for rural area and larger, more significantly so for urban. Additionally, we have found that the rates of returns on education in China have risen significantly over these years, and these increases have been largely due to the effects of institutional reforms. The urban-rural gap in their degrees of market orientation has contributed to the differences in their rates of returns on education. The analyses also suggest that foreign direct investment inflows, international trade and the increasing competitiveness from private enterprises render human capital more valuable to urban businesses. In case of the rural areas, a lack of incentive system tends to have contributed to the lower rates of returns on education. Originality/value - The authors have presented evidence on the trends in the rates of returns on education during China's critical transition period. Analyses of the possible reasons behind the differential rates of returns are provided. These findings are helpful for the government to shape their policies towards education. For instance, the government should give more emphasis to vocational schooling due to their significantly higher rates of returns.

While previous studies have focused on inequalities within countries, the aim of the present study was to quantify existing inequalities in cancer incidence and mortality between countries. Data on total and site-specific cancer incidence and mortality in 2003-2007 were obtained for 43 countries with medium-to-high levels of human development via Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Vol. X and the WHO Mortality Database. We calculated the concentration index as a summary measure of socioeconomic-related inequality between countries. Inequalities in cancer burden differed markedly by site; the concentration index for all sites combined was 0.03 for incidence and 0.02 for mortality, pointing towards a slightly higher burden in countries with higher levels of the human development index (HDI). For both incidence and mortality, this pattern was most pronounced for melanoma. In contrast, the burden of cervical cancer was disproportionally high in countries with lower HDI levels. Prostate, lung and breast cancer contributed most to inequalities in overall cancer incidence in countries with higher HDI levels, while for mortality these were mostly driven by lung cancer in higher HDI countries and stomach cancer in countries with lower HDI levels. Global inequalities in the burden of cancer remain evident at the beginning of the twenty-first century: with a disproportionate burden of lifestyle-related cancers in countries classified as high HDI, while infection-related cancers continue to predominate in transitioning countries with lower levels of HDI.

The number of displaced people reached an unprecedented level in 2015, at a total of 60 million worldwide, with more than 1 million crossing into Europe in the past year alone. Migrants and refugees are often perceived to carry a higher load of infectious diseases, despite no systematic association. We propose three important contributions that the global health community can make to help address infectious disease risks and global health inequalities worldwide, with a particular focus on the refugee crisis in Europe. First, policy decisions should be based on a sound evidence base regarding health risks and burdens to health systems, rather than prejudice or unfounded fears. Second, for incoming refugees, we must focus on building inclusive, cost-effective health services to promote collective health security. Finally, alongside protracted conflicts, widening of health and socioeconomic inequalities between high-income and lower-income countries should be acknowledged as major drivers for the global refugee crisis, and fully considered in planning long-term solutions.

MethodsFrom October 2012 to May 2013, prisoners housed in two distinct units (HIV-negative and HIV-positive) were approached to participate in the TB screening study. Consenting prisoners submitted two sputum samples that were examined using GeneXpert MTB/RIF, smear microscopy and liquid culture. Socio-demographic and clinical information was collected and correlates of active TB, defined as having either a positive GeneXpert MTB/RIF or culture results, were assessed using regression analyses. ResultsAmong the total of 559 prisoners, 442 (79.1%) had complete data; 28.7% were HIV-infected, 80.8% were men and the average age was 36.4 (SD 9.8) years. Overall, 34 (7.7%) had previously undiagnosed active TB, of whom 64.7% were unable to complete their TB treatment in prison due to insufficient time (<6 months) remaining in prison. Previously undiagnosed active TB was independently associated with older age groups (AOR 11.44 and 6.06 for age 50 and age 40-49 years, respectively) and with higher levels of immunosuppression (CD4 < 200 cells/ml) in HIV-infected prisoners (AOR 3.07, 95% CI 1.03-9.17). ConclusionsThe high prevalence of previously undiagnosed active TB in this prison highlights the inadequate performance of internationally recommended case-finding strategies and suggests that passive case-finding policies should be abandoned, especially in prison settings where HIV infection is prevalent. Moreover, partnerships between criminal justice and public health treatment systems are crucial to continue TB treatment after release. ObjectifsEtudier la prevalence de la tuberculose (TB) active non precedemment diagnostiquee parmi les detenus dans la plus grande prison de la Malaisie a l'aide d'une strategie de recherche intensifiee des cas de TB. MethodesD'octobre 2012 a mai 2013, les prisonniers detenus dans deux unites distinctes (VIH-negative et VIH-positive) ont ete sollicites pour participer a l'etude de depistage de la TB. Les prisonniers consentants ont soumis 2 echantillons de crachats qui ont ete examines en utilisant le test GeneXpert MTB/RIF, la microscopique des frottis et la culture liquide. Les informations sociodemographiques et cliniques ont ete recueillies et les correlats de TB active, definie comme ayant soit un resultat positif par GeneXpert MTB/RIF ou avec la culture, ont ete evalues a l'aide d'analyses de regression. ResultatsSur le total de 562 prisonniers, 78,7% avaient des donnees completes; 28,7% etaient infectes par le VIH, 80,8% etaient des hommes et l'age moyen etait de 36,4 ans (SD 9,8). 7,7% avait une TB active non diagnostiquee precedemment, dont 64,7% etaient incapables de terminer leur traitement de la TB en prison en raison du manque de temps (<6 mois) restant en prison. La TB active non diagnostiquee precedemment etait independamment associee aux groupes plus ages (AOR= 11,44 et 6,06 pour l'age 50 et l'age compris entre 40 et 49 ans, respectivement) et avec des niveaux plus eleves de l'immunosuppression (CD4 <200 cellules/ml) chez les prisonniers infectes par le VIH (AOR 3,07; IC95%: 1,03 a 9,17). ConclusionsLa prevalence elevee de TB active non diagnostiquee precedemment dans cette prison souligne la performance insuffisante des strategies de recherche des cas recommandees au niveau international et suggere que les politiques de depistage passif devraient etre abandonnees, en particulier dans les prisons oU l'infection au VIH est repandue. En outre, les partenariats entre la justice penale et les systemes de traitement de la sante publique sont essentiels pour la poursuite du traitement de la TB apres la liberation. ObjetivosInvestigar la prevalencia de casos de tuberculosis (TB) activa previamente no diagnosticada entre prisioneros de la prision mas grande de Malasia utilizando una estrategia intensificada de deteccion de casos de TB. MetodosEntre Octubre 2012 y Mayo 2013, se pregunto a los prisioneros albergados en dos unidades distintivas (VIH-negativa y VIH-positivas) si querian participar en el estudio de cribado de TB. Los prisioneros que dieron su consentimiento entregaron dos muestras de esputo las cuales fueron examinadas utilizando el metodo Xpert MTB/RIF, la baciloscopia y el cultivo liquido. Se recogio informacion socio-demografica y clinica y se evaluaron los correlatos de TB activa, definidos como tener un resultado positivo en GeneXpert MTB/RIF o el cultivo, mediante un analisis de regresion. ResultadosDe un total de 562 prisioneros, un 78.7% tenian datos completos; 28.7% estaban infectados con VIH, 80.8% eran hombres y la edad media era de 36.4 (SD 9.8) anos. Un 7.7% tenian un TB activa sin diagnostico previo, de los cuales 64.7% no pudieron completar su tratamiento para la TB en prision por falta de tiempo (<6 meses) en prision. Una TB activa previamente sin diagnosticar estaba independientemente asociada con grupos de edad mayores (AOR 11.44 y 6.06 para edades 50 anos y 40-49 anos, respectivamente) y con mayores niveles de inmunosupresion (CD4<200 celulas/ml) en prisioneros infectados con VIH (AOR 3.07, IC 95% 1.03-9.17). ConclusionesLa alta prevalencia de TB activa sin diagnostico previo en esta prision, pone de manifiesto el desempeno inadecuado de las estrategias internacionalmente recomendadas de deteccion de casos y sugiere que la politica de busqueda pasiva de casos deberia de abandonarse, especialmente en las prisiones en donde la infeccion por VIH es prevalente. Mas aun, las alianzas entre los sistemas de justicia criminal y de salud publica son cruciales para continuar el tratamiento de la TB despues de salir de la carcel.

J	Boerma, T; Hosseinpoor, AR; Verdes, E; Chatterji, S				Boerma, Ties; Hosseinpoor, Ahmad Reza; Verdes, Emese; Chatterji, Somnath			A global assessment of the gender gap in self-reported health with survey data from 59 countries	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Self-reported health; Gender differences; Health surveys; Behavioural factors; Biological factors; Gender inequality; Chronic conditions	RATED HEALTH; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MORTALITY; QUESTIONNAIRES; ORGANIZATION; ILLNESS; ASTHMA; ADULTS; LIFE	Background: While surveys in high-income countries show that women generally have poorer self-reported health than men, much less is known about gender differences in other regions of the world. Such data can be used to examine the determinants of sex differences. Methods: We analysed data on respondents 18 years and over from the World Health Surveys 2002-04 in 59 countries, which included multiple measures of self-reported health, eight domains of functioning and presumptive diagnoses of chronic conditions. The age-standardized female excess fraction was computed for all indicators and analysed for five regional groups of countries. Multivariate regression models were used to examine the association between country gaps in self-reported health between the sexes with societal and other background characteristics. Results: Women reported significantly poorer health than men on all self-reported health indicators. The excess fraction was 15 % for the health score based on the eight domains, 28 % for "poor" or "very poor" self-rated health on the single question, and 26 % for "severe" or "extreme" on a single question on limitations. The excess female reporting of poorer health occurred at all ages, but was smaller at ages 60 and over. The female excess was observed in all regions, and was smallest in the European high-income countries. Women more frequently reported problems in specific health domains, with the excess fraction ranging from 25 % for vision to 35 % for mobility, pain and sleep, and with considerable variation between regions. Angina, arthritis and depression had female excess fractions of 33, 32 and 42 % respectively. Higher female prevalence of the presumptive diagnoses was observed in all regional country groups. The main factors affecting the size of the gender gap in self-reported health were the female-male gaps in the prevalence of chronic conditions, especially arthritis and depression and gender characteristics of the society. Conclusions: Large female-male differences in self-reported health and functioning, equivalent to a decade of growing older, consistently occurred in all regions of the world, irrespective of differences in mortality levels or societal factors. The multi-country study suggests that a mix of biological factors and societal gender inequalities are major contributing factors to gender gap in self-reported measures of health.

We used the data from the International Mobility in Aging Study. Clinically relevant depression was defined as a score of >= 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale (CES-D). Poisson regressions with robust covariance correction were used to estimate prevalence ratios associated with potential risk factors. Prevalence of clinically relevant depression across research sites varied widely, being consistently higher in women than in men. It was lowest in men from Brazil (6.3%) and highest in women from Albania (46.6%). Low education and insufficient income, living alone, multiple chronic conditions, and poor physical performance were all significantly associated with depression prevalence. Poor physical performance was more strongly associated with depression in men than in women. Similar factors are associated with clinically relevant depression among men and women and across research sites. The large variation in depression prevalence population rates is unexplained by the classical individual factors considered in the study suggesting the impact of country characteristics on depression among older populations.

Detention of People Lost to Follow-Up on TB Treatment in Kenya: The Need for Human Rights-Based Alternatives	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; PUBLIC-HEALTH; COMMUNITY; NAIROBI; RISK; CARE; DETERMINANTS; GLOSSARY; DISTRICT	Adherence to treatment is a key element for global TB control. Public health laws can be used to enforce isolation, adherence, and completion of TB treatment. However, the practical application of public health laws can potentially range from voluntary measures to involuntary detention approaches. This paper explores the potential risks and impacts of using detention approaches to enforce TB treatment adherence. In August 2015, we conducted a literature search regarding the application of public health laws to enforce adherence to TB treatment globally, and specifically in Kenya. Texts were analyzed using narrative synthesis. Results indicated that in Kenya, people lost to follow-up on TB treatment were frequently detained in prisons. However, incarceration and detention approaches curtail the rights to health, informed consent, privacy, freedom from non-consensual treatment, freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment, and freedom of movement of people lost to follow-up. Detention could also worsen social inequalities and lead to a paradoxical increase in TB incidence. We suggest the incorporation of less intrusive solutions in legislation and policies. These include strengthening health systems to reduce dependency on prisons as isolation spaces, decentralizing TB treatment to communities, enhancing treatment education, revising the public health laws, and addressing socioeconomic and structural determinants associated with TB incidence and loss to follow-up.

J	McBroom, K				McBroom, Kerry			Litigation as TB Rights Advocacy: A New Delhi Case Study	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article								One thousand people die every day in India as a result of TB, a preventable and treatable disease, even though the Constitution of India, government schemes, and international law guarantee available, accessible, acceptable, quality health care. Failure to address the spread of TB and to provide quality treatment to all affected populations constitutes a public health and human rights emergency that demands action and accountability. As part of a broader strategy, health activists in India employ Public Interest Litigation (PIL) to hold the state accountable for rights violations and to demand new legislation, standards for patient care, accountability for under-spending, improvements in services at individual facilities, and access to government entitlements in marginalized communities. Taking inspiration from right to health PIL cases (PILs), lawyers in a New Delhi-based rights organization used desk research, fact-findings, and the Right To Information Act to build a TB PIL for the Delhi High Court, Sanjai Sharma v. NCT of Delhi and Others (2015). The case argues that inadequate implementation of government TB schemes violates the Constitutional rights to life, health, food, and equality. Although PILs face substantial challenges, this paper concludes that litigation can be a crucial advocacy and accountability tool for people living with TB and their allies.

Biosocial Approaches to the 2013-2016 Ebola Pandemic	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							WEST-AFRICA; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; VIRUS DISEASE; SIERRA-LEONE; HEALTH; EPIDEMICS	Despite more than 25 documented outbreaks of Ebola since 1976, our understanding of the disease is limited, in particular the social, political, ecological, and economic forces that promote (or limit) its spread. In the following study, we seek to provide new ways of understanding the 2013-2016 Ebola pandemic. We use the term, 'pandemic,' instead of 'epidemic,' so as not to elide the global forces that shape every localized outbreak of infectious disease. By situating life histories via a biosocial approach, the forces promoting or retarding Ebola transmission come into sharper focus. We conclude that biomedical and culturalist claims of causality have helped obscure the role of human rights failings (colonial legacies, structural adjustment, exploitative mining companies, enabled civil war, rural poverty, and the near absence of quality health care, to name but a few) in the genesis of the 2013-16 pandemic. From early 20th century smallpox and influenza outbreaks to 21st century Ebola, transnational relations of inequality continue to be embodied as viral disease in West Africa, resulting in the preventable deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

An Independent Review and Accountability Mechanism for the Sustainable Development Goals: The Possibilities of a Framework Convention on Global Health	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							HUMAN-RIGHTS; SYSTEMS; JUSTICE	The Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH), a proposed global treaty to be rooted in the right to health and aimed at health equity, could establish a nuanced, layered, and multi-faceted regime of compliance with, and accountability to, the right to health. In so doing, it would significantly strengthen accountability for the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which it would encompass. Legally binding, the FCGH could facilitate accountability through the courts and catalyze comprehensive domestic accountability regimes, requiring national strategies that include transparency, community and national mechanisms for accountability and participation and an enabling environment for social empowerment. A "Right to Health Capacity Fund" could ensure resources to implement these strategies. Inclusive national processes could establish targets, benchmarks, and indicators consistent with FCGH guidance, with regular reporting to a treaty body, which could also hear individual cases. State reports could be required to include plans to overcome implementation gaps, subjecting poorly complying states to penalties and targeted capacity building measures. Regional special rapporteurs could facilitate compliance through regular country visits, while also responding to serious violations. And reaching beyond government compliance, from capacity building to the courts and contractual obligations, the FCGH could establish nationally enforceable right to health obligations on the private sector.

The objective of this study was to evaluate provisions on access to essential medicines in national constitutions, to identify comprehensive examples of constitutional text on medicines that can be used as a model for other countries, and to evaluate the evolution of constitutional medicines-related rights since 2008. Relevant articles were selected from an inventory of constitutional texts from WHO member states. References to states' legal obligations under international human rights law were evaluated. Twenty-two constitutions worldwide now oblige governments to protect and/or to fulfill accessibility of, availability of, and/or quality of medicines. Since 2008, state responsibilities to fulfill access to essential medicines have expanded in five constitutions, been maintained in four constitutions, and have regressed in one constitution. Government commitments to essential medicines are an important foundation of health system equity and are included increasingly in state constitutions.	[Perehudoff, S.

Human Rights-Based Approaches to Mental Health: A Review of Programs	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Review							PEOPLE; METAANALYSIS; DISABILITY; DISORDERS; JAIL; HIV	The incidence of human rights violations in mental health care across nations has been described as a "global emergency" and an "unresolved global crisis." The relationship between mental health and human rights is complex and bidirectional. Human rights violations can negatively impact mental health. Conversely, respecting human rights can improve mental health. This article reviews cases where an explicitly human rights-based approach was used in mental health care settings. Although the included studies did not exhibit a high level of methodological rigor, the qualitative information obtained was considered useful and informative for future studies. All studies reviewed suggest that human-rights based approaches can lead to clinical improvements at relatively low costs. Human rights-based approaches should be utilized for legal and moral reasons, since human rights are fundamental pillars of justice and civilization. The fact that such approaches can contribute to positive therapeutic outcomes and, potentially, cost savings, is additional reason for their implementation. However, the small sample size and lack of controlled, quantitative measures limit the strength of conclusions drawn from included studies. More objective, high quality research is needed to ascertain the true extent of benefits to service users and providers.

Structural Competency in the US Healthcare Crisis: Putting Social and Policy Interventions Into Clinical Practice	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						Structural competency; Healthcare; United States; Global health; Social medicine; Inequality	DETERMINANTS; BURNOUT; MODEL	This symposium of the Journal of Bioethical Inquiry illustrates structural competency: how clinical practitioners can intervene on social and institutional determinants of health. It will require training clinicians to see and act on structural barriers to health, to adapt imaginative structural approaches from fields outside of medicine, and to collaborate with disciplines and institutions outside of medicine. Case studies of effective work on all of these levels are presented in this volume. The contributors exemplify structural competency from many angles, from the implications of epigenetics for environmental intervention in personalized medicine to the ways clinicians can act on fundamental causes of disease, address abuses of power in clinical training, racially desegregate cities to reduce health disparities, address the systemic causes of torture by police, and implement harm-reduction programs for addiction in the face of punitive drug laws. Together, these contributors demonstrate the unique roles that clinicians can play in breaking systemic barriers to health and the benefit to the U.S. healthcare system of adopting innovations from outside of the United States and outside of clinical medicine.

J	Dauda, B; Denier, Y; Dierickx, K				Dauda, Bege; Denier, Yvonne; Dierickx, Kris			What Do the Various Principles of Justice Mean Within the Concept of Benefit Sharing?	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						Benefit sharing; Justice; Post-trial obligations; Resource-limited countries; Research ethics	GENETIC-RESOURCES; CLINICAL-TRIALS; GLOBAL JUSTICE; FAIR; EXPLOITATION; TIME	The concept of benefit sharing pertains to the act of giving something in return to the participants, communities, and the country that have participated in global health research or bioprospecting activities. One of the key concerns of benefit sharing is the ethical justifications or reasons to support the practice of the concept in global health research and bioprospecting. This article evaluates one of such ethical justifications and its meaning to benefit sharing, namely justice. We conducted a systematic review to map the various principles of justice that are linked to benefit sharing and analysed their meaning to the concept of benefit sharing. Five principles of justice (commutative, distributive, global, procedural, and compensatory) have been shown to be relevant in the nuances of benefit sharing in both global health research and bioprospecting. The review findings indicate that each of these principles of justice provides a different perspective for a different benefit sharing rationale. For example, commutative justice provides a benefit sharing rationale that is focused on fair exchange of benefits between research sponsors and communities. Distributive justice produces a benefit sharing rationale that is focused on improving the health needs of the vulnerable research communities. We have suggested that a good benefit sharing framework particularly in global health research would be more beneficial if it combines all the principles of justice in its formulation. Nonetheless, there is a need for empirical studies to examine the various principles of justice and their nuances in benefit sharing among stakeholders in global health research.

The scope of this study was to analyze the factors associated with pneumonia in Yanomami children hospitalized for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC). Hospital admissions were divided into two groups: i) pneumonia; and ii) other causes, according to the Brazilian ACSC list. Adjusted hospitalization rates were estimated and unconditional logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with pneumonia. Over 90% of the registered cases were considered ACSC. The adjusted rate of ACSC was 18.6/1000. The odds ratio of hospitalization for pneumonia was 2.7 (CI: 1.3-5.4) times higher in children aged between 0.1 and 5.9 months; 1.9 (CI: 1.1-3.3) times higher in children who were hospitalized for 8-14 days; and three (CI: 1.2-7.5) times higher in children with a secondary diagnosis of malnutrition. The excess of avoidable hospitalizations is a clear indication of the low quality of care and limited accessibility to primary health care in indigenous territories, which is contrary to the assistance model proposed by the indigenous healthcare subsystem in Brazil, which should in theory focus on welfare technologies based on primary health care.

Global health burden and needs of transgender populations: a review	LANCET			English	Review							SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIORS; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER; HIV-RELATED RISK; SUBSTANCE USE; MENTAL-HEALTH; TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS; SOCIAL SUPPORT; SAN-FRANCISCO; PUBLIC-HEALTH	Transgender people are a diverse population affected by a range of negative health indicators across high-income, middle-income, and low-income settings. Studies consistently document a high prevalence of adverse health outcomes in this population, including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, mental health distress, and substance use and abuse. However, many other health areas remain understudied, population-based representative samples and longitudinal studies are few, and routine surveillance efforts for transgender population health are scarce. The absence of survey items with which to identify transgender respondents in general surveys often restricts the availability of data with which to estimate the magnitude of health inequities and characterise the population-level health of transgender people globally. Despite the limitations, there are sufficient data highlighting the unique biological, behavioural, social, and structural contextual factors surrounding health risks and resiliencies for transgender people. To mitigate these risks and foster resilience, a comprehensive approach is needed that includes gender affirmation as a public health framework, improved health systems and access to health care informed by high quality data, and effective partnerships with local transgender communities to ensure responsiveness of and cultural specificity in programming. Consideration of transgender health underscores the need to explicitly consider sex and gender pathways in epidemiological research and public health surveillance more broadly.

Physical activity level of postmenopausal women in Nigeria: Association with self-rated health status, overall obesity, and abdominal obesity	WOMEN & HEALTH			English	Article						Physical activity; self-rated health; obesity; postmenopausal women; Nigeria	WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE; PERCEIVED HEALTH; ALL-CAUSE; MORTALITY; INEQUALITIES; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; PREDICTORS; DISEASE; RISK	Regular physical activity (PA) has been shown to have many health benefits in various populations, including postmenopausal women (n=310). Self-rated health has been positively associated with PA. This cross-sectional survey of postmenopausal women in Nigeria was conducted from April to September 2012 to investigate associations among PA level, self-rated health, overall obesity (body mass index [BMI]), and abdominal obesity (waist-height ratio, waist-hip ratio, and waist circumference). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to classify PA. Chi-square and logistic regression were used for analyses with level of significance set at .05. Participants were aged 53.0 +/- 4.2years; moderate to vigorous PA was reported by 188 (60.0%), while 26 (8.4%) self-rated their health as poor/fair, and 242 (78.1%) were either predominantly overweight or obese when classified according to BMI. Participants with fair/poor self-rated health had less odds of involvement in moderate to vigorous PA. Obese postmenopausal women had greater odds of reporting lower PA. PA was positively related to self-rated health, which was negatively associated with overall obesity but not abdominal obesity. Measures to control obesity among postmenopausal women are essential in view of its direct association with poor self-rated health and low PA in this group of women.

Our analysis shows that there are a number of potentially serious health risks, with the following key pathways linking trade to health: access to medicines, reduced regulatory space, investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), and environmental protection and labor rights. We also note that economic gains that could translate into health benefits will likely be inequitably distributed. Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates the need for the public health community to be knowledgeable about trade issues and more engaged in trade negotiations. In the context of the COP21 climate change Agreement, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, this may be an opportune time for TPPA countries to reject it as drafted, and rethink what should be the purpose of such agreements in light of (still) escalating global wealth inequalities and fragile environmental resources-the two most foundational elements to global health equity.

We used the World Health Organization's data about 46 nations in Sub-Saharan Africa to test if under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) and life expectancy (LE) converged or diverged from 1990 to 2011. We explored whether the standard deviation of selected health indicators decreased over time (i.e., sigma convergence), and whether the less developed countries moved toward the average level in the group (i.e., beta convergence). The variation of U5MR between countries became smaller from 1990 to 2001. Yet this sigma convergence trend did not continue after 2002. Life expectancy in Africa from 1990-2011 demonstrated a consistent convergence trend, even after controlling for initial differences of country-level factors. The lack of consistent convergence in U5MR partially resulted from the fact that countries with higher U5MR in 1990 eventually performed better than those countries with lower U5MRs in 1990, constituting a reversal in between-country health inequity. Thus, international aid agencies might consider to reassess the funding priority about which countries to invest in, especially in the field of early childhood health.

Recommendations for Success in the Face of Future Changes in a Global Context	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Mediterranean; drylands; agroecology	AGROSILVOPASTORAL SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; MEDITERRANEAN SHEEP; RURAL-DEVELOPMENT; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; PRODUCTION-MODEL; DAIRY-CATTLE; MANAGEMENT; SPAIN	Dehesa is a remarkable agroforestry system, which needs the implementation of sustainable production systems in order to reduce its deterioration. Moreover, its livestock farms need to adapt to a new global market context. As a response, the organic livestock sector has expanded not only globally but also in the region in search for increased overall sustainability. However, conversions to the organic system have been commonly carried out without analyzing farms' feasibility to do so. This analysis is necessary before implementing any new production system in order to reduce both the diversity of externalities that the variety of contexts leads to and the vulnerability of the DDehesa ecosystem to small management changes. Within this context and in the face of this gap in knowledge, the present paper analyzes the ease of such conversions and the farms' chances of success after conversion in the face of global changes (market and politics). Different aspects ("areas of action") were studied and integrated within the Global Conversion Index (GCI), and the legal requirement for European organic farming, organic principles, future challenges for ruminants' production systems, as well as the lines of action for the post-2013 CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) and their impacts on the beef cattle sector were taken into account. Results revealed that farms must introduce significant changes before initiating the conversion process, since they had very low scores on the GCI (42.74%), especially with regard to health and agro-ecosystem management (principle of Ecology). Regarding rearing and animal welfare (principle of justice/fairness), farms were close to the organic system. From the social point of view, active participation in manufacturing and marketing of products should be increased.

Cancer patients' survival is an extremely important but complex indicator for assessing regional or global inequalities in diagnosis practices and clinical management of cancer patients. The population-based cancer survival comparisons are available through international projects (i.e. CONCORD, EUROCARE, OECD Health Reports) and online systems (SEER, NORDCAN, SLORA). In our research we aimed to show that noticeable differences in cancer patients' survival may not always reflect the real inequalities in cancer care, but can also appear due to variations in the applied methodology for relative survival calculation. Methods. Four different approaches for relative survival calculation (cohort, complete, period and hybrid) have been implemented on the data set of Slovenian breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2009, and the differences in survival estimates have been quantified. The major cancer survival comparison studies have been reviewed according to the selected relative survival calculation approach. Results. The gap between four survival curves widens with time; after ten years of follow up the difference increases to more than 10 percent points between the highest (hybrid) and the lowest (cohort) estimates. In population-based comparison studies, the choice of the calculation approach is not uniformed; we noticed a tendency of simply using the approach which yields numerically better survival estimates. Conclusion. The population-based cancer relative survival, which is continually reported by recognised research groups, could not be compared directly as the methodology is different, and, consequently, final country scores differ. A uniform survival measure would be of great benefit in the cancer care surveillance.

Take for example the aggressive early childhood eye cancer retinoblastoma, where survival reaches 97 % in resource-rich countries, but is as low 30 % in some resource-limited nations, where 92 % of the burden lies. This suggests a need for a multifaceted approach to achieve a tangible and sustainable increase in survival. Methods: We assembled the history the Kenyan National Retinoblastoma Strategy (KNRbS), using information documented in NGO reports, grant applications, news articles, meeting agendas and summaries. We evaluated the KNRbS using the principles found in the guide for transboundary research partnerships developed by the Swiss Commission for Research Partnerships with Developing Countries. Results: A nationally co-ordinated approach drawing input and expertise from multiple disciplines and sectors presented opportunities to optimise cure of children with retinoblastoma. Annual meetings were key to achieving the over 40 major outputs of the group's efforts, related to Awareness, Medical Care, Family Support and Resource Mobilization. Three features were found to be critical to the KNRbS success: multidisciplinarity, consistency and flexibility. Conclusion: The KNRbS has achieved a number of key outputs with limited financial investment. As a partnership, the KNRbS meets most of the criteria identified for success. Challenges remain in securing the long-term sustainability of its achievements. Elements of the Kenyan National Retinoblastoma Strategy may be useful to other developing countries struggling with limited survival of retinoblastoma and other cancers or rare diseases.

Where Caring Is Sharing: Evolving Ethical Considerations in Tuberculosis Prevention Among Healthcare Workers	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						bioethics; community health workers; healthcare worker-patient transmission; prevention; tuberculosis	GLOBAL HEALTH; INFECTIOUS-DISEASE; HUMAN-RIGHTS; BIOETHICS; LESSONS; ADHERENCE; TRUST; INDIA; TB; PERSPECTIVES	In many settings, the dedication of healthcare workers (HCWs) to the treatment of tuberculosis exposes them to serious risks. Current ethical considerations related to tuberculosis prevention in HCWs involve the threat posed by comorbidities, issues of power and space, the implications of intersectoral collaborations, (de) professionalization, just remuneration, the duty to care, and involvement in research. Emerging ethical considerations include mandatory vaccination and the use of geolocalization services and information technologies. The following exploration of these various ethical considerations demonstrates that the language of ethics can fruitfully be deployed to shed new light on policies that have repercussions on the lives of HCWs in underresourced settings. The language of ethics can help responsible parties get a clearer sense of what they owe HCWs, particularly when these individuals are poorly compensated, and it shows that it is essential that HCWs' contribution be acknowledged through a shared commitment to alleviate ethically problematic aspects of the environments within which they provide care. For this reason, there is a strong case for the community of bioethicists to continue to take greater interest both in the micro-level (eg, patient-provider interactions) and macro-level (eg, injustices that occur as a result of the world order) issues that put HCWs working in areas with high tuberculosis prevalence in ethically untenable positions. Ultimately, appropriate responses to the various ethical considerations explored here must vary based on the setting, but, as this article shows, they require thoughtful reflection and courageous action on the part of governments, policy makers, and managers responsible for national responses to the tuberculosis epidemic.

A global call for action to include gender in research impact assessment	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Research impact assessment; Gender; Path dependency; Health research; Science policy; Athena SWAN; Call for action	ACADEMIC MEDICINE; HEALTH RESEARCH; SEX-DIFFERENCES; FEMALE AUTHORSHIP; WOMEN; GAP; PIPELINE; OTOLARYNGOLOGY; ADVANCEMENT; DISPARITIES	Global investment in biomedical research has grown significantly over the last decades, reaching approximately a quarter of a trillion US dollars in 2010. However, not all of this investment is distributed evenly by gender. It follows, arguably, that scarce research resources may not be optimally invested (by either not supporting the best science or by failing to investigate topics that benefit women and men equitably). Women across the world tend to be significantly underrepresented in research both as researchers and research participants, receive less research funding, and appear less frequently than men as authors on research publications. There is also some evidence that women are relatively disadvantaged as the beneficiaries of research, in terms of its health, societal and economic impacts. Historical gender biases may have created a path dependency that means that the research system and the impacts of research are biased towards male researchers and male beneficiaries, making it inherently difficult (though not impossible) to eliminate gender bias. In this commentary, we - a group of scholars and practitioners from Africa, America, Asia and Europe - argue that gender-sensitive research impact assessment could become a force for good in moving science policy and practice towards gender equity. Research impact assessment is the multidisciplinary field of scientific inquiry that examines the research process to maximise scientific, societal and economic returns on investment in research. It encompasses many theoretical and methodological approaches that can be used to investigate gender bias and recommend actions for change to maximise research impact. We offer a set of recommendations to research funders, research institutions and research evaluators who conduct impact assessment on how to include and strengthen analysis of gender equity in research impact assessment and issue a global call for action.

Beyond widespread consensuses about prioritizing malaria prevention, little is known about the prevailing status of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) across different levels of wealth strata. The aim of this study was to evaluate the socioeconomic related dimension of inequalities in malaria prevention interventions. Methods: This study was conducted in July-August 2014 in Adami Tullu district in the South-central Ethiopia, among 6069 households. A cross-sectional data were collected on household characteristics, LLIN ownership and IRS coverage. Principal component analysis technique was used for ranking households based on socioeconomic position. The inequality was measured using concentration indices and concentration curve. Decomposition method was employed in order to quantify the percentage contribution of each socioeconomic related variable on the overall inequality. Results: The proportion of households with at least one LLIN was 11.6 % and IRS coverage was 72.5 %. The Erreygers normalized concentration index was 0.0627 for LLIN and 0.0383 for IRS. Inequality in LLIN ownership was mainly associated with difference in housing situation, household size and access to mass-media and telecommunication service. Conclusion: Coverage of LLIN was low and significant more likely to be owned by the rich households, whereas houses were sprayed equitably. The current mass free distribution of LLINs should be followed by periodic refill based on continuous monitoring data.

Changing lifestyles and aging populations are shifting the global disease burden towards increased noninfectious diseases including chronic conditions, co-morbidities, and injuries which are more complicated and costly to manage. The strain placed on health systems threatens the ability to ensure the health needs of both refugees and host country populations are adequately addressed. In light of the increasing challenges facing host governments and humanitarian actors to meet health needs of Syrian refugees and affected host communities, this study was undertaken to assess utilization of health services among Syrian refugees in non-camp settings. Methods: A survey of Syrian refugees in Jordan was undertaken in June 2014 to characterize health seeking behaviors and issues related to accessing care. A cluster design with probability proportional to size sampling was used to attain a nationally representative sample of 1550 non-camp Syrian refugee households. Differences in household characteristics by geographic region, facility type, and sector utilized were examined using chi-square and t-test methods. Results: Care-seeking was high with 86.1 % of households reporting an adult sought medical care the last time it was needed. Approximately half (51.5 %) of services were sought from public sector facilities, 38.7 % in private facilities, and 9.8 % in charity/NGO facilities. Among adult care seekers, 87.4 % were prescribed medication during the most recent visit, 89.8 % of which obtained the medication. Overall, 51.8 % of households reported out-of-pocket expenditures for the consultation or medications at the most recent visit (mean US$39.9, median US$4.2). Conclusions: Despite high levels of care-seeking, cost was an important barrier to health service access for Syrian refugees in Jordan. The cessation of free access to health care since the time of the survey is likely to have worsened health equity for refugees. Dependence of refugees on the public facilities for primary and specialist care has placed a great burden on the Jordanian health system. To improve accessibility and affordability of health services in an equitable manner for both refugees and Jordanian host communities, strategies that should be considered going forward include shifting resources for non-communicable diseases and other traditional hospital services to the primary level and creating strong health promotion programs emphasizing prevention and self-care are strategies.

It affects the global economy, environment and human health. Many researchers find that carbon dioxide (CO2) has contributed the most to climate change between 1750 and 2005. In this study, the orthogonal GARCH (OGARCH) model is applied to examine the time-varying correlations in European CO2 allowance, crude oil and stock markets in US, Europe and China during the Protocol's first commitment period. The results show that the correlations between EUA carbon spot price and the equity markets are higher and more volatile in US and Europe than in China. Then the optimal portfolios consisting these five time series are selected by Mean-Variance and Mean-CVAR models. It shows that the optimal portfolio selected by MV-OGARCH model has the best performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Epidemiology of Substance Use among Forced Migrants: A Global Systematic Review	PLOS ONE			English	Review							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS; COMPARATIVE RISK-ASSESSMENT; INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; INJECTION-DRUG USERS; LA REFUGEE CAMP; MENTAL-HEALTH; ALCOHOL-USE; UNITED-STATES; CAMBODIAN REFUGEES	Introduction Forced migration is occurring at unprecedented levels. Forced migrants may be at risk for substance use for reasons including coping with traumatic experiences, co-morbid mental health disorders, acculturation challenges and social and economic inequality. This paper aimed to systematically review the literature examining substance use among forced migrants, and identify priority areas for intervention and future research. Methods Seven medical, allied health and social science databases were searched from inception to September 2015 in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to identify original peer-reviewed articles describing any findings relating to alcohol and/or illicit drug use among refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs), asylum seekers, people displaced by disasters and deportees. A descriptive synthesis of evidence from quantitative studies was conducted, focusing primarily on studies which used validated measures of substance use. Synthesis of evidence from qualitative studies focused on identifying prominent themes relating to the contexts and consequences of substance use. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme ( CASP) checklists were used to assess methodological quality of included studies. Results Forty-four quantitative (82% cross-sectional), 16 qualitative and three mixed-methods studies were included. Ten studies were rated as high methodological quality (16%), 39 as moderate quality (62%) and 14 as low quality (22%). The majority of research was conducted among refugees, IDPs and asylum seekers (n = 55, 87%), predominantly in high-income settings. The highest-quality prevalence estimates of hazardous/harmful alcohol use ranged from 17%-36% in camp settings and 4%-7% in community settings. Few studies collected validated measures of illicit drug use. Seven studies compared substance use among forced migrants to other migrant or native-born samples. Among eight studies which conducted multivariable analysis, male sex, trauma exposure and symptoms of mental illness were commonly identified correlates of substance use. Conclusion Our understanding of substance use among forced migrants remains limited, particularly regarding persons displaced due to disasters, development and deportation. Despite a growing body of work among refugee-background populations, few studies include refugees in low and middle-income countries, where over 80% of the global refugee population resides. Findings suggest a need to integrate substance use prevention and treatment into services offered to forced migrants, particularly in camp settings. Efforts to develop and evaluate interventions to reduce substance use and related harms are needed.

Research Priorities for Eight Areas of Adolescent Health in Low- and Middle-Income Countries	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH			English	Article						Adolescent health; Research priorities; Low-income countries; Middle-income countries; World Health Organization; Health systems; Communicable Diseases; Injuries; Violence; Mental health; Noncommunicable diseases; Nutrition; Physical activity; Substance use; Health policy	SETTING RESEARCH PRIORITIES; REDUCE GLOBAL MORTALITY; YOUNG-PEOPLE; RESEARCH INVESTMENTS	Purpose: To conduct an expert-led process for identifying research priorities for eight areas of adolescent health in low-and middle-income countries. Specific adolescent health areas included communicable diseases prevention and management, injuries and violence, mental health, non-communicable diseases management, nutrition, physical activity, substance use, and health policy. Methods: We used a modified version of the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative methodology for reaching consensus on research priorities. In a three phase process, we (1) identified research and program experts with wide-ranging backgrounds and experiences from all geographic regions through systematic searches and key informants; (2) invited these experts to propose research questions related to descriptive epidemiology, interventions (discovery, development/testing, and delivery/implementation), and health policy/systems; and (3) asked the experts to prioritize the research questions based on five criteria: clarity, answerability, importance or impact, implementation, and equity. Results: A total of 142 experts submitted 512 questions which were edited and reduced to 303 for scoring. Overall, the types of the top 10 research questions in each of the eight health areas included descriptive epidemiology (26%), interventions: discovery (11%), development/testing (25%), delivery (33%), and policy, health and social systems (5%). Across health areas, the top questions highlighted integration of health services, vulnerable populations, and different health platforms (such as primary care, schools, families/parents, and interactive media). Conclusions: Priority questions have been identified for research in eight key areas of adolescent health in low-and middle-income countries. These expert-generated questions may be used by donors, program managers, and researchers to prioritize and stimulate research in adolescent health.

J	Hadley, A; Chandra-Mouli, V; Ingham, R				Hadley, Alison; Chandra-Mouli, Venkatraman; Ingham, Roger			Implementing the United Kingdom Government's 10-Year Teenage Pregnancy Strategy for England (1999-2010): Applicable Lessons for Other Countries	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH			English	Article						Teenage pregnancy; Health strategy; England; Sexual health; WHO-ExpandNet framework; Adolescents	NATIONAL PROGRAM; SCALING-UP	Purpose: Teenage pregnancy is an issue of inequality affecting the health, well-being, and life chances of young women, young men, and their children. Consequently, high levels of teenage pregnancy are of concern to an increasing number of developing and developed countries. The UK Labour Government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy for England was one of the very few examples of a nationally led, locally implemented evidence-based strategy, resourced over a long duration, with an associated reduction of 51% in the under-18 conception rate. This article seeks to identify the lessons applicable to other countries. Methods: The article focuses on the prevention program. Drawing on the detailed documentation of the 10-year strategy, it analyzes the factors that helped and hindered implementation against the World Health Organization (WHO) ExpandNet Framework. The Framework strives to improve the planning and management of the process of scaling-up of successful pilot programs with a focus on sexual and reproductive health, making it particularly suited for an analysis of England's teenage pregnancy strategy. Results: The development and implementation of the strategy matches the Framework's key attributes for successful planning and scaling up of sexual and reproductive health programs. It also matched the attributes identified by the Centre for Global Development for scaled up approaches to complex public health issues. Conclusions: Although the strategy was implemented in a high-income country, analysis against the WHO-ExpandNet Framework identifies many lessons which are transferable to low-and medium-income countries seeking to address high teenage pregnancy rates.

Stemming from the " world-wide" incentive and trajectory of the SfAA, and the growing interest in " Applied Anthropology" in Mexico, Mexican and United States institutions joined with the SfAA in a collaborative conference to explore transborder themes affecting individuals and communities, social process, and social justice from the perspectives of transborder anthropologies. Applied vs. Activist anthropology and differences in Mexican and United States anthropology are explored. The conference proposed acknowledging the regional, transnational/transborder-the Southwest North America and Northern Mexico as a geographic and fluid human entity. Gender, indigeneity, education, health and cancer treatment, monetary exchange, violence, and ethnic representation are discussed from both Mexican and United States transborder perspectives. A principal goal is to engage " world anthropologies" in dialogue and collaboration while challenging anthropology's western hegemonic structure.

This exploratory study weighs the nutritional, ecological, and social sustainability contributions of urban agriculture by examining three casesa community garden in the core of New York, a community farm on the edge of London, and an agricultural park on the periphery of San Francisco. Our field analysis of these sites, confirmed by generic estimates, shows very low food outputs relative to the populations of their catchment areas; the great share of urban food will continue to come from multiple foodsheds beyond urban peripheries, often far beyond. Cultivation is a more appropriate designation than agriculture for urban food growing because its sustainability benefits are more social than agronomic or ecological. A major potential benefit lies in enhancing the ecological knowledge of urbanites, including an appreciation of the role that organic food may play in promoting both sustainability and health. This study illustrates how benefits differ according to local conditions, including population density and demographics, operational scale, soil quality, and access to labor and consumers. Recognizing the real benefits, including the promotion of sustainable diets, could enable urban food growing to be developed as a component of regional foodsheds to improve the sustainability and resilience of food supply, and to further the process of public co-production of new forms of urban conviviality and wellbeing.

J	Staudt, K; Dane'el, M; Márquez-Velarde, G				Staudt, Kathleen; Dane'el, Mosi; Marquez-Velarde, Guadalupe			In the shadow of a steel recycling plant in these neoliberal times: health disparities among Hispanics in a border <i>colonia</i>	LOCAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						environmental justice; community-based participatory research; health; disparities; neo-liberalism; border studies		Neo-liberal principles and practices of limited government and market economies prevail in many global regions, especially at borders. This research examines health outcomes in Westway colonia, immediately adjacent to a steel recycling plant owned by the largest steel corporation in the world and in the Texas-Mexico borderlands, posing the questions and testing hypotheses about the incidence of cancer and respiratory and mental illnesses in an economically and politically impoverished region of Mexican Americans and immigrants. Using community-based participatory research and drawing on sources from mixed methods - ethnographic presence and both descriptive statistics and stepwise multiple regression from a random sample of 104 households, with 400 individuals within them - we demonstrate that years living in Westway (statistically significant in multivariate analysis) and closer location (in descriptive analysis) are related to negative health outcomes. Poor mental health is related to respondents' worries about the plant, odours, noise, soot, and continuous emissions on a three-shift basis. The border location offers insights into the impact of a relatively unregulated global economy on local people in a world of considerable migration across borders. Our findings are potentially relevant in the many unequal borderlands worldwide.

Using data from the international pooled SYNERGY case-control study, we studied the association between lung cancer and the level of time-weighted average occupational social prestige as well as its lifetime trajectory. Methods: We included 11,433 male cases and 14,147 male control subjects. Each job was translated into an occupational social prestige score by applying Treiman's Standard International Occupational Prestige Scale (SIOPS). SIOPS scores were categorized as low, medium, and high prestige (reference). We calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for study center, age, smoking, ever employment in a job with known lung carcinogen exposure, and education. Trajectories in SIOPS categories from first to last and first to longest job were defined as consistent, downward, or upward. We conducted several subgroup and sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our results. Results: We observed increased lung cancer risk estimates for men with medium (OR = 1.23; 95 % CI 1.13-1.33) and low occupational prestige (OR = 1.44; 95 % CI 1.32-1.57). Although adjustment for smoking and education reduced the associations between occupational prestige and lung cancer, they did not explain the association entirely. Traditional occupational exposures reduced the associations only slightly. We observed small associations with downward prestige trajectories, with ORs of 1.13, 95 % CI 0.88-1.46 for high to low, and 1.24; 95 % CI 1.08-1.41 for medium to low trajectories. Conclusions: Our results indicate that occupational prestige is independently associated with lung cancer among men.

Understanding the futility of countries' obligations for health rights: realising justice for the global poor	BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article						Health opportunities; Marginalised populations; Right to health; Global distributive justice; Obligations; Low Income Countries; Developing countries		Background: Although health is a right of all individuals without any distinction, the realisation of this right has remained very difficult for the marginalised populations of poor countries. Inequitable distribution of health opportunities globally is a major factor in explaining why this is the case. Whereas the Protection, Promotion and Fulfilment of the health rights of poor country citizens are a joint responsibility of both domestic and external governments, most governments flout their obligations. So far disproportionate effort has been dedicated to reaffirming and interpreting these obligations as opposed to investigating the fundamental question regarding why these obligations have nevertheless remained largely unfulfilled. Further the normative question regarding what ought to be done about the shortcomings of current obligations has been largely ignored. Methods: We conduct a critical content analysis of existing literature on efforts towards the realisation of the health rights of marginalised populations in our attempt to ascertain their capacity to guarantee basic health opportunities to marginalised populations. In our analysis we treat issues of 'health rights' and 'justice in global health' as having unity of purpose - guaranteeing basic health opportunities to the marginalised populations. Results: We identify two sets of reasons for the failure of present obligations for global distributive justice in general: a set of 'superficial reasons' and a set of 'fundamental reasons' which account for the superficial reasons. Discussion: In order to overcome these reasons we propose a strategy which consists in specifying a number of minimum and less-demanding obligations for both external and domestic governments to guarantee to all individuals a certain threshold of health goods and services. We argue that these minimum obligations can be freely accepted and fully complied with or enforced with "a thin system of enforcement" without significant threat to national sovereignty and autonomy. Conclusion: The futility of countries' obligations for the health rights of the global poor as is the case with global distributive injustice is because of lack of political will to specify and enforce such obligations. Minimum obligations should be specified and enforced with a "thin system" which is consistent with principles of national sovereignty and autonomy.

Infant mortality rate (IMR) is an indicator of the health status of a population and of the quality of and access to health care services. In 2000, and within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals, Argentina committed to achieve by 2015 a reduction by two thirds of its 1990 infant mortality rate, and to identify and close inter-jurisdictional gaps. The objective of this article is to describe the trend in infant mortality rate in Argentina and inter-jurisdictional gaps, infant mortality magnitude and causes, in compliance with the Millennium Development Goals. Population and methods. A descriptive study on infant mortality was conducted in Argentina in 1990 and between 2000 and 2013, based on vital statistics data published by the Health Statistics and Information Department of the Ministry of Health of Argentina. Results. The following reductions were confirmed: 57.8% in IMR, 52.6% in neonatal mortality rate and 63.8% in post-neonatal mortality rate. The inter-provincial Gini coefficient for IMR decreased by 27%. The population attributable risk decreased by 16.6% for IMR, 38.8% for neonatal mortality rate and 51.5% for post-neonatal mortality rate in 2013 versus 1990. Conclusion. A significant reduction in infant mortality and its components has been shown, but not enough to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The reduction in IMR gaps reached the set goal; however, inequalities still persist.

Less attention has been devoted to developing expertise about social, economic, and political contexts that produce ill health around the world. The purpose of this article is to offer a transnational feminist critique of the World Development Report: Gender Equality and Development and to illuminate implications such reports may have in the lives of the world's most marginalized women and girls. We examine the political economy idealized in the report, raising questions about the capitalist framework underpinning its agenda. Second, we examine the assumptive language used in the report, suggesting that it discursively constructs a problematic representation of women in low-income countries. We contend that the report perpetuates a hegemonic discourse of patriarchy and inequality for women in the Global South through the use of an uncontested economic framework and universalist reasoning. We conclude the article with discussion about a transformative policy making that could be more inclusive of the wisdoms, values, and everyday experiences of women living in the Global South and about the vital role nurses can play in advancing gender equity through their active collaboration in policy critique and policy formulation.

J	Townsend, B				Townsend, Belinda			International medicines governance 1940s to 1970s: lessons for public health	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Public health; TRIPS; access to medicines; medicines policy	ESSENTIAL DRUGS; ECONOMIC ORDER; POLITICS; OIL	Public health advocates aim to maximise affordable access to good quality essential medicines. This goal often conflicts with the profit-seeking ambitions of the pharmaceutical industry. Since the World Trade Organisation's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement, the extension and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights has become the dominant discourse in global medicines governance. Public health advocates operating within this framework face significant obstacles and challenges. This paper presents an historical perspective to the contemporary debate over medicines and patents by examining the evolution of international medicines governance between the 1940s and 1970s. This research indicates that debates around IP and medicines were more advanced in terms of equity and access in the 1960s and 1970s than they are today. While acknowledging the existence of obstacles and challenges for advocates, the paper argues that alternative frameworks can and should be reasserted in global debates about medicines governance.

Exploring models for the roles of health systems' responsiveness and social determinants in explaining universal health coverage and health outcomes	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						health information; health determinants; health systems; gender	CARE; MORTALITY; COUNTRIES; SERVICES; QUALITY; ACCESS; INCOME	Background: Intersectoral perspectives of health are present in the rhetoric of the sustainable development goals. Yet its descriptions of systematic approaches for an intersectoral monitoring vision, joining determinants of health, and barriers or facilitators to accessing healthcare services are lacking. Objective: To explore models of associations between health outcomes and health service coverage, and health determinants and health systems responsiveness, and thereby to contribute to monitoring, analysis, and assessment approaches informed by an intersectoral vision of health. Design: The study is designed as a series of ecological, cross-country regression analyses, covering between 23 and 57 countries with dependent health variables concentrated on the years 2002-2003. Countries cover a range of development contexts. Health outcome and health service coverage dependent variables were derived from World Health Organization (WHO) information sources. Predictor variables representing determinants are derived from the WHO and World Bank databases; variables used for health systems' responsiveness are derived from the WHO World Health Survey. Responsiveness is a measure of acceptability of health services to the population, complementing financial health protection. Results: Health determinants' indicators - access to improved drinking sources, accountability, and average years of schooling - were statistically significant in particular health outcome regressions. Statistically significant coefficients were more common for mortality rate regressions than for coverage rate regressions. Responsiveness was systematically associated with poorer health and health service coverage. With respect to levels of inequality in health, the indicator of responsiveness problems experienced by the unhealthy poor groups in the population was statistically significant for regressions on measles vaccination inequalities between rich and poor. For the broader determinants, the Gini mattered most for inequalities in child mortality; education mattered more for inequalities in births attended by skilled personnel. Conclusions: This paper adds to the literature on comparative health systems research. National and international health monitoring frameworks need to incorporate indicators on trends in and impacts of other policy sectors on health. This will empower the health sector to carry out public health practices that promote health and health equity.

J	Hunt, MR; Chung, R; Durocher, E; Henrys, JH				Hunt, Matthew R.; Chung, Ryoa; Durocher, Evelyne; Henrys, Jean Hugues			Haitian and international responders' and decision-makers' perspectives regarding disability and the response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						disability; earthquake; Haiti; disaster; vulnerability	REHABILITATION; HEALTH; SERVICES	Background: Following disasters, persons with disabilities (PWD) are especially vulnerable to harm, yet they have commonly been excluded from disaster planning, and their needs have been poorly addressed during disaster relief. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, thousands of individuals experienced acute injuries. Many more individuals with preexisting disabilities experienced heightened vulnerability related to considerations including safety, access to services, and meeting basic needs. Objective: The objective of this research was to better understand the perceptions of responders and decision-makers regarding disability and efforts to address the needs of PWD following the 2010 earthquake. Design: We conducted a qualitative study using interpretive description methodology and semistructured interviews with 14 Haitian and 10 international participants who were involved in the earthquake response. Results: Participants identified PWD as being among the most vulnerable individuals following the earthquake. Though some forms of disability received considerable attention in aid efforts, the needs of other PWD did not. Several factors were identified as challenges for efforts to address the needs of PWD including lack of coordination and information sharing, the involvement of multiple aid sectors, perceptions that this should be the responsibility of specialized organizations, and the need to prioritize limited resources. Participants also reported shifts in local social views related to disability following the earthquake. Conclusions: Addressing the needs of PWD following a disaster is a crucial population health challenge and raises questions related to equity and responsibility for non-governmental organizations, governments, and local communities.

Female disability disadvantage: a global perspective on sex differences in physical function and disability	AGEING & SOCIETY			English	Article						disability; physical functioning; sex differences; international differences	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; PERFORMANCE-MEASURES; LIFE EXPECTANCY; OLDER-ADULTS; HEALTH; MORTALITY; CHINA; AGE; LIMITATIONS; PEOPLE	The objectives were to determine whether women always fare more poorly in terms of physical function and disability across countries that vary widely in terms of their level of development, epidemiologic context and level of gender equality. Sex differences in self-reported and objective measures of disability and physical function were compared among older adults aged 55-85 in the United States of America, Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, China, Indonesia and among the Tsimane of Bolivia using population-based studies collected between 2001 and 2011. Data were analysed using logistic and ordinary least-squares regression. Confidence intervals were examined to see whether the effect of being female differed significantly between countries. In all countries, women had consistently worse physical functioning (both self-reported and objectively measured). Women also tended to report more difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL), although differences were not always significant. In general, sex differences across measures were less pronounced in China. In Korea, women had significantly lower grip strength, but sex differences in ADL difficulty were non-significant or even reversed. Education and marital status helped explain sex differences. Overall, there was striking similarity in the magnitude and direction of sex differences across countries despite considerable differences in context, although modest variations in the effect of sex were observed.

J	Reid-Henry, S				Reid-Henry, Simon			Just Global Health?	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article							LIFE; INSTITUTIONS; INEQUALITY; REGIMES; JUSTICE	Some 40 years ago, the public health philosopher Dan Beauchamp suggested that public health should be a way of doing justice'. The argument put forward in this essay is that global health should be a way of doing global justice, by ameliorating the health inequalities that exclude many millions of people globally from enjoying a healthy life and from the benefits of a fuller inclusion in modern society. The essay develops this argument in three stages. First, it sets out some points of intersection between the politics of (global) health and competing ideas of justice. It offers a very basic typology of global health policy and practice that divides it into market-justice' and social-justice' models, and shows why it is the market-justice model that at present dominates. Second, the essay explores how mainstream market-justice' approaches to global health deal with the problem of health inequality rather weakly, and it is suggested that there are both historical and geographical reasons for this. Third, three social-justice' approaches to global health are explored that better take those historical and geographical conditions into account. In conclusion the essay offers some thoughts on the political uses of theories of justice.
