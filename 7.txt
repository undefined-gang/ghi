J	Eriksson, L				Eriksson, Lise			Outsourcing problems or regulating altruism? Parliamentary debates on domestic and cross-border surrogacy in Finland and Norway	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES			English	Article						Assisted reproductive technology; discourse analysis; equality policies; Finland; Nordic countries; Norway; parliamentary debates; respectability; social problems; surrogacy	COMMERCIAL SURROGACY; EGG DONATION; CONTEXT; BIOPOLITICS; DISCOURSES; GENDER	This article employs the concept of respectability and the discursive representation of gender equality policies to discuss how surrogacy is represented in Nordic parliamentary debates and policy documents. The article's objective is to study how respectability, problems and equality are represented and discursively and rhetorically produced through a comparative study of Finnish and Norwegian political discourses on domestic unpaid surrogacy and cross-border commercial surrogacy. The article uses rhetorical and discursive analysis to analyse the Finnish and Norwegian Parliaments' bills, members' initiatives and proceedings from 2002 to 2018. Finland's policy on surrogacy has evolved from an unregulated and permissive approach towards a more restrictive one, with discourses focusing on medicalisation, equality, altruism and safety concerning domestic surrogacy and problems and risks concerning cross-border surrogacy. Norway's policy on surrogacy has been restrictive consistently, with discourses focusing on surrogacy as a transnational social problem involving exploitation of women and children, and biocentrism. Analysing surrogacy regulation in Nordic welfare states, the author concludes that policies and parliamentary debates in both countries have expressed expectations for inclusive health policies and social security for families. Cross-border surrogacy is characterised as an unwanted consequence of globalisation and marketisation of reproduction. Surrogate mothers' respectability is constructed through rhetoric on differences in terms of nationality, class and binary representations of female caring and instrumentalism.

Understanding what drives these deviations is critical to assessing their ethical consequences. In this paper we describe four conditions that influence decision-making during PHEs, in particular regarding the deployment and conduct of research on experimental or novel biomedical interventions. These four conditions are politicization, urgency, uncertainty, and fear. We argue that taken together these four conditions create pressure to address the most visible targets of immediate crisis events, driving emphasis on research and development of biomedical interventions. However, this emphasis raises ethical concerns regarding the extent to which attention to and investment in the underlying causes of PHEs, particularly impoverished global public health infrastructure, is diminished as a result.

Significant challenges for renewable energy development include uncertainty in assessing social impacts at local scales, participation and social acceptance. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches have been widely used in energy planning to address these challenges. This article reviews how social criteria and participation mechanisms have been incorporated into decision-making processes for renewable energy projects. A total of 184 articles were analyzed. A total of 490 indicators that estimated social impacts were identified and organized into nine criteria: employment, social acceptance, social development, health impact, governance, visual impact, knowledge and awareness, cultural value and social justice. Most research included analytical hierarchy process methodologies, and the articles were geographically concentrated in Asia and Europe. Most articles included a participative component (92.3%), and the majority of them were based on expert consultation (75.4%). Of the articles that exclusively considered experts, almost 40% did not provide any description of the expert elicitation process. Results revealed advances in the use of MCDA but highlighted important challenges-related to improving expert consultation methodologies and broadening the participation of stakeholders-when developing renewable energy initiatives and policies.

Given the success of Community Health Workers (CHWs) in addressing communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases, this scoping review will investigate the roles and impacts of CHWs in breast cancer screening programs. This paper also seeks to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of these programs, with particular attention paid to differences between CHW-led interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs).Methods: A scoping review was performed using six databases with dates ranging from 1978 to 2019. Comprehensive definitions and search terms were established for 'Community Health Workers' and 'breast cancer screening', and studies were extracted using the World Bank definition of LMIC. Screening and data extraction were protocolized using multiple independent reviewers. Chi-square test of independence was used for statistical analysis of the incidence of themes in HICs and LMICs.Results: Of the 1,551 papers screened, 33 were included based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study locations included the United States (n=27), Bangladesh (n=1), Peru (n=1), Malawi (n=2), Rwanda (n=1), and South Africa (n=1). Three primary roles for CHWs in breast cancer screening were identified: education (n=30), direct assistance or performance of breast cancer screening (n=7), and navigational services (n=6). In these roles, CHWs improved rates of breast cancer screening (n=23) and overall community member knowledge (n=21). Two studies performed cost-analyses of CHW-led interventions.Conclusion: This review extends our understanding of CHW effectiveness to breast cancer screening. It illustrates how CHW involvement in screening programs can have a significant impact in LMICs and HICs, and highlights the three CHW roles of education, direct performance of screening, and navigational services that emerge as useful pillars around which governments and NGOs can design effective programs in this area.

During the global health crisis, another global pandemic - xeno or racism - is evoked to corroborate authoritarian populism. We critically analyze the dynamics of populism that shift the focus from 'people' to 'problems' and how it has been intensified during COVID-19. Using narrative justice as a guiding framework, we invite social workers to critically reflect on how this politics has impacted marginalized populations and injuries done to democracy and how social workers can contribute constructing social justice narratives.

Sustainable and personalized nutrition: From earth health to public health	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Review						Saturated fatty acids; Palmitic acid; Palm oil; Personalized nutrition; Metabolic syndrome		Sustainable nutrition, equaling earth health, involves a personalized approach designed in terms of precision and avoidance of still cogent but unjustified dogmas, equaling public health. For instance, current dietary recommendations continue to dwell on the need to limit as much as possible the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA), notwithstanding the mounting evidence that the effects of food on health cannot be predicted from the content of single nutrients without considering the overall macronutrient composition and the role of the food matrix. The traditional recommendation to restrict SFA ignores that their effects on health depend on the interaction between naturally occurring food components and those introduced by food processing. It is warranted to modify the still widely promoted dietary guidelines based upon such single nutrients as SFA and instead personalize dietary habits on the basis of the whole pattern of the food matrix. Accordingly, the double edge of malnutrition, that involves deficiency as well as excess and materializes in many individuals throughout their life course, might be tackled by implementing sustainability, with the additional effect of overcoming global inequalities. Within this context SFA may regain their position of tasty and cheap sources of energy to be adapted to each individual lifestyle.

Based on some recent studies on COVID-19 and the older population, the various cascades toward health inequity have been projected. This study highlights how the COVID-19 is met by health inequity triggers, such as global trade inequality, ageist social regulations, and the existing social inequity. While those triggers are applicable to all the populations, there seems to be specific amplifiers for health inequity among the older populations. In particular, six types of amplifiers have been identified: (1) expansion of riskscape, (2) reduction of social ties, (3) uncertainty of future, (4) losing trust in institutions, (5) coping with new knowledge, and (6) straining on public spending. While the fundamental mitigating responses to health inequity among the older population is tackling existing inequalities, this study may help to shed light on emerging vulnerabilities among the older population to alleviate far-reaching consequences of COVID-19 of the identified inequity amplifiers.

Methods We conducted comprehensive, semistructured interviews with 44 experienced humanitarian aid workers, from the field to headquarters, to evaluate and describe ethical conditions in humanitarian situations. Results 61% were female; average age was 41.8 years; 500 collective years of humanitarian experience (11.8 average) working with diverse major international non-governmental organisations. Important themes included; allocation schemes and integrity of the humanitarian industry, including resource allocation and fair access to and use of services; staff or organisational competencies and aid quality; humanitarian process and unintended consequences; corruption, diversion, complicity and competing interests, and intentions versus outcomes; professionalism and interpersonal and institutional responses; and exposure to extreme inequities and emotional and moral distress. Related concepts included broader industry context and allocations; decision-making, values, roles and sustainability; resource misuse at programme, government and international agency levels; aid effectiveness and utility versus futility, and negative consequences. Multiple contributing, confounding and contradictory factors were identified, including context complexity and multiple decision-making levels; limited input from beneficiaries of aid; different or competing social constructs, values or sociocultural differences; and shortcomings, impracticality, or competing philosophical theories or ethical frameworks. Conclusions Ethical situations are overarching and often present themselves outside the exclusive scope of moral reasoning, philosophical views, professional codes, ethical or legal frameworks, humanitarian principles or social constructivism. This study helped identify a common instinct to uphold fairness and justice as an underlying drive to maintain humanity through proximity, solidarity, transparency and accountability.

Methods We analysed the age-specific, sex-specific, region-specific mortality in Guangdong based on assembled databases. County-level surveillance data were calculated to inform city-level changes. Results The age-standardised mortality of all causes, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), communicable diseases, maternal diseases, neonatal diseases, malnutrition and injury declined progressively. Despite declining mortality of NCDs, the overall burden of disease was dominated by NCDs (ie, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) that still accounted for 86.93% and 88.12% of death in 2005 and 2015, respectively. Considerable variations across geographic regions were observed (lowest in Pearl River Delta and highest in west Guangdong). There was a modest shift to transport injuries at younger ages and unintentional injuries in the elderly. Conclusions We have documented a dramatic change in the overall mortality and age-specific, sex-specific and cause-specific mortality in Guangdong province between 2005 and 2015. The significant burden of NCDs remains a major healthcare issue despite the notable progress in reducing mortality in Guangdong, China. Our findings highlight important unmet needs to refine healthcare services by taking into account the inequity of age, sex and geographic regions. Identification of the 'treatable' risk factors and improved disease surveillance should be continuously improved to minimised the overall and cause-specific mortality.

Background: Indigenous Peoples with experiences of colonisation have poorer health compared to other groups, as health systems have failed to address their needs and preferences. Achieving health equity will require leadership from Indigenous nurses to develop and implement new systems of care delivery. However, little is known about how Indigenous nurses influence health systems as levers for change. Design: A Kaupapa Maori case study design. Methods: Using a Kaupapa Maori case study methodology, coupled with expert Indigenous nursing knowledge, we developed a consensus on key themes. Themes were derived from three questions posed across the four countries. Themes were collated to illustrate how Indigenous nurses have provided nursing leadership to redress colonial injustices, contribute to models of care and enhance the Indigenous workforce. Results: These case studies highlight Indigenous nurses provide strong leadership to influence outcomes for Indigenous Peoples. Five strategies were noted across the four countries: (1) Indigenous nationhood and reconciliation as levers for change, (2) Indigenous nursing leadership, (3) Indigenous workforce strategies, (4) Development of culturally safe practice and Indigenous models of care and (5) Indigenous nurse activism. Conclusions: In light of 2020 declared International Year of the Nurse and Midwife, we assert Indigenous nurses' work must be visible to support development of strategic approaches for improving health outcomes, including resources for workforce expansion and for implementing new care models. Relevance to clinical practice: Curating strategies to promote Indigenous nurse leaders around the world is essential for improving models of healthcare delivery and health outcomes for Indigenous Peoples.

Debts have been relatively understudied as a specific aspect of socioeconomic disadvantage contributing to poor mental health. This study examines the bidirectional association between debts and common mental disorders (CMDs) in the adult population of the Netherlands. Data were obtained from the second ('baseline') and third (3-year follow-up) wave of the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2, a representative cohort of adults. Questions were asked about debts and difficulty in repaying debts in the past 12 months. The answers were combined into one variable: no debts, easy, difficult, and very difficult to pay back debts. Twelve-month CMDs were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0. Increasing levels of difficulty in repaying debts predicted onset of CMD at follow-up in those without 12-month CMD at baseline, and persistence of CMD at follow-up in those with 12-month CMD at baseline. Conversely, CMD was not linked to onset of debts at follow-up in those without 12-month debts at baseline, but was associated with persistence of difficulty to pay back debts at follow-up in those with 12-month debts at baseline. These associations remained significant after adjustment for baseline sociodemographic variables, negative life events and physical health. Health professionals and debt counsellors should pay more attention to patients' debts and clients' mental health respectively in order to refer those with financial or mental health problems to the appropriate services.

Different toxicities of the various chemical compositions in PM2.5 mixtures have been confirmed by epidemiological evidence but have rarely been considered. We proposed an approach to calculate the disease burden of both the chemical components and concentrations of PM2.5 by combining their pre-established dose-response relationships with a multivariate Gaussian model. We estimated that PM2.5 mixtures account for 0.43 (95% CI: 0.29 similar to 0.56) million premature deaths in China in 2013, consistent with estimates based on single-pollutant models in quantifying the total risk but with differing risk distributions. The residential, an elemental carbon-rich emission sector, accounted for approximately a quarter of PM2.5 emissions, but for half of the premature deaths attributable to air pollution, due to the stronger toxicity of carbonaceous particles than other PM2.5 compositions. Conventional risk assessments based on PM2.5 mass assume equality in the toxicity of PM2.5 compositions and may therefore fundamentally underestimate the skewness of the risk distribution and the adverse health effects of particles from the residential emissions. The different toxicities of the of PM2.5 compositions modify the risk estimates and thus should be included in emission reduction plans.

J	Petersen, J; Kandt, J; Longley, PA				Petersen, Jakob; Kandt, Jens; Longley, Paul A.			Ethnic inequalities in hospital admissions in England: an observational study	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health disparities; Ethnicity; Departments; hospital; Electronic health records		Background Ethnic inequalities in health are well-known and partly explained by social determinants such as poorer living and working conditions, health behaviours, discrimination, social exclusion, and healthcare accessibility factors. Inequalities are known both for self-reported health and for diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and non-specific chest pains. Most studies however concern individual diseases or self-reported health and do not provide an overview that can detect gaps in existing knowledge. The aim of this study is thus to identify ethnic inequalities in inpatient hospital admission for all major disease categories in England. Methods Observational study of the inpatient hospital admission database in England enhanced with ethnicity coding of participants' surnames. The primary diagnosis was coded to Level 1 of the Global Burden of Disease groups. For each year, only the first admission for each condition for each participant was included. If a participant was readmitted within two days only the first admission was counted. Admission risk for all major disease groups for each ethnic group relative to the White British group were calculated using logistic regression adjusting for age and area deprivation. Results 40,928,105 admissions were identified between April 2009 and March 2014. Ethnic inequalities were found in cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, chest pain, and diabetes in line with previous studies. Additional inequalities were found in nutritional deficiencies, endocrine disorders, and sense organ diseases. Conclusions The results of this study were consistent with known inequalities, but also found previously unreported disparities in nutritional deficiencies, endocrine disorders, and sense organ diseases. Further studies would be required to map out the relevant care pathways for ethnic minorities and establish whether preventive measures can be strengthened.

Cross-sectional evidence from the observational HUNT Study in Norway	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article						EPIDEMIOLOGY; MODELLING; Health inequalities; ECONOMICS; EMPLOYMENT; INTERNATIONAL HEALTH; SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY; AGEING; BIOSTATISTICS; ELDERLY; Epidemiological methods; DISABILITY; HEALTH SERVICES; MENTAL HEALTH		Background Research suggests that genetic predisposition for common mental disorders may be moderated by the environment. This study examines whether a polygenic risk score (PRS) for depression is moderated by the level of residential area urbanicity using five symptoms of poor mental health as outcomes. Methods The study sample consisted of 41 198 participants from the 2006-2008 wave of the Norwegian HUNT study. We created a weighted PRS for depression based on 99 variants identified in a recent genome -wide association study. Participants were classified into urban or rural place of residence based on wards that correspond to neighbourhoods. Mixed effects logistic regression models with participants nested in 477 neighbourhoods were specified. Results A SD increase in PRS for depression was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the odds of anxiety, comorbid anxiety and depression and mental distress. Associations for depression were weaker and not statistically significant. Compared with urban residents, rural resident had higher odds for reporting poor mental health. Genetic propensity for depression was higher for residents of urban than rural areas, suggesting gene-environment correlation. There was no sign of effect modification between genetic propensity and urbanicity for depression, anxiety, comorbid anxiety and depression, or mental distress. Conclusion The PRS predicted small but significant odds of anxiety, comorbid anxiety and depression and mental distress, but we found no support for a differential effect of genetic propensity in urban and rural neighbourhoods for any of the outcomes.

Prevalence, Comorbidity, and Continuity of Psychiatric Disorders in a 15-Year Longitudinal Study of Youths Involved in the Juvenile Justice System	JAMA PEDIATRICS			English	Article							DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW SCHEDULE; SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT; DSM-IV DISORDERS; AGE-OF-ONSET; BEHAVIORAL HEALTH; MENTAL-DISORDERS; DELINQUENT YOUTH; PERSONALITY-DISORDERS; LIFETIME PREVALENCE; SOCIAL-CONSEQUENCES	IMPORTANCE Previous studies have found that one-half to three-quarters of youths detained in juvenile justice facilities have 1 or more psychiatric disorders. Little is known about the course of their disorders as they age. OBJECTIVE To examine the prevalence, comorbidity, and continuity of 13 psychiatric disorders among youths detained in a juvenile justice facility during the 15 years after detention up to a median age of 31 years, with a focus on sex and racial/ethnic differences. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Northwestern Juvenile Project is a longitudinal cohort study of health needs and outcomes of 1829 randomly selected youths in a temporary juvenile detention center in Cook County, Illinois. Youths aged 10 to 18 years were interviewed in detention from November 20, 1995, through June 14, 1998. Participants were reinterviewed up to 12 times during the 15-year study period through February 2015, for a total of 16 372 interviews. The sample was stratified by sex, race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White), age (10-13 years or 14-18 years), and legal status (processed in juvenile or adult court). Data analysis was conducted from February 2014, when data preparation began, to March 2020. EXPOSURES Detention in a juvenile justice facility. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Psychiatric disorders, assessed by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, version 2.3 at the baseline interviews. Follow-up interviews were conducted using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, version IV; the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, version IV; and theWorld Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (beginning at the 6-year follow-up interview). RESULTS The study included 1829 youths sampled at baseline (1172 males and 657 females; mean [SD] age, 14.9 [1.4] years). Although prevalence and comorbidity of psychiatric disorders decreased as the 1829 participants aged, 52.3% of males and 30.9% of females had at least 1 or more psychiatric disorders 15 years postdetention. Among participants with a disorder at baseline, 64.3% of males and 34.8% of females had a disorder 15 years later. Compared with females, males had 3.37 times the odds of persisting with a psychiatric disorder 15 years after baseline (95% CI, 1.79-6.35). Compared with Black participants and Hispanic participants, non-Hispanic White participants had 1.6 times the odds of behavioral disorders (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.27-1.91 and odds ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.23-2.05, respectively) and greater than 1.3 times the odds of substance use disorders (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.55-2.33 and odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.73, respectively) throughout the follow-up period. Behavioral disorders and substance use disorders were the most prevalent 15 years after detention. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study's findings suggest that persistent psychiatric disorders may complicate the transition from adolescence to adulthood, which is already challenging for youths involved in the juvenile justice system, many of whom are from racial/ethnic minority groups and low-income backgrounds.

This focus on personal responsibility and care-for-self reflects national values and permeates governmental systems and actions, including generalized public health approaches. This issue has been most recently highlighted in the individual and systemic attitudes, beliefs, and responses towards the recent, ongoing crisis following the global surge of COVID-19. In this paper, we provide examples and discuss lessons gleaned from the public health response to this crisis, particularly in the areas and intersections of gender, individualism, and neoliberalism, and the parallels of these issues in sex education. We make an appeal for a collectivist and community-oriented approach to sex education, which would focus not only on prevention and protection, but on inequities, ethics, and care for others.

Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) for Global Health	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article								Purpose As global health education and training shift toward competency-based approaches, academic institutions and organizations must define appropriate assessment strategies for use across health professions. The authors aim to develop entrustable professional activities (EPAs) for global health to apply across academic and workplace settings. Method In 2019, the authors invited 55 global health experts from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and public health to participate in a multiround, online Delphi process; 30 (55%) agreed. Experts averaged 17 years of global health experience, and 12 (40%) were from low- to middle-income countries. In round one, participants listed essential global health activities. The authors used in vivo coding for round one responses to develop initial EPA statements. In subsequent rounds, participants used 5-point Likert-type scales to evaluate EPA statements for importance and relevance to global health across health professions. The authors elevated statements that were rated 4 (important/relevant to most) or 5 (very important/relevant to all) by a minimum of 70% of participants (decided a priori) to the final round, during which participants evaluated whether each statement represented an observable unit of work that could be assigned to a trainee. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data analysis. The authors used participant comments to categorize EPA statements into role domains. Results Twenty-two EPA statements reached at least 70% consensus. The authors categorized these into 5 role domains: partnership developer, capacity builder, data analyzer, equity advocate, and health promoter. Statements in the equity advocate and partnership developer domains had the highest agreement for importance and relevance. Several statements achieved 100% agreement as a unit of work but achieved lower levels of agreement regarding their observability. Conclusions EPAs for global health may be useful to academic institutions and other organizations to guide the assessment of trainees within education and training programs across health professions.

Low- and Middle-Income Country Host Perceptions of Short-Term Experiences in Global Health: A Systematic Review	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Review							INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL ELECTIVES; PRECEPTORS PERCEPTIONS; EDUCATION; PERSPECTIVES; STUDENTS; US; RESIDENTS; PHYSICIANS; LEARNERS; TRAINEES	Purpose Stakeholders have expressed concerns regarding the impact of visiting trainees and physicians from high-income countries (HICs) providing education and/or short-term clinical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review aimed to summarize LMIC host perceptions of visiting trainees and physicians from HICs during short-term experiences in global health (STEGH). Method In September 2018 then again in August 2020, the authors searched 7 databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Global Index Medicus) for peer-reviewed studies that described LMIC host perceptions of STEGH. They extracted information pertaining to study design, participant demographics, participant perceptions, representation of LMICs and HICs, and HIC visitors' roles and used thematic synthesis to code the text, develop descriptive themes, and generate analytical themes. Results Of the 4,020 studies identified, 17 met the inclusion criteria. In total, the studies included 448 participants, of which 395 (88%) represented LMICs. The authors identified and organized 42 codes under 8 descriptive themes. They further organized these descriptive themes into 4 analytical themes related to STEGH: (1) sociocultural and contextual differences, (2) institutional and programmatic components, (3) impact on host institutions and individuals, and (4) visitor characteristics and conduct. Conclusions STEGH can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on LMIC host institutions and individuals. The authors translated these findings into a set of evidence-based best practices for STEGH that provide specific guidance for LMIC and HIC stakeholders. Moving forward, LMIC and HIC institutions must work together to focus on the quality of their relationships and create conditions in which all stakeholders feel empowered to openly communicate to ensure equity and mutual benefit for all parties.

J	Alemi, Q; Stempel, C; Montgomery, S				Alemi, Qais; Stempel, Carl; Montgomery, Susanne			Prevalence and social determinants of tobacco use in Afghanistan	INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						Afghanistan; cigarettes; chew; dual use; media exposure; smokeless tobacco	GLOBAL BURDEN; LOW-INCOME; CONSUMPTION; COUNTRIES; SMOKING; CONTEXT; DISEASE; ADULTS; HEALTH; SOUTH	Background: Limited evidence exists on the prevalence and social determinants of tobacco use in Afghanistan-a fragile post-war context where the tobacco epidemic is on the rise. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and social determinants of tobacco use in Afghan men and women. Methods: Data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey of 10 760 men and 29 461 women were used to generate weighted prevalence estimates for smoking, smokeless tobacco (SLT) products including chew and snuff tobacco, 'any tobacco use' and 'dual tobacco use'. We also modelled associations with tobacco outcomes using binary logistic regressions. Results: We found that for men, smoking cigarettes was the most prevalent form of tobacco use (21.9% [95% confidence interval {CI} 21.2-22.7]). Prevalence rates were far lower for women, with cigarette/pipe smoking at 3.4% (95% CI 3.2-3.7). For both sexes, tobacco use was inversely associated with education and positively associated with agricultural and skilled and unskilled manual labour occupations. Wealth increased the odds of smoking for men but decreased the odds for women. Media exposure had little influence on tobacco use among women; however, the effects were more varied for men. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate social inequalities in tobacco use among Afghan men and women, which calls for stronger tobacco control measures and continued monitoring of this growing epidemic.

Revisiting maternal and child undernutrition in low-income and middle-income countries: variable progress towards an unfinished agenda	LANCET			English	Review							MULTIPLE MICRONUTRIENT SUPPLEMENTATION; ENVIRONMENTAL ENTERIC DYSFUNCTION; UPPER ARM CIRCUMFERENCE; FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; LINEAR GROWTH; NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS; PREGNANT-WOMEN; WATER-QUALITY; DOUBLE BURDEN	13 years after the first Lancet Series on maternal and child undernutrition, we reviewed the progress achieved on the basis of global estimates and new analyses of 50 low-income and middle-income countries with national surveys from around 2000 and 2015. The prevalence of childhood stunting has fallen, and linear growth faltering in early life has become less pronounced over time, markedly in middle-income countries but less so in low-income countries. Stunting and wasting remain public health problems in low-income countries, where 4.7% of children are simultaneously affected by both, a condition associated with a 4.8-times increase in mortality. New evidence shows that stunting and wasting might already be present at birth, and that the incidence of both conditions peaks in the first 6 months of life. Global low birthweight prevalence declined slowly at about 1.0% a year. Knowledge has accumulated on the short-term and long-term consequences of child undernutrition and on its adverse effect on adult human capital. Existing data on vitamin A deficiency among children suggest persisting high prevalence in Africa and south Asia. Zinc deficiency affects close to half of all children in the few countries with data. New evidence on the causes of poor growth points towards subclinical inflammation and environmental enteric dysfunction. Among women of reproductive age, the prevalence of low body-mass index has been reduced by half in middle-income countries, but trends in short stature prevalence are less evident. Both conditions are associated with poor outcomes for mothers and their children, whereas data on gestational weight gain are scarce. Data on the micronutrient status of women are conspicuously scarce, which constitutes an unacceptable data gap. Prevalence of anaemia in women remains high and unabated in many countries. Social inequalities are evident for many forms of undernutrition in women and children, suggesting a key role for poverty and low education, and reinforcing the need for multisectoral actions to accelerate progress. Despite little progress in some areas, maternal and child undernutrition remains a major global health concern, particularly as improvements since 2000 might be offset by the COVID-19 pandemic.

J	Auld, G; Renckens, S				Auld, Graeme; Renckens, Stefan			Private sustainability governance, the Global South and COVID-19: Are changes to audit policies in light of the pandemic exacerbating existing inequalities?	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Private regulation; COVID-19; Crisis; Inequalities; Sustainability; Certification	INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE; VALUE CHAINS; STANDARDS; MARKET; CERTIFICATION	The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global economic relations. Transnational private regulatory programs, such as sustainability certification and eco-labeling schemes that set standards for responsible production practices in global markets, have had to react. Private regulation's market credibility is partially built on audits, which include field visits used to assess whether participating operators conform with a program's standard. But COVID-19-related health and business restrictions have forced adjustments to field-audit policies. Literature on private governance has identified several barriers to participation of Global South operators, including the costs of certification, the availability of qualified auditors, and uncertain socio-economic benefits. Are audit policy changes made because of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating these barriers? We examine this question through a dataset constructed between April and November 2020 that contains information on COVID-19-related audit policy responses of 98 transnational private sustainability regulators. We describe the mixed transparency of these adjustments to date and five ways in which the adjustments create explicit and implicit barriers to operators from Global South countries. The changes create barriers through (1) the conditions set on when and how adjustments to audits are permitted, (2) the limited flexibility of substantive standards, (3) the potential costs of shifting to remote audits, (4) the focus on accommodating existing participants over new applicants, and (5) the potential challenges of accessing auditors to conduct assessments. We conclude with implications for research on private regulation post-COVID-19. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lynch, R				Lynch, Rebecca			Living in the end of days: risk, anxiety, subjectivity and the devil in a Trinidadian village	ANTHROPOLOGY & MEDICINE			English	Article						Evangelical Christianity; the body; Trinidad; Cosmological understandings; risk and anxiety		Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Trinidad, this paper examines how the framing of a particular apocalyptic future provided a moral commentary and model for wellbeing in contemporary everyday life. Changing social, political, and economic circumstances and relations had brought a range of new risks and anxieties into daily life. These more recent problems originating from beyond the village (such as climate change, criminality, inequality, pollution, neglect by the State) could not be resolved through working with obeah spirits as might have been used previously for more local issues, or through the long-established Catholic and Anglican churches. Instead evangelical Christian cosmology and practices gave a means of making sense of such issues and for protecting oneself. The development of a strong individual relationship with God connected individuals to a greater power and a global community, framing such problems not only as the work of the Devil but as evidence of the coming of the End of Days. Political protest or attempts at wider change were futile therefore; individuals should focus on their own practices to develop a strong relationship with God. Health and wellbeing relied on an individualised and deep relationship with the Holy Spirit. This was developed through practices that both drew on, and helped create, a type of neoliberal logic and global subjectivity to understand and live within current times, evangelical Christianity promoting ways of living without anxiety in the present through understandings of an apocalyptic future.

The un-diagnosticmild cases (who show no critical sign and symptoms) play the role as a route that spread the infection unknowingly to healthy individuals. In this paper, we present a fractional order SIR model incorporating individual with mild cases as a compartment to become SMIR model. The existence of the solutions of the model is investigated by solving the fractional Gronwall's inequality using the Laplace transform approach. The equilibrium solutions (DFE & Endemic) are found to be locally asymptotically stable, and subsequently the basic reproduction number is obtained. Also the global stability analysis is carried out by constructing Lyapunov function. Lastly, numerical simulations that support analytic solution follow. It was also shown that when the rate of infection of the mild cases increases, there is equivalent increase in the overall population of infected individuals. Hence to curtail the spread of the disease there is need to take care of the Mild cases as well. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Inequalities in antenatal care coverage and quality: an analysis from 63 low and middle-income countries using the ANCq content-qualified coverage indicator	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Antenatal care; Socioeconomic inequalities; National surveys; Sustainable development goals	HEALTH-CARE; VALIDATION	Background Antenatal care (ANC) is an essential intervention associated with a reduction of maternal and new-born morbidity and mortality. However, evidence suggested substantial inequalities in maternal and child health, mainly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to conduct a global analysis of socioeconomic inequalities in ANC using national surveys from LMICs. Methods ANC was measured using the ANCq, a novel content-qualified ANC coverage indicator, created and validated using national surveys, based upon contact with the health services and content of care received. We performed stratified analysis to explore the socioeconomic inequalities in ANCq. We also estimated the slope index of inequality, which measures the difference in coverage along the wealth spectrum. Results We analyzed 63 national surveys carried out from 2010 to 2017. There were large inequalities between and within countries. Higher ANCq scores were observed among women living in urban areas, with secondary or more level of education, belonging to wealthier families and with higher empowerment in nearly all countries. Countries with higher ANCq mean presented lower inequalities; while countries with average ANCq scores presented wide range of inequality, with some managing to achieve very low inequality. Conclusions Despite all efforts in ANC programs, important inequalities in coverage and quality of ANC services persist. If maternal and child mortality Sustainable Development Goals are to be achieved, those gaps we documented must be bridged.	[Arroyave, Luisa; Victora, Cesar G.; Barros, Aluisio J.

J	Harjoto, MA; Rossi, F				Harjoto, Maretno Agus; Rossi, Fabrizio			Market reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from emerging markets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS			English	Article						COVID-19; Event study; Emerging markets; Small cap; Growth stocks; Sectors; G01; G14; G15	GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS; PERFORMANCE; COLLAPSE; IMPACT; FIRMS; PERSISTENCE; OWNERSHIP; LIQUIDITY; RETURNS; EVENT	Purpose This study examines the market reaction to the World Health Organization (WHO) announcement of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic on the emerging equity markets and compares the reaction with developed markets. This study also compares the market reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic with the market reactions to the 2008 global financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach Using the Morgan Stanley Capital International daily stock indices data and the Carhart and the GARCH(1,1) models for an event study, the authors examine the cumulative abnormal returns during 30 and 10 trading days and the extended 60 days before and after the WHO pandemic announcement. It also compares the market reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic with the reactions to the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy announcement during the 2008 global financial crisis. Findings This study finds that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly greater negative impact to the stock markets in emerging countries than in the developed countries. The negative impact on the emerging markets is more pronounced for firms with small market capitalizations and for growth stocks. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is stronger in the energy and financial sectors in both emerging and developed markets. The positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred in healthcare and telecommunications for the emerging markets and information technology for the developed markets. This study also finds that the equity markets in both emerging and developed countries recovered faster from the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the 2008 global financial crisis. Social implications Investors' desire to diversify their risks across different countries and sectors in the emerging markets could bring superior returns. The diversification strategies bring critical financial supports to forestall the contagion of COVID-19, to protect lives, and to save the emerging economies, especially for those financially constrained countries that are facing twin health and economic shocks by channeling their investments to countries with weak healthcare systems. Originality/value This study extends the literature that examines market reactions to stock market shocks by examining the market reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak on the emerging and developed equity markets across different market capitalizations, valuation and sectors. This study also finds that the markets recovered quicker from the COVID-19 pandemic announcement than during the 2008 global financial crisis.

Moving across scales of analysis, this paper focuses attention on anthropogenic effects at the micro-scale of genomic regulation, neuronal functioning and cellular activity. Building on expanding dialogues at the interface of Anthropocene science, biogeography, microbiology and ecotoxicology, we mobilize epigenetic findings to show increasing evidence of anthropogenic changes in plants, animals and human bodies. Treating human-induced changes at the macro-global and micro-biological scales as part of an intertwined process has implications for how these problems are conceptualised and addressed. While we are sceptics about major geo-bio-social syntheses, we believe that agile social-scientific tools can facilitate interaction across disciplines without denying unevenness, and differences. If rightly contextualized in broad anthropological and social science frameworks, biosocial work on epigenetics offers a compelling avenue to make detectable the 'slow violence' of everyday pollution, racism, inequalities and the disproportionate impact of the Anthropocene on the poor and vulnerable. Consolidating work at the Anthropocene/biology interface has potential to offer a richer and more complete picture of the present crisis at the macro and micro-scale alike.

Early pregnancy overweight/obesity and length of residence among immigrants in Sweden: a pooled analysis of Swedish population registers between 1992 and 2012	PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION			English	Article						Country of origin; Global health; Inequalities; Length of residence; Migration; Overweight; obesity; Pregnancy		Objective: To examine whether the association between women's origin and early pregnancy overweight and obesity (OW/OB) varies by length of residence in Sweden. Design: This cross-sectional observational study used pooled Swedish population register data from 1992 to 2012. Logistic regression models were run to estimate odds ratios (OR) of early pregnancy OW/OB and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI), comparing Swedish-born and immigrants by length-of-residence categories while adjusting for covariates. Setting: Sweden. Participants: In total, 1 771 821 pregnant women, 315 992 of whom were immigrants. Results: With longer residence in Sweden, more immigrant women from various origins exhibited higher odds of experiencing early OW/OB compared with Swedish-born women. Findings specifically showed increased odds of early pregnancy OW/OB with increasing length of residence for women born in Latin America, Europe-27 and Southeast Asia. For example, immigrant women from Latin America residing in Sweden for < 6 years showed similar odds as Swedish-born (OR <= 5 years 0 center dot 92, 95 % CI 0 center dot 87, 0 center dot 98), while their longer residing counterparts showed higher odds than Swedish-born women (OR(6-15 years)1 center dot 21, 95 % CI 1 center dot 14, 1 center dot 28 and OR >= 16 years 1 center dot 68, 95 % CI 1 center dot 59, 1 center dot 78). Mixed results were found for other origins. Conclusions: The current study suggests that host country conditions might play an important role in explaining OW/OB among some groups of immigrant women. Although further studies are needed to disentangle the mechanisms that generate these health inequalities, policy efforts should focus on immigrant reception and early integration to prevent pregnancy-related OW/OB.

Based on national health profile assessments, this study investigated perceived changes of lifestyle habits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associations between perceived lifestyle changes and mental health in Swedish working adults. Among 5599 individuals (50% women, 46.3 years), the majority reported no change (sitting 77%, daily physical activity 71%, exercise 69%, diet 87%, alcohol 90%, and smoking 97%) due to the pandemic. Changes were more pronounced during the first wave (April-June) compared to the second (October-December). Women, individuals <60 years, those with a university degree, white-collar workers, and those with unhealthy lifestyle habits at baseline had higher odds of changing lifestyle habits compared to their counterparts. Negative changes in lifestyle habits and more time in a mentally passive state sitting at home were associated with higher odds of mental ill-health (including health anxiety regarding one's own and relatives' health, generalized anxiety and depression symptoms, and concerns regarding employment and economy). The results emphasize the need to support healthy lifestyle habits to strengthen the resilience in vulnerable groups of individuals to future viral pandemics and prevent health inequalities in society.

Aiding Universal Health Coverage through Humanitarian Outreach Services and Global Health Diplomacy in Resource-Poor Settings	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Global Health Diplomacy; Universal Health Coverage; Pediatric; Surgical procedures; Humanitarian; DALYs; Diplomacy; Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)		According to the Lancet Commission Report on Global Surgery, it was estimated that in 2010 about 16.9 million lives were lost due to the unavailability of Surgical services. It was further calculated that 77.2 million DALYs could simply have been averted by providing basic surgical inspection and triage. Aiding Universal Health Coverage (UHC) through Humanitarian Outreach Services in Resource-Poor Settings is both challenging and difficult to execute. However, to promote and ensure the right to health even by vulnerable groups, the role of global health diplomacy (GHD) and humanitarian diplomacy is pivotal. GHD advances the health of the poor, contribute peacekeeping and promote health security as it is also concerned with the design, and delivery of global health interventions and programs in accordance with diplomatic criteria. The synergistic Humanitarian diplomacy is more focused in persuading decision-makers and opinion leaders to act, at all times, in the interest of vulnerable people and with full respect for our fundamental principles. Since the inclusion of surgical care in the universal basic health care services play a critical role in addressing the rising epidemic of injuries, non-communicable diseases and improving quality of life, there is a great need to address the inequities in pediatric surgical services in resource-poor settings. Hence the successful practice of GHD and humanitarian diplomacy is indispensable for establishing global partnerships, securing funding and strengthening systems to promote cost-effective and essential surgical care to achieve UHC and economic development.

For members of vulnerable migrant groups, systemic inequalities and structural forms of marginalisation and exclusion create health risks, impede access to needed care and interfere with the ability to achieve one's full potential. Migrants often have limited access to healthcare, and they frequently are portrayed as less deserving than others of the resources needed to lead a healthy and flourishing life. Under these circumstances, clinicians, healthcare institutions and global health organisations have a moral and ethical obligation to consider the role they can-and do-play in either advancing or impeding migrants' health and their capacity to flourish. Drawing on case studies from three world regions, we propose concrete steps clinicians and health institutions can take in order to better serve migrant patients. These include recommendations that can help improve understanding of the complex circumstances of migrants' lives, strengthen collaboration between care providers and non-medical partners and transform the social, economic and structural circumstances that impede flourishing and harm health. Developing new strategies to promote the flourishing of precarious migrants can strengthen our collective ability to re-envision and redesign health systems and structures to value the health, dignity and bodily integrity of all patients-especially the most vulnerable-and to promote flourishing for all.

However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions (ABIs) in reducing risky drinking among those in the criminal justice system, including the prison system and, in particular, those on remand. Building on earlier work, A two-arm parallel group individually randomised Prison Pilot study of a male Remand Alcohol Intervention for Self-efficacy Enhancement (APPRAISE) is a pilot study designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an ABI, delivered to male prisoners on remand. The findings of APPRAISE should provide the information required to design a future definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods and analysis APPRAISE will use mixed methods, with two linked phases, across two prisons in the UK, recruiting 180 adult men on remand: 90 from Scotland and 90 from England. Phase I will involve a two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomised pilot study. The pilot evaluation will provide data on the likely impact of A two-arm parallel group individually randomised Prison Pilot study of a male Remand Alcohol Intervention for Self-efficacy Enhancement (APPRAISE), which will be used to inform a future definitive multicentre RCT. Phase II will be a process evaluation assessing how the ABI has been implemented to explore the change mechanisms underpinning the ABI (figure 1) and to assess the context within which the ABI is delivered. Ethics and dissemination The APPRAISE protocol has been approved by the East of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (19/ES/0068), National Offender Management System (2019-240), Health Board Research and Development (2019/0268), Scottish Prison Service research and ethics committee, and by the University of Edinburgh's internal ethics department. The findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journal publications, presentations at local, national and international conferences, infographics and shared with relevant stakeholders through meetings and events.

It is delicate among the developing countries such as Ethiopia. It has major consequences for public health, national security, social development, human rights, economic development, and gender equality. Methods: The analyzed data were obtained from the 2016 EDHS and 1120 samples were considered in this analysis. Both bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression model were used to identify the determinants of early marriage practice. Results: The prevalence of early marriage practice was 48.57% in the study area. The odds of early marriage practice were 2.04(AOR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.88, 2.45) times higher among rural residents compared to urban. The odds of early marriage practice was 0.94(AOR=0.94, 95%CI: 0.57, 1.98) times lower among women who had primary education compared to un- educated women. Those who did not know the legal marital age were 1.61(AOR=1.61, 95%CI: 1.26, 2.07) times more likely to practice early marriage compared to parents who knew the legal marital age. Conclusion: Education level, family monthly income, residence, literacy level and knowledge of legal marital were signifi- cant determinants of early marriage practice.

The statement focused exclusively on the impacts of deportation and forced family separation, documenting the damage done by oppressive U.S. policies and practices. We felt it was imperative to document this harm, and yet were uncomfortable producing a narrow paper that focused solely on harm. There are multiple ways immigrants and their allies resist deportation and other forms of oppression. This resistance is done individually, collectively, and in settings that vary in size and scope, including community-based, faith-based, direct care, and educational settings, as well as entire municipalities and transnational organizing settings. Settings facilitate resistance in many ways, focusing on those who are oppressed, their oppressors, and systems of oppression. In this statement, we describe the unique and overlapping ways in which settings facilitate resistance. We situate this review of the scientific and practice literature in the frameworks of change through social settings, empowering settings, healing justice, and decolonization. We also document recommendations for continued resistance.

J	Schenkman, S; Bousquat, A				Schenkman, Simone; Bousquat, Aylene			From income inequality to social inequity: impact on health levels in an international efficiency comparison panel	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health equity; Efficiency; Effectiveness; Health systems; Capitalism; Income inequality; Life expectancy at birth; Infant mortality; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Panel analysis	POPULATION HEALTH; PUBLIC-HEALTH; LIFE EXPECTANCY; MORTALITY; ORGANIZATION; DETERMINANT; INDICATORS; SYSTEMS; PEOPLE	Background Health equity, although addressed in several publications dealing with health efficiency analysis, is not easily translated into the operationalization of variables, mainly due to technical difficulties. Some studies provide evidence that it does not influence health outcomes; others demonstrate that its effect is an indirect one, with the hegemony of material living conditions over its social connotation. The aim of this article is to evaluate the role of health equity in determining health outcomes, in an international comparative analysis of the effectiveness and efficiency of health systems. Method Fixed Effects Model Panel and Data Envelopment Analysis, a dynamic and network model, in addition to comparative analysis between methods and health impacts. The effect variables considered in the study were life expectancy at birth and infant mortality, in 2010 and 2015, according to the sociocultural regions of the selected countries. Inequity was assessed both economically and socially. The following dimensions were considered: physical and financial resources, health production (access, coverage and prevention) and intersectoral variables: demographic, socioeconomic, governance and health risks. Results Both methods demonstrated that countries with higher inequity levels (regarding income, education and health dimensions), associated or not with poverty, are the least efficient, not reaching the potential for effective health outcomes. The outcome life expectancy at birth exhibited, in the final model, the following variables: social inequity and per capita health expenditure. The outcome infant mortality comprehended the level of education variable, in association with the following healthcare variabels: care seeking due to diarrhea in children under five, births attended by skilled health professionals and the reduction in the incidence of HIV. Conclusion The dissociation between the distribution of health outcomes and the overall level of health of the population characterizes a devastating political choice for society, as it is associated with high levels of segregation, disrespect and violence from within. Countries should prioritize health equity, adding value to its resources, since health inequties affect society altogether, generating mistrust and reduced social cohesion.

This motivated us to develop a random forest-convolutional neural network-local contrast normalization (RF-CNN-LCN) pipeline that detects local PM2.5 hotspots at a 300 m resolution using satellite imagery and meteorological information. The RF-CNN joint model in the pipeline uses three meteorological variables and daily 3 m/pixel resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery to generate daily 300 m ground-level PM2.5 estimates. The downstream LCN processes the estimated PM2.5 maps to reveal local PM2.5 hotspots. The RF-CNN joint model achieved a low normalized root mean square error for PM2.5 of within similar to 31% and normalized mean absolute error of within similar to 19% on the holdout samples in both Delhi and Beijing. The RF-CNN-LCN pipeline reasonably predicts urban PM2.5 local hotspots and coolspots by capturing both the main intra-urban spatial trends in PM2.5 and the local variations in PM2.5 with urban landscape, with local hotspots relating to compact urban spatial structures and coolspots being open areas and green spaces. Based on 20 sampled representative neighborhoods in Delhi, our pipeline revealed an annual average 9.2 +/- 4.0 mu g m(-3) difference in PM2.5 between the local hotspots and coolspots within the same community. In some cases, the differences were much larger; for example, at the Indian Gandhi International Airport, the increase was 20.3 mu g m(-3) from the coolest spot (the residential area immediately outside the airport) to the hottest spot (airport runway). This work provides a possible means of automatically identifying local PM2.5 hotspots at 300 m in heavily polluted megacities and highlights the potential existence of substantial health inequalities in long-term outdoor PM2.5 exposures even within the same local neighborhoods between local hotspots and coolspots.

From the perspective of urban practitioners and other stakeholders, there are two main schools of thought that discuss the roles of informality in the urban development discourse. The first school maintains that informality hinders the urban development process while the other posits that informality could be helpful in the urban sustainability push. In this article, the researchers, focusing on the latter, explores the productive functions of informality in developing sustainable Ghanaian cities. The researchers relied predominantly on secondary data. Using the Boolean search methodology, data were extracted from 85 articles/reports/websites that were obtained from online data and journal publishing repositories such as JSTOR, Scopus, SAGE and Taylor and Francis. The results from the thematic analysis of the data indicate that informality plays a vital role in promoting the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of cities in Ghana. Specifically, the informal economy and informal spaces contribute to the employment of both men and women, household income, tax revenue, waste management, water access, organic farming, health care access, social equity, and innovation. The paper concludes that informality in Ghana could profoundly facilitate the attainment of the sustainable city development objectives. Viewing informality through a productive lens, as we have argued in the paper, calls for a shift from `broad blanket and criminalisation' policies on informality to more inclusive and pro-poor policies. Additionally, understanding the enormous opportunities informality presents to cities in the Global South will lead to increased investment and restructuring to mitigate the barriers its poses to the city development process.

J	Akaeda, N				Akaeda, Naoki			Welfare States and the Health Impact of Social Capital: Focusing on the Crowding-Out and Crowding-In Perspectives	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						Welfare provisions; Social capital; Self-rated health; World Values Survey	SELF-RATED HEALTH; INCOME INEQUALITY; PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH; DARK SIDE; ALL-CAUSE; LEVEL; REDISTRIBUTION; MORTALITY; REGIMES; TRUST	In recent decades, studies in various countries have found that social capital, such as social trust and civic participation, improves health. However, some studies have suggested that the influence of social capital on health may vary depending on welfare provisions because social policies may alter how social capital works. Therefore, this study adopts the crowding-out and the crowding-in perspectives to conduct an international comparative analysis to investigate whether welfare provisions affect the impacts of cognitive and structural social capital on self-rated health. This analysis uses the pooled data from the World Values Survey and cross-classified full models to examine the cross-level interaction effects of public social expenditures (PSE) and two types of social capital, specifically, social trust and civic participation, on self-rated health. The results of this study indicated that the cross-level interaction effects of PSE and the two types of social capital on self-rated health were positive and significant. These results suggested that welfare provisions may enhance the effect of social capital on health.

A bilingual systematic review of South Korean medical tourism: a need to rethink policy and priorities for public health?	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Medical tourism; South Korea; International health policy; Health policy; Globalization and health	INDUSTRY; BENEFITS; SATISFACTION; PROMOTION; SERVICES; COVERAGE; ROLES; BIAS; CARE	Background In 2016, the "Act on Support for Overseas Expansion of Healthcare System and Attraction of International Patients" was enacted by the South Korean government in an attempt to accelerate growth of its medical tourism industry. However, only a few years after its implementation, the benefits are not well understood, nor have the positive or negative impacts of expanding Korea's medical tourism sector been properly evaluated. Objective We aimed to systematically review and summarize existing literature describing South Korea's medical tourism policy and legislative history, while also assessing the impact of this domestic policy approach on the country's public health systems. Methods A bilingual systematic literature review was conducted per PRISMA guidelines for all South Korean medical tourism legislative and policy literature using MeSH terms and other related keywords in two academic databases, PubMed and JSTOR. Published studies were included if they directly addressed South Korean medical tourism policy. To supplement results from the peer-review, the grey literature was also searched using Google search engine for relevant policy documents, information from government websites, and national statistics on medical tourism-related data. Results This review included 14 peer-reviewed journal articles and 9 websites. The majority of literature focused on the legislative history of South Korea's pro-medical tourism policy, economic considerations associated with industry growth, and the specific experiences of medical tourists. There was a lack of studies, analytical or commentary-based, conducting in-depth analysis of the healthcare impact of these policies or comparing benefits and costs compared to other medical tourism destinations. Proponents of medical tourism continue to advocate the government for increased deregulation and investment in the sector. Conclusion This systematic review suggests that policy decisions may prioritize economic growth offered by medical tourism over negative effects on the healthcare workforce, access and equity, and its potential to undermine Universal Health Coverage. South Korea continues to examine ways to further amend the Act and grow this sector, but these actions should be taken with caution by critically examining how other countries have adapted their policymaking based on the real-world costs associated with medical tourism.

Quarantine and other lockdown measures have altered people's daily lives; levels of anxiety, depression, substance use, self-harm and suicide ideation have increased. This commentary assesses how international governments, agencies and organisations are responding to the challenge of the mental health impact of COVID-19 with the aim of informing the ongoing policy and service responses needed in the immediate and longer term. It identifies some of the key themes emerging from the literature, recognises at-risk populations and highlights opportunities for innovation within mental health services, focusing on the published academic literature, international health ministry websites and other relevant international organisations beyond the United Kingdom and Ireland. COVID-19 has challenged, and may have permanently changed, mental health services. It has highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing pressures and inequities. Many decision-makers consider this an opportunity to transform mental health care, and tackling the social determinants of mental health and engaging in prevention will be a necessary part of such transformation. Better data collection, modelling and sharing will enhance policy and service development. The crisis provides opportunities to build on positive innovations: the adaptability and flexibility of community-based care; drawing on lived experience in the design, development and monitoring of services; interagency collaboration; accelerating digital healthcare; and connecting physical and mental health.

J	Jacobs, T; George, A				Jacobs, Tanya; George, Asha			Democratic South Africa at 25-a conceptual framework and narrative review of the social and structural determinants of adolescent health	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Review						Social and structural determinants; Adolescent health; Gender; Intersectionality; South Africa; Micro; Meso; Macro		Twenty-five years into South Africa's constitutional democracy provides an opportunity to take stock of the social and structural determinants of adolescent health. Those born in democratic South Africa, commonly known as the 'Born Frees', are perceived to be able to realise equal rights and opportunities, yet many factors constrain their lives. In bringing together approaches to understanding context in health policy and systems research and the social determinants of health, the paper develops a conceptual framework to guide the narrative review examining the key contextual social and structural determinants of adolescent health in South Africa. Illustrative examples drawing from 65 papers from public health and the social sciences describe and link these determinants across micro, meso and macro levels of society, their global determinants, and their intersections with compounding axes of power and inequality.At a micro level individual adolescent sexual and gender identities are expressed through multiple and evolving forms, while they experience growing autonomy and agency, they do so within a broader context characterised by regressive social norms, gender inequality and other intersecting power relationships. At the meso level, organisational and sectoral determinants shape adolescents health and rights, both in being supportive, but they also replicate the biases and inequalities that characterise South African society. In addition, the macro level national and global determinants, such as the structural colonial and apartheid legacies, shape adolescents' health. Despite constitutional and other legislative rights, these determinants and compound economic, geographic, gender and other intersecting inequalities.A key finding is that current experiences and health of adolescents is shaped by past social and structural determinants and power relations, with apartheid inequalities still echoing in the lives of the adolescents, 25 years into democracy. More research and work is needed to provide insights into determinants of adolescent health beyond just the micro level, but also at the interrelated and dynamic meso and macro levels, nested in global determinants. The findings raise critical considerations and implications for understanding the social and structural determinants in the South African context and what this means for adolescent health in the SDG era.

Implication for accurately targeting vulnerable characteristics	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Cardiovascular disease; Catastrophic health expenditure; Impoverishment by medical expense; Medical insurance; Health policy; China	HEALTH-INSURANCE; FINANCIAL PROTECTION; GLOBAL BURDEN; EXPENDITURE; IMPACT; INEQUALITY; PREVENTION; HOUSEHOLDS; MORTALITY; DEMAND	BackgroundThe vulnerability of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients' health abilities, combined with the severity of the disease and the overlapping risk factors, leads such people to bear the economic burden of the disease due to the medical services. We estimated the economic burden of CVD and identified the weak link in the design of the medical insurance.MethodsData from 5610 middle-aged and elderly with CVD were drawn from the 2015 wave of "China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study" (CHARLS). The recommended method of the "World Health Organization" (WHO) was adopted to calculate "catastrophic health expenditure" (CHE), "impoverishment by medical expenses" (IME), and applied the treatment-effect model to analyze the determinants of CHE.ResultsThe incidence of CHE was 19.9% for the elderly families with CVD members, which was 3.6% higher than for uninsured families (16.3%). Families with CVD combined with >3 other chronic diseases (38.88%) were the riskiest factor for the high CHE in the new rural cooperative medical system (NCMS). Moreover, families with members >75years old (33.33%), having two chronic disease (30.74%), and families having disabled members (33.33%), hospitalization members (32.41%) were identified as the high risky determinants for the high CHE in NCMS.ConclusionsElderly with physical vulnerabilities were more prone to CHE. The medical insurance only reduced barriers to accessing health resources for elderly with CVD; however it lacked the policy inclination for high-utilization populations, and had poorly accurate identification of the vulnerable characteristics of CVD, which in turn affects the economic protection ability of the medical insurance. The dispersion between the multiple medical security schemes leads to the existence of blind spots in the economic risk protection of individuals and families.

Improved housing, health checks, education for their children, and clean water were chosen by the Honduran residents as the projects they thought were most important to improve their health and living conditions. During the short mission trips, the North Americans (NAs) and the villagers worked side-by-side on house building and participated in village life. The Hondurans organized into communities that mutually decided on which families received homes and together worked on each other's homes with the NAs' assistance. Nurse-led health clinics and scholarships for students were provided by the visitors during their time in the villages. Health has improved from better housing and periodic health checks, and most significantly, sustainable community organizing occurred. Public Health Nurses can work towards health equity and population health improvement by basing efforts on what the community partners request and create outcomes through relationships with those who stand to benefit from the improvement.

Global Environmental Engineering for and with Historically Marginalized Communities	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						community-based participatory research; environmental justice; marginalized populations; sustainable development; WaSH		Marginalized communities lack full participation in social, economic, and political life, and they disproportionately bear the burden of environmental and health risks. This special issue of Environmental Engineering Science, the official journal of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP), reports research on the unique environmental challenges faced by historically marginalized communities around the world. The results of community-based participatory research with an Afro-descendant community in Columbia, Native American communities in Alaska, United States, villagers in the Philippines, disadvantaged communities in California, United States, rural communities in Mexico and Costa Rica, homeless encampments in the San Diego River (United States) watershed entrepreneurs in Durban, South Africa, and remote communities in the island nation of Fiji are presented. The research reported in this special issue is transdisciplinary, bringing engineers together with anthropologists, sociologists, economists, and public health experts. In the 13 articles in this special issue, some of the topics covered include inexpensive technologies for water treatment, novel agricultural strategies for reversing biodiversity losses, and strategies for climate change adaptation. In addition, one article covered educational strategies for teaching ethics to prepare students for humanitarian engineering, including topics of poverty, sustainability, social justice, and engineering decisions under uncertainty. Finally, an article presented ways that environmental engineering professors can engage and promote the success of underrepresented minority students and enable faculty engaged in community-based participatory research.

Prioritizing a global research agenda to inform guidance, service delivery, access to and quality of services is essential to improve the survival and health of women, children and adolescents in humanitarian settings. Method A mixed-methods design was adapted from the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) methodology to solicit priority research questions across the sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (SRMNCAH) domains in humanitarian settings. The first step (CHNRI) involved data collection and scoring of perceived priority questions, using a web-based survey over two rounds (first, to generate the questions and secondly, to score them). Over 1000 stakeholders from across the globe were approached; 177 took part in the first survey and 69 took part in the second. These research questions were prioritized by generating a research prioritization score (RPP) across four dimensions: answerability, program feasibility, public health relevance and equity. A Delphi process of 29 experts followed, where the 50 scored and prioritized CHRNI research questions were shortlisted. The top five questions from the CHNRI scored list for each SRMNCAH domain were voted on, rendering a final list per domain. Results A total of 280 questions were generated. Generated questions covered sexual and reproductive health (SRH) (n = 90, 32.1%), maternal health (n = 75, 26.8%), newborn health (n = 42, 15.0%), child health (n = 43, 15.4%), and non-SRH aspects of adolescent health (n = 31, 11.1%). A shortlist of the top ten prioritized questions for each domain were generated on the basis of the computed RPPs. During the Delphi process, the prioritized questions, based on the CHNRI process, were further refined. Five questions from the shortlist of each of the SRMNCAH domain were formulated, resulting in 25 priority questions across SRMNCAH. For example, one of the prioritized SRH shortlisted and prioritized research question included: "What are effective strategies to implement good quality comprehensive contraceptive services (long-acting, short-acting and EC) for women and girls in humanitarian settings?" Conclusion Data needs, effective intervention strategies and approaches, as well as greater efficiency and quality during delivery of care in humanitarian settings were prioritized. The findings from this research provide guidance for researchers, program implementers, as well as donor agencies on SRMNCAH research priorities in humanitarian settings. A global research agenda could save the lives of those who are at greatest risk and vulnerability as well as increase opportunities for translation and innovation for SRMNCAH in humanitarian settings.

Telerheumatology: before, during, and after a global pandemic	CURRENT OPINION IN RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Review						COVID-19; rheumatoid arthritis; telehealth; telerheumatology	RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; CARE	Purpose of review In early 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic shifted most healthcare to remote delivery methods to protect patients, clinicians, and hospital staff. Such remote care delivery methods include the use of telehealth technologies including clinical video telehealth or telephone visits. Prior to this, research on the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of telehealth applied to rheumatology, or telerheumatology, has been limited. Recent findings Telerheumatology visits were found to be noninferior to in-person visits and are often more time and cost effective for patients. Clinicians and patients both noted the lack of a physical exam in telehealth visits and patients missed the opportunity to have lab work done or other diagnostic tests they are afforded with in-person visits. Overall, patients and clinicians had positive attitudes toward the use of telerheumatology and agreed on its usefulness, even beyond the pandemic. Although telerheumatology has the potential to expand the reach of rheumatology practice, some of the most vulnerable patients still lack the most basic resources required for a telehealth visit. As the literature on telerheumatology continues to expand, attention should be paid to health equity, the digital divide, as well as patient preferences in order to foster true shared decision-making over telehealth.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one serious complication. Our aim was to investigate the trends and inequalities of the burden of CKD due to T2DM between 1990 and 2019. Data were obtained from the Global Health Data Exchange database. Age-standardized incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates of CKD were used to estimate the disease burden across the Human Development Index (HDI). Joinpoint regression was performed to assess changes in trend, and the Gini coefficient was used to assess health inequality. A higher incidence was observed in more developed countries (p < 0.001), while higher mortality and DALYs rates were experienced in low and middle HDI countries in 2019 (p < 0.001). The trend of incidence has increased since 1990 (AAPC: 0.9-1.5%), while slight decrease was observed in low HDI countries in mortality (APC: -0.1%) and DALYs (APC: -0.2%). The Gini coefficients of CKD incidence decreased from 0.25 in 2006 to 0.23 in 2019. The socioeconomic development was associated with disease burden. Our findings indicate that awareness of complications should be improved in countries with high incidence, and cost-effective preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic tools are necessary to implement in less developed regions.

A scoping review of pharmacy participation in dental and oral health care	COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						dental care; health promotion; oral health; pharmacist; pharmacy	COMMUNITY PHARMACISTS; SIMULATED PATIENTS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; NEW-ZEALAND; KNOWLEDGE; INEQUALITIES; STUDENTS; AWARENESS; SERVICES; ADVICE	Objectives To explore the scope of dental and oral health care (DOHC) provided by the pharmacy profession and associated outcomes, and attitudes of pharmacy staff and other key stakeholders about pharmacy involvement in this context. Methods A scoping review of full-text articles describing outcomes related to pharmacy staff/student involvement in, knowledge of or attitudes towards DOHC in any setting, and stakeholder perspectives was conducted. Articles written in English were searched for using PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, International Pharmaceutical s, Education Resources Information Centre, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ProQuest for Dissertations and Theses. No date restrictions were used. Key outcomes were mapped: role and practice, knowledge and attitudes, and training and education. Results Seventy studies met the inclusion criteria: 49 were conducted in developed countries; 60 were quantitative in design; and 38 involved community pharmacy settings only. Pharmacists and pharmacy support staff commonly managed DOHC inquiries (n = 13), including the provision of advice and products with or without a further referral. Integrated pharmacist-led services in dental settings (n = 4) showed improved prescribing and quality use of medicines but low community pharmacy referrals were identified in studies involving mystery shoppers with potential oral cancer (n = 7). DOHC promotion programmes delivered by pharmacy staff and collaborations with dentists were limited. There was interest from the pharmacy profession for a role in DOHC; however, knowledge gaps were reported and needs for further training identified. Consumer participant DOHC outcomes were not reported. Conclusions Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were interested in an expanded role in DOHC; however, this scoping review identified lack of knowledge and sub-optimal practice as potential barriers. Research on development, implementation and evaluation of DOHC-related services and practice by pharmacy staff was scarce. Further evidence of consumer-related oral health outcomes and their perceptions of the role of pharmacy is needed.

The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of disability using the GALI and to analyse its determinants in immigrant and Roma populations. Data from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 and the National Health Survey of the Roma Population 2014 were used, including adults aged 50 and above. Prevalence of disability was estimated, and odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression models to assess the association between disability and demographic, socioeconomic, and health variables. The prevalence of disability was estimated at 39.4%, 30.6%, and 58.7% in the native, immigrant, and Roma populations, respectively. Gender was a common determinant for the native and Roma populations. On the other hand, among immigrants, the risk of disability increased over the time residing in Spain. There were significant interactions with age and gender in the native population. Disability has different determinants in the three population groups. Public health measures to protect the Roma population and immigrants' health should be considered.

TRANSPORT REVIEWS			English	Article						cycling; gender; age; distance; inequality; low-and-middle income countries; high-income countries	GENDER-GAP; BICYCLE; WALKING; TRANSPORT; HEALTH; COMMUTER; POLICIES; ENGLAND; CONTEXT; CITIES	International comparisons of cycling behaviour have typically been limited to high-income countries and often limited to the prevalence of cycling, with lack of discussions on demographic and trip characteristics. We used a combination of city, regional, and national travel surveys from 17 countries across the six continents, ranging from years 2009 through 2019. We present a descriptive analysis of cycling behaviour including level of cycling, trip purpose and distance, and user demographics, at the city-level for 35 major cities (>1 million population) and in urbanised areas nationwide for 11 countries. The Netherlands, Japan and Germany are among the highest cycling countries and their cities among the highest cycling cities. In cities and countries with high cycling levels, cycling rates tend to be more equal between work and non-work trips, whereas in geographies with low cycling levels, cycling to work is higher than cycling for other trips. In terms of cycling distance, patterns in high- and low-cycling geographies are more similar. We found a strong positive association between the level of cycling and women's representation among cyclists. In almost all geographies with cycling mode share greater than 7% women made as many cycle trips as men, and sometimes even greater. The share of cycling trips by women is much lower in geographies with cycling mode shares less than 7%. Among the geographies with higher levels of cycling, children (<16 years) are often overrepresented. Older adults (>60 years) remain underrepresented in all geographies but have relatively better representation where levels of cycling are high. In low-cycling settings, females are underrepresented across all the age groups, and more so when older than 16 years. With increasing level of cycling, representation of females improves across all the age groups, and most significantly among children and older adults. Clustering the cities and countries into homogeneous cycling typologies reveals that high cycling levels always coincide with high representation of females and good representations of all age groups. In low-cycling settings, it is the reverse. We recommend that evaluations of cycling policies include usage by gender and age groups as benchmarks in addition to overall use. To achieve representation across different age and gender groups, making neighbourhoods cycling friendly and developing safer routes to school, should be equally high on the agenda as cycling corridors that often cater to commuting traffic.

Harnessing the digital potential of the next generation of health professionals	HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH			English	Article						Capacity building; Digital education; Digital ethics; Digital health; Digital literacy; Healthcare professionals; Health literacy; Public health; Youth		Digital technologies are rapidly being integrated into a wide range of health fields. This new domain, often termed 'digital health', has the potential to significantly improve healthcare outcomes and global health equity more broadly. However, its effective implementation and responsible use are contingent on building a health workforce with a sufficient level of knowledge and skills to effectively navigate the digital transformations in health. More specifically, the next generation of health professionals-namely youth-must be adequately prepared to maximise the potential of these digital transformations. In this commentary, we highlight three priority areas which should be prioritised in digital education to realise the benefits of digital health: capacity building, opportunities for youth, and an ethics-driven approach. Firstly, capacity building requires educational frameworks and curricula to not only be updated, but to also place an emphasis on interdisciplinary learning. Secondly, opportunities are important for youth to meaningfully participate in decision-making processes and gain invaluable practical experiences. Thirdly, training in digital ethics and the responsible use of data as a standard component of education will help to safeguard against potential future inequities resulting from the implementation and use of digital health technologies.

Putting the "Love of Humanity" Back in Corporate Philanthropy: The Case of Health Grants by Corporate Foundations	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						Corporate philanthropy; Health inequality; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Homophily; Health grants	SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; US COUNTIES; PERFORMANCE; MORTALITY; EQUITY; STAKEHOLDER; INEQUALITY; PROXIMITY; NETWORKS	With the growing call for private sector actors to address global challenges, it is necessary to first assess whether regions with the greatest needs are accessing corporate philanthropy. In this paper, we ask whether corporate philanthropy is reaching those with the greatest health-care needs. Drawing on economic geography and corporate homophily, we argue that corporate philanthropy tends to exacerbate health inequality as grants are destined for counties with fewer health problems. We test and find support for this hypothesis using data on health grants made by US corporate foundations and county-level health data. Our results that corporate health grants are less likely to go to counties which have a lower proportion of medical service providers and insured citizens suggest that corporate foundations are unwittingly complicit in worsening the resource gap between small, poor, rural counties and large, wealthy, urban counties. From an ethical perspective, we provide some guidance as to how this may be corrected.

Mental health issues and needs of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, refugee claimants and refugees in Toronto, Canada	PSYCHOLOGY & SEXUALITY			English	Article						Asylum seekers; Canada; LGTBQ+ people; mental health; refugee claimants; refugees; Toronto	PSYCHOLOGY	LGBTQ+ people experience mental health challenges due to their minoritized status, systemic inequities and structural disparities. For LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, refugee claimants and refugees the impact on their mental health can be compounding. This study, which featured a series of focus groups with LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, refugee claimants and refugees in Toronto, Canada, was part of a larger international study 'Envisioning Global LGBT Human Rights' that looked at colonising effects on LGBTQ people in the Commonwealth. The migration process, - often forced due to persecution in their country of origin based on sexual orientation or gender identity and expression - produced traumatic experiences involving life-changing decisions, accessing information and resources, cultural shifts, conceptualisation of identities, and navigating the refugees claims process. The specialised experiences of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, refugee claimants and refugees can have a deleterious effect on their mental health that a critical psychology perspective can address clinically by recognising the particularised needs of this population and systemically by addressing the structural inequities.

The gendered pandemic: The implications of COVID-19 for work and family	SOCIOLOGY COMPASS			English	Article						COVID-19; disaster; family; gender; inequality; pandemic; work	EMPLOYMENT; FATHERS; MOTHERS; IMPACT	The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly all the aspects of society since it's onset in early 2020. In addition to infecting and taking the lives of millions of global citizens, the pandemic has fundamentally changed family and work patterns. The pandemic and associated mitigation measures have increased the unemployment rates, amplified health risks for essential workers required to work on-site, and led to unprecedented rates of telecommuting. Additionally, due to school/daycare closures and social distancing, many parents have lost access to institutional and informal childcare support during the COVID-19 crisis. Such losses in childcare support have significantly impacted the paid and unpaid labor of parents, particularly of mothers. In this article, we synthesize recent research on pandemic-related changes to work and family in the United States. Applying an intersectionality lens, we discuss the gendered implications of these changes. Because gender inequality in family and work are connected, COVID-19 has, in many cases, deepened the pre-existing gender inequalities in both realms.

Financial Market Risks during the COVID-19 Pandemic	EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE			English	Article						Beta; systematic risk; equity indices; Islamic finance; COVID-19		This article examines the nature of time-varying systematic risk for both Islamic and non-Islamic sectoral indices during COVID-19. The novelty lies in the analysis of behavioral changes in beta as the global health crisis moved from an epidemic to a pandemic. Using daily stock market return data on 10 different industry sectors, we show that both Islamic and conventional indices depict a similar pattern, but Islamic equities exhibit lower risk, indicating a subdued reaction to market movements. However, as the COVID-19 evolves from an epidemic to a pandemic the trend changes, with Consumer Services, Financials, Healthcare, and Oil & Gas sector betas depicting an overreaction in Islamic equities. These results remain robust to multiple additional tests. On this basis, we argue that a lower systematic risk of Islamic equities can offer portfolio diversification opportunities.

However, the links between the built environment and subjective well-being are not sufficiently understood. This paper reviews the evidence on the range of pathways linking the built environment to subjective well-being. Seven potential pathways are identified and reviewed: (1) travel, (2) leisure, (3) work, (4) social relationships, (5) residential well-being, (6) emotional responses, and (7) health. Based on this knowledge, the paper presents an overview of strategies for improving subjective well-being through urban planning. Among others, proposed strategies are to: enhance conditions for active travel; improve public transport while restricting cars; provide easy access to facilities and services; develop or steer technology and emerging mobility options to improve inclusiveness and quality of life for different groups; integrate various forms of urban nature as much as possible; provide accessible, inclusive public spaces and communal spaces; maintain upkeep and order in urban space, vegetation, and transport systems; implement noise reduction strategies; develop aesthetically pleasing buildings and public spaces based on residents' needs and preferences; and reduce socio-spatial inequalities while providing support for housing and transport for vulnerable groups.

Methods Our sample included 18727 adolescents aged 11, 13 or 15 years old (y/o). The relationship between toothbrushing frequency (TBF) and eating habits, health and socio-economic status markers, family status, school perception, substance use, sedentary lifestyle and physical activity, together with their evolution over the 3 studies, were investigated using multivariate logistic regression. Results The proportion of adolescents brushing twice a day increased from 68.8% in 2006 to 70.8% in 2010 and 78.8% in 2014 (p<0.0001). Notable associated factors (p<0.0001) were: being a girl (adjusted Odds Ratio = 1.5) and, even more, an older girl (aOR 1.5 for 15 y/o vs 11 y/o girls), having breakfast (aOR 1.4) and eating fruits daily (aOR 1.6), excellent perceived health (aOR 1.2), obesity or overweight (aOR 0.6), being bullied at school (aOR 0.8), and perceived family wealth (aOR 1.4 for High vs Low). No impact from any associated factor changed over the 3 studies. Conclusions Among French adolescents, TBF improved from 2006 to 2014. TBF was significantly associated with other health behaviors. These associations stayed similar in 2006, 2010 and 2010. This increase in TBF may be linked with global prevention programs developed during this time period. These programs should be maintained and associated with more specific ones targeting and adapted to disadvantaged populations, in order to reduce inequalities in oral hygiene and oral health.

J	Harrison, S; Macmillan, A; Rudd, C				Harrison, Sarah; Macmillan, Alexandra; Rudd, Chris			Framing climate change and health: New Zealand's online news media	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						climate; public health; advocacy; media	TELEVISION-NEWS; POLITICS; COVERAGE; SCIENCE; COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; ISSUE	Climate change is a major threat to public health worldwide. Conversely, well-designed action to mitigate climate change offers numerous opportunities to improve health and equity. Despite this, comprehensive climate action has not been forthcoming within New Zealand. The media plays an important role in shaping public opinion and support for policy change. Previous literature has suggested that certain types of framing may be more effective than others at encouraging support for climate action and policy. This includes positive, personally relevant framing, as well as key journalistic tools which appear counter-intuitive, such as an increase in human interest stories and 'sensationalist' framing. We undertook a qualitative thematic analysis of climate change and health media coverage in two online New Zealand news outlets to understand how the issue was framed, and how it may be framed more effectively to encourage climate action. We compared the framing used by journalists in mainstream media outlet the New Zealand Herald Online (NZHO) with that of contributors to independent news repository site Scoop. Content in both outlets emphasized the threat unchecked climate change poses to health, which overshadowed the positive health opportunities of climate action. The NZHO was more prone to negative framing, and more likely to favour stories which could be sensationalized and were international in scope. We considered the possible effectiveness of the framing we found for attracting greater media attention and encouraging support for climate action and policy.

The Mediator Effect of Interregional Labor Flow	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; TRADE; COMPETITIVENESS; LEVEL	Global income inequality is widening and carbon emissions remain high. So, reducing carbon emissions and income gap are urgent challenges. The purpose of this paper is to analysis how carbon emission efficiency influences the region income inequality. The improvement of carbon emission reduction efficiency has widened the regional income inequality with the flow of high-tech labor as an intermediary variable in China. Methods used in this article are mediating effect model and DEA method. This paper constructs a disposable income model of income and health costs, where health costs are a function of carbon reduction. If income is fixed, then the expectations of disposable income will change as the level of carbon emission reduction changes. This study finds that the disposable income expectations of high-income areas increases, while the disposable income expectations of lower-income areas decrease with the improvement of carbon emission reduction efficiency. High-income regions attract high-income labor from other regions, resulting in the widening of regional income inequality under the constraint of high cost of living. This result is verified by the data of China from 2007 to 2017. The regression model with Geordie coefficient as the dependent variable, carbon emission reduction efficiency as the core independent variable, gravitation of high-tech talent as the mediator variable, and urbanization rate, educational level, social security coverage, and highway and railway traffic mileage as control variables not only verifies the above results but also finds that high-tech talents' flow is not the only intermediary between carbon emission reduction efficiency and regional income inequality. This paper finds that when the carbon emission reduction efficiency increases by one unit, the income inequality gap of 25 provinces increases by 0.0202 units, provinces with high carbon emission reduction efficiency increases by 0.107 units, and provinces with medium carbon emission reduction efficiency increases by 0.026 units. However, the income inequality gap of provinces with low carbon emission reduction efficiency decreases by 0.0390 units. The carbon emission reduction efficiency of the high and medium carbon emission reduction efficiency groups is proportional to the income inequality, while the low carbon emission reduction efficiency group is the opposite, when the carbon emission reduction efficiency is grouped into high efficiency group, medium efficiency group, and low efficiency group. The reason for this result is that the high carbon emission reduction efficiency of the former attracts high-income high-tech talent, while the latter's narrowing regional income inequality benefits from the reduction costs of health and the government's ecological compensation. The effective measures to narrow the income inequality are to implement carbon emission reduction policy, industrial policy, education investment policy, and public service policy, according to the above findings.

J	Louart, S; Bonnet, E; Ridde, V				Louart, Sarah; Bonnet, Emmanuel; Ridde, Valery			Is patient navigation a solution to the problem of "leaving no one behind"? A scoping review of evidence from low-income countries	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Review						Patient navigation; indigents; access to health care; scoping review	COMMUNITY-HEALTH WORKERS; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; WOMENS GROUPS; OPEN-LABEL; PERINATAL-MORTALITY; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; CLINICAL-OUTCOMES; NEWBORN HEALTH; PEER SUPPORT	Patient navigation interventions, which are designed to enable patients excluded from health systems to overcome the barriers they face in accessing care, have multiplied in high-income countries since the 1990s. However, in low-income countries (LICs), indigents are generally excluded from health policies despite the international paradigm of universal health coverage (UHC). Fee exemption interventions have demonstrated their limits and it is now necessary to act on other dimensions of access to healthcare. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the interventions implemented in LICs to support the indigents throughout their care pathway. The aim of this paper is to synthesize what is known about patient navigation interventions to facilitate access to modern health systems for vulnerable populations in LICs. We therefore conducted a scoping review to identify all patient navigation interventions in LICs. We found 60 articles employing a total of 48 interventions. Most of these interventions targeted traditional beneficiaries such as people living with HIV, pregnant women and children. We utilized the framework developed by Levesque et al. (Patient-centred access to health care: conceptualising access at the interface of health systems and populations. Int J Equity Health 2013;12:18) to analyse the interventions. All acted on the ability to perceive, 34 interventions on the ability to reach, 30 on the ability to engage, 8 on the ability to pay and 6 on the ability to seek. Evaluations of these interventions were encouraging, as they often appeared to lead to improved health indicators and service utilization rates and reduced attrition in care. However, no intervention specifically targeted indigents and very few evaluations differentiated the impact of the intervention on the poorest populations. It is therefore necessary to test navigation interventions to enable those who are worst off to overcome the barriers they face. It is a major ethical issue that health policies leave no one behind and that UHC does not benefit everyone except the poorest.

Here, peat drained for agricultural expansion increases the risk of large-scale uncontrolled fires. Several solutions to this complex environmental, humanitarian and economic crisis have been proposed, such as forest protection measures and agricultural support. However, numerous programmes have largely failed. Bundles of interventions are proposed as promising strategies in integrated approaches, but what policy interventions to combine and how to align such bundles to local conditions remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of two types of interventions and of their combinations, in reducing fire occurrence through driving behavioural change: incentives (i.e. rewards that are conditional on environmental performance), and deterrents (e.g. sanction, soliciting concerns for health). We look at the impact of these interventions in 10 villages with varying landscape and fire-risk contexts in Sumatra, Indonesia. A private-led implementation of a standardised programme allows us to study outcome variability through a natural experiment design. We conduct a systematic cross-case comparison to identify the most effective combinations of interventions, using two-step qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and geospatial and socio-economic survey data (n = 303). We analysed the combined influence of proximate conditions (interventions, e.g. fear of sanction) and remote ones (context; e.g. extent of peat soil) on fire outcomes. We show how, depending on the level of risk in the pre-existing context, certain bundles of interventions are needed to succeed. We found that, despite the programme being framed as rewards-based, people were not responding to the reward alone. Rather sanctions and soliciting concern appeared central to fire prevention, raising important equity implications. Our results contribute to the emerging global interest in peat fire mitigation, and the rapidly developing literature on PES performance.

The concept of sustainability is central to these efforts, as climate adaptation discussions are often framed within the context of economic resilience, environmental protection, and social vulnerability. For urban centers, the climate change issue presents unique challenges for each of these dimensions; however, its potential impacts on marginalized populations are extensive. This study draws from the 'just sustainabilities' (Agyeman, Bullard, and Evans 2003) framework and applies the concepts of distributive and procedural justice to examine whether, and to what extent, U.S. cities prioritize social equity concerns in adaptation plans. We perform a qualitative analysis of climate adaptation plans prepared by 22 of the 100 largest U.S. cities. We find that social equity concerns are particularly prominent in local-level climate adaptation discussions relative to those concerning environmental quality and economic development.

Rwanda has made notable efforts to fight the pandemic. However, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country's economy are numerous and the refugees residing in Rwanda are not spared these effects. As of December 2020, 164,000 people were granted refugee status in Rwanda according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The majority were from neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes regions, including DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) and Burundi. The impact the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy has led to a decline in donations to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which in turn has significantly reduced the food rations of refugees. Such paucity will no doubt cause unprecedented impacts on the people residing in refugee camps, who completely depend on humanitarian aid to meet their basic food requirements. This lack of access to adequate and affordable food will expose refugees to extreme hunger and starvation, putting their lives in danger by triggering forced returns, infections, social conflicts and thus higher morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, such stressful environments would no doubt put the mental health of these already vulnerable communities at risk. It is unsurprising that refugees are more likely to experience poor mental health compared to local population, including higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This is an issue as they are also less likely to receive support than the general population. Refugees in Rwanda are under the responsibility of UNHCR and WFP, who should ensure adequate food assistance is provided to refugees and therefore ameliorate the risks to health that result from food shortages, safeguarding these vulnerable communities.

Our objectives are: (1) define trends of collaborative HNC publications among LMICs and the United States and (2) assess the global distribution of these publications by region. Methods A Scopus search identified all HNC research publications during 2009 to 2018. These were then categorized by type (basic vs. clinical) and by global regions. Results Five thousand one hundred and seventy collaborative publications were identified, of which 41% were basic science and 59% clinical. The highest rate of collaborative publications for both basic science and clinical papers was seen in the East Asia/Pacific region. Conclusions The number of collaborative research publications per year in HNC is increasing across the globe, at varying rates in different global regions.

Global dietary convergence from 1970 to 2010 altered inequality in agriculture, nutrition and health	NATURE FOOD			English	Article							INTENSIFICATION; COUNTRIES	This study draws on publicly available data to examine food-system inequality across countries. Changes in natural resource inputs, food/nutrient outputs and nutrition/health indicators reveal that inequality generally declined, but did so very differently across variables. Humans globally have similar nutritional needs but face large differences in natural resource endowments and local food production. This study quantifies food-system inequality across countries on the basis of natural resource inputs, food/nutrient outputs and nutrition/health outcomes, from 1970 to 2010. Animal source foods and overweight/obesity show rapid convergence while availability of selected micronutrients show slower convergence. However, all variables are more equally distributed than national income per capita, the Gini coefficient of which declined from 0.71 to 0.65. Inequalities in total and animal-source dietary energy declined from 0.16 to 0.10 and 0.55 to 0.36, respectively. There was convergence in overweight/obesity prevalence from 0.39 to 0.27, while undernutrition and stunting became increasingly concentrated in a few high-burden countries. Characterizing cross-country inequalities in agricultural resources, foods, nutrients and health can help identify critical opportunities for agriculture and food policies, as well as prioritize research objectives and funding allocation for the coming decade.

Equity concerns in urban public schools such as decreased enrollment among largely Black and Latinx prekindergarten and special needs public school students already disproportionately impacted by the pandemic itself have added urgency to Chicago Department of Public Health's analysis of COVID-19 transmission. Close tracking within a large school system revealed a lower attack rate for students and staff participating in in-person learning than for the community overall. By combining local data from a large urban private school system with national and international data on maintaining in-person learning during COVID-19 surges, Chicago believes in-person public education poses a low risk of transmission when the operational burden imposed by the second wave has subsided.

A range of ethics and regulatory issues need to be addressed through comprehensive policy frameworks that integrate with local environments. While important efforts have been made to enhance understanding and awareness of ethical dimensions of GGR in Africa, including through the H3Africa initiative, there remains a need for in-depth policy review, at a country-level, to inform and stimulate local policy development and revision on the continent. Methods To identify and characterize existing ethics-related guidelines and laws applicable to GGR across much of Africa, we conducted a scoping review of English language policy documents identified through databases, repositories, and web searches. Thirty-six documents were included and coded using a framework that contained a range of themes across five analytical categories: (1) respect, (2) beneficence, (3) justice, (4) independent oversight, and (5) bans and prohibitions. Data analysis software (NVivo 12) was used to organize, code, and tabulate information according to document characteristics and topics. Illustrative examples of policy requirements were selected for inclusion. Results Documents that met inclusion criteria spanned 20 years; published between 1996 and 2018, with the majority (58%) published after 2009. About two-thirds were denoted as "guidelines," and slightly more than half were non-exclusive to GGR. Very few (six) country-level documents identified were specific to GGR. Requirements related to the principle of "respect" appeared most often across all documents, relative to other principles and processes. The most commonly stated ban was on reproductive cloning. Other prohibitions applied to germline editing, undue inducements in research, sample use for commercial purposes, employee mandatory DNA testing, fetal sex selection, stem cell use, eugenics, and research without public health benefits. Conclusions Enforceable policies that are indispensable to the ethical conduct and review of GGR are either deficient or missing in many African countries. Existing international, GGR-specific ethics guidelines can be used to inform GGR policy development at a country-level, in conjunction with insight from country specific ethics committees and other local stakeholders.

J	Munung, NS; de Vries, J; Pratt, B				Munung, Nchangwi Syntia; de Vries, Jantina; Pratt, Bridget			Genomics governance: advancing justice, fairness and equity through the lens of the African communitarian ethic of Ubuntu	MEDICINE HEALTH CARE AND PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Ubuntu; Genomics; Governance; Equity; Justice; Africa; Solidarity; Reciprocity	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; INFORMED-CONSENT; BROAD CONSENT; HEALTH; PERSPECTIVES; SOLIDARITY; CHALLENGES; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; EXPORT	There is growing interest for a communitarian approach to the governance of genomics, and for such governance to be grounded in principles of justice, equity and solidarity. However, there is a near absence of conceptual studies on how communitarian-based principles, or values, may inform, support or guide the governance of genomics research. Given that solidarity is a key principle in Ubuntu, an African communitarian ethic and theory of justice, there is emerging interest about the extent to which Ubuntu could offer guidance for the governance of genomics research in Africa. To this effect, we undertook a conceptual analysis of Ubuntu with the goal of identifying principles that could inform equity-oriented governance of genomics research. Solidarity, reciprocity, open sharing, accountability, mutual trust, deliberative decision-making and inclusivity were identified as core principles that speak directly to the different macro-level ethical issues in genomics research in Africa such as: the exploitation of study populations and African researchers, equitable access and use of genomics data, benefit sharing, the possibility of genomics to widen global health inequities and the fair distribution of resources such as intellectual property and patents. We use the identified the principles to develop ethical guidance for genomics governance in Africa.

Social gradient in health-related quality of life among urban middle-age residents in Limassol, Cyprus: research article	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Social inequalities; Quality of health; SF 36; Social status; Gender		BackgroundSocial inequalities in health threaten social cohesion and their investigation is an important research field. Monitoring the health of the population is necessary to identify health needs, design programs focused in people's needs and to evaluate the effectiveness of health policies.MethodsA cross-sectional survey using primary data was applied. The study investigated the size and the extent of social inequalities in quality of life and health behaviours in Limassol, Cyprus. Data collection was done door-to-door in the form of survey interviews. The sample consisted of 450 residents aged 45-64 across 45 randomly selected neighbourhoods, that met the selection criteria. The tools used were: Demographic questionnaire, SF 36 Questionnaire, IPAQ- International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form.ResultsThe social gradient appears in all social indicators. Physical dimension of health has a strong relationship between health-related quality of life with the education index. Specifically, the range is 12 points for males and 14 points for females (p for interaction=0.16). Profession systematically appears to have a stronger relationship with men than with women, and is present in both physical and mental dimensions. The range is 13 points for men and 10 points for women (p for interaction=0.31).ConclusionsIt seems that young highly educated males, employed full time, earning high income and engaging in mild physical activity, have significantly higher level of health-related life quality, compared to other middle age adult groups, living in Limassol. This finding is in agreement with other studies that show correlations between gender and the patterns of risk factors.

J	Martin, A; Naunton, M; Peterson, GM				Martin, Alicia; Naunton, Mark; Peterson, Gregory M.			Gender balance in pharmacy leadership: Are we making progress?	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY			English	Article						Gender; Leadership; Pharmacy; Equality	GLOBAL HEALTH	Background: In recent years there has been an increasing focus on gender balance and equity in leadership po-sitions. In most fields of work, including female dominated professions such as pharmacy, there is an under-representation of women in leadership positions. This is despite significant benefits being observed in organisations when diversity in leadership is increased. To date, there has been no research investigating gender balance in pharmacy leadership and decision-making positions in Australia. Objective: To explore gender balance in pharmacy leadership in Australia and how it has changed over the last 20 years. Setting: This study was conducted in Australia. Method: Eight key Australian pharmacy organisations were identified. Data were extracted from their websites or through direct contact with the organisation for the gender breakdown of their boards/committees/councils from the years 1998?2018. Results: In total, data were obtained for 368 separate professional committees, from seven organisations (including 22 state/territory branches), covering the years of 1998?2018. Some organisations provided information for each of the 21 years, while others were only able to provide a few data points. Overall, gender balance in pharmacy organisations has increased over the 21-year period however, there remains a lack of women in leadership positions, particularly in the most senior posi-tions where women held only 24% of president/chair positions over the time period. In 2018 women held 34% of these positions, despite representing 62% of pharmacists in Australia. Conclusion: Gender inequity in leadership is prevalent in the Australian pharmacy profession, although it has lessened over time. Based on the trend from 1998 to 2018 it is predicted that women will achieve an average of 50% representation in Australian pharmacy professional committees no sooner than 2029.

Yet the geographic distribution, authorship representation, and subject trends among Low-/Low-Middle-Income Country (LIC/LMIC)-based scientific publications remain largely unknown. This analysis assesses these gaps in knowledge. We performed a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of all scientific articles published between January 2014 and June 2016 in the four most prominent general medicine and five most prominent general global health journals based on impact factor. The African region, containing 24% of the global LIC/LMIC population, accounted for 49.9% of all publications. Corresponding authors with either exclusive or joint appointment to a LIC/ LMIC institution were present in 26.2% of all included articles. Over one-quarter (28.8%) of all publications did not list a local author. Nearly two-thirds (62.1%) of articles published in global health journals and roughly half (52.4%) in general medicine journals involved infectious diseases. Non-HIV infectious disease studies were by far the most frequent subject areas across all journals.

J	Cristiano, S				Cristiano, Silvio			Organic vegetables from community-supported agriculture in Italy: Emergy assessment and potential for sustainable, just, and resilient urban-rural local food production	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Clean and just production; Local food systems; Resilient cities; Emergy accounting; Food geographies; Emergy analysis; Systems thinking	CROP PRODUCTION SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY; MAIZE PRODUCTION; UNITED-STATES; ENERGY; GEOBIOSPHERE; TRANSFORMITY; UNCERTAINTY; SCALE; ORGANIZATION	Global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the interconnectedness and vulnerability of human systems, requiring integrated transdisciplinary studies aimed at breaking unsustainable and unjust practices. In this work, a horticultural collaborative production system is addressed, inspired by the community-supported agriculture (CSA) model. In a highly industrialised area of Northern Italy, with significant wild land consumption, an alternative bottom-up experience is described for the provision of vegetables in a short and cooperative not-for-sale supply chain. Local organic farming and just labour conditions seek ecological sustainability and social equity beyond market dynamics. This CSA project contributes to the resilience of a territory currently affected by health and economic plights. Its claims, limits, and potentials of a project of this kind are investigated for the first time by means of the Emergy Assessment (EMA). The socio-ecological and economic inputs in the system at issue are identified and quantified, partly eased by the transparent process of the target community, and some key indicators are calculated. The new specific emergy values for the organic horticultural produce at hand are 3.15E+12 sej/kg (without labour and services), with organic manure as a leading input (37%) and 1.02E+13 sej/kg (with L&S), with labour as a leading input (38% paid, 8% voluntary) as key inputs; their calculation corrects underestimations present in some biased studies. This EMA provides fruitful insights of a single replicable and/or scalable project, thus offering current barrier and future opportunities for local improvement and exportability to crisis and post-crisis scenarios, and anyway for pursuing sustainability goals.

J	Pomeranz, K				Pomeranz, Kenneth			Afterword: Lives Interrupted, Trends Continued?	JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES			English	Article						COVID-19; East Asia; South Asia; migrants; inequality; racism; telecommunications; environmental crisis; global politics; poverty		The COVID-19 pandemic is nowhere near over. Some things, however, seem relatively clear. So far, the agendas of the world's most powerful actors seem unchanged-or, indeed, accelerated. Partly as a result, disease mortality and economic losses have fallen largely on poorer people, though deaths so far have been concentrated among poorer people in rich countries. Consequently, the pandemic's implications look very different at the local, subnational, and international levels-although at all levels, they thus far reflect accelerations of preexisting trends more than new departures. Many developments reflect remarkable gains in human capacity to cope with disasters-a point highlighted by comparisons to the 1919 flu and other historical events pandemics made by the authors in this forum. Those gains are particularly evident in Asia, though they look more precarious in South Asia and Southeast Asia than in East Asia; this has contributed to a marked shift in rhetoric about global "sickness" and health and seems consistent with prophecies of a coming "Asian century." However, COVID-19 may not be a singular event like 1919 but may portend a wave of environmental emergencies; in that scenario, no world region has exhibited as much resilience as it would need.

Focused on Palestinians, this paper discusses the collective trauma Palestinians experienced and how it manifests in transgenerational effects on the body and mind that may be post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or perhaps another distinct condition that is yet to be codified in the Western medical lexicon. It describes local alternatives to Western medical diagnostic tools like the "ease to disease" diagnostic scale and the sociopolitical context-in this case, the Palestinian fight for karamah, or dignity-from which such alternatives arise. Based on these findings, a novel theoretical framework, the comprehensive communal trauma intervention model (CCTIM), a truly transdisciplinary population-level model for treating mental health in vulnerable communities globally, is proposed. It articulates the need to address the root cause of collective trauma, make modifications to the healthcare system, and cultivate strategic equity-oriented and research-based partnerships.

Annual Research Review: Youth firearm violence disparities in the United States and implications for prevention	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Adolescence; firearm violence; prevention; structural inequality; socio&#8208; cultural influence; racial disparities	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; GUN VIOLENCE; RACIAL DISPARITIES; STRUCTURAL RACISM; RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES; SUICIDE-PREVENTION; ETHNIC DISPARITIES; PROTECTIVE FACTORS; SCHOOL SHOOTINGS; NATIONAL-SURVEY	Objective Research has identified the United States (U.S.) as a global outlier in its firearm ownership rates, with a correspondingly higher risk of youth firearm violence compared to other countries. The relative extent of disparities in youth firearm violence within the U.S. has been less clear. Little is known about factors in the social ecology driving these disparities and whether current firearm violence prevention approaches sufficiently address them. Method Applying a health disparities framework, we synthesized epidemiological, sociological, and prevention science literatures, emphasizing structural inequalities in youth sociocultural positionality in life course developmental context. We also highlighted findings from national injury data and other studies regarding the magnitude and impacts of youth firearm violence disparities. Results The burden of firearm violence varied markedly at intersections of gender, race, place, developmental stage, and homicidal or suicidal intent. Firearm homicide among Black boys and young men (ages 15-24) was at outlier levels - many times greater than the rates of any other demographic group, developmental stage, or violence intent, particularly in urban settings. Recent research has operationalized structural racism and implicated historically racialized spaces as a root cause of this disparity. In contrast, elevated firearm suicide rates were found among Native and White boys and young men in rural settings; firearm-related cultural attitudes and gender socialization were points of consideration to explain these disparities. We highlighted research-based youth firearm violence preventive interventions, and emphasized gaps in efforts focused on structural and sociocultural factors. Conclusions More explicit attention to reducing firearm homicide among Black boys and young men and firearm suicide among Native and rural White boys and young men is urgently needed and has potential to substantially lower overall rates of firearm violence in the U.S.	[Bottiani, Jessika H.; Camacho, Daniel A.; Bradshaw, Catherine P.] Univ Virginia, Sch Educ & Human Dev, 405 Emmet St South, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Lindstrom Johnson, Sarah] Arizona State Univ, Sanford Sch Social & Family Dynam, Tempe, AZ USA	University of Virginia; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe	Bottiani, JH (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Sch Educ & Human Dev, 405 Emmet St South, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.	jessika.bottiani@virginia.edu	Bottiani, Jessika/AEI-2801-2022	Bottiani, Jessika/0000-0001-7810-1707; Bradshaw, Catherine/0000-0003-2048-3225; Lindstrom Johnson, Sarah/0000-0002-4550-1162	William T.

However, studies are inconclusive in determining the influence of contextual and individual factors on dental caries incidence in this group of teeth. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of contextual and individual factors on dental caries incidence in first permanent molars. This 7-year cohort study was conducted with children (1-5 years of age) who had been assessed initially in a survey performed in 2010. Dental caries was assessed at the baseline through the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). Contextual and individual variables were collected at baseline and included the presence of cultural community centers in the neighborhood as well as demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and biological characteristics. A multilevel Poisson regression model was used to investigate the influence of individual and contextual characteristics on dental caries incidence in first permanent molars (relative risk [RR] and 95% confidence interval [CI]). Of the 639 children examined at baseline, a total of 449 were reassessed after 7 years (70.3% retention rate). Children who lived in neighborhoods with cultural community centers had a lower risk of dental caries in first permanent molars at the follow-up (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.62-0.99). Children from families with a low income (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.03-1.76) and poor parental perception of children's oral health (RR 1.56; 95% CI 1.18-2.06) were associated with a higher risk of dental caries in first molars. In conclusion, individual and contextual determinants showed an important role in the incidence of caries in first permanent molars.

Different issues worldwide affect children's physical and mental health as well as their development, influencing their future as adults. Inequities are avoidable inequalities. Despite improvements in the past two decades, the ambitious goals of global agendas have, for the most part, remained as expectations with regard to childhood rights, social justice, and health equity in practice. The concept of social determinants of health has become part of the common language in certain settings, but this is still too little to improve health in practice on a global scale, particularly for underprivileged subgroups of the community, as children and adolescents often are. Pediatric health professionals and their organizations are also responsible for guaranteeing children's and adolescents' right to health and better wellbeing, helping to reduce health inequalities.

The continent is home to 12% of the global population, but accounts for 71% of PWH globally. Antiretroviral therapy has played an important role in the reduction of the morbidity and mortality rates for HIV, which necessitates increased surveillance of the threats from pernicious risks to which PWH who live longer remain exposed. This includes cardiopulmonary comorbidities, which pose significant public health and economic challenges. A significant contributor to the cardiopulmonary comorbidities is tobacco smoking. Indeed, globally, PWH have a 2-4-fold higher utilization of tobacco compared to the general population, leading to endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis that result in cardiopulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease. In the context of PWH, we discuss (1) the current trends in cigarette smoking and (2) the lack of geographically relevant data on the cardiopulmonary conditions associated with smoking; we then review (3) the current evidence on chronic inflammation induced by smoking and the potential pathways for cardiopulmonary disease and (4) the multifactorial nature of the syndemic of smoking, HIV, and cardiopulmonary diseases. This commentary calls for a major, multi-setting cohort study using a syndemics framework to assess cardiopulmonary disease outcomes among PWH who smoke. Conclusion: We call for a parallel program of implementation research to promote the adoption of evidence-based interventions, which could improve health outcomes for PWH with cardiopulmonary diseases and address the health inequities experienced by PWH in African countries.

We use the Develop-Distort Dilemma (DDD) framework to understand how the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) distorted or developed local health systems. We include document review and 176 interviews with respondents at the global level and across seven focus countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia and Nigeria). We use DDD domains, contextual factors and transition planning to analyse interactions between the broader context, local health systems and the GPEI to identify changes. Our analysis confirms earlier research including improved health worker, laboratory and surveillance capacity, monitoring and accountability, and efforts to reach vulnerable populations, whereas distortions include shifting attention from routine health services and distorting local payment and incentives structures. New findings highlight how global-level governance structures evolved and affected national actors; issues of country ownership, including for data systems, where the polio programme is not indigenously financed; how expectations of success have affected implementation at programme and community level; and unresolved tensions around transition planning. The decoupling of polio eradication from routine immunization, in particular, plays an outsize role in these issues as it removed attention from system strengthening. In addition to drawing lessons from the GPEI experience for other efforts, we also reflect on the use of the DDD framework for assessing programmes and their system-level impacts. Future eradication efforts should be approached carefully, and new initiatives of any kind should leverage the existing health system while considering equity, inclusion and transition from the start.

Social protection programs have been used by many Latin American countries as the region is more urbanized than any other developing regions.

As a result, discharge planning, patient access to local community-based treatment, and safety-net programming were affected. Given structural and intersectional risk vulnerabilities of people with substance use disorders (SUDs), the OHSU members felt that COVID-19 would disproportionately impact chronically marginalized members of our community. These inequities inspired the formation of the Oregon substance use disorder resources collaborative (ORSUD) led by four medical students. ORSUD?s mission is to support the efforts of local safety-net organizations that and front-line providers who serve chronically marginalized community members in the midst of the global pandemic. We operationalized our mission through: 1) collecting and disseminating operational and capacity changes in local addiction and harm reduction services to the broader treatment community, and 2) identifying and addressing immediate resource needs for local safety-net programs. Our program uses a real-time public-facing document to collate local programmatic updates and general community resources. COVID-19 disproportionately burdens people with SUDs; thus, ORSUD exists to support programs serving people with SUDs and will continue to evolve to meet their needs and the needs of those who serve them.

Models estimate that without intervention, over the next 50 years 12.2 million new cases of cervical cancer will occur, nearly 60% of which are preventable only through CSM. Given that more than 80% of the cervical cancer occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), scaling up sustainable CSM programs in these countries is a top priority for achieving the global elimination goals. Multiple technologies have been developed and validated to meet this need. Now it is critical to identify strategies to implement these technologies into complex, adaptive health care delivery systems. As part of the coordinated cervical cancer elimination effort, we applied a systems thinking lens to reflect on our experiences with implementation of HPV-based CSM programs using the WHO health systems framework. While many common health system barriers were identified, the effectiveness of implementation strategies to address them was context dependent; often reflecting differences in stakeholder's belief in the quality of the evidence supporting a CSM algorithm, the appropriateness of the evidence and algorithm to context, and the 'implementability' of the algorithm under realistic assessments of resource availability and constraints. A structured planning process, with early and broad stakeholder engagement, will ensure that shared-decisions in CSM implementation are appropriately aligned with the culture, values, and resource realities of the setting.

The focus of this article is on the community-engaged pedagogy within a community health nursing practice course that supported student learning. Insights were gleaned over the course of four academic semesters (and four student cohort groups) with students as co-developers of the campus-community garden and participants in the PAR. Key themes emerged from student participants in the PAR process including: (1) planning in community to "think global, act local"; (2) discovering 'the people in your neighbourhood' as socially just partnerships; (3) revisiting landscapes of social inclusion; and (4) reflecting on "humble togetherness" across generational gaps. The findings showcased here attest to how community-engaged pedagogy, in conjunction with PAR, can facilitate student learning outside of traditional settings and grow social inclusion, intergenerational connection, and social justice.

One area where the impact of genomics is very noticeable is in oncology, specifically in terms of diagnosis and elucidating genetic predisposition to rare and common cancers. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) stands to benefit from cancer genomics, given recent spikes in the incidence of various types of cancers in the region. This mini review presents, from a health and science equity perspective, how genomics could shape cancer research and clinical care in SSA. We highlight some pan-African genomics and cancer initiatives that are facilitating cancer genomics research in SSA. We conclude with recommendations on how the ideals of equity may be advanced in cancer genomics initiatives in SSA.

J	Hersh, D; Israel, M; Shiggins, C				Hersh, Deborah; Israel, Mark; Shiggins, Ciara			The ethics of patient and public involvement across the research process: towards partnership with people with aphasia	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Aphasia; ethics; research; involvement; engagement	INFORMED-CONSENT; STROKE RESEARCH	Background: Conducting Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in health research is a way of building knowledge that incorporates the experience of service users, adds research impact, and helps avoid wasting resources on findings that have little relevance to people or cannot be implemented. We argue that there is a need to extend ethical considerations currently focused on research participants with aphasia to encompass and guide expectations of involvement in partnerships with people with aphasia across the research lifecycle. Method: We use the 2018 revision of the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research as the framework for this article. The National Statement is underpinned by values based on respect for human beings, research merit and integrity, justice, and beneficence. While the National Statement outlines the ethical standards for conducting human research with research participants in Australia, the ideas and principles within it draw on international norms. Building on the seven elements of the research process introduced in Chapter 3 of the National Statement, we develop a model for examining ethics and PPI across the research lifecycle. This model revolves around an extra phase, Element Zero, required for the preparation of PPI for both researchers and research partners with aphasia. Results: There are many ethical considerations when involving patients and members of the public across the research lifecycle. Ethical questions that arise in relation to patients and the public as partners (whether in a role of consultant, advisor, collaborator or within user-controlled projects) may differ from those associated with participants. The nature of the relationships built through the PPI process requires a clear extension of the remit for research ethics to encompass ethical reflection both before the design of a project and after a project has ended as represented by the Ethics and PPI Research Lifecycle Model. Conclusion: The role of people with aphasia as partners in research recognises their expertise and potential to improve the relevance and impact of research endeavours. Reflecting on the ethical implications of this is crucial, protecting, empowering and enabling both researchers and partners with aphasia to engage with each other through respectful and positive research relationships.

J	Barlow, P; Stuckler, D				Barlow, P.; Stuckler, D.			Globalization and health policy space: Introducing the WTOhealth dataset of trade challenges to national health regulations at World Trade Organization, 1995?2016	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Trade; Globalization; Political determinants of health; Politics of health policy; Policy space; Health policy process; Power asymmetries	GLOBAL HEALTH; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; TOBACCO CONTROL; GOVERNANCE; STANDARDS; FRAMEWORK; ECONOMY; EQUITY; FOOD	Do international trade rules and agreements constrain health policy space? A multitude of global actors and institutions with different interests and power can shape national health policy, and trade rules provide one means through which to exert pressure on governments. Yet, the full scope of political pressure on health policy within the global trade regime is insufficiently understood, as previous research largely focussed on challenges to food, alcohol, and tobacco regulations and used small-N case studies. This potentially overlooks other domains of influence and we lack an understanding of quantitative trends and patterns therein. In this article we introduce a novel dataset, WTOhealth, comprising all challenges to national health regulations at the WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee between 1995 and 2016. The dataset is based on 1496 pages of minutes from 71 TBT meetings. We describe how we developed this dataset and present an exploratory analysis of key patterns within the data. Our analysis shows that WTO members raised 250 trade challenges to health regulations between 1995 and 2016. 83.6% of challenges to low- or lower-middle income country (LMIC) members were raised by highincome countries (HICs). Many challenges centred on food (16.4% challenges), alcohol (10.4%), and tobacco (4.2%) policies, but a substantial proportion concerned other products, including toxic chemicals (9.1%), pharmaceuticals and medical devices (8.1%), machinery (7.8%), and motor vehicles (7.3%). This includes measures targeting medical device safety, increased access to pharmaceuticals, and reduced exposure to toxins harmful to both health and the environment. We further examine these challenges, finding that HIC members made claims with contentious scientific support. In short, diverse health regulations may be changed or delayed following contentious challenges at the TBT Committee. There is a need for further research investigating the nature and influence of WTO challenges to diverse health regulations.

Chemotherapy is nowadays the main element of therapy, but irradiation is still required for some patients. With the advent of multimodality therapy and supportive care, five-year cancer survival exceeds 80 % in most European and North American countries today. The substantial improvements in survival led to a constantly growing population of childhood cancer survivors. Concerns regarding the risk of late effects of the intensive cancer treatment at a young age, together with increasing numbers of survivors, have directed attention towards survivorship research. Survivors of childhood cancer are at longstanding risk of various severe somatic and mental health conditions attributable to the cancer and its treatment, as well as adverse social and socioeconomic consequences, and diminished psychological well-being and quality of life. It is, however, important to stress that some survivors have no or very mild adverse health conditions. Nevertheless, joint efforts are warranted for the care and long-term follow-up of childhood cancer patients. With this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of improvements in survival and treatment modalities over time, as well as the related somatic and mental late effects, and social and socioeconomic difficulties that these children might encounter later in life.

Neoliberal discourse, actor power, and the politics of nutrition policy: A qualitative analysis of informal challenges to nutrition labelling regulations at the World Trade Organization, 2007-2019	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Politics of nutrition policy; Discourse; Power; Neoliberalism; Political determinants of health; Structural nutrition policy; Nutrition labelling; Critical discourse analysis	TOBACCO CONTROL; HEALTH; IDEAS; PRIORITY; OBESITY; LEGITIMATION; DISPARITIES; FRAMEWORK; EQUITY	Unhealthy diets are increasing contributors to poor health and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Government interventions targeting the structural drivers of unhealthy diets are needed to prevent these illnesses, including nutrition labelling regulations that create healthier food environments. Yet, implementation remains slow and uneven. One explanation for slow implementation highlights the role of politics, including powerful ideological discourse and its strategic deployment by economically powerful actors. In this article, we advance research on the politics of nutrition policies by analysing political discourse on nutrition labelling regulations within an influential and under-studied global institution: the World Trade Organization (WTO). We identified WTO Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee meeting minutes with reference to nutrition labelling policies proposed by Thailand, Chile, Indonesia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Uruguay (2007?2019; n = 47). We analysed the frames, narratives, and normative claims that feature in inter-country discourse within TBT meetings and examined how actors mobilize ideological and material sources of power via these statements. We find that informal government challenges to nutrition labelling proposals within the Committee featured a narrative that individualized the causes of and solutions to poor diet, downplayed harms from industrialised food products, and framed state regulation as harmful and unjust. These non-technical claims mobilised neoliberal ideology and rhetoric to contest the normative legitimacy of members? proposals and to desocialize and de-politicize poor diets. Furthermore, high-income countries (HICs) re-framed policy goals to focus on individual determinants of poor nutrition whilst calling for their preferred policies to be adopted. Patterns of discourse within TBT meetings also had striking similarities with arguments raised by multi-national food corporations elsewhere. Our findings suggest that non-technical and ideological arguments raised during TBT meetings serve as inconspicuous tools through which nutrition labelling policies in LMICs are undermined by HICs, industry, and the powerful ideology of neoliberalism.

Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals? response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.	[Pereira, Rafael H.

How to evaluate the implementation of complex health programmes in low-income settings: the approach of the Gavi Full Country Evaluations	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Evaluation; implementation research; immunization; health systems	FRAMEWORK	Vaccination, like most other public health services, relies on a complex package of intervention components, functioning systems and committed actors to achieve universal coverage. Despite significant investment in immunization programmes, national coverage trends have slowed and equity gaps have grown. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Gavi Full Country Evaluations, a multi-country, prospective, mixed-methods approach whose goal was to monitor and evaluate processes, inputs, outputs and outcomes of immunization programmes in Bangladesh, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia. We implemented the Full Country Evaluations from 2013 to 2018 with the goal of identifying the drivers of immunization programme improvement to support programme implementation and increase equitable immunization coverage. The framework supported methodological and paradigmatic flexibility to respond to a broad range of evaluation and implementation research questions at global, national and cross-country levels, but was primarily underpinned by a focus on evaluating processes and identifying the root causes of implementation breakdowns. Process evaluation was driven by theories of change for each Gavi funding stream (e.g. Health Systems Strengthening) or activity, ranging from global policy development to district-level programme implementation. Mixing of methods increased in relevance and rigour over time as we learned to build multiple methods into increasingly tailored evaluation questions. Evaluation teams in country-based research institutes increasingly strengthened their level of embeddedness with immunization programmes as the emphasis shifted over time to focus more heavily on the use of findings for programme learning and adaptation. Based on our experiences implementing this approach, we recommend it for the evaluation of other complex interventions, health programmes or development assistance.

We conducted a systematic scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guideline to map and critically appraise economic evaluations of population-based dietary policies using simulation models. We searched Medline, Embase, and EconLit for studies published in English after 2005. Modeling studies were mapped based on model type, dietary policy, and nutritional target, and modeled risk factor-outcome pathways were analyzed. We included 56 studies comprising 136 model applications evaluating dietary policies in 21 countries. The policies most often assessed were reformulation (34/136), taxation (27/136), and labeling (20/136); the most common targets were salt/sodium (60/136), sugar-sweetened beverages (31/136), and fruit and vegetables (15/136). Model types included Markov-type (35/56), microsimulation (11/56), and comparative risk assessment (7/56) models. Overall, the key diet-related risk factors and health outcomes were modeled, but only 1 study included overall diet quality as a risk factor. Information about validation was only reported in 19 of 56 studies and few studies (14/56) analyzed the equity impacts of policies. Commonly included cost components were health sector (52/56) and public sector implementation costs (35/56), as opposed to private sector (18/56), lost productivity (11/56), and informal care costs (3/56). Most dietary policies (103/136) were evaluated as cost-saving independent of the applied costing perspective. An analysis of the main limitations reported by authors revealed that model validity, uncertainty of dietary effect estimates, and long-term intervention assumptions necessitate a careful interpretation of results. In conclusion, simulation modeling is widely applied in the economic evaluation of population-based dietary policies but rarely takes dietary complexity and the equity dimensions of policies into account. To increase relevance for policymakers and support diet-related disease prevention, economic effects beyond the health sector should be considered, and transparent conduct and reporting of model validation should be improved.

In the United States, where public health departments have been severely defunded, Black, Native, Latinx communities and those experiencing poverty in the country's largest cities are disproportionately infected and disproportionately dying. Based on our collective ethnographic work in three global cities in the U.S. cities (San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Detroit), we identify how the political geography of racialisation potentiated the COVID-19 crisis, exacerbating the social and economic toll of the pandemic for non-white communities, and undercut the public health response. Our analysis is specific to the current COVID19 crisis in the U.S, however the lessons from these cases are important for understanding and responding to the corrosive political processes that have entrenched inequality in pandemics around the world.

Both are on a progressive incline with intergenerational effects on the wellbeing, health and security of the population. The aim of this review was to explore the interconnection relationship between type 2 diabetes and climate change. Methods: A literature review search of MEDLINE publications from 2010 to March 2020 was performed. Englishlanguage articles using terms ?diabetes? AND ?climate change? OR ?temperature change? OR ?temperature rise? OR ?hot temperature? OR ?extreme heat? were reviewed. Results: Climate change and diabetes are interconnected through a direct and indirect pathway. Temperature changes can trigger a person?s susceptibility to develop diabetes as well as impose adverse effects on those diagnosed with diabetes (such as increased incidence of hospitalization, dehydration and mortality). Both temperature extremes have been reported to lead to negative effects on diabetes. Concurrently, both phenomena have shared predisposing vectors (such as sedentary lifestyle, urbanisation, unhealthy diets) that lead to their progressive development. Conclusion: A bidirectional relationship exists between type 2 diabetes and climate change. This relationship originates through a multifactorial pathway involving biological, social, environmental, geophysical and economic factors. An integrated action plan targeting the common predisposing vectors should be set up. This should support a low environmental impact while promoting equity and wellbeing.

The high maternal deaths in the country have been attributed to the low utilization of maternal healthcare services, including skilled birth attendance. This study examined the predictors of skilled birth services utilization among married women in Cameroon. Methods Data from the 2018 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey was analyzed on 7881 married women of reproductive age (15-49 years). Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine the predictors of skilled childbirth services. The results were presented with crude odds ratio (cOR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results The coverage of skilled birth attendance among married women of reproductive age in Cameroon was 66.2%. After adjusting for potential confounders, media exposure (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.11-1.91), higher decision making (aOR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.36-2.59), maternal education (aOR = 2.38, 95% CI; 1.65-3.42), place of residence (aOR = 0.50, 95% CI; 0.33-0.74), religion (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI; 0.35-0.87), economic status (aOR = 5.16, 95% CI; 2.58-10.30), wife beating attitude (aOR = 1.32, 95% CI; 1.05-1.65), parity (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI; 0.41-0.93) and skilled antenatal care (aOR = 14.46, 95% CI; 10.01-20.89) were found to be significant predictors of skilled birth attendance. Conclusions This study demonstrates that social, economic, regional, and cultural factors can act as barriers to skilled childbirth services utilization in Cameroon. Interventions that target women empowerment, antenatal care awareness and strengthening are needed, especially among the rural poor, to reduce barriers to care seeking. Maternal healthcare services utilization interventions and policies in Cameroon need to focus on specific equity gaps that relate to socio-economic status, maternal education, and the economic empowerment of women. Such policies and interventions should also aim at reducing geographical barriers to access to maternal healthcare services, including skilled birth attendance. Due to the presence of inequities in the use of skilled birth attendance services, programs aimed at social protection and empowerment of economically disadvantaged women are necessary for the achievement of the post-2015 targets and the Sustainable Development Goals. Plain English Summary Globally, Cameroon is one of the countries with high maternal deaths. Low utilization of maternal healthcare services, including skilled birth attendance have been found to account for the high maternal deaths in the country. This study sought to examine the factors associated with skilled childbirth services utilization among married women in Cameroon. Using data from the 2018 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey, we found that the coverage of skilled birth attendance among married women of reproductive age in Cameroon is high. Factors such as higher decision-making power, higher maternal education, place of residence, religion, higher economic status, wife beating attitude, parity and skilled antenatal care were found to be the significant predictors of skilled birth attendance. This study has shown that socio-economic, regional and cultural factors account for the utilization of skilled childbirth services utilization in Cameroon. Interventions aimed at enhancing the utilization of skilled childbirth services in Cameroon should target women empowerment, antenatal care awareness creation and sensitization, especially among the rural poor, to reduce barriers to care seeking. Maternal healthcare services utilization interventions and policies in Cameroon need to focus on specific equity gaps that relate to socio-economic status, maternal education, and the economic empowerment of women.

Challenges for people with intellectual disabilities in law enforcement interactions in Ireland; thematic analysis informed by 1537 person-years' experience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Intellectual disabilities; Police; Law enforcement officer; Vulnerability; Representative Organisations; Judiciary; Garda; Barrister; Solicitor; Mental health; Ireland; United Nations&apos; convention on the rights of persons with disabilities	ADULTS; COURT; COMMUNICATION; PREVALENCE; PRISONERS; WITNESSES; OFFENDERS	Background: People with intellectual disabilities (PWID) are over-represented in criminal justice systems globally. This over-representation reveals itself at once in the demographic make-up of prison populations, as well as those detained in police settings as suspects of crime. While it is well-established in international literature that individuals who find themselves in the latter scenario face particular challenges in negotiating the forensic formalities routinely followed by the police at the pre-trial stage of criminal proceedings on account of their impairments, the specific difficulties experienced by PWID as suspects within Ireland's criminal justice system has yet to be explained, or indeed, understood. In seeking to address this research lacuna, this paper yields an account of a qualitative study which was aimed at identifying the unique challenges which PWID face in their interactions with Law Enforcement Officials (LEOs) in Ireland. Aims: This study aimed to elicit perspectives across a range of disciplines with regard to barriers for PWID interacting with LEOs in Ireland, and sought viewpoints on the content of a proposed awareness programme. Methods: A survey using purposive sampling was used to elicit viewpoints from people from representative organisations for PWID, people working with voluntary organisations for PWID, healthcare professionals working with PWID and professionals from the criminal justice system (including members of An Garda Siochana, lawyers, members of the Irish judiciary and officials within the Airport Police). Data were anonymised at the point of collection. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to extract themes based on the data retrieved through the survey. Results: Ninety-five (n = 95) responses were received from individuals reporting a cumulative experience of 1537 person-years. Respondents identified themselves as members of one of three groups; people working in a voluntary or representative organisation for PWID (n = 42, 44.2%); people working in healthcare (n = 31, 32.6%); and people working in law enforcement (n = 22, 23.1%). Three themes were identified from the qualitative thematic analysis. The first theme, "Barriers to Communication", identified challenges which PWID and LEO experience in their mutual interactions and communications with one another. The second theme, "Building Awareness and Skills", identified elements of an ID awareness programme for LEOs. The third theme, "Institutional and System Change", identified possible lines of innovation with respect to contemporary police practice and the availability of supports for both PWID and the LEOs who work with them. Originality/Value: This study represents the first dedicated qualitative inquiry conducted on a multidisciplinary level into the barriers which healthcare professionals, legal professionals and disability advocacy groups perceive to be faced by PWID in their interactions with LEOs in Ireland. Consequently, the findings from this study will act as a valuable template in the direction of informing the development of an ID awareness programme for LEOs in Ireland. In addition, these research findings are expected to usefully inform the development of national policy and protocols in areas related to health, disability and justice. In offering a rich evidence-base for future policy initiatives, the timing of this study is particularly significant.The recent ratification by Ireland of the UN Convention for the Rights of People with Disabilities (UNCRPD), together with the synchronous emergence of an evolving emphasis on human rights-based policing at a national level in Ireland, has meant that Irish policy makers have a unique opportunity to re-imagine the pre-trial formalities of Ireland's criminal process in order to demonstrate an increased sensitivity to the needs of PWID. Securing equal access to justice for such individuals, it is important to emphasise, is a legal requirement pursuant to Article 13 of the UNCRPD. To the extent therefore that this study yields unique insights into the barriers faced by PWID in their interactions with LEOs, the results of this study are potentially generalisable to other jurisdictions that have ratified the UNCRPD and are developing policy to accord with Article 13.

Articles which mentioned health equity in the context of WHO's programs, policies, and so on, but did not discuss its conceptualization or definition were excluded.Sources of evidenceWe focused on peer-reviewed literature by scanning Ovid MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, and supplementing by hand-search.ResultsResults demonstrate the WHO has held - and continues to hold - ambiguous, inadequate, and contradictory views of equity that are rooted in different theories of social justice.ConclusionsMoving forward, the WHO should revaluate its conceptualization of equity and normative position, and align its work with Amartya Sen's Capabilities Approach, as it best encapsulates the broader views of the organization. Further empirical research is needed to assess the WHO interpretations and approaches to equity.

J	Higginbotham, G				Higginbotham, George			Virtual Connections: Improving Global Neurosurgery Through Immersive Technologies	FRONTIERS IN SURGERY			English	Article						virtual reality; augmented reality; global neurosurgery; COVID-19; immersive technologies	INTERACTIVE PRESENCE; REALITY; COLLABORATION; HEALTH	The field of neurosurgery has always been propelled by the adoption of novel technologies to improve practice. Although advancements have occurred in the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term outcomes of patients, these have not translated to global patient benefit. Up to five million people each year do not have access to safe and affordable neurosurgical interventions, and those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected. Current approaches to increase neurosurgical capacity are unlikely to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals target by 2030, and many of the most successful programs have been disrupted by the travel restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is therefore a pressing need for creative virtual solutions. An area of growing relevance is the use of immersive technologies: virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). AR allows additional information to be superimposed onto the surgeon's visual field, thus enhancing intra-operative visualization. This can be used for remote tele-proctoring, whereby an experienced surgeon can virtually assist with a procedure regardless of geographical location. Expert guidance can therefore be given to both neurosurgical trainees and non-neurosurgical practitioners, further facilitating the growing practice of neurosurgical task-shifting in LMICs. VR simulation is another useful tool in remote neurosurgical training, with the potential to reduce the learning curve of complex procedures whilst conserving supplies in low-resource settings. The adoption of immersive technologies into practice is therefore a promising approach for achieving global neurosurgical equity, whilst adapting to the long-term disruptions of the pandemic.

While the search for a vaccine represents the hope to overcome the pandemic, measures were established to control the disease transmission through individual and collective actions of hygiene and physical distancing. Based on the popular clamor for new vaccines, this critical essay discusses the paradox and contradictions of the individual-society relationship in the context of COVID-19 considering vaccine hesitancy as a historical and social phenomenon. We also argue that decisions on (not) vaccinating or (not) following COVID-19 control and preventive measures are influenced by social belonging and traversed by inequalities that tend to exacerbate. COVID-19 surrounding infodemic and vaccine hesitancy reflect the tension between scientifically-validated and self-perceived risk, besides being impacted by the crisis of confidence in science. Perceiving risk and adhering to precautionary measures extrapolate subjectivity and rationality, and mirror values and creed shaped by the political, economic, and sociocultural dimensions.

We argue that in a global politics characterized by racialized inequality, pandemics such as COVID-19 exacerbate the marginalization of already oppressed groups. We review published research on previous pandemics to historicize pandemic othering and blame, and enumerate some of the consequences for politics, policy, and public health. Specifically, we draw on lessons from smallpox outbreaks, the third bubonic plague, the 1918 influenza pandemic, and more recent pandemics, such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and Ebola. We also compile reports to document the discrimination and violence targeting marginalized groups early in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article lays bare the continuation of a long history of othering and blame during disease outbreaks and identifies needs for further inquiry to understand the persistence of these pandemic politics.

SEMINARS IN ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM			English	Article						Systematic reviews; Aging; Function; Core outcome sets&nbsp; Musculosketal Rhematology&nbsp	INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; HEALTH ICF; DISABILITY; FRAMEWORK	Background: Musculoskeletal conditions are the leading cause of years lived with disability for older adults. Limitations in functional ability affect healthy aging for aging populations worldwide. Thus, it is important to assess effects of interventions on the multiple dimensions of function for older adults. Objectives: To assess: (1) which domains of function are assessed in reviews published by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group inclusive of older adults, and (2) the extent to which these reviews evaluate effects and/ or applicability of findings for older adults. Methods: We included all reviews published by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group after 2015 including participants over the age of 50 (n = 52). We extracted data on how the activities and participation domains of the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) were measured. We assessed the extent to which reviews included methods to evaluate effects across age, according to the framework in the Cochrane Handbook chapter on equity and specific populations. Results: The median age of participants across reviews was 54 years (range 16-94). ICF domains assessed in reviews, in descending order of frequency, were: domestic life (90%), mobility (89%), self-care (87%), interpersonal interactions and relationships (65%), community, social, and civic life (64%), major life areas (31%), communication (2%), general tasks and demands (0%) and learning and applying knowledge (0%). In evaluating effects across age, the age of participants was described by 73% of reviews and 54% mentioned age in the description of the condition, 21% planned subgroup analysis by age and none were able to conduct this analysis. Only 17% described applicability of results to older people. Conclusions: Reviews published by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group inclusive of older adults assess most domains of functional ability with the exception of communication, general tasks and knowledge domains. None of these reviews were able to conduct a subgroup analysis across age, indicating a need to improve the consideration of age in both Cochrane reviews as well as in primary studies.

J	Briskin, A				Briskin, Alan			Eupsychian Management: Spirit of the Good in Humanity and Society	JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Eupsychian; management; Abraham Maslow; Andrew Kay; synergy; workplace creativity		Eupsychian management was Abraham Maslow's term for workplaces of creativity, synergy, and continuous learning. His ideas were crystalized while visiting Non-Linear Systems, founded by Andrew Kay. Eupsychian management, a phrase congruent yet distinct from utopian concepts, specifically referred to environments designed for improving the self-fulfillment and psychological health of all its members. Maslow astutely observed that the characteristics of such environments were its general atmosphere for creative pursuit rather than a specific policy or practice. With retrospective hindsight, Maslow's managerial ideas, once visionary in nature, have been largely integrated into mainstream management theory and practice. However, his desire for less competitive, controlling, and hierarchical workplaces has been frustrated by ever-increasing global competition, fragmentation, and pressure for cost-efficiencies. The lasting impact of Eupsychian ideals may lie in its humanistic clarity. Human beings long for meaning, purpose, and contribution to a more just and regenerative world. The workplace cannot succeed as an island of psychological health separate from broader efforts to bring forth social justice and environmental renewal.

Sustainable fisheries are essential but not enough to ensure well-being for the world's fishers	FISH AND FISHERIES			English	Article						blue economy; fisheries management; just transitions; minimum living wage; social equity; sustainable livelihoods	SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARINE FISHERIES; IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT; POVERTY; LESSONS	Effective fisheries management is necessary for the long-term sustainability of fisheries and the economic benefits that they provide, but focusing only on ecological sustainability risks disregarding ultimate goals related to well-being that must be achieved through broader social policy. An analysis of global landings data shows that average fishing wages in 36%-67% of countries, home to 69%-95% of fishers worldwide, are likely below their nationally determined minimum living wage (which accounts for costs of food, shelter, clothing, health and education). Furthermore, even if all fisheries in every country were perfectly managed to achieve their Maximum Sustainable Yield, a common sustainability target, average incomes of fishers in up to 49 countries-70% of fishers worldwide-would still not meet minimum living wages. Access to decent work and livelihoods are fundamental human rights, including for all fisherfolk around the world, and strategies to support their well-being must therefore integrate a much wider set of perspectives, disciplines and institutions. Key first steps for fisheries researchers are to more fully recognize and estimate fisheries benefits to households-including income from women and/or alternative employment, unreported landings, or shadow values of subsistence catch-and to help identify and learn from economic equity outcomes in rebuilt fisheries around the world.

A flourishing world needs strong and equitable structures and systems, including strengthened democratic, research, and educational institutions, supported by ideas and discourses that are free of opaque and conflicted influence and that challenge the status quo and inequitable distribution of power.

J	Yates, S; Dickinson, H				Yates, Sophie; Dickinson, Helen			Navigating Complexity in a Global Pandemic: The Effects of COVID-19 on Children and Young People with Disability and Their Families in Australia	PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW			English	Article							PERSONALIZATION; INEQUALITIES	While Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) does not discriminate against particular groups, our social structures and systems mean some people are more at risk in a pandemic context-from both the disease and the social and policy responses to the pandemic. This is particularly so for people with disability, in part because they often have poorer health outcomes from underlying conditions but also due to discrimination and social exclusion. Here, we draw from a survey about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australian children and young people with disability and their families. Respondents faced a range of inequities prior to the pandemic, and COVID-19 has further exposed and often exacerbated them. We conclude that recent developments in the Australian disability context to personalize services have arguably made people with disability and their families less safe within a pandemic context, and we outline some ways in which these issues might be addressed.

Case studies and global lessons learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic	GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						health literacy; health-promoting schools; equity; social justice; health-promoting healthcare; vulnerable groups; migrant health; mental health literacy	LITERACY	The current COVID-19 pandemic has exposed missing links between health promotion and national/global health emergency policies. In response, health promotion initiatives were urgently developed and applied around the world. A selection of case studies from five countries, based on the Socio-Ecological Model of Health Promotion, exemplify 'real-world' action and challenges for health promotion intervention, research, and policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions range from a focus on individuals/families, organizations, communities and in healthcare, public health, education and media systems, health-promoting settings, and policy. Lessons learned highlight the need for emphasizing equity, trust, systems approach, and sustained action in future health promotion preparedness strategies. Challenges and opportunities are highlighted regarding the need for rapid response, clear communication based on health literacy, and collaboration across countries, disciplines, and health and education systems for meaningful solutions to global health crises.

J	Lori, JR; Madigan, E				Lori, Jody R.; Madigan, Elizabeth			Global engagement competencies for PhD nursing students	JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL NURSING			English	Article								The following question was posed to work groups at an invitational summit of educators, policy makers, and funding agencies involved in PhD nursing programs from Canada, the Caribbean, Latin America, and the US: Should global engagement competencies be included in PhD program curricula of research-intensive universities?" While the need for global engagement competencies ranked low among participants, our perspective is that there may be benefits from development of global engagement competencies. Many of the concepts identified for global engagement competencies are also important for US-based research. Nurses and midwives with PhDs are well positioned to conduct research that will impact the global burden of disease and close the health equity gap.

We estimate household-level energy footprints for Zambia covering direct (traditional and modern energy carriers) and indirect energy use, and adopting energy extended multiregional input-output. We employ final energy consumption, as it is closer to energy services and thus the purpose of energy use than the total primary energy use. The inequality in energy footprints differs from the inequality in incomes: the poorest half of the households have similar energy footprints and only high-income urban households have significant indirect energy footprints, associated with spend on goods and services. We examine the association between energy footprints and basic well-being measured in terms of physical health, education, nutrition and access to clean water using logistic regression, for a sub-sample of households with children under the age of five. We find that access to provisioning systems is more important than income for need satisfaction. Rural households have limited access to modern energy and provisioning systems and as a result fewer of them attain desirable well-being outcomes. We conclude that access to collective provisioning systems such as education, electricity and indoor sanitation is more important for household need satisfaction than individual provisioning in the form of ownership of durables, or even income. Further research is needed to improve the understanding of the association between energy use and needs satisfaction as it is crucial for addressing decarbonisation and human development agendas.

J	Black, K; Oh, P				Black, Kathy; Oh, Patricia			Assessing Age-Friendly Community Progress: What Have We Learned?	GERONTOLOGIST			English	Article						Age-friendly environments; Aging in place; Community development		Background and Objectives: The Global Network of Age-Friendly Cities and Communities has grown steadily over the past decade across the United States. The age-friendly model calls for a 5-year process of continuous improvement across the stages of engagement, planning, action, and measurement, culminating in an evaluation of age-friendly progress. However, surprisingly, little is known regarding American age-friendly communities' accomplishments to date. Research Design and Methods: We utilized content analysis to assess the progress reported by American age-friendly communities (n = 30) that joined by end of year 2015 using the Age-Friendly Community Evidence-based Tool with expanded program evaluation measures including health equity as defined by the World Health Organization. We employed deductive analytic techniques to assess reported community performance in 11 thematic areas across the range of structures and processes that characterize age-friendly efforts. Results: We found strong evidence in the areas of leadership and governance, harnessed resources, application of the age-friendly framework, and in multisector collaboration as well as reported provisions. All of the communities reported health equity aims, particularly in promoting accessible physical environments and social inclusion efforts. Our analysis further revealed relatively moderate evidence of older adult involvement and weak performance in the monitoring and reporting of evaluative findings as well as overall summation and dissemination plans. Discussion and Implications: We conclude by synthesizing the overall performance reported by the age-friendly communities, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses. We also offer suggestions to enhance evaluative efforts and advance the dissemination of age-friendly community progress.

There were presentations on STIs in Europe, many centred on Romania. A full session was devoted to syphilis, including global efforts in syphilis vaccine development. A workshop on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation in Europe reviewed the 'PrEP gap' and the East/West divide with an additional presentation on upcoming PrEP technologies. The conference featured symposia from WHO: STIs are still increasing and with no Euro universal surveillance systems. Other symposia focused on health inequalities amongst gender and sexual minorities and the recently published changes in IUSTI guidelines on gonorrhoea, syphilis and Lymphogranuloma Venereum. SARS-CoV-2 was a focus for several plenary sessions and its possibly lasting impact on service delivery. New challenges were discussed, particularly the loss of azithromycin as a useful antimicrobial. The symposia covered latest research and work into genomics of STIs. Whole-genome sequencing has revolutionised infectious disease study, particularly infection transmission and control. There was a debate on whether 'screening and treatment of bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infection is associated with Antimicrobial Resistance and should be reconsidered', emphasising limited damage of asymptomatic infection and the possibility of emergence of rapid antibiotic resistance. The conference closed with several IUSTI awards.

J	Webber, C				Webber, Craig			Rediscovering the Relative Deprivation and Crime Debate: Tracking its Fortunes from Left Realism to the Precariat	CRITICAL CRIMINOLOGY			English	Article								This article revisits the concept of relative deprivation and asks whether it is still useful for criminology. The article traces the way relative deprivation has been used in the past to understand crime and how it has connections to other, more recent, additions to debates on social justice. I argue that relative deprivation has disappeared even in the place that it had become the key explanation for crime-left realism. In so doing, I explore the resurrection of left realism in criminology-what I refer to as "post-millennial left realism"-first, by those who were associated with it originally, and then with Hall and Winlow's (2015, 2017) shift in emphasis to what they term "ultra-realism." I maintain that relative deprivation is still a powerful concept for bridging several related areas that should still be central to the concerns of criminology-in part, because it is still a major concern in popular social science and social psychology. Why has it disappeared in criminology? I present an argument that suggests that the absence of certain research methods, such as ethnographic and qualitative or small-scale survey methods, has impoverished our understanding of the lived reality of people experiencing the social transformations of a networked, precarious society. The massive polarization and disruption in politics and social discourse, as well as the worldwide economic, public health, and social transformations (ranging from the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter protests to the COVID-19 global pandemic) have demonstrated the continued relevance and analytical power that relative deprivation, in its elaborated form, brings to questions of crime and justice.

These early years are especially influenced by the surrounding environments in which children live and grow. A large international body of evidence demonstrates that children who experience disadvantage tend to fall increasingly behind over time. At the societal level, these inequities can cause substantial social burdens and significant costs across health, education, and welfare budgets. A contributing factor is that children experiencing adversity are less likely to have access to the environmental conditions that support them to thrive. Many of these factors are modifiable at the community or place level. We argue for three key-though not exhaustive-ideas that collectively could achieve more equitable outcomes for children facing disadvantage and experiencing adversity: 1. Adopt a social determinants approach to conceptualizing disadvantage; 2. Stack existing, evidence-based government and nongovernment service interventions/programs that operate at the local or community level; and 3. Use data and evidence to focus improvements for more equitable and adaptive systems. We conclude that if adopted, these 3 ideas could contribute to the ability of local communities and networks to identify and respond to factors that address early childhood inequalities.

Conformity and reactions to deviance in the time of COVID-19	GROUP PROCESSES & INTERGROUP RELATIONS			English	Article						black sheep effect; conformity; COVID-19; deviance; intergroup hypocrisy; intergroup relations; polarization; pandemic		We have seen massive global behavioral change as billions of people radically altered their ways of life in response to COVID-19. Here, we review how research on conformity and deviance can inform understanding of and effective responses to the pandemic. Group identities are critical for understanding who is influenced by whom, as well as how partisan divisions can obstruct cohesive and coordinated action. We identify several questions highlighted by the pandemic, including when people will react more harshly to ingroup members who violate health-protective norms (black sheep effect) or to outgroup members violating the same norms (intergroup hypocrisy). As a working hypothesis, we propose a goal-based approach, positing that differentially negative reactions to ingroup and outgroup deviants are likely influenced by the relative salience of goals to protect ingroup image, enforce group norms, maintain intergroup boundaries, and seek justice for potential victims put at risk by norm-violating behavior.

We unveil the influence of these factors? on climate change beliefs in a large American city facing substantial climate change impacts, Phoenix, Arizona. Using the Phoenix Area Social Survey that includes data collected from (n = 806) households across fourteen cities in the Phoenix metropolitan area, we investigate what factors influence a belief that ?global warming and climate change are already occurring.? Engaging adaptive capacity and justice literatures with climate belief models, we find that belief in climate change and global warming is positively associated with race specifically other than non-Hispanic Whites, high levels of education, personal experience with heat-related illnesses, and liberal beliefs. Widespread agreement about climate change is found within the scientific community, but general populations, especially in the USA, lag behind in accepting climate change. Critically, there are important justice dimensions absent in the existing literature relevant to understanding belief in and the impacts of climate change. Unpacking these factors could help inform policy makers and civil society organizations in their efforts to design more ?just adaptation? strategies.

The aim of the Better Cardiac Care Data Linkage project is to describe patient care pathways and to identify disparities in care and health outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Queensland residents diagnosed with CVD in the state of Queensland. Methods This is a population-based retrospective cohort study using linked regional, state and national health and administrative data collections to describe disparities in CVD healthcare in primary and secondary prevention settings and during hospitalisation. The CVD cohort will be identified from the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection for admissions that occurred between 1 July 2010 and 31 June 2016 and will include relevant International Classification of Disease codes for ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Person-level data will be linked by Data Linkage Queensland and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) in accordance with ethical and public health approvals to describe the patient journey prior to, during and post the hospital admission. Analysis This project will focus largely on descriptive epidemiological measures and multivariate analysis of clinical care standards and outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared with other Queenslanders, including identification of risk factors for suboptimal care and change over time. Variation in care pathways and patient outcomes will be compared by Indigenous status, sex, age group, remoteness of residence, year of index hospitalisation and socioeconomic status. Cox models for time-to-event data and mixed models or generalised estimating equations for longitudinal data will be used to measure change over time where temporal effects exist. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by Human Research Ethics Committees of the Prince Charles Hospital (HREC/15/QPCH/289) and the AIHW (EO2016-1-233). The Northern Territory Department of Health and Menzies School of Health Research have also provided reciprocal ethical approval of the project (HREC 2019-3490). The deidentified results will be summarised in a report and shared with investigators, advisory groups, Queensland Health and key stakeholders. Findings will be disseminated through workshops, conferences and will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

The results show using the spillover index of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) time-varying asymmetry spillovers among commodity and the ten sectors. Industrials and consumer discretionary sectors are the largest contributor and receiver of spillovers in the system. In addition, basic materials sector is a net contributor of spillovers whereas oil futures, gold futures and the remaining sectors are net receiver of spillovers. Furthermore, the bad return spillovers dominate the good return spillovers. The asymmetry spillovers are influenced by the global financial and European crises (GFC & ESDC), oil price crash and global health crisis (COVID-19 outbreak). Equity investors benefit from adding gold and oil to their individual equity markets. Moreover, the hedging is sensitive to the GFC & ESDC, oil price crash, and COVID-19 outbreak. Finally, the highest hedging effectiveness occurs during COVID-19 spread for the case of oil futures. The result is similar for gold under only good spillovers and it is highest during recovery period under bad spillovers. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: The global, regional, and national gender-specific prevalence and DALYs caused by epilepsy by year and age were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2017. The Gini coefficient and concentration index (CI) were calculated to demonstrate the trends in between-country inequality in the epilepsy burden from 1990 to 2017. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, Pearson correlation, and linear regression analyses were performed to analyze the association of gender disparity in epilepsy and socio-demographic index (SDI). Results: The DALYs number of epilepsies increased from 1990 to 2017 by 13.8%, whereas age-standardized DALY rates showed a substantial reduction (16.1%). Men had a higher epilepsy burden than women of the same period. The epilepsy burden appeared to be higher in countries with lower socioeconomic development (CI < 0). The Gini coefficient decreased from 0.273 in 1995 to 0.259 in 2017, representing a decline in the between-country gap. Age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates of men were higher than those of women in each SDI-based country group (p < 0.0001). Male-minus-female difference (r = -0.5100, p < 0.0001) and male-to-female ratio (r = -0.3087, p < 0.0001) of age-standardized DALY rates were negatively correlated with SDI. Conclusion: Although global health care of epilepsy is in progress, the epilepsy burden was concentrated in males and developing countries. Our findings highlight the importance of formulating gender-sensitive health policies and providing more services in developing countries.

There is a vast epilepsy treatment gap in China, mainly driven by deficiencies in health-care delivery and social discrimination resulting from cultural beliefs about epilepsy. WHO's Global Campaign Against Epilepsy project in China showed that it was possible to treat epilepsy in primary care settings, which was a notable milestone. The China Association Against Epilepsy has been a necessary force to stimulate interest in epilepsy care and research by the medical and scientific community. Nearly 20 different anti-seizure medications are now available in China. Non-pharmacological options are also available, but there are still unmet needs for epilepsy management. The Chinese epilepsy research portfolio is varied, but the areas in which there are the most concentrated focus and expertise are epidemiology and clinical research. The challenges for further improvement in delivering care for people with epilepsy in China are primarily related to public health and reducing inequalities within this vast country.

Perception of Unmet Need after Seeking Treatment for a Past Year Major Depressive Episode: Results from the 2018 National Survey of Drug Use and Health	PSYCHIATRIC QUARTERLY			English	Article						Unmet treatment need; Major depressive episode; National survey of drug use and health; Treatment bias; Health disparities	MENTAL-HEALTH; HELP-SEEKING; ADULTS; CARE; DISORDER; BARRIERS; INDIVIDUALS; DISPARITIES; ANXIETY; ASSOCIATIONS	Depression, a leading cause of disability and mortality world-wide that one in five U.S. adults are estimated to experience in their lifetime, presents special complications in treatment. While it is well-recognized that there are several barriers to even obtaining treatment for depression, once an individual obtains treatment they may not receive the type of care that they need. In order to examine common factors of those who experienced an unmet treatment need for depression despite seeking mental health treatment, we examined data from the 2018 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). We cross-sectionally compared two groups of individuals who both met criteria for a past year Major Depressive Episode (MDE) and sought mental health treatment, however one group reported an unmet treatment need and the other did not. Results indicate a variety of personal identity and social factors associated with perceiving an unmet treatment need, including age, race/ethnicity, sexual attraction, marital status, poverty level, health insurance, substance misuse, global health, and role impairment. This study contributes to the literature by providing further support for disparities in depression treatment at the consumer, provider, and systemic levels that have downstream effects for health equity policy and public health promotion.

The response to ESKD, particularly regarding kidney replacement therapy (KRT), depends on local disease burden, culture, and socioeconomics. Here, we explore geographic variation and global trends in ESKD incidence and prevalence and examine variations in KRT modality, practice patterns, and mortality. We conclude with a discussion on disparities in access to KRT and strategies to reduce ESKD global burden and to improve access to treatment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Summary: From 2003 to 2016, incidence rates of treated ESKD were relatively stable in many higher income countries but rose substantially predominantly in East and Southeast Asia. The prevalence of treated ESKD has increased worldwide, likely due to improving ESKD survival, population demographic shifts, higher prevalence of ESKD risk factors, and increasing KRT access in countries with growing economies. Unadjusted 5-year survival of ESKD patients on KRT was 41% in the USA, 48% in Europe, and 60% in Japan. Dialysis is the predominant KRT in most countries, with hemodialysis being the most common modality. Variations in dialysis practice patterns account for some of the differences in survival outcomes globally. Worldwide, there is a greater prevalence of KRT at higher income levels, and the number of people who die prematurely because of lack of KRT access is estimated at up to 3 times higher than the number who receive treatment. Key Messages: Many people worldwide in need of KRT as a life-sustaining treatment do not receive it, mostly in LMICs where health care resources are severely limited. This large treatment gap demands a focus on population-based prevention strategies and development of affordable and cost-effective KRT. Achieving global equity in KRT access will require concerted efforts in advocating effective public policy, health care delivery, workforce capacity, education, research, and support from the government, private sector, nongovernmental, and professional organizations.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has led implementation of the HEARTS in the Americas Initiative since 2016. The authors mapped the developmental stages, barriers, and facilitators to implementation among the 371 primary health care centers in the participating 12 countries. The authors used the qualitative method of document review to examine cumulative country reports, technical meeting notes, and reports to regional stakeholders. Common implementation barriers include segmentation of health systems, overcoming health care professionals' scope of practice legal restrictions, and lack of health information systems limiting operational evaluation and quality improvement mechanisms. Main implementation facilitators include political support from ministries of health and leading scientific societies, PAHO's role as a regional catalyst to implementation, stakeholder endorsement demonstrated by incorporating HEARTS into official documents, and having a health system oriented to primary health care. Key lessons include the need for political commitment and cultivating on-the-ground leadership to initiate a shift in hypertension care delivery, accompanied by specific progress in the development of standardized treatment protocols and a set of high-quality medicines. By systematizing an implementation strategy to ease integration of interventions into delivery processes, the program strengthened technical leadership and ensured sustainability. These study findings will aid the regional approach by providing a staged planning model that incorporates lessons learned. A systematic approach to implementation will enhance equity, efficiency, scale-up, and sustainability, and ultimately improve population hypertension control.

In this rapid review, we examine community-engaged responses that move beyond risk communication and instead meaningfully integrate communities into decision-making and multi-sectoral action on various dimensions of the response to COVID-19. Based on a rapid, global review of 42 case studies of diverse forms of substantive community engagement in response to COVID-19, this paper identifies promising models of effective community-engaged responses and highlights the factors enabling or disabling these responses. The paper reflects on the ways in which these community-engaged responses contribute to comprehensive approaches and address social determinants and rights, within dynamics of relational power and inequality, and how they are sometimes able to take advantage of the ruptures and uncertainties of a new pandemic to refashion some of these dynamics.

The present study has attempted to present and compare the regional pattern of deprivation in rural India by formulating a simple summary index of multidimensional deprivation (IMD) at the district level using global principal component analysis (PCA) and a Geographically Weighted Principal Component Analysis (GWPCA). The results of the study show that the east-central heartland of India is the most deprived region. On the contrary, the north and south India are in a much better position compared to the other part of the country. The results of the spatial autocorrelation of multidimensional deprivation (Global Moran?s I = 0.748) indicates that there is a statistically significant pattern of spatial clustering that includes four distinct categories (High High, Low-Low, High-Low, and Low-High). The LISA map shows that 151 districts belong to High-High (deprivation hotspots) and 108 districts come under the Low-Low cluster (deprivation cold spots). High-High cluster group spreads along with the ecologically sensitive areas like the Bastar region, Tarai tract, Chotonagpur region, and Dandakaranya region which are dominated by tribal populations.

A cross-sectional study was carried out on 3029 Mexican schoolchildren. A questionnaire was administered to caregivers to determine sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral variables. The dependent variable was prevalence of PATF, coded as 0 = without PATF and 1 = with PATF, at any point in life, and separately, in the previous year. Various indicators of socioeconomic position were included. Logistic regression was used in the final multivariate analysis. The prevalence of PATF any time in life was 33.8%, while in the previous year it was 11.4%. The variables associated (p < 0.05) with PATF any time in life were child's older age (OR = 1.12), older age when tooth brushing started (OR = 1.57), higher brushing frequency (OR = 1.60), having health insurance [public (OR = 1.61) or private (OR = 1.45)], if family owned a car (OR = 1.29) and better socioeconomic position [parents' education, second (OR = 1.48) and third (OR = 1.75) tertile]. For PATF in the previous year, the variables associated were older age of mother (OR = 1.03), older age when tooth brushing started (OR = 1.99), higher brushing frequency (OR = 1.68), having health insurance [public (OR = 1.62)] and better socioeconomic position (parents' education, second (OR = 1.57) and third (OR = 1.97) tertile). This study suggests the existence of socioeconomic inequalities in PATF, manifested through socioeconomic position, access to health insurance and household having a car. Identifying and addressing PATF inequalities would improve oral health in the child population.

J	Boeing, G				Boeing, Geoff			Street Network Models and Indicators for Every Urban Area in the World	GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article							QUALITY ASSESSMENT; OPENSTREETMAP; INFORMATION	Cities worldwide exhibit a variety of street network patterns and configurations that shape human mobility, equity, health, and livelihoods. This study models and analyzes the street networks of every urban area in the world, using boundaries derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer. Street network data are acquired and modeled from OpenStreetMap with the open-source OSMnx software. In total, this study models over 160 million OpenStreetMap street network nodes and over 320 million edges across 8,914 urban areas in 178 countries, and attaches elevation and grade data. This article presents the study's reproducible computational workflow, introduces two new open data repositories of ready-to-use global street network models and calculated indicators, and discusses summary findings on street network form worldwide. It makes four contributions. First, it reports the methodological advances of this open-source workflow. Second, it produces an open data repository containing street network models for each urban area. Third, it analyzes these models to produce an open data repository containing street network form indicators for each urban area. No such global urban street network indicator data set has previously existed. Fourth, it presents a summary analysis of urban street network form, reporting the first such worldwide results in the literature.

Contemporary perspectives in COPD: Patient burden, the role of gender and trajectories of multimorbidity	RESPIROLOGY			English	Review						frailty; inequality; patient perspective; patient&#8208; reported outcome measure; symptoms	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BLOOD-PRESSURE TRAJECTORIES; ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY; BODY-MASS INDEX; LUNG-FUNCTION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CHRONIC-BRONCHITIS; PRIMARY-CARE; DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS	An individual's experience of COPD is determined by many factors in addition to the pathological features of chronic bronchitis and emphysema and the symptoms that derive directly from them. Multimorbidity is the norm rather than the exception, so most people with COPD are living with a range of other medical problems which can decrease overall quality of life. COPD is caused by the inhalation of noxious particles or gases, in particular tobacco smoke, but also by early life disadvantage impairing lung development and by occupations where inhaled exposures are common (e.g. industrial, farming and cleaning work). Wealthy people are therefore relatively protected from developing COPD and people who do develop the condition may have reduced resources to cope. COPD is also no longer a condition that predominantly affects men. The prevalence of COPD among women has equalled that of men since 2008 in many high-income countries, due to increased exposure to tobacco, and in low-income countries due to biomass fuels. COPD is one of the leading causes of death in women in the USA, and death rates attributed to COPD in women in some countries are predicted to overtake those of men in the next decade. Many factors contribute to this phenomenon, but in addition to socioeconomic and occupational factors, there is increasing evidence of a higher susceptibility of females to smoking and pollutants. Quality of life is also more significantly impaired in women. Although most medications (bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids) used to treat COPD demonstrate similar trends for exacerbation prevention and lung function improvement in men and women, this is an understudied area and clinical trials frequently have a preponderance of males. A better understanding of gender-based predictors of efficacy of all therapeutic interventions is crucial for comprehensive patient care. There is an urgent need to recognize the increasing burden of COPD in women and to facilitate global improvements in disease prevention and management in this specific population. Many individuals with COPD follow a trajectory of both lung function decline and also multimorbidity. Unfavourable lung function trajectories throughout life have implications for later development of other chronic diseases. An enhanced understanding of the temporal associations underlying the development of coexisting diseases is a crucial first step in unravelling potential common disease pathways. Lessons can be learned from exploring disease trajectories of other NCD as well as multimorbidity development. Further research will be essential to explain how early life risk factors commonly influence trajectories of COPD and other diseases, how different diseases develop in relation to each other in a temporal way and how this ultimately leads to different multimorbidity patterns in COPD. This review integrates new knowledge and ideas pertaining to three broad themes (i) the overall burden of disease in COPD, (ii) an unappreciated high burden in women and (iii) the contrast of COPD trajectories and different multimorbidity patterns with trajectories of other NCD. The underlying pathology of COPD is largely irreversible, but many factors noted in the review are potentially amenable to intervention. Health and social care systems need to ensure that effective treatment is accessible to all people with the condition. Preventive strategies and treatments that alter the course of disease are crucial, particularly for patients with COPD as one of many problems.

Cuba's cardiovascular risk factors: International comparison of levels and education gradients	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background Cuba's life expectancy at 79 is third highest in Latin America. Many attribute this to social investments in health and education, but comparative research is sparse, thus we compare Cuba with neighboring Dominican Republic, Costa Rica due to its strong social protections, and the U.S. Given high cardiovascular mortality, we focus on cardiovascular risk factor levels. To assess the role of health care, we distinguish medically amenable biomarkers from behavioral risk factors. To assess the role of Cuba's focus on equity, we compare education gradients in risk factors. Methods We analyze Cuban data from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group baseline survey of urban adults ages 65 plus. Comparison samples are drawn from the Dominican Republic 10/66 survey, the Costa Rican CRELES, and U.S. NHANES. We analyze cross-country levels and education gradients of medically amenable (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, access to health care) and behavioral (smoking, obesity) risk factors,-using sexstratified weighted means comparisons and age-adjusted logistic regression. Results Neither medically amenable nor behavioral risk factors are uniformly better in Cuba than comparison countries. Obesity is lower in Cuba, but male smoking is higher. Hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia levels are high in all countries, though Cuba's are lower than Costa Rica. Hypertension awareness in Cuba is similar to Costa Rica. Cuba has a higher proportion of hypertensives on treatment than Costa Rica, though lower than the U. S. Comparative gradients by education are similarly mixed. For behavioral factors, Cuba shows the strongest gradients (primarily for men) among the countries compared: smoking improves, but obesity worsens with education. Hypertension awareness also improves with education in Cuba, but Cuba shows no significant differences by education in hypertension treatment. Conclusion Smoking is comparatively high in Cuba, but obesity is low, and the resulting biomarkers show comparatively mixed patterns. Cuba's social protections have not eliminated strong educational gradients in behavioral risk factors, but the healthcare system appears to have eliminated disparities such as in hypertension treatment.

However, measures to address the current pandemic, specifically the relevant interventions proposing physical distancing, have highlighted how social determinants affect contagion and mortality dynamics of COVID-19. For the most part, these social determinants are not present in either policy discussions or in epidemiological models. We argue for the importance of incorporating social determinants of health into the modelling dynamics of COVID-19, and show how global variation of these conditions may be integrated into relevant models. In doing so, we also highlight a key political economy aspect of reproduction dynamics in epidemics.

J	Bond, E; Tyrrell, K				Bond, Emma; Tyrrell, Katie			Understanding Revenge Pornography: A National Survey of Police Officers and Staff in England and Wales	JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE			English	Article						Internet and abuse; domestic violence; dating violence; mental health and violence		Online abuse, facilitated via social media and mobile technologies, has recently attracted considerable academic attention. The nonconsensual sharing of intimate images-revenge pornography-can have a devastating effect on victims, is a global problem, and constitutes interpersonal violence. The national helpline in the United Kingdom has now received over 7,000 calls. In the United Kingdom, new legislation making revenge pornography a crime was introduced in 2014, yet the police do not always respond appropriately to victims. This article presents the findings of a national online survey of police understanding of revenge pornography, undertaken in the United Kingdom in March 2017. The study set out to investigate police knowledge of revenge pornography legislation, their confidence in responding to cases of revenge pornography, and what level of training they had received. A total of 783 members of the police force responded to the survey and, to the authors' knowledge, this the first study to seek to quantify the understanding of revenge pornography by police officers and staff in England and Wales. The findings suggest that the police in the United Kingdom have a limited understanding of revenge pornography legislation and lack confidence both in investigating cases and in effectively responding to victims. The implications of the study demonstrate that there is an urgent need for training across police forces to ensure that cases of revenge pornography are appropriately responded to, victims are safeguarded, and offenders brought to justice.

In this article, we focus on revealing the burden of violence in girls and young women and its implications for public policy. This study presents the subnational analysis of Mexico from the Global Burden of Disease study (1990-2015). The global study harmonized information of 195 countries and 79 risk factors. The study analyzed the deaths, years of life lost to premature death (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and the healthy years of life lost or disability-adjusted life year (DALY) related to violence. Nationwide, violence in young women accounts for 7% of all deaths in the 10 to 29 years age group and arises as the second most important cause of death in all age groups, except 10 to 14 years old, where it stands in the seventh position from 1990 to 2015. The health losses and social impact related to violence in young women demands firm actions by the government and society. It is urgent for health institutions to focus on the health of girls and young women because gender inequities have an enormous effect on their lives. Girls and women are nearly universally less powerful, less privileged, and have fewer opportunities than men.

Economic growth as an underlying probable systemic driver for childhood obesity in South Africa: A Joinpoint regression and ecological analysis over 10 years	SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; NUTRITION TRANSITION; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; RISK-FACTORS; OVERWEIGHT; ADOLESCENTS; HEALTH	Background. Childhood obesity has become a global public health problem and is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction and various cancers in later adulthood. Associations between adult obesity and economic growth, technological changes, socioeconomic status and economic inequities have been reported, but limited data are available for children and adolescents in countries that are undergoing an epidemiological health transition exhibiting both under-and overnutrition. Objectives. To demonstrate childhood obesity trends and explore their associations with economic growth in South Africa (SA). Methods. This was a retrospective review and analysis of obesity and economic growth trends in SA. Data for obesity levels were obtained from national surveys conducted in SA youths in 2002, 2008 and 2012. Economic growth indicators (EGIs), namely gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, household final consumption expenditure and Gini coefficient, were obtained from the World Bank and IHS Global Insight databases. Obesity trends for 2002 2012 are presented by gender and ethnicity. Annual percentage changes (APCs) in obesity prevalence were computed to assess obesity trends using the linear Joinpoint regression. Results. An overall increase in obesity prevalence over time from 3.8% to 6.0% was observed. Females had higher levels across all time points. APCs in both males (7.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3 15.9; p=0.01) and females (3.1%; 95% CI -14.7 24.7; p=0.30) were observed. Among black Africans, coloureds and whites, females had higher obesity levels than males for the three time points. For males, the prevalence of obesity was highest in whites and Asians/Indians, whereas coloureds and blacks had lower levels across all time points. However, the black male population had the highest APC increase (9.4%; 95% CI -23.0 55.3; p=0.20). The prevalence of obesity was positively and inversely associated with GDP per capita and the Gini coefficient, respectively. Conclusions. An increase in childhood and adolescent obesity over time was observed, while trend associations between obesity and EGIs exist.	[Pisa, P.

J	Lahoti, S; Dixit, P				Lahoti, Supriya; Dixit, Priyanka			Declining trend of smoking and smokeless tobacco in India: A decomposition analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PREVALENCE; CONSUMPTION; PATTERNS; WOMEN	There has been a relative reduction of tobacco consumption between Global Adult Tobacco Survey-India (GATS-India) 2009-10 and GATS-India 2016-17. However, in terms of absolute numbers, India still has the highest number of tobacco consumers. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the socioeconomic correlates and delineate the factors contributing to a change in smoking and smokeless tobacco use from GATS (2009-10) to GATS (2016-17) in India. We used multivariable binary logistic regressions to examine the demographic and socioeconomic correlates of smoking and smokeless tobacco use for both the rounds of the survey. Further decomposition analysis has been applied to examine the specific contribution of factors in the decline of tobacco consumption over a period from 2009 to 2016. Results indicated that the propensity component was primarily responsible for major tobacco consumption decline (smoking- 41%, smokeless tobacco use- 81%). Most of the decrease in propensity to smoke has been explained by residential type and occupation of the respondent. Age of the respondent contribute significantly in reducing the prevalence of smokeless tobacco consumption during the seven-year period, regardless of change in the composition of population. To achieve the National Health Policy, 2017 aim of reducing tobacco use up to 15% by 2020 and up to 30% by 2025, targeted policies and interventions addressing the inequalities identified in this study, must be developed and implemented.

Because there is no clear division of labour between the gender-based violence and child protection sectors, adolescent girls are often neglected by both groups, and violence against this subpopulation goes unaddressed. This Review presents an adapted ecological framework for gender-based violence risks facing adolescent girls in emergencies, synthesises the scant evidence for gender-based violence prevention and response, and identifies barriers to effective and ethical measurement and evaluation of programme effectiveness. Although nascent evidence highlights promising interventions for transforming girls' attitudes about violence and gender inequity and improving psychosocial and mental wellbeing, little evidence supports the ability of existing approaches to reduce gender-based violence incidence. A more explicit focus on adolescent girls is needed when designing and evaluating interventions to ensure global efforts to end gender-based violence are inclusive of this population.

The herbal remedy was described as a gift to help African countries in need. Drawing on preliminary data in English and Kiswahili from unstructured participant observation, social and legacy media available online and shared through contact channels, and ongoing conversations, we explore the Tanzanian policy response to COVID-19. What can the exemplary case of Covid-Organics in Tanzania help us to understand about South-South humanitarian assistance (SSHA) in times of crisis? We suggest that Covid-Organics has enabled the government to project a link to latent debates about Pan-Africanism and Julius Nyerere's legacy and Madagascar's SSHA has provided an opportunity for a public reflection on Africa's place in the world. For some, the remedy's 'Africanness' is its comparative advantage, even promising a continental renaissance. For others, the lack of scientific evidence or approval by global health authorities like WHO is delegitimizing. These findings suggest that receivers of SSHA make sense of it in both a broad, post-colonial discursive context and in a specific context of local contestation. If the promise of this particular form of aid is its ability to transcend deep divisions between North and South, the case of Covid-Organics suggests that SSHA draws on deep ideologies of Pan-Africanism; is increasingly important in crises that are global; and like other forms of humanitarianism, reflects elite politics and priorities rather than prioritizing the distribution of humanitarian goods and decreasing inequality.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of hypertension and comorbidities in older people and to describe differences between patients from rural and urban areas in China. METHODS A cross-sectional study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) was conducted from 2007 to 2010 across 8 provinces in China. The current study included a nationally representative subsample of 7,403 respondents aged 60 years and above. Hypertension was either selfreported diagnosed hypertension or 1 elevated measured blood pressure measurement (>= 140/90 mm Hg). Comorbidities were self-reported and included angina, arthritis, asthma, stroke, diabetes, depression, and chronic lung disease. RESULTS The prevalence of hypertension was 66.1%. Hypertension associated with 1 comorbidity was recorded in 35.9% of all participants. A large majority (73.6%) of participants with hypertension reported "good" or "very good" general health status. The prevalence of hypertension and the number of comorbidities increased with age. The prevalence rates of multiple comorbidities were higher for urban participants than their rural counterparts (27.8 vs. 42.4% for 1 morbidity; 7.7 vs. 16.4% for 2 comorbidities; 1.4 vs. 4.7% for 3 comorbidities; 0.4 vs. 1.2% for >= 4 comorbidities) after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. However, urban participants reported better general health status, irrespective of the number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Our study implies that health promotion policies targeting older people should be developed. Rural areas should be a priority, and investment in the quality of health care in rural areas is urgently needed.

Methods: Searches were conducted between 2000 and 2019 in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and HTA. Included studies compared the CSII vs MDI in children and young people (CYP) <= 20 years with type 1 diabetes. Two independent reviewers screened the articles, extracted the data, assessed the risk of bias, evaluated the quality of evidence, and identified equity data. Results were pooled with a random-effects model. Results: Of the 578 articles screened, 16 RCT (545 CYP on CSII) and 70 NRS (73253 on CSII) were included in the meta-analysis. There was moderate-level evidence that the CSII lower HbA(1c) in RCT (pooled mean difference [MD]: -0.22%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.33, -0.11%; I-2:34%) and insufficient in NRS (pooled MD: -0.45%; 95%CI: -0.52, -0.38%; I-2:99%). The pooled incidence rate ratio of severe hypoglycemia on CSII vs MDI in RCT was 0.87 (95%CI: 0.55, 1.37; I-2:0%; low-level evidence), and 0.71 (95%CI: 0.63, 0.81; I-2:57%, insufficient evidence) in NRS. Health-related quality of life presented insufficient evidence. Equity data were scarcely reported. Conclusions: CSII modestly lower HbA(1c) when compared with MDI. Current literature does not provide adequate data on other glycemic outcomes. Future assessment on diabetes technology should include individual and area-level socioeconomic data.

The existence of multiple sets of principles poses a challenge for those seeking to critically engage with and develop their practice. Which of these is best to use, and why? To what extent, if any, is there agreement across proposed principles? Objective: The objectives of this review were to: (1) identify and consolidate existing documents and principles to guide global health research partnerships; (2) identify areas of overlapping consensus, if any, regarding which principles are fundamental in these partnerships; (3) identify any lack of consensus in the literature on core principles to support these partnerships. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to gather documents outlining 'principles' of good global health research partnerships. A broad search of academic databases to gather peerreviewed literature was conducted, complemented by a hand-search of key global health funding institutions for grey literature guidelines. Results: Our search yielded nine sets of principles designed to guide and support global health research partnerships. No single principle recurred across all documents reviewed. Most frequently cited were concerns with mutual benefits between partners (n = 6) and equity (n = 4). Despite a lack of consistency in the inclusion and definition of principles, all sources highlighted principles that identified attention to fairness, equity, or justice as an integral part of good global health research partnerships. Conclusions: Lack of consensus regarding how principles are defined suggests a need for further discussion on what global health researchers mean by 'core' principles. Research partnerships should seek to interpret the practical meanings and requirements of these principles through international consultation. Finally, a need exists for tools to assist with implementation of these principles to ensure their application in research practice.

Objective: To provide a comprehensive overview of current pedagogical practices and educational paradigms used by occupational therapy educators to teach concepts of, and skills for, equity and diversity. Data Sources: Seven education and health care databases were searched for articles published between 2007 and 2018. Study Selection and Data Collection: Consensually developed criteria were refined until an agreement rate of >80% was achieved among the authors. Inclusion criteria focused on entry-level occupational therapy education across the world and explicitly examined approaches to teaching diversity. All articles meeting the criteria were kept for full-text review (N = 87). Findings: Diversity in professional occupational therapy education programs is taught within five main underlying educational paradigms and theories: competency-based (44%), social justice (29%), critical (11%), social accountability (10%), and constructivism (6%). Within these paradigms, 14 key pedagogical practices were applied, with community service learning (37%), international service learning (25%), and didactic or course-based practices (23%) making up the majority of pedagogical practices. Conclusions and Relevance: Although current occupational therapy research demonstrates a trend toward critical paradigms and practices, problematic cultural competency theories and uncritical international service learning practices continue to dominate occupational therapy education for diversity. Educators should implement pedagogies and approaches within critical educational paradigms. What This Article Adds: This article highlights the importance to occupational therapy education of attending to coherence across educational ethics, paradigms, and learning outcomes in teaching for diversity and health equity.

The so-called Nordic Paradox, the apparently contradictory co-existence of high levels of IPVAW and of gender equality in Nordic countries, has not been adequately explained. This study explores discussions about how this apparent paradox can be understood among 30 IPVAW professionals working in southern Sweden, through a thematic analysis of focus groups and individual and paired interviews. The analysis highlights complexities of gender (in)equality and its links with IPVAW in Sweden, of relevance for the addressing and prevention of IPVAW.

JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES			English	Article						Self-rated health; self-rated anxiety; gender gap; working conditions; odds ratio		This study analyses the differences in self-rated health (SRH) and self-rated anxiety (SRA) among the countries of the Euro-Area through the European Working Conditions Survey (2015). The article, thus, proposes a grouping of countries based on the Global Gender Gap Index, developed by the World Economic Forum, to justify differences in SRH and SRA. The descriptive analysis demonstrates remarkable differences among countries. The gender response pattern is also different. The estimates, made using the odds ratio method, reveal that women are more likely to report higher anxiety than poor health (56% vs 25%). The estimates show that in those countries where the situation of women compares unfavourably to that of men, the probability of women reporting poorer health status is higher. The situation with SRA, however, is different. In those countries with greater economic and political equality, the probability of women suffering anxiety increases. It is feasible that economic gender equality, which often results in greater incorporation of women in the labour market, could negatively affect SRA if women assume increased workloads and responsibility while maintaining the tasks associated with caring for home and family.

The aim was to construct a critical, active, and participatory citizenship. The method used has been the pedagogical hermeneutic in which the qualitative analysis of data was preceded by a process of child participation which allowed the analysis of the opinions of 6867 children and adolescents from 22 countries and 3 continents. The results present the children's thinking about the closure of schools, the alternative teaching carried out, the role of teachers and families, and on the return of the "new school" with the health protocols. This work provides the children's view on the measures of social distancing and massive school closures. However, without doubt, it also shows children's and adolescents' potential to empower themselves in complex situations which put the world's schools in an unprecedented crisis. In addition, it shows the opportunity to take into consideration a joint construction of a society from the germ of its citizenship: children.

J	Crawford, CA				Crawford, Claire Antonia			Studying social workers' roles in natural disasters during a global pandemic: What can we learn?	QUALITATIVE SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						Disasters; emergency social work; social justice; health; social work practice; participant observation		The author reflects on the convergence of her roles as a qualitative researcher studying social workers' roles during Hurricane Harvey, a student of public health, and a hospital social worker in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarities are drawn between the social work role following a natural disaster and a pandemic disaster along with observations regarding core differences. Practice and research recommendations are provided for social workers in the domains of therapeutic interactions, social justice, and public health. While therapeutic relationships have often been far more difficult to achieve during the pandemic than Hurricane Harvey, the assistance of technology and proper personal protective equipment has been helpful in filling communication gaps. Both types of disasters are universal in their reach, impacting people of all backgrounds; the social work role has been to address differences in access to resources, including health care and financial assistance. Finally, social workers play a significant role in public health during disasters through disseminating reliable information about safety, resources, and opportunities to assist others. The author recommends the expansion of social work in the public health space to provide more insight about communicating with vulnerable populations during disasters.

J	Jemal, A				Jemal, Alexis			Liberation-based social work theory in progress: Time to practice what I teach	QUALITATIVE SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						Liberation; education; pandemic; social work; white supremacy		Social work education integrates theory and practice to bridge the micro-macro divide. The theoretical framework of intersecting identities reveals hidden inequities related to health consequences. The global pandemic, reflecting a colliding of personal and professional worlds, interrupted an elective social work course designed to: 1) develop transformative potential (i.e., critical consciousness of and critical action against white supremacy, anti-blackness, and racial oppression of Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC)); 2) model liberation-based social work education and practice; and 3) prepare students to be critical social workers in the field. The pandemic created an in-class opportunity for the professor, also the course's designer, to practice what she teaches. This self-reflexive essay details the pandemic's impact on a teaching experience and follows the professor's journey to more fully understand systems, inequity, and her own transformative potential. The transformative potential development process included many learning experiences in the areas of relationship and community building; transformative consciousness development; accountability and responsibility; efficacy; and, critical action. The unforeseen global pandemic presented the professor with opportunities for deep reflection about liberation-based social work education and practice. By bringing the reality of how macro processes create micro consequences into the classroom in real time, the professor's responses were tested against oppressive norms, standards and values versus those that honor a person's humanity. An important discovery is that a critical social work educator teaches in ways that spark radical imagination to disrupt the oppressive status quo camouflaged as personal choice and business as usual.

J	Hutchison, J				Hutchison, Jessica			Applying feminist principles to social work teaching: Pandemic times and beyond	QUALITATIVE SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						Pedagogy; feminism; social work education; social justice		It took a global pandemic for me to recognize how my social work teaching was an act of feminist praxis. I have long identified as a feminist and regularly engage efforts to advance equity for women, primarily centered on the abolition of prisons which disproportionately incarcerate Indigenous and Black women in Canada. Surprisingly, I have never considered how my feminism shows up in my teaching. The following reflexive essay explores the ways in which the feminist principles of centring emotions, rejecting patriarchal hierarchy, and challenging white feminism were embedded into the development and delivery of a graduate level social work research course that was rapidly adapted to being taught online during a global public health crisis. It ends with a call to action for social work educators to incorporate feminist principles into their pedagogies, not only in times of crisis, but as standard practice.

Actions aimed towards the optimised use of antibiotics should be implemented on equal terms and according to the needs of the population. Previous research results on differences in antibiotic use between socio-economic and demographic groups in Sweden are not entirely coherent, and have typically focused on the effects of singular socio-economic variables. Using an intersectional approach, this study provides a more precise analysis of how the dispensation of antibiotic medication was distributed across socio-economic and demographic groups in Sweden in 2016-2017. Methods: Using register data from a nationwide cohort and adopting an intersectional analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy, we map the dispensation of antibiotics according to age, sex, country of birth and income. Results: While women and high-income earners had the highest antibiotic dispensation prevalence, no large differences in the dispensation of antibiotics were identified between socio-economic groups. Conclusions: Public-health interventions aiming to support the reduced and optimised use of antibiotics should be directed towards the whole Swedish population rather than towards specific groups. Correspondingly, an increased focus on socio-economic or demographic factors is not warranted in interventions aimed at improving antibiotic prescription patterns among medical practitioners.

J	Heller, C				Heller, Charles			De-confining borders: towards a politics of freedom of movement in the time of the pandemic	MOBILITIES			English	Article						Migration; mobility; borders; virus; human rights; freedom of movement; air travel; climate change	MIGRATION; TRAVEL	This article, primarily focused on Europe, charts some of the momentous transformations in bordering practices, migration and global mobility that have been sparked by the new coronavirus pandemic. In a first part it argues that since the onset of the pandemic, the enduring 'global mobility apartheid' which uses citizenship and visa restrictions to police the differential access to mobility founded on race and class, has been supplemented by a fluctuating 'sanitary apartheid', seeking to separate populations designated as at risk of Covid-19 infection from those designated as Covid-free. While these logics are distinct, where states have conflated them, we have seen eruptive and mutating border violence. In a second more normative part the article seeks to rethink the demand for freedom of movement in the context of the pandemic, arguing that allowing migrants who today are illegalised to move in safe and legal ways is also the condition to implement sanitary measures to protect the health of migrants and sedentary populations alike. Adopting a mobility justice approach, the article also argues that the excessive mobility of the privileged through air travel that has been a major factor in spreading the virus and contributes to ecological destruction should be limited. Ultimately this article calls for re-thinking the politics of (im)mobility in the context of the pandemic as part of the process of transformation towards a more just and sustainable world.

Mental Health and Community-Based Rehabilitation: A Qualitative Description of the Experiences and Perspectives of Service Users and Carers in Bangladesh	COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article						CBR; Mental health; Qualitative research; Bangladesh		Since 2016, Promotion of Human Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Bangladesh (PHRPB) has been working to include people with psychosocial disabilities in their community-based inclusive development work, and to increase access to formal mental health care. Field visits were carried out to PHRPBD catchment areas in Dhaka and Chittagong for a case study on the integration of mental health into community-based rehabilitation (CBR). This paper synthesizes the results of twenty-five semi-structured interviews carried out as part of the case study. Participants included people with psychosocial disabilities, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy or other cognitive impairments and their carers as needed. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated from Bangla to English, then hand-coded for content analysis. Results were organized into five overarching categories: (1) explanatory models, (2) help-seeking behaviors, (3) impact of services, (4) challenges and barriers to improving mental health, (5) recommendations of users and carers. Respondents either had no explanation for why service users had become unwell or attributed it to physically and/or emotionally traumatic events or supernatural causes. Before attending PHRPBD's mental health services, most had visited formal or informal health care providers, often with disappointing results. Despite positive feedback on PHRPBD's services, participants identified ongoing challenges. Stigma, discrimination and human rights abuses persist and are compounded by issues of gender inequality. Participants also identified barriers and made recommendations specific to the program itself, mainly regarding accessibility (e.g., cost, distance, frequency). This study adds to the limited body of qualitative research on mental health in Bangladesh, reinforcing previous findings on explanatory models and health-seeking behaviors while providing new insights into the impact of a CBR program in this context. Feedback of service users and carers suggests that CBR may indeed be a useful approach to increase access to services in Bangladesh for people with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities, epilepsy or other cognitive impairments. However, this program is not without its limitations, some of which are the product of broader issues within the mental health system and others of the social and cultural context. More research is needed to formally evaluate this and other CBR programs in the Global South.

Providers' gender-discriminatory attitudes, and men's limited positive involvement correlate with poor utilization and quality of services. We conducted a study at the beginning of a large family planning (FP) and maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health program in Kogi and Ebonyi States of Nigeria to assess whether or not gender plays a role in access to, use of, and delivery of health services. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, observational, baseline quality of care assessment from April-July 2016 to inform a maternal and newborn health project in health facilities in Ebonyi and Kogi States. We observed 435 antenatal care consultations and 47 births, and interviewed 138 providers about their knowledge, training, experiences, working conditions, gender-sensitive and respectful care, and workplace gender dynamics. The United States Agency for International Development's Gender Analysis Framework was used to analyze findings. Results Sixty percent of providers disagreed that a woman could choose a family planning method without a male partner's involvement, and 23.2% of providers disagreed that unmarried clients should use family planning. Ninety-eight percent believed men should participate in health services, yet only 10% encouraged women to bring their partners. Harmful practices were observed in 59.6% of deliveries and disrespectful or abusive practices were observed in 34.0%. No providers offered clients information, services, or referrals for gender-based violence. Sixty-seven percent reported observing or hearing of an incident of violence against clients, and 7.9% of providers experienced violence in the workplace themselves. Over 78% of providers received no training on gender, gender-based violence, or human rights in the past 3 years. Conclusion Addressing gender inequalities that limit women's access, choice, agency, and autonomy in health services as a quality of care issue is critical to reducing poor health outcomes in Nigeria. Inherent gender discrimination in health service delivery reinforces the critical need for gender analysis, gender responsive approaches, values clarification, and capacity building for service providers.

This review aims to provide an overview of the categories of the psychosocial risk factors and hazards affecting HCWs during the Covid-19 pandemic and the recommendations for prevention. We used the scoping review methodology to collate categories of psychosocial risks, the related health outcomes, interventions, and data gaps. The review was conducted on global peer-reviewed academic and authoritative grey literature, published between 1. January-26. October 2020; in total, 220 articles were included into the review and the subsequent analysis. Analysis of the extracted data found PSRs related to four sources: personal protective equipment (PPE), job content, work organisation, and social context. is. Women health workers and nurses reported worst health outcomes. Majority of the research to date concerns health workers in secondary care, while data on psychosocial risks at primary and community-based settings are scarce. However, the emerging research implies that the pandemic creates psychosocial risks also to non-clinical health workers. The intervention and mitigation measures address individual and organisational levels. Preventative and mitigating measures for social and societal risks-such as staff shortages, intersecting inequalities, and financial stressors require further research.

However, in most non-emergency cases, public transport is the travel mode used by the public to access medical services. Yet, there has been little evaluation of the public transport system-based inequality of medical service accessibility. This work uses massive real smart card data (SCD) and an improved potential model to estimate the public transport-based medical service accessibility in Beijing, China. These real SCD data are used to calculate travel costs in terms of time and distance, and medical service accessibility is estimated using an improved potential model. The spatiotemporal variations and patterns of medical service accessibility are explored, and the results show that it is unevenly spatiotemporally distributed across the study area. For example, medical service accessibility in urban areas is higher than that in suburban areas, accessibility during peak periods is higher than that during off-peak periods, and accessibility on weekends is generally higher than that on weekdays. To explore the association of medical service accessibility with socio-economic factors, the relationship between accessibility and house price is investigated via a spatial econometric analysis. The results show that, at a global level, house price is positively correlated with medical service accessibility. In particular, the medical service accessibility of a higher-priced spatial housing unit is lower than that of its neighboring spatial units, owing to the positive spatial spillover effect of house price. This work sheds new light on the inequality of medical service accessibility from the perspective of public transport, which may benefit urban policymakers and planners.

Challenges of resource allocation frequently lead to ethical concerns of healthcare inequity. To tackle this, such developing nations continually need to implement healthcare innovation, coupled with capacity building to ensure new strategies continue to be developed and executed. The COVID-19 pandemic has made significant demands of healthcare systems across the world-to provide equitable healthcare to all, to ensure public health principles are followed, to find novel solutions for previously unencountered healthcare challenges, and to rapidly develop new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Countries worldwide have struggled to accomplish these demands, especially the latter two, considering that few nations had long-standing systems in place to ensure processes for innovation were on-going before the pandemic struck. The crisis represents a critical juncture to plan for a future. This future needs to incorporate a vision for the implementation of healthcare innovation, coupled with capacity building to ensure new strategies continue to be developed and executed. In this paper, the case of the massive Indian healthcare system is utilized to describe how it could implement this vision. An inclusive, ethically-resilient framework has been broadly laid out for healthcare innovation in the future, thereby ensuring success in both the short- and the long-term.

This work aimed to examine gender inequalities in pain across Europe. Methods: Data for 27,552 men and women aged 25-74 years in 19 European countries were taken from the social determinants of health module of the European Social Survey (2014). Inequalities in reporting pain were measured by means of adjusted rate differences (ARD) and relative adjusted rate risks (ARR). Results: At the pooled pan-European level, a greater proportion of women (62.3%) reported pain than men (55.5%) (ARD 5.5% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 4.1, 6.9), ARR 1.10 (95% CI 1.08, 1.13)). These inequalities were greatest for back/neck pain (ARD 5.8% (95% CI 4.4, 7.1), ARR 1.15 (95% CI 1.12, 1.19)), but were also significant for hand/arm pain (ARD 4.6% (95% CI 3.5, 5.7), ARR 1.24 (95% CI 1.17, 1.30)) and foot/leg pain (ARD 2.6% (95% CI 1.5, 3.8), ARR 1.12 (95% CI 1.07, 1.18)). There was considerable cross-national variation in gender pain inequalities across European countries. Conclusions: Significant gender pain inequalities exist across Europe whereby women experience more pain than men. The extent of the gender pain gap varies by country. The gender pain gap is a public health concern and should be considered in future prevention and management strategies.

J	Amilon, A; Hansen, KM; Kjær, AA; Steffensen, T				Amilon, Anna; Hansen, Kasper M.; Kjaer, Agnete Aslaug; Steffensen, Tinne			Estimating disability prevalence and disability-related inequalities: Does the choice of measure matter?	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Disability prevalence; Disability measures; Employment; Voter turnout; Inequality; Denmark; The Washington group short set of questions on; disability; The global activity limitation indicator		Rationale: Different measures for quantifying the percentage of people with a disability in surveys result in diverging estimates of prevalence and disability-related inequalities. Thus understanding the implications of using different disability measures is of vital policy importance. This study is the first to investigate the within survey variation in disability prevalence based on two internationally recognized measures: the Washington Group Short Set (WGSS) and the Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI). It is also the first to examine the disability-related inequality in voter turnout, based on official validated voter records. Methods: We use data on 11,308 25-54-year-old respondents from the 2016 wave of the Survey of Health, Impairment and Living Conditions in Denmark (SHILD) to estimate the disability prevalence based on the WGSS and the GALI. Moreover, we investigate health characteristics of individuals with a disability according to the two measures and inequalities in two central social policy success parameters: voter turnout and employment. Results: The WGSS estimates higher disability prevalence (10.6%) than the GALI (5.5%). Only 2.5% of the sample are in both groups, implying that largely, different individuals are defined as having a disability depending on which measure is used. The health profiles of the two groups also differ, as people with a GALI-defined disability are significantly more likely to report a severe mental illness or a major physical health problem. The GALI estimates indicate larger inequalities between people with and without a disability than the WGSS for the probability of being employed, whereas there are no significant differences for voter turnout. Conclusion: The choice of disability measure strongly influences within-survey estimates of disability prevalence, the health profile of the defined groups, and inequalities in outcomes. The WGSS underrepresents the number of people suffering from severe mental illness. Estimated inequalities in employment are larger for the GALI than for the WGSS.

Researchers applied Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methodology in collaboration with a non-governmental organization (NGO) in an underserved Beirut neighborhood from 2014 through 2016, aiming to address health inequities, build social cohesion among refugees and host populations, and empower community members to develop a community health intervention. We recruited a community advisory board (CAB), conducted six focus groups and sixteen individual interviews, and held several community meetings. In response to the study findings, NGO staff, researchers and community members agreed to work together on a trash collection initiative as a community health intervention. Ultimately, we found the CBPR toolkit to be insufficient to the empirical reality: a series of structural challenges due to entrenched local and national hierarchies, ineffective political processes, and interand intra-group conflict driven by competition over privatized social services. Together these resulted in a lack of trust in the collaborative process wherein study participants solicited researchers for aid in return for their involvement, mirroring the Lebanese patronage system. Ultimately, the most expedient path toward change was not through empowerment of oppressed community participants, but through the action of already powerful local individuals. In conclusion, structural inequalities limit the participatory and emancipatory possibilities of CBPR research. Power mapping exercises, which are often used in community organizing, offer an important opportunity to assess viability and lay the groundwork for CBPR projects. Academic and popular media in the Middle East often focus on religious, sectarian conflict; however, in our study conflict both between and among social groups was driven by competition over material resources more than cultural or religious differences.

These mesolevel characteristics can influence access to healthcare and might have the potential to moderate or aggravate socioeconomic inequity in healthcare use. This scoping review aims to map the existing evidence of the association of socioeconomic inequity in healthcare use and mesolevel access characteristics of the health system. Methods and analysis In conducting the scoping review, we follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols Extension for Scoping Reviews. The search will be carried out in four scientific databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO. Main eligibility criteria are inclusion in the analysis of a measure of socioeconomic position, a measure of individual healthcare use and a mesolevel determinant of access to healthcare services. The selection process consists of two consecutive screening stages (first: title/abstract; second: full text). At both stages, two reviewers independently assess the eligibility of studies. In case of disagreement, a third reviewer will be involved. Cohen's kappa will be calculated to report inter-rater agreement between reviewers. Results are synthesised narratively, as a high heterogeneity of studies is expected. Ethics and dissemination No primary data are collected for the presented scoping review. Therefore, ethical approval is not necessary. The scoping review will be published in an international peer-reviewed journal, and findings will be presented on national and international conferences.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action, and pose a challenge for HEIs as for the efforts made to fulfill them and knowing how to assess their performance. However, the metric management system implemented by HEIs quickly led to rankings emerging, which compare HEIs to metrics not related to the sustainability dimensions of the 17 SDGs. The main aim of the paper is to assess the level of reporting and alignment of SDG achievements with the overall the Times Higher Education (THE) ranking score. For this purpose, our study (i) models and quantifies the impact of HEIs' disclosure of SDG information on HEIs' overall THE Impact Rankings score, (ii) analyzes whether the best ranked universities are indeed significantly related to different SDGs than other not-so-well-ranked ones, and (iii) models the differences in the overall score and its alignment with distinct SDGs by dimensions, subjects, and geographical regions. In order to do so, a descriptive analysis, non-parametric tests, and linear and logistic regression analyses were performed. Our results reveal that the overall ranking is related to the reporting of HEIs' SDG achievements. Moreover, the more positive actions related to health, education, industry, responsible consumption and production, climate action, and partnerships there were, the higher the position of HEIs in the general ranking was. However, we found differences between top-ranking universities and others in geographical location, disclosed information, and impact. Thus, the best-ranked universities are more committed to transferring knowledge to industry to satisfy its needs (SDG9), support strong institutions in their countries, and promote peace and justice (SDG16). Finally, SDG9 and SDG17 are the most relevant and constant SDGs when modeling the alignment of SDGs with HEIs' dimensions (teaching, research, citations, industry income, international outlook) and subjects (technological and social sciences and humanities). HEIs integrating SDG actions into the strategic management of universities and, consequently, reporting their SDG performance to promote sustainability and contribute to sustainable development, is advisable.

In this context, we investigated the social representations of health provision to immigrant patients, held by physicians. We conducted 40 interviews with Greek physicians working in the public health system, the private health system, the health system in jails, and nongovernmental organizations. Using principles from thematic analysis, results show a social representation of immigrant patients as a burden to the health system. This social representation is constructed by themes focusing on immigrant patients as a group with mental health issues and on the construction of the health system as unable to provide health to noncitizens. Results are discussed in relation to current issues of social exclusion and the need to protect the human right of health.

J	Barr, EC; Michael, M				Campbell Barr, Epsy; Michael, Marmot			Leadership, social determinants of health and health equity: the case of Costa Rica	REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health equity; social determinants of health; human development; life expectancy; Costa Rica		Costa Rica has long been a country of special interest in the Americas and in global health because of its good health. The United Nations Development Programme ranks countries according to their level of human development based on life expectancy, education and national income. Although Costa Rica is ranked at 63 and classified as 'High', in terms of health it belongs in the 'Very High' group. In 2018 mean life expectancy for the 'Very High' countries was 79.5, while in Costa Rica it was 80. In 2018, under five mortality was 8.8/1000 live births, lower than countries ranked in the 'Very High' human development group. Expected years of schooling in Costa Rica is 15.4, closer to the average, 16.4 years, of the 'Very High' human development group than the average of the 'High' group. The country is much healthier than would be predicted by its national income; rather, other features of society's development are likely to have played a key role in the development of good health. These include (i) the decision to cease investment in national defence, which freed up money to invest in health, education and the welfare of the population; (ii) the decision to create a universal health system financed by the State, employers and workers in the 1940s; and (iii) the educational system, that generated opportunities to lift important sectors of the population out of poverty, allowing them to have basic sanitary conditions that increase their possibilities to live longer and in better conditions. Despite these advances, inequalities in terms of income and social conditions persist, presenting challenges in the field of health, particularly for lower-income populations and those of African and indigenous descent. These inequalities must be addressed using decisions based on scientific evidence, a greater use of disaggregated data to reveal progress in addressing these inequalities, and with a broader articulation of the health sector with policies that act on the social determinants of health.

This rising burden widens the inequality gap, contributes to massive economic hardships of patients and carers, and increases costs to the health system, facing challenges such as low physician-to-patient ratios and lack of access to medicines. Established risk factors include unhealthy diet (high salt and low fruit and vegetable intake), physical inactivity, tobacco and alcohol use, and obesity. Emerging risk factors include pollution (air, water, noise, and light), urbanization, and a loss of green space. Risk factors that require further in-depth research are low birth weight and social and commercial determinants of health. Global actions include the HEARTS technical package and the push for universal health care. Promising research efforts highlight that successful interventions are feasible in LMICs. These include creation of health-promoting environments by introducing salt-reduction policies and sugar and alcohol tax; implementing cost-effective screening and simplified treatment protocols to mitigate treatment inertia; pooled procurement of low-cost single-pill combination therapy to improve adherence; increasing access to telehealth and mHealth (mobile health); and training health care staff, including community health workers, to strengthen team-based care. As the blood pressure trajectory continues creeping upward in LMICs, contextual research on effective, safe, and cost-effective interventions is urgent. New emergent risk factors require novel solutions. Lowering blood pressure in LMICs requires urgent global political and scientific priority and action.

The quality scores have a wide range and heterogeneity whichever AGREE II domain is prioritised. Five higher-quality CPGs focus on HIV and other blood-borne infections (overall assessment scores 69%-94%). Six lower-quality CPGs concern transition-specific interventions (overall assessment scores 11%-56%). None deal with primary care, mental health or longer-term medical issues. Sparse information on estimated changes in mortality and QoL is conflicting. Consistency between CPGs could not be examined due to unclear recommendations within the World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care Version 7 and a lack of overlap between other CPGs. None provide key messages for patients.ConclusionsA paucity of high-quality guidance for gender minority/trans people exists, largely limited to HIV and transition, but not wider aspects of healthcare, mortality or QoL. Reference to AGREE II, use of systematic reviews, independent external review, stakeholder participation and patient facing material might improve future CPG quality.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42019154361.

Organisational best practices for advancing women in leadership: protocol for a systematic literature review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review						change management; organisational development; public health	METAANALYSIS; GENDER	IntroductionEvidence-based approaches for achieving gender equity for women in leadership are lacking. Current efforts are of limited effectiveness, especially in healthcare. This work occurs in the context of an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council funded partnership to advance women in healthcare leadership. Partners include government, professional colleges and healthcare organisations with national reach and international links. Here we present a protocol for a systematic review, aiming to capture evidence on effective organisational strategies across multiple sectors with comparable challenges in advancing women in leadership. The aim of the review is to learn from other sectors and analyse the evidence to inform implementation in the health sector.Methods and analysisA systematic search will be performed on Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO and SCOPUS databases to identify studies since 2000, reflecting a major shift in the global gender equality agenda with the development of the 2000 Millennium Development Goals. Titles and abstracts will be screened to assess eligibility; data extraction, quality assessment (using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist) and synthesis of outcomes will be performed. Outcomes will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Studies in English using quantitative or qualitative design, which investigate organisational practices in any sector, for advancing women in leadership, and report on one or more measurable outcomes (eg, capacity-building, incidence of promotion) will be included. Findings will be analysed, themes will be extracted and results will be described.Ethics and disseminationEthics approval is not required. To our knowledge, this review will be the first to provide a comprehensive synthesis of available evidence on organisational practices for advancing women in leadership from the last two decades. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at conferences and meetings. Through a large-scale funded partnership, this work will inform practice, linking to international initiatives.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42020162115; International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

The pandemic is an outcome of what we term a planetary dysbiosis, for which underlining drivers include inequality and the exploitation and extraction of human and non-human labours. The implication is that the usual fixes to outbreaks of infectious diseases (ie, surveillance, pharmaceutical measures, and non-pharmaceutical measures) will be insufficient without a thorough reappraisal of and investment in planetary health. Given the heterogeneity and diversity of environments and populations, we envisage these actions as a matter for the generation of new kinds of public, requiring widespread and multiple forms of engagement to generate lasting solutions. We use and extend the concept of healthy publics to suggest a movement that can start to reclaim planetary health as a collective and ongoing issue.

Exploring a Culture of Health in the Auto Industry	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Auto industry; Culture of Health; mobility solutions; equity; sustainability	AIR-POLLUTION; ACCESS; DISEASE	The Culture of Health framework includes four pillars of societal health and well-being influenced by business, namely: consumers; employees and workers in the supply chain; the community, and the environment. The Auto industry was an ideal crucible in which to explore the interface of public health with business given the confluence of the different domains in this sector. The substantial benefits of mobility, especially for the under-resourced, sit alongside negative impacts from emissions, accidents, products and services. Through interviews with 65 senior executives from seven major automakers, corporate actions reflecting health as a strategic agenda were mapped to the Culture of Health model. While most of the companies did not use the language of health explicitly in their strategy, key examples were present across all four pillars. Given the future of mobility relies on the interface of human experience with technology, it is a population-level challenge demanding system-level changes. Ostensibly, a framework for sustainability, the Culture of Health model could help the Auto industry navigate the disruption caused by the global megatrends and changing societal expectations of business in society and transition successfully to a new mobility economy.

However, the extent to which implementation of such approaches may impact transportation and health equity is unclear. In this scoping review, we examine the differential transportation and health effects of road pricing policies across population groups and geographic region. We conducted a systematic database search of Transport Research International Documentation, GEOBASE, Scopus, and Ovid Medline, supplemented by bibliographic review and internet searches. Fifteen studies were included in the review. The studies evaluated area and cordon road pricing systems in Singapore, London, Stockholm, Milan, and Gothenburg, and had a median follow-up period of 12 months. Outcomes evaluated include car commuting, mode shift to public transit, accessibility to destinations, affordability, welfare, social interactions, air pollution, traffic injuries and deaths, acute asthma attacks, and life expectancy. While more studies across diverse urban contexts and policy settings will be needed to strengthen the evidence base, the existing evidence suggests road pricing has mostly net positive effects related to a reduction in car trips, air pollution, asthma attacks, and road traffic collisions, and increases in life expectancy. Frequency and ease of social interactions were found to be negatively impacted, with fewer visits to family and friends. The population groups that generally fared better across transportation and health outcomes were those with higher incomes, men, and people between the ages of 35-55. Across space, there are benefits for both the areas inside and outside the cordon boundary, but to a greater degree for the area inside. Overall, the evidence base is limited by a narrow set of health-related outcomes and a lack of longer-term studies. We did not come across any studies assessing distributional effects of noise pollution, mode shifts to walking or cycling, or other morbidities in the general population that are not listed above. In addition, there are few evaluations that include non-work trips, therefore potentially missing effects for unemployed populations or women who are more likely to make non-work trips. We find that the limited body of evidence on area and cordon pricing policies suggests these policies are beneficial for a number of transportation and health outcomes, particularly for populations inside the cordon area, but that there may be some degree of inequities in the distribution of the benefits and burdens.

Ten Global Surgical Care Statements for Children: examining our commitment to the future	PEDIATRIC SURGERY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Pediatric; Surgery; Global; Equity; Health disparity; Access to care; Global health		Background The lack of access to essential surgery for many of our world's children is a global health crisis. A third of all deaths in the pediatric population are due to surgical conditions. In low- and middle-income countries, an average of nine in ten children lack access to basic surgical care. Methods This review examines ten commitment statements ratified by numerous global pediatric surgical organizations aimed at addressing existing gaps in global surgical care for children. They are substantiated by a review of literature and represent over-arching principles. Results They prompt the recognition of childhood surgical disease as a global health priority and advocate for availability to safe surgical and anesthetic care. Calls to action highlight the importance of capacity building in the areas of education, data gathering, workforce, research, and international collaborations.

These have been reproduced through the intensification of inequalities and reinforced through policy responses that have failed to protect the most vulnerable from the health and socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has also revealed the materiality of human activity and complex geographies of inequality. It has highlighted how inequalities embedded in relations of production, reproduction and global finance continue to perpetuate the divide between the Global North and South. Using an interdisciplinary political economy lens with a focus on the Global South, this Special Issue brings together contributions that explore the dynamics underpinning the intensification of inequalities during the pandemic and that analyse the initial policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis.

A Systems Understanding Underpins Actions at the Climate and Health Nexus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						climate change; systems thinking; health equity; planetary health	MODEL	Multiple sectors-health and non-health-can determine the health and well-being of people and the condition of the socio-ecological environment on which it depends. At the climate and human health nexus, a systems-based understanding of climate change and health should inform all stages of the policy process from problem conceptualization to design, implementation, and evaluation. Such an understanding should guide countries, their partners, and donors to incorporate health in strategic climate actions based on how health is affected by, and plays a role in, the dynamic interactions across economic, environmental, and societal domains. A systems-based approach to sustainable development has been widely promoted but operationalizing it for project level and policy development and implementation has not been well articulated. Such an approach is especially valuable for informing how to address climate change and health together through policy actions which can achieve multiple, mutually reinforcing goals. This commentary article describes strategic steps including the complementary use of health impact assessment, quantification of health impacts, and linking climate and health actions to national and global policy processes to apply a systems-based approach for developing climate mitigation and adaptation actions with human health benefits.

ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article								Medical schools are increasing global health training opportunities, but these have been marketed to medical students as an exotic vocation. The challenges of global health education in high income country (HIC) medical schools are rooted within broader inequities in global health partnerships. More meaningful engagement during medical training is hindered by students' inability to take extended absences, difficulty securing funding, a paucity of mentors with demonstrated commitment to equitable global health practice, and inadequate preparation. Calls for decolonizing global health have recently amplified, and medical schools must seize the opportunity to train decolonizers. We outline steps medical schools can adopt to shift their global health education approach to develop practitioners better prepared to contribute equitably. First, students should be exposed to more global health courses, including the history of colonial medicine and its effects on specific local contexts. Medical schools should deemphasize short-term unidirectional engagement, and encourage extended experiences. International experiences must have clearly defined roles, clarified with pre-visit contracts and supervision of the experience to ensure students do not engage in medicine above their level of training. For any exchange, medical schools must provide pre-visit training that includes site-specific orientation and strategies for effective collaboration. Finally, medical schools must recruit faculty committed to developing equitable, long-term collaborations, and institutional promotion criteria must be aligned to encourage this work. An understanding and commitment to this lifelong practice can be fostered through medical school curricula that expose students to global health work that prioritizes equity in clinical work and research.

We look forward to providing policy experience for other countries still in severe epidemics. Methods We analyzed data provided by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center for the period 10 January 2020 to 25 May 252,020. We used generalized linear model to evaluate the associations between the main control policies and the number of confirmed cases and the policy disparities in response to the first wave of COVID-19 between China and Germany. Results The generalized linear models show that the following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China: the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism; locking down the worst-hit areas; the highest level response to public health emergencies; the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients; makeshift hospitals; residential closed management; counterpart assistance. The following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Germany: the Novel Coronavirus Crisis Command; large gathering cancelled; real-time COVID-19 risk assessment; the medical emergency plan; schools closure; restrictions on the import of overseas epidemics; the no-contact protocol. Conclusions There are two differences between China and Germany in non-pharmaceutical interventions: China adopted the blocking strategy, and Germany adopted the first mitigation and then blocking strategy; China's goal is to eliminate the virus, and Germany's goal is to protect high-risk groups to reduce losses. At the same time, the policies implemented by the two countries have similarities: strict blockade is a key measure to control the source of infection, and improving medical response capabilities is an important way to reduce mortality.

There is a paucity of evidence about disparities of obesity in Lesotho. This study examined socioeconomic and area-based inequalities in obesity among non-pregnant women in Lesotho.MethodsData were extracted from the 2004, 2009 and 2014 Lesotho Demographic and Health Surveys (LDHS) and analyzed through the recently updated Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) of the World Health Organization. Obesity prevalence was disaggregated by four equity stratifiers, namely education, wealth, residence and sub-national region. For each equity stratifier, simple and complex as well as relative and absolute summary measures were calculated. A 95% confidence interval was used to measure statistical significance of findings.ResultsWe noticed substantial wealth-driven (D=-21.10, 95% CI; -25.94, -16.26), subnational region (PAR=-11.82, 95%CI; -16.09, -7.55) and urban-rural (-9.82, 95% CI; -13.65, -5.99) inequalities in obesity prevalence without the inequalities improved over time in all the studied years. However, we did not identify educational inequality in obesity.ConclusionsWealth-driven and geographical inequalities was identified in Lesotho in all the studied time periods while education related inequalities did not appear during the same time period. All population groups in the country need to be reached with interventions to reduce the burden of obesity in the country.

This study aimed to determine the time trend of incidence of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and its association with income, presented by GDP (gross domestic product) per capita.MethodsThis study was a retrospective observational study in Taiwan. Newly diagnosed SCI patients with moderate to severe disability from 2002 to 2015 were identified from the reimbursement database of the National Health Insurance (NHI) system (1998-2015). CIR16-99 (cumulative incidence rate, aged 16-99years, per 10(3) person-years) and CIR16-59 (aged 16-59years) of SCI from 2002 to 2015 were measured.ResultsThere were 5048 newly diagnosed SCI patients during the study period. After controlling the factors of sex, urbanization level, literacy, income inequality, and global financial crisis (mixed effects models), the CIR16-99 of SCI, traumatic SCI, motor vehicle (MV)-related SCI, fall-related SCI, tetraplegia, traumatic tetraplegia, MV-related tetraplegia, and fall-related tetraplegia were inversely associated with GDP per capita; the beta coefficients ranged from -4.85 (95% confidence interval-7.09 to -2.6) for total SCI to -0.8 (-1.3 to -0.29) for fall-related tetraplegia. We restricted our comparison to Taipei City and the 4 lowest densely populated counties, which also corroborated with the above results. The income elasticity analysis revealed when GDP per capita increased by 1%, the total SCI decreased by 1.39; which was also associated with a decrease of 1.34 parts per thousand, 1.55 parts per thousand, 1.36 parts per thousand, 1.46 parts per thousand, 1.54 parts per thousand, 1.54 parts per thousand, and 1.62 parts per thousand for traumatic SCI, MV-related SCI, fall-related SCI, tetraplegia, traumatic tetraplegia, MV-related tetraplegia, and fall-related tetraplegia respectively. The beta coefficients show that the compared areas of urbanization level were also inversely correlated with CIR16-59 in the SCI population.Conclusions We conclude that the incidence of tetraplegia of traumatic SCI in Taiwan decreases with good economic performance, which may be resulted from the provision of public goods and services, possibly through improvements in the infrastructure of transportation and construction.

We employ a sequential design to analyze statistical and qualitative data. Despite international data suggesting that trust in federal governments reduces anxiety, women who did not trust and actively opposed the Trump administration reported lower levels of anxiety than expected. Results indicate reliance on and development of new forms of connection that seem to mitigate symptomatic anxieties when living in opposition. Women living in opposition to the leadership of the federal government use and develop resources to help them cope. Research on coping strategies and mental health and anxiety during crisis can inform recommendations for ways to support and strengthen sense of coherence during tumultuous times.

Sources: This UK version is based on the supranational EFP guideline (Sanz et al., 2020) published in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology. The source guideline was developed using the S3-level methodology, which combined the assessment of formal evidence from 15 systematic reviews with a moderated consensus process of a representative group of stakeholders, and accounts for health equality, environmental factors and clinical effectiveness. It encompasses 62 clinical recommendations for the treatment of stage I-III periodontitis, based on a stepwise process mapped to the 2017 classification system. Methodology: The UK version was developed from the source guideline using a formal process called the GRADE ADOLOPMENT framework. This framework allows for the adoption (unmodified acceptance), adaptation (acceptance with modifications) and the de novo development of clinical recommendations. Using this framework and following the S3-process, the underlying systematic reviews were updated and a representative guideline group of 75 delegates from 17 stakeholder organisations was assembled into three working groups. Following the formal S3-process, all clinical recommendations were formally assessed for their applicability to the UK and adoloped accordingly. Results and conclusion: Using the ADOLOPMENT protocol, a UK version of the EFP S3-level clinical practice guideline was developed. This guideline delivers evidence-and consensus-based clinical recommendations of direct relevance to the dental community in the UK. Clinical significance: The aim of S3-level guidelines is to combine the evaluation of formal evidence, grading and synthesis with the clinical expertise of a broad range of stakeholders to form clinical recommendations. Herein, the first major international S3-level guideline in dentistry, the EFP guideline, was implemented for direct clinical applicability in the UK healthcare system.

J	Hasan, HF				Hasan, Hasan Falah			Legal and Health Response to COVID-19 in the Arab Countries	RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEALTHCARE POLICY			English	Article						COVID-19; Arab countries; health systems; health workforce; health finance; taxes; legal issues; health quality		Background: Arab countries account for almost 6% of the global population, yet they make up only 5% of the total cases and less than 3% of the global death toll attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 has put the health systems in the various Arab Countries and their ability to deliver healthcare services under tremendous strain. The capacity and stability of any health system is important in any type of response to the pandemic, in order to ensure an effective and efficient delivery of care to the public through COVID-19 and beyond. The objective of this study is to identify the various response of health systems in Arab Countries to COVID-19, and highlight the legal and health challenges faced during the pandemic. The study identified both gaps and good practices that may be utilized in order to guide the efforts in response to COVID-19 and the recovery efforts once the pandemic is over. Methods: To determine why the response of some health systems in Arab Countries responses are more effective than others, a three-step framework is adopted which includes, detection, containment, and treatment stages. In order to identify which countries are excelling at detection, containment, and treatment stages, several indicators were selected for each stage. To be able to understand the legal and health challenges of response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an analysis of the health systems, the resources in terms of quality and access, health workforce, and finance was conducted. Secondary data published by the Global Burden of Disease Study, and the Global Change Data Lab of the University of Oxford was used to study identified gaps and good practices to guide the responses to COVID-19 and recovery efforts once the pandemic is over. Results: The epidemiologic record demonstrates that that certain Arab countries are managing to control the pandemic, through a combination of mitigation strategies, suppression strategy and elimination strategy. There are several barriers and challenges in Arab health systems which have been amplified due to COVID-19 and if ignored may pose a further significant challenge in the future. Health systems in Arab countries are not sufficiently equipped to handle all healthcare needs related to COVID-19, in particular issues relating to administration, equity, finances, the supply side of healthcare, and usage of information technology. Conclusion: In Arab counties, the standard response to COVID-19 was enforced by new health laws, which consist of a combination of the traditional disease control measures (testing, contact-tracing, social distancing), population-based physical distancing (including stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, and social gathering bans), travel limits (including travel bans, and border closures), and economic support measures. Acceptable healthcare quality and access, sufficient health workforce, and sufficient funds are the most imperative needs in the health system in Arab counties to provide a sustainable response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accurate estimates of ASD prevalence are vital to planning diagnostic, educational, health, and social care services and may detect possible access barriers to diagnostic pathways and services and inequalities based on social determinants of health. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with ASD prevalence and the likelihood of accessing ASD services in racial/ethnic minority and disadvantaged groups in England. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This case-control prevalence cohort study used the Spring School Census 2017 from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census of the National Pupil Database, which is a total population sample that includes all English children, adolescents, and young adults aged 2 to 21 years in state-funded education. Data were collected on January 17, 2017, and analyzed from August 2, 2018, to January 28, 2020. EXPOSURES Age and sex were treated as a priori confounders while assessing correlates of ASD status according to (1) race/ethnicity, (2) social disadvantage, (3) first language spoken, (4) Education, Health and Care Plan or ASD Special Educational Needs and Disability support status, and (5) mediation analysis to assess how social disadvantage and language might affect ASD status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sex- and age-standardized ASD prevalence by race/ethnicity and 326 English local authority districts in pupils aged 5 to 19 years. RESULTS The final population sample consisted of 7 047 238 pupils (50.99% male; mean [SD] age, 10.18 [3.47] years) and included 119 821 pupils with ASD, of whom 21 660 also had learning difficulties (18.08%). The standardized prevalence of ASD was 1.76%(95% CI, 1.75%-1.77%), with male pupils showing a prevalence of 2.81%(95% CI, 2.79%-2.83%) and female pupils a prevalence of 0.65%(95% CI, 0.64%-0.66%), for a male-to-female ratio (MFR) of 4.32:1. Standardized prevalence was highest in Black pupils (2.11% [95% CI, 2.06%-2.16%]; MFR, 4.68:1) and lowest in Roma/Irish Travelers (0.85%[95% CI, 0.67%-1.03%]; MFR, 2.84:1). Pupils with ASD were more likely to face social disadvantage (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.59-1.63) and to speak English as an additional language (adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.63-0.65). The effect of race/ethnicity on ASD status was mediated mostly through social disadvantage, with Black pupils having the largest effect (standardized mediation coefficient, 0.018; P < .001) and 12.41% of indirect effects through this way. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that significant differences in ASD prevalence exist across racial/ethnic groups and geographic areas and local authority districts, indicating possible differential phenotypic prevalence or differences in detection or referral for racial/ethnic minority groups.

This lack of explicit attention from source country perspectives can lead to inadequate policy responses. Methods A Canadian-led research team partnered with co-investigators in the Philippines, South Africa, and India to examine the causes, consequences and policy responses to the international migration of health workers from these 'source' countries. Multiple-methods combined an initial documentary analysis, interviews and surveys with health workers and country-based stakeholders. We undertook an explicit gender-based analysis highlighting the gender-related influences and implications that emerged from the published literature and policy documents from the decade 2005 to 2015; in-depth interviews with 117 stakeholders; and surveys conducted with 3580 health workers. Results The documentary analysis of health worker emigration from South Africa, India and the Philippines reveal that gender can mediate access to and participation in health worker training, employment, and ultimately migration. Our analysis of survey data from nurses, physicians and other health workers in South Africa, India and the Philippines and interviews with policy stakeholders, however, reveals a curious absence of how gender might mediate health worker migration. Stereotypical views were evident amongst stakeholders; for example, in South Africa female health workers were described as "preferred" for "innate" personal characteristics and cultural reasons, and in India men are directed away from nursing roles particularly because they are considered only for women. The finding that inadequate remuneration was as a key migration driver amongst survey respondents in India and the Philippines, where nurses predominated in our sample, was not necessarily linked to underlying gender-based pay inequity. The documentary data suggest that migration may improve social status of female nurses, but it may also expose them to deskilling, as a result of the intersecting racism and sexism experienced in destination countries. Regardless of these underlying influences in migration decision-making, gender is rarely considered either as an important contextual influence or analytic category in the policy responses. Conclusion An explicit gender-based analysis of health worker emigration, which may help to emphasize important equity considerations, could offer useful insights for the health and social policy responses adopted by source countries.

J	Lor, P; Wiles, B; Britz, J				Lor, Peter; Wiles, Bradley; Britz, Johannes			Re-thinking Information Ethics: Truth, Conspiracy Theories, and Librarians in the COVID-19 Era	LIBRI-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION STUDIES			English	Article						alethic rights; conspiracy theories; COVID-19; infodemic; information ethics	FAKE-NEWS; POST-TRUTH; LITERACY; NEUTRALITY; JUSTICE	The COVID-19 pandemic is an international public health crisis without precedent in the last century. The novelty and rapid spread of the virus have added a new urgency to the availability and distribution of reliable information to help curb its fatal potential. As seasoned and trusted purveyors of reliable public information, librarians have attempted to respond to the "infodemic" of fake news, disinformation, and propaganda with a variety of strategies, but the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge because of the deadly stakes involved. The seriousness of the current situation requires that librarians and associated professionals re-evaluate the ethical basis of their approach to information provision to counter the growing prominence of conspiracy theories in the public sphere and official decision making. This paper analyzes the conspiracy mindset and specific COVID-19 conspiracy theories in discussing how libraries might address the problems of truth and untruth in ethically sound ways. As a contribution to the re-evaluation we propose, the paper presents an ethical framework based on alethic rights-or rights to truth-as conceived by Italian philosopher Franca D'Agostini and how these might inform professional approaches that support personal safety, open knowledge, and social justice.

Older people and nature: the benefits of outdoors, parks and nature in light of COVID-19 and beyond- where to from here?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH			English	Review						Outdoors; spaces; parks; built environment; older people; health; COVID-19		The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people's health and wellbeing globally. In the pandemic, parks, gardens and other local green spaces have been recognised as vital to people's physical and mental health. Emerging global evidence shows increased access to local parks and recreational activities and a new appreciation of the natural surroundings. Various movements and organisations globally have called for actions to embrace recent trends and changes in relation to the planning of public spaces and urban built environments to enable better access to parks and nature. The crisis, however, has exposed the inequities around access to green space where vulnerable populations such as older people and those in low socioeconomic areas are particularly affected. The crisis presents an opportunity to positively impact on society, and an opportunity to consolidate new emerging trends to better integrate nature into the architecture, infrastructure, and public spaces of urban areas.

Rachel Davis and Janiya Williams are both International Board Certified Lactation Consultants and hold positions as directors for the only two Pathway 2 Lactation Consultant Training Programs in Historically Black Colleges / Universities. Rachel is Program Director for the Lactation Consultant Training Program at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina, while Janiya directs the Human Lactation Training Program at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University an hour and a half away in Greensboro, North Carolina. While their backgrounds are quite different, both women care passionately about increasing diversity and equity in the field of lactation support, as well as normalizing nursing for Black and brown families transitioning into parenthood. In this interview they speak to relationships they have developed with their students, their students have developed with each other, and the strength of community created within and between their programs. They describe the difficulties their students encounter with institutional racism within the medical system, and the additional preparation they receive to navigate it. Both programs experience high volumes of applicants-almost 350 for the 12 positions at Johnson C. Smith University-demonstrating the significant need for this curriculum in Historically Black Universities/Colleges. The importance of this model in diversifying the field of lactation cannot be underestimated, and the outspoken women doing this work will be influencers in this field for years to come.

Governments, statistics agencies, and health care organizations are developing and implementing modernized practices that support health equity for SGMs. Extending our work, we conducted a rapid review of grey literature to explore information practices that support quality health care for SGMs. Objective: The aim of this rapid review of grey literature was to elucidate modern GSSO information practices from leading agencies for adaptation, adoption, and application by health care providers and organizations seeking to modernize outdated GSSO information practices that contribute to health inequities among SGMs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Google from 2015 to 2020 with terms related to gender, sex, sexual orientation, and electronic health/medical records for English-language grey literature resources including government and nongovernment organization publications, whitepapers, data standards, toolkits, health care organization and health quality practice and policy guides, conference proceedings, unpublished academic work, and statistical papers. Peer-reviewed journal articles were excluded, as were resources irrelevant to information practices. We also screened the reference sections of included articles for additional resources, and canvassed a working group of international topic experts for additional relevant resources. Duplicates were eliminated ATLAS.ti was used to support analysis. Themes and codes were developed through an iterative process of writing and discussion with the research team. Results: Twenty-six grey literature resources met the inclusion criteria. The overarching themes that emerged from the literature were the interrelated behaviors, attitudes, and policies that constitute SGM cultural competence as follows: shared language with unambiguous definitions of GSSO concepts; welcoming and inclusive care environments and affirming practices to reduce barriers to access; health care policy that supports competent health care; and adoption of modernized GSSO information practices and electronic health record design requirements that address invisibility in health data. Conclusions: Health equity for SGMs requires systemic change. Binary representation of sex and gender in electronic health records (EHRs) obfuscates natural and cultural diversity and, in the context of health care, places SGM patients at risk of clinical harm because it leads to clinical assumptions. Agencies and agents in health care need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate modern attitudes, policies, and practices that enable health equity for SGMs. Adopting small but important changes in the language and terminology used in technical and social health care systems is essential for institutionalizing SGM competency. Modern GSSO information practices depend on and reinforce SGM competency in health care.

J	Holz, M				Holz, Manuel			Health inequalities in Germany: differences in the 'Healthy migrant effect' of European, non-European and internal migrants	JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES			English	Article						Migration; health inequality; healthy migrant effect; selection; propensity score matching		The present study aims at comparing physical and mental health outcomes of different migrant groups and the native German population, testing for the presence of a healthy migrant effect (HME) and its potential differences between groups. The HME is marked by an observed health advantage for migrants compared to the host population, which declines with increasing years since migration. Macroeconomic, institutional and cultural differences of sending countries or regions define the pre-migration and the host country situation differently for European, Non-European and internal migrants. These conditions are assumed to have an impact on initial health differences as well as on health differences after longer exposure to the host country. Using cross-sectional data from the 2016 wave of the German Socioeconomic Panel, physical and mental health outcomes (generated from the SF-12) are compared between recent international and internal migration groups (<= 10 years since migration), non-recent international and internal migration groups (>10 years since migration) and the native German-born population without migration experience. Propensity score matching analyses reveal the presence of a HME for both European and Non-European migrants, but not for internal migrants. This effect differs on the outcome measure and the native comparison group.

A Position Paper	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						harm reduction; structured preparation for alcohol detoxification; managed alcohol programs; alcohol; COVID-19	MANAGED ALCOHOL; MEDICAL CANNABIS; HOMELESS PEOPLE; MENTAL-HEALTH; CARE; SUBSTITUTION; CONSUMPTION; SUBSTANCES; PREDICTORS; STRATEGIES	The COVID-19 pandemic is presenting significant challenges for health and social care systems globally. The implementation of unprecedented public health measures, alongside the augmentation of the treatment capacity for those severely affected by COVID-19, are compromising and limiting the delivery of essential care to people with severe substance use problems and, in some cases, widening extreme social inequities such as poverty and homelessness. This global pandemic is severely challenging current working practices. However, these challenges can provide a unique opportunity for a flexible and innovative learning approach, bringing certain interventions into the spotlight. Harm reduction responses are well-established evidenced approaches in the management of opioid dependence but not so well-known or implemented in relation to alcohol use disorders. In this position paper, we explore the potential for expanding harm reduction approaches during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond as part of substance use treatment services. We will examine alcohol use and related vulnerabilities during COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on substance use services, and the potential philosophical shift in orientation to harm reduction and outline a range of alcohol harm reduction approaches. We discuss relevant aspects of the Structured Preparation for Alcohol Detoxification (SPADe) treatment model, and Managed Alcohol Programs (MAPs), as part of a continuum of harm reduction and abstinence orientated treatment for alcohol use disorders. In conclusion, while COVID-19 has dramatically reduced and limited services, the pandemic has propelled the importance of alcohol harm reduction and created new opportunities for implementation of harm reduction philosophy and approaches, including programs that incorporate the provision of alcohol as medicine as part of the substance use treatment continuum.

J	Hasnan, S; Tan, NC				Hasnan, Syarafina; Tan, Ngiap Chuan			Multi-domain narrative review of vaccine hesitancy in childhood	VACCINE			English	Review						Vaccine hesitancy; Childhood vaccination; Domains; Child; Parent; Clinician; Healthcare system	INFLUENZA VACCINATION; HPV VACCINE; IMMUNIZATION; COMMUNITY; CHILDREN; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; RATES; RECOMMENDATIONS; PERSPECTIVES	Vaccine hesitancy, where individuals delay or refuse some or all vaccines, is a perennial problem. It undermines the success of the immunisation programmes and places the society, especially vulnerable populations such as children, at risk of contracting infectious diseases. The phenomenon has been extensively analysed based on four aspects - confidence, complacency, convenience and costs. We suggest the alternative use of a multi-dimensional framework adapted from the "Generalist Wheel of Knowledge, Understanding and Inquiry" that was developed by Prof Larry Green and Kurt Stange, to assess the multiple facilitators and barriers towards vaccine hesitancy in childhood vaccination. The framework identifies domains in the healthcare system namely the child and parent/family, the clinician, the healthcare system and policy, and the infectious disease and corresponding vaccine that influence vaccine hesitancy. This narrative review includes literature beyond those covered by the World health Organisation Global Vaccine Action Plan (WHO GVAP). It identifies emotional distress, past negative experience and misconceptions that contribute to vaccine hesitancy in children and family, while attitude and motivation underpin vaccine hesitancy in clinicians. The healthcare system contributes to vaccine hesitancy when enforcements, diligent monitoring and transparency are absent or lacking. Inefficient dissemination of information about the disease and its associated vaccine as well as inadequate surveillance of misinformation add to vaccine hesitancy. The inter-domain factors highlight the roles of relationship between the clinician, child and parent, information mastery of the clinician, prioritisation of resources and equity in combating vaccine hesitancy. Using this framework, we present evidence-based strategies which have been effective in mitigating vaccine hesitancy for each domain and their corresponding inter-domains. By providing new perspectives of a complex problem and its potential solutions, this narrative review aims to complement and support the WHO GVAP by developing a coordinated multi-domain strategy to mitigate vaccine hesitancy in childhood.

The results are based on 79 publications deemed eligible for inclusion after the screening and prioritizing of 1,658 records. The findings are organized according to the 3 main categories of socioeconomic interventions-protecting jobs, enterprises, and workers-although the 3 are intertwined. Most results were derived from global-level gray literature with recommendations for interventions and implicit links to the sustainable development goals. Based on research gaps uncovered in the review, future implementation science research needs to focus on designing, implementing, evaluating, and scaling: effective evidence-based socioeconomic interventions; equity-focused, redistributive, and transformative interventions; comprehensive packages of complementary interventions; interventions to upend root causes of systemic social inequities; collaborative and participatory approaches; interventions that integrate environmental sustainability; and city-level interventions. Failing to consider the environmental dimensions of economic recovery is shortsighted and will ultimately exacerbate social inequities and poverty and undermine economic stability in the long term.

More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial. Objective: The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention. Methods: This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canada's guidance on app assessment and selection. Results: A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity. Conclusions: A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group. While some research and digital interventions addressed equity-related considerations, more research and focused attention should be given to this area.

The study discusses and compares operation and use of two such parks located in Wellington, New Zealand and Warsaw, Poland by adopting "pandemic urban ethnography", an approach that includes autoethnography, interviews with users, non-participant observation, and analysis of social media content. As indicated by the findings of the study, the importance of less rigidly designed, multifunctional spaces that give their users freedom of "tactical" adjustments, significantly grows during times of lockdown and "social distancing". During such a crisis, the management and everyday use of urban parks are highly related to urban policies. The article provides insight into how those policies impact the functional values of green infrastructure confronting it with user-generated adaptations and the landscape design itself. The global health emergency showed how access to green areas becomes a crucial determinant on environmental justice while proving the significance of "tactical pandemic urbanism" as both a design and management method.

Global health is unique in the opportunities it can offer to students during the pandemic if programs can manage and learn from the pandemic's many challenges. Global health educators can: shift to sustainable remote engagement and mobilize resources globally to facilitate this; collaborate with partners to support the efforts to deal with the current pandemic and to prepare for its next phases; partner in new ways with health care professional students and faculty from other countries; collaborate in research with partners in studies of pandemic related health disparities in any country; and document and examine the impact of the pandemic on health care workers and students in different global contexts. These strategies can help work around pandemic travel restrictions, overcome the limitations of existing inequitable models of engagement, and better position global health education and face future challenges while providing the needed support to LMIC partners to participate more equally.

However, last mile research lacks a shared understanding around its conceptualization. Objectives: This project used a concept mapping process to answer the questions: what is last mile research in global health and, how can it be used to make positive change for health equity in the last mile? Methods: Between July and December 2019, a five-stage concept mapping exercise was undertaken using online concept mapping software and an in-person consensus meeting. The stages were: establishment of an expert group and focus prompt; idea generation; sorting and rating; initial analysis and final consensus meeting. Results: A group of 15 health researchers with experience working with populations in last mile contexts and who were based at the Matariki Network institutions of Queen's University, CAN and Dartmouth College, USA took part. The resulting concept map had 64 unique idea statements and the process resulted in a map with five clusters. These included: (1) Last mile populations; (2) Research methods and approaches; (3) Structural and systemic factors; (4) Health system factors, and (5) Broader environmental factors. Central to the map were the ideas of equity, human rights, health systems, and contextual sensitivity. Conclusion: This is the first time 'last mile research' has been the focus of a formal concept mapping exercise. The resulting map showed consensus about who last mile populations are, how research should be undertaken in the last mile and why last mile health disparities exist. The map can be used to inform research training programs, however, repeating this process with researchers and members from different last mile populations would also add further insight.

Prevalence and Nature of Sexist and Racial/Ethnic Microaggressions Against Surgeons and Anesthesiologists	JAMA SURGERY			English	Article							RACIAL MICROAGGRESSIONS; BURNOUT; PHYSICIANS; RESIDENTS	IMPORTANCE Workplace mistreatment can manifest as microaggressions that cause chronic, severe distress. As physician burnout becomes a global crisis, quantitative research to delineate the impact of microaggressions is imperative. OBJECTIVES To examine the prevalence and nature of sexist and racial/ethnic microaggressions against female and racial/ethnic-minority surgeons and anesthesiologists and assess the association with physician burnout. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional survey evaluated microaggressions and physician burnout within a diverse cohort of surgeons and anesthesiologists in a large health maintenance organization. A total of 1643 eligible participants were sent a recruitment email on January 8, 2020, 1609 received the email, and 652 replied, for a response rate of 41%. The study survey remained open until February 20, 2020. A total of 588 individuals (37%) were included in the study after exclusion criteria were applied. EXPOSURES The Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Racial Microaggression Scale, and the Sexist Microaggression Experience and Stress Scale. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were prevalence and nature of sexist and racial/ethnic microaggressions against female and racial/ethnic-minority surgeons and anesthesiologists using the Sexist Microaggression Experience and Stress Scale and Racial Microaggression Scale. Secondary outcomes were frequency and severity of microaggressions, prevalence of physician burnout, and associations between microaggressions and physician burnout. RESULTS Data obtained from 588 respondents (249 [44%] female, 367 [62%] racial/ethnic minority. 224 [38.1%] 40-49 years of age) were analyzed. A total of 245 of 259 female respondents (94%) experienced sexist microaggressions, most commonly overhearing or seeing degrading female terms or images. Racial/ethnic microaggressions were experienced by 299 of 367 racial/ethnic-minority physicians (81%), most commonly reporting few leaders or coworkers of the same race/ethnicity. Criminality was rare (18 of 367 [5%]) but unique to and significantly higher for Hispanic and Black physicians. Individuals who identified as underrepresented minorities were more likely to experience environmental inequities (odds ratio [OR], 4.21; 95% CI, 1.6-10.75; P = .002) and criminality (OR, 14.93; 95% CI, 4.5-48.5; P < .001). The prevalence of physician burnout was 47% (280 of 588 physicians) and higher among female physicians (OR, 1.60: 95% CI, 1.03-2.47; P = .04) and racial/ethnic-minority physicians (OR, 2.08; 95% CI. 1.31-3.30; P = .002). Female physicians who experienced sexist microaggressions (racial/ethnic-minority female physicians: OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.04-3.25; P = .04; White female physicians: OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.07-3.69; P = .03) were more likely to experience burnout. Racial/ethnic-minority female physicians (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.03-3.35; P = .04) who experienced racial microaggressions were more likely to report burnout. Racial/ethnic-minority female physicians who had the compound experience of sexist and racial/ethnic microaggressions (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 114-3.69; P = .02) were more likely to experience burnout. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of sexist and racial/ethnic microaggressions against female and racial/ethnic-minority surgeons and anesthesiologists was high and associated with physician burnout. This study provides a valuable response to the increasing call for evidence-based data on surgical workplace mistreatment.

Health data poverty: an assailable barrier to equitable digital health care	LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Article							COVID-19; PARTICIPANTS; INFORMATICS	Data-driven digital health technologies have the power to transform health care. If these tools could be sustainably delivered at scale, they might have the potential to provide everyone, everywhere, with equitable access to expert-level care, narrowing the global health and wellbeing gap. Conversely, it is highly possible that these transformative technologies could exacerbate existing health-care inequalities instead. In this Viewpoint, we describe the problem of health data poverty: the inability for individuals, groups, or populations to benefit from a discovery or innovation due to a scarcity of data that are adequately representative. We assert that health data poverty is a threat to global health that could prevent the benefits of data-driven digital health technologies from being more widely realised and might even lead to them causing harm. We argue that the time to act is now to avoid creating a digital health divide that exacerbates existing health-care inequalities and to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital era. today are amassing health data at astronomical rates, with estimates putting the total volume of health data in 2020 at 2314 exabytes?where one exabyte is equal to 1 billion gigabytes.11 Second, how are health data used? Health data are used to benefit patients and the public, and the use of health data can be classified as either primary or secondary. The primary (direct) use is where health data are used to deliver health care to the individual from whom they were collected.12 Here, health data inform health-care professionals when making diagnoses and decisions relating to an individual?s care.

J	Pratt, B				Pratt, Bridget			Research for Health Justice: an ethical framework linking global health research to health equity	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Review						health services research; public health	RESEARCH CONSORTIA; INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH; SYSTEMS RESEARCH; GOVERNANCE; RESPONSIBILITIES; BIOETHICS; CAPACITY; POLICY; CARE	Global health research should generate new knowledge to improve the health and well-being of those considered disadvantaged and marginalised. This goal motivates much of the global health research being undertaken today. Yet simply funding and conducting global health research will not necessarily generate the knowledge needed to help reduce health disparities between and within countries. Global health research grants programmes and projects must be structured in a particular way to generate that type of information. But how exactly should they be designed to do so? Through a programme of ethics research starting in 2009, an ethical framework called Research for Health Justice was developed that provides guidance to global health researchers and funders on how to design research projects and grants programmes to promote global health equity. It provides guidance on, for example, what research populations and questions ought to be selected, what research capacity strengthening ought to be performed and what post-study benefits ought to be provided. This paper describes how the 'research for health justice' framework was generated and pulls together a body of work spanning the last decade to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date version of its guidance.

The strength of the association-the "social gradient in adolescent mental health"-varies across countries, with stronger associations in countries with greater income inequality. Country-level meritocratic beliefs (beliefs that people get what they deserve) may also strengthen the social gradient in adolescent mental health; higher SES may be more strongly linked to adolescent's perceptions of capability and respectful treatment. Methods: Using data from 11-15 year olds across 30 European countries participating in the 2013/ 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study (n = 131,101), multilevel regression models with cross-level interactions examined whether country-level meritocratic beliefs moderated the association between two individual-level indicators of SES, family affluence and perceived family wealth, and three indicators of adolescent mental health (life satisfaction, psychosomatic complaints, and aggressive behavior). Results: For family affluence, in some countries, there was a social gradient in adolescent mental health, but in others the social gradient was absent or reversed. For perceived family wealth, there was a social gradient in adolescent life satisfaction and psychosomatic complaints in all countries. Country-level meritocratic beliefs moderated associations between SES and both life satisfaction and psychosomatic complaints: in countries with stronger meritocratic beliefs associations with family affluence strengthened, while associations with perceived family wealth weakened. Conclusions: Country-level meritocratic beliefs moderate the associations between SES and adolescent mental health, with contrasting results for two different SES measures. Further understanding of the mechanisms connecting meritocratic beliefs, SES, and adolescent mental health is warranted. (C) 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Methods Five electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science Core Collection, were searched for relevant articles. Following a full-text review by three authors, qualitative data was synthesized thematically according to the Thomas and Harden methodology and quality assessment was conducted by two authors reaching a consensus. Results Fourteen articles were included, with unfavorable work environments, male-dominated culture and societal pressures being major themes. Females in surgery lacked support, faced harassment, and had unequal opportunities, which were often exacerbated by sex-blindness by their male counterparts. Mothers were especially affected, struggling to achieve a work-life balance while facing strong criticism. However, with increasing recognition of the unique professional traits of female surgeons, there is progress towards gender quality which requires continued and sustained efforts. Conclusion This systematic review sheds light on the numerous gender barriers that continue to stand in the way of female surgeons despite progress towards gender equality over the years.

Methods We undertook a cross-sectional study of board members and chairs of ICO and WCO member organisations using a desk-based assessment of member organisation websites during February and March 2020. Gender and ethnicity of board members and chairs were collected using a combination of validated algorithmic software and manual assessment, based on names and photographs where available. Gender proportions were calculated across Global Burden of Disease super-regions, and gender and ethnicity proportions in the high-income regions of Australasia, North America and Western Europe. Results Globally, approximately one in three board members were women for both ICO (34%) and WCO (35%) members, and one in three ICO (32%) and one in five WCO (22%) chairpersons were women. Women held at least 50% of posts in only three of the 26 (12%) leadership structures assessed; these were based in Latin America and the Caribbean (59% of WCO board positions held by women, and 56% of WCO chairs), and Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania (55% of ICO chairs). In the Eurocentric high-income regions, white men held more than half of all board (56%) and chair (58%) positions and white women held a further quarter of positions (26% of board and 27% of chair positions). Ethnic minority women held the fewest number of board (6%) and chair (7%) positions. Conclusions Improvements in gender parity are needed in member organisations of the WCO and ICO across all world regions. In high-income regions, efforts to address inequity at the intersection of gender and ethnicity are also needed. Potential strategies to enable inclusive leadership must be centred on structurally enabled diversity and inclusion goals to support the professional progression of women, and people from ethnic minorities in global optometry and ophthalmology.

In responding to this urgent and growing public health crisis, mitigation strategies are in place to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) while adaptation strategies exist to reduce and/or alleviate the adverse effects of climate change by increasing systems' resilience to future impacts. While these strategies have numerous positive benefits on climate change itself, they also often have other positive externalities or health co-benefits. This knowledge can be harnessed to promote and improve global public health, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Previous conceptual models in mitigation and adaptation studies such as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) considered health in the thinking, but health outcomes were not their primary intention. Additionally, existing guidance documents such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidance for Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Health Care Facilities is designed primarily for public health professionals or healthcare managers in hospital settings with a primary focus on resilience. However, a detailed cross sectoral and multidisciplinary conceptual framework, which links mitigation and adaptation strategies with health outcomes as a primary end point, has not yet been developed to guide research in this area. In this paper, we briefly summarize the burden of climate change on global public health, describe important mitigation and adaptation strategies, and present key health benefits by giving context specific examples from high, middle, and low-income settings. We then provide a conceptual framework to inform future global public health research and preparedness across sectors and disciplines and outline key stakeholders recommendations in promoting climate resilient systems and advancing health equity.

Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD) is one of the most common substance use disorders in the world. Evidence-based treatment of TUD is effective, but treatment accessibility remains very low. A dearth of specially trained clinicians is a significant barrier to treatment accessibility, even within systems of care that implement brief intervention models. The treatment of TUD is becoming more complex and tailoring treatment to address new and traditional tobacco products is needed. The Council for Tobacco Treatment Training Programs (Council) is the accrediting body for Tobacco Treatment Specialist (TTS) training programs. Between 2016 and 2019, n = 7761 trainees completed Council-accredited TTS training programs. Trainees were primarily from North America (92.6%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (6.1%) and were trained via in-person group workshops in medical and academic settings. From 2016 to 2019, the number of Council-accredited training programs increased from 14 to 22 and annual number of trainees increased by 28.5%. Trainees have diverse professional backgrounds and work in diverse settings but were primarily White (69.1%) and female (78.7%) located in North America. Nearly two-thirds intended to implement tobacco treatment services in their setting; two-thirds had been providing tobacco treatment for 1 year or less; and 20% were sent to training by their employers. These findings suggest that the training programs are contributing to the development of a new workforce of TTSs as well as the development of new programmatic tobacco treatment services in diverse settings. Developing strategies to support attendance from demographically and geographically diverse professionals might increase the proportion of trainees from marginalized groups and regions of the world with significant tobacco-related inequities.

Virtual pollination trade uncovers global dependence on biodiversity of developing countries	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; OIL CONTENT; ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION; YIELD; SERVICES; WATER; GERMPLASM; BENEFIT; TRENDS; FOOD	Nations' food consumption patterns are increasingly globalized and trade dependent. Natural resources used for agriculture (e.g., water, pollinators) are hence being virtually exchanged across countries. Inspired by the virtual water concept, we, herein, propose the concept of virtual biotic pollination flow as an indicator of countries' mutual dependence on biodiversity-based ecosystem services and provide an online tool to visualize trade flow. Using information on 55 pollinator-dependent crop markets (2001-2015), we show that countries with higher development level demand high levels of biodiversity-based services to sustain their consumption patterns. Such patterns are supported by importation of virtual biotic pollination (up to 40% of national imports of pollinator-dependent crops) from developing countries, stimulating cropland expansion. Quantifying virtual pollination flow can help develop new global socioeconomic policies to meet the interconnected challenges of biodiversity loss, ecosystem health, and social justice.	[Silva, F. D.

This paper presents the key features of the new NHS: A National Health Insurance Fund operated by the Health Insurance Organisation pays for services provided by a mix of public and private providers. A prerequisite for the establishment of this new quasi-market was the transfer of public hospitals from the Ministry of Health to the new State Health Services Organisation, thus establishing a purchaser-provider and regulator split. The first implementation phase started in June 2019 and introduced coverage of outpatient healthcare services for the entire population, providing access - with relatively small user charges - to family physicians, outpatient specialists, pharmaceuticals and laboratories. The second implementation phase began in June 2020 with the inclusion of hospital care, followed by the inclusion of specialty pharmaceuticals in September and was completed in December 2020. The reform is a vital achievement as it is a major step towards the goal of universal health coverage, reducing the excessive reliance on out-of-pocket payment and glaring inequities in access to care.

The purpose of this study is to assess the HRQoL of people living with HIV (PLHIV), and to ascertain its association with the social inequalities and clinical determinants among people living with HIV in Benishangul Gumuz Regional State, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2016 and February 2017; 390 people at two referral hospitals and three health centers participated in the study. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health Scale (PROMIS Global 10) was used to measure key HRQoL domains. Global Physical Health (GPH) and Global Mental Health (GPH) summary scores were employed. GPH and GMH summary scores below 50 (the standardized mean score) were determined as poor HRQoL. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with GPH and GMH summary scores. Results This study included 259 (66.4%) females and 131 (33.6%) males. The GPH summary scores ranged from 16.2 to 67.7 with a mean of 48.8 (SD = 8.9). Almost 44.6% of the study population has a GPH summary score of below 50; the GMH summary scores ranged from 28.4 to 67.6 with a mean of 50.8 (SD = 8.1). About 41.8% of the study population has a GMH summary score of below 50. Unemployment, household food insecurity and comorbidities with HIV were associated with both poor GPH and poor GMH summary scores. Age below 25 years and being a member of Christian fellowship were inversely associated with poor GPH. The least wealth index score and CD4 count below 350 cells/mL were also associated with poor GMH. Conclusion Overall, socioeconomic inequalities and HIV-related clinical factors play an important role in improving the HRQoL of PLHIV. Many of these determinants are alterable risk factors. Appropriate strategies can improve the holistic management of chronic HIV care and maximize PLHIVs' HRQoL. Such strategies require the adoption of comprehensive interventions, including policies and programmes that would improve the health, wellbeing and livelihood of PLHIV.

Consented participants were (1) trained to use a digital camera and encouraged to capture their screening barriers, (2) interviewed to unpack and analyze their images, and (3) invited to participate in follow-up focus groups for refined discussion and data triangulation for content analysis using NVivo software. The sample included women (n = 25) who were on average 42 years (SD = 9.8, range: 26-57) and born and raised in Haiti. Results highlighted multiple barriers, including gendered family responsibilities, concerns about quality of care, financial and time constraints, worries about discomfort and exam efficacy, and emotional deterrents such as frustration. Framed by the PEN-3 model's dimensions of cultural identity, relationships and expectations, and cultural empowerment, women's recommendations to overcome barriers spanned education, evaluation, and empowerment, respectively, across individual, interpersonal, and institutional systems. Study results call for more extensive examination of the diversity present in the groups of African origin to unearth transnational, multifaceted determinants of health by biology, beliefs, and behaviors including sociocultural and socioenvironmental access. Future interventions must include development of proactive policies, which deliberately pressure the government and global community to prioritize health infrastructure while simultaneously educating women about and dispelling fear of cervical cancer, thus empowering Haitian women to live their healthiest lives. Accordingly, this study may contribute to understanding global health equity advances and improving public health infrastructure in underresourced settings in low- and middle-income countries in the Caribbean.

However, to achieve efficient and meaningful adoption of health care data-sharing initiatives, it is necessary to engage all stakeholders, from health care professionals to patients. Although previous work has assessed health care professionals' perceptions of data sharing, perspectives of the general public and particularly of seldom heard groups have yet to be fully assessed. Objective: This study aims to explore the views of the public, particularly their hopes and concerns, around health care data sharing. Methods: An original, immersive public engagement interactive experience was developed-The Can of Worms installation-in which participants were prompted to reflect about data sharing through listening to individual stories around health care data sharing. A multidisciplinary team with expertise in research, public involvement, and human-centered design developed this concept. The installation took place in three separate events between November 2018 and November 2019. A combination of convenience and snowball sampling was used in this study. Participants were asked to fill self-administered feedback cards and to describe their hopes and fears about the meaningful use of data in health care. The transcripts were compiled verbatim and systematically reviewed by four independent reviewers using the thematic analysis method to identify emerging themes. Results: Our approach exemplifies the potential of using interdisciplinary expertise in research, public involvement, and human-centered design to tell stories, collect perspectives, and spark conversations around complex topics in participatory digital medicine. A total of 352 qualitative feedback cards were collected, each reflecting participants' hopes and fears for health care data sharing. Thematic analyses identified six themes under hopes: enablement of personal access and ownership, increased interoperability and collaboration, generation of evidence for better and safer care, improved timeliness and efficiency, delivery of more personalized care, and equality. The five main fears identified included inadequate security and exploitation, data inaccuracy, distrust, discrimination and inequality, and less patient-centered care. Conclusions: This study sheds new light on the main hopes and fears of the public regarding health care data sharing. Importantly, our results highlight novel concerns from the public, particularly in terms of the impact on health disparities, both at international and local levels, and on delivering patient-centered care. Incorporating the knowledge generated and focusing on co-designing solutions to tackle these concerns is critical to engage the public as active contributors and to fully leverage the potential of health care data use.

There are large regional and within-country disparities in the burden of underweight, anemia, and micronutrient deficiencies across the globe. Driving these disparities are complex and multifactorial causes, including access to health services, water and sanitation, women's status, and food insecurity as well as the underlying social, economic, and political context. Women's health, nutrition, and wellbeing across the continuum of preconception to pregnancy are critical for ensuring positive pregnancy and long-term outcomes for both the mother and child. In this review, we summarize the evidence base for nutrition interventions before and during pregnancy that will help guide programs targeted towards women's nutrition. Growing evidence from preconception nutrition trials demonstrates an impact on offspring size at birth. Preconception anemia and low preconception weight are associated with an increased risk of low birth weight and small for gestational age births. During pregnancy, several evidence-based strategies exist, including balanced-energy protein supplements, multiple micronutrient supplements, and small-quantity lipid nutrient supplements for improving birth outcomes. There, however, remain several important priority areas and research gaps for improving women's nutrition before and during pregnancy. Further progress is needed to prioritize preconception nutrition and access to health and family planning resources. Additional research is required to understand the long-term effects of preconception and pregnancy interventions particularly on offspring development. Furthermore, while there is a strong evidence base for maternal nutrition interventions, the next frontier requires a greater focus on implementation science and equity to decrease global maternal undernutrition disparities.

J	Langran, I				Langran, Irene			Challenges to Global Health Governance from the International Trade in Organ Transplants <i>Time for a New Mode</i>l?	GLOBAL GOVERNANCE			English	Article						globalization and health; global health governance; medical tourism; organ transplants; transplant tourism; Declaration of Istanbul	TOURISM; TRAFFICKING	The internationalization of medical services-including organ transplantations-is driven by advances in technology and integration of trade. Patients in need of organ transplants began to seek these services outside their countries of origin in the 1980s and 1990s, and this practice expanded in the ensuing decades. While these transplants yielded benefits to some, abuses included human trafficking, preying on vulnerable populations, and negative outcomes in health equity. This case study of efforts to regulate the international transplant trade yields important findings for our understanding of global health governance. First, it provides support to the "globalization reformers" who maintain that if globalization's benefits are to be widely distributed, institutional mechanisms must be enacted. Second, it provides another example of the externalities that occur when health concerns are absent, poorly represented, or weakened in trade negotiations. Finally, it demonstrates limits of a global health regime that lacks a centralized authority.

The purpose of this study was to identify trends in ECC burden in children under 5 years old among European Union (EU) member states over time and to evaluate the relationship with its risk factors. Global Burden of Disease 2019 data were analyzed to estimate the burden of ECC over time, specifically incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for children under 5 years old. Four ecological variables with a potential effect on YLDs for ECC were used to investigate the association between 2014 and 2017. The YLDs rate was consistently higher among Eastern EU countries over time. Univariate models showed a positive significant association between at-risk-of-poverty rate and YLDs rate, while GDP per capita and urbanization were inversely associated with YLDs rate. In the multivariate analysis, sugar consumption, GDP per capita and urbanization showed significant association with YLDs rate. After stratification by region, association remained significant only in the Eastern EU countries between GDP, urbanization, and YLDs rate, while sugar consumption and at-risk-of-poverty rate had no significant impact on YLDs rates. This study found increasing ECC burden in the EU. The complexity of the problem indicates the need for innovative and personalized policy approaches to tackle the disease.

To identify potential barriers to the implementation of the National Childbirth Guidelines in Brazil based on the best available global evidence. Method. A rapid review of evidence was performed in six databases in March/April 2019. Secondary studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese with a focus on barriers of any nature relating to the implementation of the Guidelines were retrieved. Results. Twenty-three documents (21 reviews and two practice guides) were included in the review. The barriers identified were grouped into 52 meaning categories and then reorganized into nine thematic clusters: delivery and childbirth care model, human resource management, knowledge and beliefs, gender relations, health care service management, attitudes and behaviors, communication, socioeconomic conditions, and political interests. Conclusions. The results show that combined approaches may be required to address different barriers to the implementation of the Guidelines. For successful implementation, it is essential to engage health care leaders, professionals, and users in the effort to change the delivery and childbirth care model. Also necessary is the development of intersectoral initiatives to improve the socioeconomic conditions of women and families and to curtail gender inequalities.

This study examined the linkages between FGM and multiple sexual partnership in Mali and Sierra Leone - two African countries with a high prevalence of FGM. Data were from the 2018 Mali and 2013 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Surveys, and the study sample comprised 4750 women from Mali and 16,614 from Sierra Leone. Multilevel logistic regression was used for the data analysis, with reported adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and associated 95% confidence intervals. In Mali, women who had not undergone FGM were less likely to have multiple sexual partners (aOR=0.60, CI=0.38-0.96) compared with those who had undergone FGM. In Sierra Leone, women who had undergone FGM (aOR=1.15, CI=1.02-1.30) were more likely to have multiple sexual partners compared with those who had not undergone FGM. Age, level of education, wealth quintile, sex of household head, community socioeconomic status, mass media exposure, and community literacy level were found to be associated with the likelihood of multiple sexual partnership among women in Mali and Sierra Leone. Comprehensive, age-group-based risk-reduction strategies, such as abstinence education and decision-making skills (assertiveness) training, are needed to reduce girls' and young women's engagement in multiple sexual partnerships. Policy interventions, such as anti-FGM legislation and initiatives like the 'Schooling for the Female Child' initiative aimed at reducing social inequality among girls and women, might help decrease FGM and the likelihood of health-compromising behaviours like multiple sexual partnership.

As media coverage plays an important, direct role in shaping official responses to unfolding crisis situations, the aim of this paper was to analyse the portrayal of older people and COVID-19 by mainstream New Zealand news media. We undertook a qualitative document analysis (QDA) of New Zealand coverage during March 2020. From a total sample pool of 482 articles obtained from the database Knowledgebasket, 91 articles met our inclusion criteria. Our analysis of this coverage found that older people were most often referred to as an nameless, homogeneous 'other' group who were overwhelmingly framed as being at risk and passive. Only a third of articles framed older people as active. Older people's agency and ability to navigate threats to their health and wellbeing were under-represented in news coverage. Coverage stigmatised older people as passive and inherently, rather than situationally, vulnerable and neglected the diversity of their social circumstances and intersecting identities, including ethnicity. We conclude this article with suggestions informed by our findings for promoting equitable media coverage of older New Zealanders' in the context of pandemics.

Unfortunately, one in five women in Pakistan has not been using contraceptives and thus bearing unwanted pregnancies. Female's participation in their own matters and benefits from social, economic, and political spheres has remained very low. Gender inequality is often cited as a barrier to improving women's sexual and reproductive health outcomes, including contraceptive use. Pakistan is ranked at 148th place out of the 149 countries in Global Gender Gap Report 2018, which indicates very high gender inequality. Keeping in view this fact, we investigated the impact of women's decision-making autonomy on contraceptive use among married women age 15-49 years in Pakistan. Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2018 data has been used for analysis by using descriptive statistics, association tests, and multiple logistic regression. Women's participation in making four household decisions: access to health care; large household purchases; what to do with the husband earning and freedom to visit family and relatives have been used as women's decision-making autonomy. The results indicated that women's decision-making autonomy has been positively associated with contraceptive use. Women's age, province of residence, education level, household wealth status, number of children, time since last sex, and awareness about family planning services have also been found statistically significantly associated with contraceptive use. The current study suggests integrating the interventions for women's decision-making autonomy into family planning programs. For this purpose, the development of community-based awareness programs for women's decision-making autonomy and contraceptive use could be useful interventions to achieve population equilibrium.

The European Union EIA Directive (2011/92/EU as amended by 2014/52/EU) requires EIAs to consider the effects that a project might have on human health. The International Association for Impact Assessment and the European Public Health Association prepared a reference paper on public health in EIA to enable the health sector to contribute to this international requirement. We present lessons from this joint action. We review literature on policy analysis, impact assessment and Health Impact Assessment (HIA). We use findings from this review and from the consultation on the reference paper to consider how population and human health should be defined; how the health sector can participate in the EIA process; the relationship between EIA and HIA; what counts as evidence; when an effect should be considered 'likely' and 'significant'; how changes in health should be reported; the risks from a business-as-usual coverage of human health in EIA; and finally competencies for conducting an assessment of human health. This article is relevant for health authorities seeking to ensure that infrastructure, and other aspects of development, are not deleterious to, but indeed improve, human health.

Importantly, failing to reach their developmental potential contributes to global cycles of poverty, inequality, and social exclusion. Guided by a rights-based approach, this narrative review synthesizes selected studies and global initiatives promoting early child development and proposes a universal intervention framework of child-environment interactions to optimize children's developmental functioning and trajectories.

They are the primary policy instrument for protecting people's health in the face of rising global temperatures. However, evidence on engagement with health in the NDCs is scarce. In this study, we aimed to examine how public health is incorporated in the NDCs, and how different patterns of engagement might be related to broader inequalities and tensions in global climate politics. Methods We analysed the NDCs in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change registry submitted by 185 countries. Using content analysis and natural language processing (NLP) methods, we developed measures of health engagement. Multivariate regression analyses examined whether country-level factors (eg, population size, gross domestic product [GDP], and climate-related exposures) were associated with greater health engagement. Using NLP methods, we compared health engagement with other climate-related challenges (ie, economy, energy, and agriculture) and examined broader differences in the keyword terms used in countries with high and low health engagement in their NDCs. Findings Countries that did not mention health in their NDCs were clustered in high-income countries, whereas greater health engagement was concentrated in low-income and middle-income countries. Having a low GDP per capita and being a small island developing state were associated with higher levels of health engagement. In addition, higher levels of population exposure to temperature change and ambient air pollution were associated with more health coverage included in a country's NDC. Variation in health engagement was greater than for other climate-related issues and reflected wider differences in countries' approaches to the NDCs. Interpretation A focus on health in the NDCs follows broader patterns of global inequalities. Poorer and climate-vulnerable countries that contribute least to climate change are more likely to engage with health in their NDCs, while richer countries focus on non-health sectors in their NDCs, such as energy and the economy.

However, despite convincing evidence demonstrating that early onset offending is associated with more frequent and persistent offending. understanding how to best identify children at risk of (re)offending is limited, and consistent application of evidence-based interventions specifically targeting this group is lacking. Relative to youth offending, child offending has largely been neglected in child welfare and crime prevention research, policy, and practice. This article outlines recent trends in international child and youth offending and reviews current youth justice issues. It then summarizes research on the characteristics, trajectories, and potential consequences of child offending. Some of the shortcomings in current child welfare and crime prevention policy and practice in effectively addressing the needs of CWHO are highlighted. Overall, this article calls for a spotlight on child offending in research, policy, and clinical practice. Increased attention to CWHO and those at risk of offending is urgently needed for developing more effective identification and intervention strategies, ensuring more positive outcomes for children, families, and communities, and reducing criminal justice costs if we are truly going to address burgeoning prison populations across the globe.

Disparities in pregnancy-related deaths: spatial and Bayesian network analyses of maternal mortality ratio in 54 African countries	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						child health; health policy; health services research; maternal health; epidemiology		BackgroundMaternal mortality remains a public health problem despite several global efforts. Globally, about 830 women die of pregnancy-related death per day, with more than two-third of these cases occurring in Africa. We examined the spatial distribution of maternal mortality in Africa and explored the influence of SDoH on the spatial distribution.MethodsWe used country-level secondary data of 54 African countries collected between 2006 and 2018 from three databases namely, World Development Indicator, WHO's Global Health Observatory Data and Human Development Report. We performed descriptive analyses, presented in tables and maps. The spatial analysis involved local indicator of spatial autocorrelation maps and spatial regression. Finally, we built Bayesian networks to determine and show the strength of social determinants associated with maternal mortality.ResultsWe found that the average prevalence of maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Africa was 415 per 100000 live births. Findings from the spatial analyses showed clusters (hotspots) of MMR with seven countries (Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, Chad and Cameroon, Mauritania), all within the Middle and West Africa. On the other hand, the cold spot clusters were formed by two countries; South Africa and Namibia; eight countries (Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Ghana, Gabon and Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Cape Verde) formed low-high clusters; thus, indicating that these countries have significantly low MMR but within the neighbourhood of countries with significantly high MMR. The findings from the regression and Bayesian network analysis showed that gender inequities and the proportion of skilled birth attendant are strongest social determinants that drive the variations in maternal mortality across Africa.ConclusionMaternal mortality is very high in Africa especially in countries in the middle and western African subregions. To achieve the target 3.1 of the sustainable development goal on maternal health, there is a need to design effective strategies that will address gender inequalities and the shortage of health professionals.

Based on a review of 14 international trauma treatment guidance documents that explicitly mentioned children, we reflect on two areas in which these guidelines can become more inclusive and equitable; a) representation of children's cultural background and b) children's opportunity to have their voice heard. While a few guidelines mentioned that treatment should be tailored to children's cultural needs, there was little guidance on how this could be done. Moreover, there still appears to be a strong white Western lens across all stages of producing and evaluating the international evidence base. The available documentation also suggested that no young people under the age of 18 had been consulted in the guideline development processes. To contribute to inclusion and equity, we suggest five elements for future national guideline development endeavours. Promoting research and guideline development with, by, and for currently under-represented communities should be a high priority for our field. Our national, regional and global professional associations are in an excellent position to (continue to) stimulate conversation and action in this domain.

Racial/Ethnic Heterogeneity and Rural-Urban Disparity of COVID-19 Case Fatality Ratio in the USA: a Negative Binomial and GIS-Based Analysis	JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES			English	Article						Rural-urban continuum; COVID-19 severity; Political inclination; Racial; ethnic minorities; Disease severity; Spatial analysis	GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION; CORONAVIRUS	The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has exacerbated inequality in the United States of America (USA). Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. This study examines determinants of COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) based on publicly sourced data from January 1 to December 18, 2020, and sociodemographic and rural-urban continuum data from the US Census Bureau. Nonspatial negative binomial Poisson regression and geographically weighted Poisson regression were applied to estimate the global and local relationships between the CFR and predictors-rural-urban continuum, political inclination, and race/ethnicity in 2407 rural counties. The mean COVID-19 CFR among rural counties was 1.79 (standard deviation (SD) = 1.07; 95% CI 1.73-1.84) higher than the total US counties (M = 1.69, SD = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.65-1.73). Based on the global NB model, CFR was positively associated with counties classified as "completely rural" (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.12-1.39) and "mostly rural" (IRR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.15-1.38) relative to "mostly urban" counties. Nonspatial regression indicates that COVID-19 CFR increases by a factor of 8.62, 5.87, 2.61, and 1.36 for one unit increase in county-level percent Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian/Pacific Islanders, respectively. Local spatial regression shows CFR was significantly higher in rural counties with a higher share of BIPOC in the Northeast and Midwest regions, and political inclination predicted COVID-19 CFR in rural counties in the Midwest region. In conclusion, spatial and racial/ethnic disparities exist for COVID-19 CFR across the US rural counties, and findings from this study have implications for public health.

One possible option to overcome this challenge is merging the existing health insurance funds together. This article aims to review and compare the experience of South Korea, Turkey, Thailand and Indonesia regarding merging their health insurance funds. Methods This was a cross-country comparative study. The countries of the study were selected purposefully based on the availability of data to review their experience regarding merging health insurance funds. To find the most relevant documents about the subject, different sources of information including books, scientific papers, dissertations, reports, and policy documents were studied. Research databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct and ProQuest were used to find relevant articles. Documents released by international organizations such as WHO and World Bank were analyzed as well. The content of documents was analyzed using a data-driven conventional content analysis approach and all details regarding the subject were extracted. The extracted information was reviewed by all authors several times and nine themes emerged. Results The findings show that improving equity in health financing and access to health care services among different groups of population was one of the main triggers to merge health insurance funds. Resistance by groups enjoying better benefit package and concerns of workers and employers about increasing the contribution rates were among challenges ahead of merging health insurance funds. Improving equity in the health care financing; reducing inequity in access to and utilization of health care services; boosting risk pooling; reducing administrative costs; higher chance to control total health care expenditures; and enhancing strategic purchasing were the main advantages of merging health insurance funds. The experience of these countries also emphasizes that political commitment and experiencing a reliable economic growth to enhance benefit package and support the single national insurance scheme financially after merging are required to facilitate implementation of merging health insurance funds. Conclusions Other contributing health reforms should be implemented simultaneously or sequentially in both supply side and demand side of the health system if merging is going to pave the way reaching universal health coverage.

An individualistic focus on 'health risk behaviours' has resulted in behaviour change strategies that are potentially ineffective and increase inequalities. We conducted a grounded theory study of 25 young adults to increase the limited qualitative evidence base surrounding young people, health risk behaviours and socioeconomic inequalities. We found that health risk behaviours were perceived as class markers, manifesting as class stigma, leading some participants from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to employ strategies to avoid such behaviours. Peers and family were core constructs for understanding the relationship between health risk behaviours and socioeconomic life trajectories. However, individualism and choice were consistently expressed as the overriding narrative for understanding health risk behaviour and socioeconomic position during the transition to adulthood. The use of 'personal responsibility' discourse by young adults, we argue, highlights the need for a public health focus on achieving structural changes as opposed to individualised approaches to avoid reinforcing neoliberal ideologies that serve to marginalise and maintain social inequalities.

Around 10.45 crore (10.45 million) indigenous population that resides in India are at stake because of economic inequality and social stigma. Lack of developmental measures in India has always led the tribal population to dwell at the margins without proper resources of economic sustenance. The announcements of lockdown and proposals for industrial projects approved during the lockdown period further aggravated their conditions. With the help of secondary data, news reports, and international agency reports, the article tries to critically review the conditions of the tribal population in India, the measures taken by the government, and the role of local organizations in helping tribal people to sustain the pandemic.

Unfortunately, progress in reducing pneumonia related mortality has been slow. The number of children with symptoms of pneumonia taken to health facilities for treatment is low in Ethiopia, and disparities among sub-groups regarding health seeking behavior for pneumonia have not been well explored in the region. This study assessed the trends of inequalities in care seeking behavior for children under five years of age with suspected pneumonia in Ethiopia.MethodsUsing cross-sectional data from the 2005, 2011 and 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT), this study investigated the inequalities in health seeking behavior for children with suspected pneumonia. Four measures of inequality were calculated: Difference, Ratio, Slope Index of Inequality and Relative Index of Inequality. Results were disaggregated by wealth, education, residence, and sex with computed 95% Uncertainty Intervals for each point estimate to determine significance.ResultsThe percentage of under-five children with symptoms of pneumonia who were taken to a health facility was significantly lower for children in the poorest families, 15.48% (95% UI; 9.77, 23.64) as compared to children in the richest families, 61.72% (95% UI; 45.06, 76.02) in 2011. Substantial absolute (SII=35.61; 95% UI: 25.31, 45.92) and relative (RII=4.04%; 95% UI: 2.25, 5.84) economic inequalities were also observed. Both educational and geographic inequalities were observed; (RII=2.07; 95% UI: 1.08, 3.06) and (D=28.26; 95% UI: 7.14, 49.37), respectively. Economic inequality decreased from 2011 to 2016. There was no statistically significant difference between male and female under-five children with pneumonia symptoms taken to health facility, in all the studied years.ConclusionsHealth care seeking behavior for children with pneumonia was lower among the poorest and non-educated families as well as children in rural regions. Policies and strategies need to target subpopulations lagging behind in seeking care for pneumonia treatment as it impedes achievement of key UN sustainable development goals (SDGs).

There are concerns increasing restrictions on entitlement to health services have a detrimental impact on access to services and obstetric outcomes, particularly among undocumented migrant women. The study aimed to investigate the experiences of undocumented migrant women who have been pregnant in England, and factors affecting access to care and health outcomes. Methods: We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews June-December 2017 with a purposive sample of migrant women born outside the UK (aged>18) who had experiences of pregnancy and undocumented status (without permission to reside) in the UK, recruited through Doctors of the World (DOTW) UK. Interpreting services were used on request. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Ethical approval: Imperial College London Research Ethics Committee (ICREC reference: 17IC3924). Results: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants, 10 of whom had their first antenatal appointment after the national target of 13 weeks, and nine of whom reported complications. Themes defining women's experiences of pregnancy included: restricted agency, intersecting stressors, and an ongoing cycle of precarity, defined by legal status, social isolation, and economic status. Conclusions: This study provides new evidence of women's experiences of pregnancy in the UK in the context of increasingly restrictive health policies including charging and data sharing. Six recommendations are made to ensure the UK and other migrant receiving countries work towards reducing inequalities and achieving national and global targets for maternal and child health and universal health coverage.

Additionally, it has been challenging for the Brazilian shores that were recently (2019/2020) affected by the most extensive oil spill in the tropical oceans. Monitoring programs and studies about the economic, social and ecological consequences of the oil disaster were being carried out when the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic was declared, which has heavily affected Brazil. For Brazilian seagrasses conservation, this scenario is especially challenging. An estimated area of + 325 km(2) seagrass meadows was affected by the 2019 oil spill. However, this area is undoubtedly underestimated since seagrasses have not yet been adequately mapped along the 9000 km-long Brazilian coast. In addition to scientific budget cuts, the flexibilization of public and environmental policies in recent years and absence of systematic field surveys due to COVID-19 has increased the underestimation of affected seagrass areas and ecosystem service losses due to the oil spill. Efforts to understand and solve the oil spill crisis were forced to stop (or slow down) due to COVID-19 and the economic crisis, leaving ecosystems and society without answers or conditions to identify the source(s) that was/were responsible for this spill, mitigate the damage to poor communities, promote adequate impact assessment or restoration plans, or properly monitor the environment. Our results highlight that pandemic and large-scale environmental disasters may have had a synergistic effect on the economy (e.g., artisanal fisheries and tourism), public health and ecology, mainly due to government inaction, social inequality and poorly studied tropical ecosystems. The results of this study also demonstrate the need to analyze the short- and long-term impacts of the combined effects (oil spill + COVID-19) on the recovery of the economy and coastal ecosystems.

This can occur through multiple pathways including poor diet and inadequate sanitation. In this perspective, we discuss the potential advantages of a syndemic approach to understanding the consequences of food and water insecurity, that is, one that makes possible the assessment of their mutually enhancing effects on health. Syndemic theory considers the concerted, deleterious interaction of two or more diseases or other health conditions, such as psycho-emotional stress, that result from structural inequities. We therefore call for an approach that links localized morbidity of individualor household-level experiences of concurrent food and water insecurity to larger structural and contextual forces/risk environments. Such an approach permits the investigation of food and water insecurity as suites of risk, such that certain disease outcomes serve as signals for interlinked stressors. For example, the use of a syndemic perspective could help explain the persistence of conditions like diarrhea or stunting after food or water interventions; that is, existing approaches may be too narrow in scope to protect individuals from multiple and overlapping environmental and biopsychosocial stressors.

Objective: This article aims to illustrate the status of refugees' access to healthcare and main initiatives to improve their health status in Iran. Methods: This is a mixed-method study with two consecutive phases: qualitative and quantitative. In the qualitative phase, through a review of documents and semi-structured interviews with 40 purposively-selected healthcare providers, the right of refugees to access healthcare services in the Iranian health system was examined. In the quantitative phase, data on refugees' insurance coverage and their utilization from community-based rehabilitation (CBR) projects were collected and analyzed. Results: There are international and upstream policies, laws and practical projects that support refugees' health in Iran. Refugees and immigrants have free access to most healthcare services provided in the PHC network in Iran. They can also access curative and rehabilitation services, the costs of which depend on their health insurance status. In 2015, the government allowed the inclusion of all registered refugees in the Universal Public Health Insurance (UPHI) scheme. Moreover, the mean number of disabled refugees using CBR services was 786 (+/- 389.7). The mean number of refugees covered by the UPHI scheme was 112,000 (+/- 30404.9). Conclusion: The United Nations' SDGs ask to strive for peace and reducing inequity. Along its pathway towards UHC, despite limited resources received from the international society, the government of Iran has taken some fundamental steps to serve refugees similar to citizens of Iran. Although the initiative looks promising, more is still required to bring NGOs on board and fulfill the vision of leaving no one behind.

The desire for robust, evidence-based policymaking in this time of disruption has been at the heart of the multilateral response to the crisis, not least in terms of supporting a continuing agenda for global sustainable development. The role of boundary-spanning knowledge institutions in this context could be pivotal, not least in cities, where much of the pandemic has struck. 'Urban observatories' have emerged as an example of such institutions; harbouring great potential to produce and share knowledge supporting sustainable and equitable processes of recovery. Building on four 'live' case studies during the crisis of institutions based in Johannesburg, Karachi, Freetown and Bangalore, our research note aims to capture the role of these institutions, and what it means to span knowledge boundaries in the current crisis. We do so with an eye towards a better understanding of their knowledge mobilisation practices in contributing towards sustainable urban development. We highlight that the crisis offers a key window for urban observatories to play a progressive and effective role for sustainable and inclusive development. However, we also underline continuing challenges in these boundary knowledge dynamics: including issues of institutional trust, inequality of voices, collective memory, and the balance between normative and advisory roles for observatories.

These challenges are accentuated in underserved patient populations across Europe, who are less likely to receive quality healthcare for reasons including socioeconomic inequalities, educational or cultural status, or geographic location. While there are many local and national initiatives targeted to address these challenges, there remains a need to reduce disparities and improve access to healthcare to improve outcomes, with a focus on multidisciplinary stakeholder engagement. In October 2019, a range of experts in metastatic breast cancer, including healthcare professionals, patient representatives, policymakers and politicians, met to discuss and prioritize the critical needs of underserved patient populations with metastatic breast cancer in Europe. Six key challenges faced by these communities were identified: the need for amplification of the metastatic breast cancer patient voice, better and wider implementation of high-quality guidelines for metastatic breast cancer, more collaboration between stakeholders, tailored support for patients from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, improved data sharing, and work-related issues. The Expert Panel then conceived and discussed potential actionable goals to address each key challenge. Their conclusions present a set of interrelated approaches to address the different challenges and could serve as the basis for concerted improvement of the lives of patients with metastatic breast cancer in Europe.

Methods The numbers of DALYs due to ONIHL, age-standardised DALY rates and national human development index (HDI) data from 1990 to 2017 were collected. The relationship between the age-standardised DALY rates and the 2017 HDI was analysed. A concentration index (CI) and a relative index of inequality (RII) were calculated to evaluate the trend in socio-economic disparity in the burden of ONIHL for the period 1990-2017. Results From 1990 to 2017, the global DALYs due to ONIHL increased from 3.3 to 6.0 million, with the highest growth occurring in low-income countries (110.7%). Age-standardised DALY rates due to ONIHL were negatively associated with the HDI (beta = -0.733, p<0.001), and these rates were significantly higher in countries with a lower HDI. From 1990 to 2017, the trend in between-country inequality was flat with little fluctuation, the CIs stayed near -0.17, and the RIIs remained near 0.35. Conclusions Over the past few decades, low-income countries have experienced the most rapid growth in DALYs worldwide. A widening socio-economic disparity has persisted in the global burden of ONIHL, with a higher burden in lower socio-economic countries. These data suggest that more prevention programmes and healthcare services should be provided for developing countries.

However, while 'formal' (top-down) mhealth programmes continue to face challenges of scalability and sustainability, we know relatively little about how health-workers are using their own mobile phones informally in their work. Using data from Ghana, Ethiopia and Malawi, we document the reach, nature and perceived impacts of community health-workers' (CHWs') 'informal mhealth' practices, and ask how equitably these are distributed. We implemented a mixed-methods study, combining surveys of CHWs across the three countries, using multi-stage proportional-to-size sampling (N = 2197 total), with qualitative research (interviews and focus groups with CHWs, clients and higher-level stake-holders). Survey data were weighted to produce nationallyor regionally-representative samples for multivariate analysis; comparative thematic analysis was used for qualitative data. Our findings confirm the limited reach of 'formal' compared with 'informal' mhealth: while only 15% of CHWs surveyed were using formal mhealth applications, over 97% reported regularly using a personal mobile phone for work-related purposes in a range of innovative ways. CHWs and clients expressed unequivocally enthusiastic views about the perceived impacts of this 'informal health' usage. However, they also identified very real practical challenges, financial burdens and other threats to personal wellbeing; these appear to be borne disproportionately by the lowest-paid cadre of health-workers, especially those serving rural areas. Unlike previous small-scale, qualitative studies, our work has shown that informal mhealth is already happening at scale, far outstripping its formal equivalent. Policy-makers need to engage seriously with this emergent health system, and to work closely with those on the ground to address sources of inequity, without undermining existing good practice.

Race and the spatialisation of risk during the 2013-2016 West African Ebola epidemic	HEALTH & PLACE			English	Article								This paper examines the spatial navigation of risk by international health responders working in Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) during the West African Ebola epidemic. Drawing on Black studies and geographies it argues for a race-conscious analysis o f spatial strategies of risk aversion in order to highlight the geographical, postcolonial and racial inequalities at the heart of the West African Ebola response. Based on interviews with international health responders to Liberia and Sierra Leone, it argues that the spatial organisation of ETCs perpetuated non-equivalence between Black and white lives and contributed to the normalisation of Black suffering and death.

This situation is changing across continents and national and international initiatives are supporting aspiring female surgeons in pursuing the surgical career through mentorship and fellowship programmes. Due to the differences in training programmes, Health Care systems and cultural backgrounds, it's not easy to describe unanimously the pathways and obstacles that junior female thoracic surgeons are experiencing in Europe. The development of female surgical associations, mentorship programmes and national initiatives will further champion the gender equality in this specialty across Europe. During the recent years, the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) has established initiatives like the first ESTS Women in Thoracic Surgery Scientific Session or the annual Women in Thoracic ESTS Reception during the Annual Conference, which are done in an effort to encourage all female colleagues to join this specialty and increase the opportunity to share their experience and meet potential mentors. In this article we will depict the situation in some of the European countries whose female thoracic surgeons have led their way. We aim to give the next generation the examples that can influence women's choice of surgical career, and the possible strategies and initiatives to reduce the gender discrimination within healthcare.

Risk factors for developing diabetes and having adverse outcomes of COVID-19 appear to be similar; metabolic factors (such as obesity), non-White ethnicity and poorer socioeconomic status appear to be risk factors for both. Diabetes and COVID-19 have a significant effect on populations adversely affected by health inequality. Whilst we hope that COVID-19 will be mitigated by widespread use of vaccines, no such prospect exists for mitigating the pandemic of diabetes. In this brief opinion review, I compare risk factors for diabetes and adverse outcomes of COVID-19 and argue that tackling health and social inequality is likely to play a major role in solving the global diabetes pandemic and improve outcomes of COVID-19.

J	Mohan, G				Mohan, Gretta			The influence of caregiver's migration status on child's use of healthcare services: evidence from Ireland	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS			English	Article						children; health services; health&#8208; care use; migrant; parents		Large-scale international migration continues apace. From a health-care services perspective, it is important to understand the influence of migrant heritage on utilization, to allocate resources appropriately and facilitate equity. However, the differences in utilization across different migrant groups remain poorly understood, particularly so for paediatric populations. This paper contributes to filling this gap in knowledge, examining the health-care contact of children for whom their primary caregiver is foreign-born, using longitudinal data from two nationally representative surveys. The study setting is Ireland, which provides an interesting case as a small, open European country, which for the first-time experienced net inward migration in the past two decades. For both cohorts, panel regression models, adjusting for socioeconomic and health indicators, demonstrated lower utilization of general practitioner (GP) services for children of caregivers from 'less-advanced, non-Anglosphere, non-European Union (EU)' nations, relative to native-born counterparts. Relatively lower attendances at Emergency Departments and hospital nights were also observed for this group, as well as for children born to EU (non-UK) caregivers. The insights provided are instructive for policymakers for which immigration is a substantial phenomenon in current and future population demographics.

In 2018 alone, Africa recorded over 400,000 AIDS-related deaths which is more than half of the global total. This reflects years of inequality in the global pandemic response. Also, the international response to AIDS in the early years was very slow, with a global programme only developed 6 years into the pandemic. Many African countries still lack pandemic preparedness plans to handle a global pandemic. Thus, this paper highlights the important lessons that can be learnt from the response to the AIDS pandemic and recommends how they can be applied during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Some of the important lessons include: HIV reversed the previous success recorded in health systems of developing countries; the antiretroviral drug development process was prolonged and required long term commitment; and primary healthcare was crucial in preventing and controlling the disease. These lessons can be utilised in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. It is recommended that: there should be solidarity among the nations of the world to fight COVID-19; health authorities should be proactive in curbing misinformation; and interventions should prioritise human rights and focus on vulnerable communities. HIV treatment services should not be discontinued as it is still an ongoing pandemic. A balance needs to be achieved in combating both pandemics as discontinuation of HIV treatment during the coronavirus pandemic could result in more than 500,000 deaths.

Late initiation of antiretroviral therapy: inequalities by educational level despite universal access to care and treatment	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						HIV; ART or antiretroviral therapy; Late treatment initiation; Universal care; Brazil	RIO-DE-JANEIRO; HIV-INFECTION; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; VIROLOGICAL FAILURE; HEALTH; MORTALITY; STIGMA; BRAZIL; IMMUNODEFICIENCY; DISCRIMINATION	BackgroundLate antiretroviral treatment initiation for HIV disease worsens health outcomes and contributes to ongoing transmission. We investigated whether socioeconomic inequalities exist in access to treatment in a setting with universal access to care and treatment.MethodsThis study investigated the association of educational level, used as a proxy for socioeconomic status, with late treatment initiation and treatment initiation with advanced disease. Study participants included adults (>= 25years) who started treatment from 2005 to 2018 at Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas of FundacAo Oswaldo Cruz (INI/FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Educational level was categorized following UNESCO's International Standard Classification of Education: incomplete basic education, basic education, secondary level, and tertiary level. We defined late treatment initiation as those initiating treatment with a CD4<350 cells/mL or an AIDS-defining event, and treatment initiation with advanced disease as those initiating treatment with a CD4<200 cells/mL or an AIDS-defining event. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was constructed to represent the theoretical-operational model and to understand the involvement of covariates. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Multiple imputation using a chained equations approach was used to treat missing values and non-linear terms for continuous variables were tested.ResultsIn total, 3226 individuals composed the study population: 876 (27.4%) had incomplete basic education, 540 (16.9%) basic, 1251 (39.2%) secondary level, and 525 (16.4%) tertiary level. Late treatment initiation was observed for 2076 (64.4%) while treatment initiation with advanced disease was observed for 1423 (44.1%). Compared to tertiary level of education, incomplete basic, basic and secondary level increased the odds of late treatment initiation by 89% (aOR:1.89 95%CI:1.47-2.43), 61% (aOR:1.61 95%CI:1.23-2.10), and 35% (aOR:1.35 95%CI:1.09-1.67). Likewise, the odds of treatment initiation with advanced disease was 2.5-fold (aOR:2.53 95%CI:1.97-3.26), 2-fold (aOR:2.07 95%CI:1.59-2.71), 1.5-fold (aOR:1.51 95%CI:1.21-1.88) higher for those with incomplete basic, basic and secondary level education compared to tertiary level.ConclusionDespite universal access to HIV care and antiretroviral treatment, late treatment initiation and social inequalities persist. Lower educational level significantly increased the odds of both outcomes, reinforcing the existence of barriers to "universal" antiretroviral treatment.

In an era of unprecedented international migration, meeting the health care needs of growing multicultural or multiethnic societies presents major challenges for health care systems and for health researchers. Considerable literature exists on the methodological and ethical difficulties of conducting research in a cross-cultural context; however, there is a need for a framework to guide health research in multicultural societies. Methods The framework was informed by "research on research" that we have undertaken in community and primary health care settings in Sydney, Australia. Case studies are presented as illustrative examples. Results We present a framework for preferred practices in conducting health research that is culturally informed, high-quality, safe, and actionable. Conclusions The framework is not intended to be universal, however many of its aspects will have relevance for health research generally. Application of the framework for preferred practices could potentially make health research more culturally competent, thus enabling enhanced policies, programmes and practices to better meet population health needs. The framework needs to be further tested and refined in different contexts.

Chronic exposure to hazardous chemicals at work can lead to serious illnesses, contributing to health inequities. In this article, we expand on theories of 'responsibilization' in an occupational health context to reveal how responsibilities for workplace chemical exposures are negotiated by workers and owners in Latinx-owned small businesses.MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews with a total of 22 workers and owners in auto repair shops and beauty salons - two high-risk industries - in Southern Metropolitan Tucson. Participants were asked about their insights into workplace chemical exposures and health. A qualitative analysis team with representation from all study partner organizations collectively coded and reviewed the interview data in QSR International's NVivo 11 and identified overarching themes across the interviews.ResultsWe identified three primary themes: 1) ambivalence toward risks in the workplace; 2) shifting responsibilities for exposure protection at work; and 3) reflections on the system behind chemical exposure risks. Participants discussed the complexities that small businesses face in reducing chemical exposures.ConclusionsThrough our analysis of the interviews, we examine how neoliberal occupational and environmental policies funnel responsibility for controlling chemical exposures down to individuals in small businesses with limited resources, obscuring the power structures that maintain environmental health injustices. We conclude with a call for upstream policy changes that more effectively regulate and hold accountable the manufacturers of chemical products used daily by small business workers.

J	Benatar, S; Gill, S				Benatar, Solomon; Gill, Stephen			Universal Access to Healthcare: The Case of South Africa in the Comparative Global Context of the Late Anthropocene Era	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Universal Healthcare Access; South Africa; Anthropocene; Social Innovation	POWER; TRANSITIONS; MEDICINE; ETHICS; REFORM	Much current global debate - as well as a great deal of political rhetoric - about global health and healthcare is characterised by a renewed emphasis on the goal of universal access throughout the world. While this goal has been achieved to varying extents in the United Kingdom, Canada and many countries in Europe, even within those countries where national health systems have long been in place, the pervasive shift in emphasis from health as a social value to health as a commodity within a capitalist market civilization is eroding the commitment to equitable access to healthcare. Against this background the challenge is much greater in lowand middle-income countries that lag behind - especially if aspirations to universal access go beyond primary care. The challenges of achieving greater equity in access to health and in health outcomes, in a middle-income country like South Africa, illustrate the magnitude of the tensions and gaps that need to be traversed, given the vast differences between healthcare provided in the private and public sectors. Understandably the concept of National Health Insurance (NHI) in South Africa has widespread support. The strategies for how a successful and effective NHI could be implemented, over what time-frame and what it covers are, however, very controversial issues. What tends to be ignored is that sustainable improvement in health in South Africa, and elsewhere, is not determined merely by medical care but more especially by social structures intimately linked to deeply entrenched local and global social, economic and political forces and inequalities. While seldom openly addressed, some of these forces are explicated in this article to supplement views elsewhere, although most have elided emphasis on the pervasive effects of the global political economy on the provisioning and practising of health and healthcare everywhere on our planet.

This study proposes a consolidated framework based on the synthesis of published frameworks for the assessment of primary care organization and performance. Approach: We conducted a review of the literature to identify relevant existing frameworks that aimed to describe PC organization or/and monitor its activities. First, we extracted all domains from the frameworks and then hierarchically organized them into domains, dimensions and elements. Second, we mapped key domains. Third, we grouped together domains covering the same field to build a consolidated framework. Finally, the consolidated framework was assessed by 10 international experts in PC evaluation using a survey. Results: We retained seven frameworks. The consolidated framework comprises four domains: 1) population needs; 2) organization and structure of PC practices; 3) delivery of PC services and 4) patient and population health outcomes. We added five connecting constructs to the framework in order to link the domains: accessibility, appropriateness, productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, equity and integration. None of the previously published frameworks encompassed all domains, dimensions and elements of the new consolidated framework. Conclusion: We propose a consolidated framework of PC organization based on the synthesis of seven published frameworks. This unitary framework may provide a foundation for comparative assessment across various contexts to support researchers and policy makers. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Dental caries experience and associated factors in adults: a cross-sectional community survey within Ethiopia	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Dental caries; Dental caries experience; Oral health; Health system; Ethiopia	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; ORAL-HEALTH; GLOBAL BURDEN; NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES; CARE; INEQUALITIES; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; CHILDREN; FLUORIDE	BackgroundEthiopia is a developing sub-Saharan African country with increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including oral conditions. Oral health and dental care have been given little consideration, and there is limited information relating to population oral health and use of dental services in the country. The aim of this study was to examine the burden and associated factors of dental caries experience and investigate access to dental care amongst adults within Ethiopia.MethodsThis community-based oral health survey is a baseline study for the ASSET - Health System Strengthening in sub-Saharan Africa project undertaken in the Butajira area, south-central Ethiopia. A stratified random sample of households and individuals participated in the study. The survey instruments were mainly based on the WHO Oral Health Survey Methods manual (5(th) ed.). Face-to-face interviews and clinical dental examinations were conducted. The data were analysed for descriptive statistics; and Poisson regression models were built to assess the association of dental caries and predictor variables in adults (>= 18years).ResultsMost of the study population (n=626) were female (63.9%), married (71.4%) and Muslim (76.0%). Just over half (53.2%) lived in rural areas and many (44.4%) had no formal education. A majority (74.0%) reported never utilising dental care services, and the main reason was never experiencing any dental problem (71.3%). Sixty percent (n=377) of the adults had experienced dental caries, 88.0% (n=332) of whom had untreated carious teeth. Pain or discomfort was reported by 16.5, and 7.2% had one or more PUFA component. Most (59.9%) adults with dental caries experience reported tooth pain or discomfort during the last year. In the fully adjusted Poisson regression model, increasing age, dental care utilisation and Khat chewing had positive significant associations with dental caries experience, whilst education status was negatively associated (p<0.05).ConclusionThis study demonstrated a high burden of dental caries and considerable consequences resulting from untreated disease in this population of adults. There was evidence of social inequity, limited utilisation of dental care and oral health awareness. This highlights the need for oral health system strengthening focusing on health promotion and expanding overall access to care.

J	Xiong, YL; Zhang, QZ; Tian, X; Li, HX				Xiong, Yiling; Zhang, Qianzhi; Tian, Xin; Li, Haoxin			Environmental inequity hidden in skewed water pollutant-value fl ows via interregional trade in China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Multi-regional input-output analysis; Structural path analysis; Embodied water pollutants; Value added; Environmental inequity	STRUCTURAL PATH-ANALYSIS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; CARBON; CONSUMPTION; EMISSIONS; TRANSFERS; ENERGY; FOOTPRINTS; FLOWS	Extensive economic growth brings about tremendous water pollutant discharge, which in turn poses great threats to ecosystem and human health, underscoring the vital importance of coordination between economic development and environment. Meanwhile, with the increasing frequency of commodity flows in China, pollutant leakage and the uneven distribution of economic benefits further enlarge the preexisting economic disparities among regions and trigger regional environmental inequities. Therefore, to understand the status quo of the inequities in China, we calculated the regional environmental inequity index (EI) of thirty provinces in terms of water pollution and value added, and further investigated the flow and important paths across provinces and sectors of water pollution and value added by combining multi-regional input-output analysis and structural path analysis. The results showed that northeastern and part of central and northwestern regions suffered from the most serious environmental inequity, while the eastern and southern coastal provinces benefited the most from interregional trade in 2015. Such inequities were driven by the inconsistent net flows of water pollutants and value added, wherein there was a net transfer of water pollutants from developed regions to less developed provinces in northeastern and central China; however, value added was generally transferred among developed provinces and from inland less-developed to eastern coastal developed provinces. Thus, economic and environmental benefits were both more common in developed areas. This skewed relationship can be explained by the uneven spatial distribution of key sectors (i.e., agriculture, food and tobacco, construction and hotel and restaurant), that are generally in high water pollution or strongly demand for water polluted intensive products. Thereinto, the primary flowing path is that high water-polluting but low value-added agricultural products produced by inland provinces are processed for foods, ultimately consumed by developed southeastern region. By investigating the environmental inequities that exist and underlying reasons for them in mainland China, our results provide an empirical basis upon which policy makers can promote coordinated and sustainable development among regions in China.

J	Houidi, A; Paruk, S				Houidi, Ahlem; Paruk, Saeeda			A narrative review of international legislation regulating fitness to stand trial and criminal responsibility: Is there a perfect system?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Legislation for mentally ill offenders; Fitness to stand trial; Criminal responsibility; Insanity defence; Competency to stand trial		Mentally ill offenders have a right to a fair trial and adequate treatment in terms of the law. The diversion of mentally ill offenders between the criminal justice and the mental health care systems is linked to the forensic psychiatric assessment and based on two psycho-legal constructs, fitness to stand trial (FTST) and criminal responsibility (CR). Forensic psychiatric assessment is therefore an important element in criminal law and plays a major role in the court's decisions regarding the sentence, detention, placement, or treatment of mentally ill offenders. The legislation aims to ensure balancing the rights of mentally ill offenders to psychiatric care and society's safety. A narrative overview of the literature summarizing the findings on legislation regulating FTST and CR assessment and their practice in different areas of the world was conducted. It offers insight into the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches and examines the way court proceedings function in these different geographical and psychosocial-legal contexts. This may have policy implications for individual systems and allow countries to consider feasible mechanisms to refine the relevant legislation to improve their practices in forensic psychiatric assessments. Worldwide, relevant legislation is considered as essential in protecting mentally ill offender's right; it has been established for many years regarding specifying the procedures and responsibilities for the mental health care and criminal justice systems. Despite similarities in the principles of the psycho-legal constructs in different countries, there are differences in the way legislations are implemented, often depending on the available resources.

There are a range of interventions aimed at addressing these outcomes, but the international evidence-base remains ambiguous. There is a paucity of methodologically robust systematic reviews of intervention effectiveness, with few considering the contextual conditions under which evaluations were conducted. This is important in understanding the potential transferability of the evidence-base across contexts. The present systematic review will adopt a complex systems perspective to synthesise evidence reporting evaluations of mental health and well-being interventions for care-experienced children and young people. It will address impact, equity, cost-effectiveness, context, implementation and acceptability. Stakeholder consultation will prioritise a programme theory, and associated intervention, that may progress to further development and evaluation in the UK. Methods and analysis We will search 16 bibliographic databases from 1990 to June 2020. Supplementary searching will include citation tracking, author recommendation, and identification of evidence clusters relevant to included evaluations. The eligible population is children and young people (aged <= 25 years) with experience of being in care. Outcomes are (1) mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders; (2) subjective well-being; (3) self-harm; suicidal ideation; suicide. Study quality will be appraised with methodologically appropriate tools. We will construct a taxonomy of programme theories and intervention types. Thematic synthesis will be used for qualitative data reporting context, implementation and acceptability. If appropriate, meta-analysis will be conducted with outcome and economic data. Convergent synthesis will be used to integrate syntheses of qualitative and quantitative data. Ethics and dissemination We have a comprehensive strategy for engagement with care-experienced children and young people, carers and social care professionals. Dissemination will include academic and non-academic publications and conference presentations. Ethical approval from Cardiff University's School of Social Sciences REC will be obtained if necessary.

Yet many energy technologies classified as renewable have human health and livelihood implications that jeopardize the lives and wellbeing of those already most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The purpose of this study is thus to summarize the documented environmental justice (EJ) impacts associated with renewable energy technologies included in many renewable energy policies globally. Our motivation for this study is to ensure that renewable energy policies incorporate concerns for justice into their formulation and implementation. We provide a systematic review of the literature assessing renewable energy technologies from the perspective of distributive, procedural, recognition, and capability interpretations of environmental justice. Our review finds that there are ten common renewable energy technologies that have EJ implications documented in the current literature, and that future energy transition policy development needs to ensure these justice concerns are addressed.

Despite the extra risk Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) groups face in the pandemic, our current medical research system seems to prioritise innovation aimed at people of European descent. We found significant difficulties in assessing baseline demographics in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, displaying a lack of transparency in reporting. Further, we found that most of these trials take place in high-income countries, with only 25 of 219 trials (11.4%) taking place in lower middle- or low-income countries. Trials for the current best vaccine candidates (BNT162b2, ChadOx1, mRNA-173) recruited 80.0% White participants. Underrepresentation of BAME groups in medical research will perpetuate historical distrust in healthcare processes, and poses a risk of unknown differences in efficacy and safety of these vaccines by phenotype. Limiting trial demographics and settings will mean a lack of global applicability of the results of COVID-19 vaccine trials, which will slow progress towards ending the pandemic.

Historically, however, the two fields have operated independently and missed opportunities to build upon their biological and sociocultural linkages. Biological touchpoints connecting the two fields include genital tract infections, menstrual disorders, contraception, and menopause. From a sociocultural perspective, intersections occur in relation to the experience of puberty and menarche, gender norms and equity, education, gender-based violence, and transactional sex. We describe evidence linking menstrual health and SRHR and offer recommendations for integration that could strengthen the impact of both fields.

Outbreak response measures also have immediate and long-term gendered effects. However, gender-based analysis of outbreaks and responses is limited by lack of data and little integration of feminist analysis within global health scholarship. Recognising these barriers, this paper applies a gender matrix methodology, grounded in feminist political economy approaches, to evaluate the gendered effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response in four case studies: China, Hong Kong, Canada, and the UK. Through a rapid scoping of documentation of the gendered effects of the outbreak, it applies the matrix framework to analyse findings, identifying common themes across the case studies: financial discrimination, crisis in care, and unequal risks and secondary effects. Results point to transnational structural conditions which put women on the front lines of the pandemic at work and at home while denying them health, economic and personal security - effects that are exacerbated where racism and other forms of discrimination intersect with gender inequities. Given that women and people living at the intersections of multiple inequities are made additionally vulnerable by pandemic responses, intersectional feminist responses should be prioritised at the beginning of any crises.

Despite the range of testing solutions, over 40% of MSM were not tested for HIV and over 50% for STIs in the past year. Based on international experiments that offer screening solutions via online advertising, the French National Health Agency launched a programme (MemoDepistages) to provide a free self-sampling kit (SSK) for HIV and STIs. This article analyses the sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics of MSM in terms of kit acceptance and sample return. Methods Participants were registered for the programme online after ordering an SSK. The study included men aged over 18 years, living in one of the four selected French regions, and willing to disclose their postal and email address; they had health insurance, acknowledged more than one male partner in the past year, indicated a seronegative or unknown HIV status and were not taking medically prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs. Samples were collected by users and posted directly to the laboratory. Characteristics associated with kit acceptance and sample return were analysed using logistic regression. Results Overall, 7158 eligible MSM were offered to participate in the programme, with 3428 ordering the kit (47.9%) and 1948 returning their sample, leading to a return rate of 56.8% and an overall participation rate of 27.2%. Acceptance and return rates were strongly associated with sociodemographic characteristics, mainly education level but not with behavioural characteristics. Non-college graduates had lower acceptance (44.2%) and return rates (47.7%). Conclusion The programme rapidly recruited a large number of MSM. It removed geographical inequalities related to screening access.

Prizes in Medicine have typically gone to honor foundational knowledge rather than measurable impact. Two recent examples from global health (a rotavirus vaccine, child growth standards) offer alternatives for what might be lauded in medicine. These two examples and historical achievements regarding cholera and smallpox are worthy but do not fall within the scope of Nobel awards for Peace or Economics. The COVID-19 pandemic gives a new context for the idea that discovery and implementation are both keys to medicine. New patterns that redefine achievement in medicine could emerge by Nobel Prize precedent to promote greater health equity and international collaboration.

Life expectancy (LE) and cause-deleted LE were calculated on the basis of life table technique.ResultsThe burden of death from 2002 to 2018 was dominated by cardiovascular diseases (CVD), neoplasms, chronic respiratory diseases and injuries in Jiading district, accounting for almost 80% of total deaths. The overall ASMR dropped from 407.6/100000 to 227.1/100000, and LE increased from 77.86years to 82.31years. Women lived about 3.0-3.5years longer than men. Besides, a cluster of lower LE was found for CVD in the southeast corner and one cluster for neoplasms in the southern corner of the district. The largest individual contributor to increment in LE was neoplasms, ranged from 2.41 to 3.63years for males, and from 1.60 to 2.36years for females.ConclusionsImprovement in health was mainly attributed to the decline of deaths caused by CVD and neoplasms, but was distributed with sex and town. This study served as a reflection of health inequality, is conducive to formulate localized health policies and measures.

The impact of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) on health and wellbeing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): A case study of Kenya	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS; MEDICAL GEOGRAPHY; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; PERCEPTIONS; ELIMINATION	Author summary Wellbeing is currently seen as an avenue that shapes, happiness, productivity, environmental awareness, social inclusion, and justice; however, most countries presently adopting wellbeing measures are in the global north. Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) significantly compromise populations' health and well-being in the global south, causing undesirable effects on the personal, social, and economic capabilities of communities living in endemic regions. As countries work towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is paramount that countries in the global south adopt wellbeing measures and, in doing so, capture the lived experiences of individuals experiencing inequities, particularly as these are shaped by NTDs. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), political and economic power manifests across different scales, determining human-environmental interaction, distribution of resources, and the transmission of infectious agents. This paper uses a political ecology of health approach to identify the political, economic, social and cultural factors that contribute to NTDs, which are among the world's greatest global health problems. The vast majority of people bearing the burden of NTDs reside in low-income countries. Surprisingly, as the economies of the low-income countries improve to middle-income status, NTDs continue to thrive among sub-populations of low socioeconomic status because of the unequal distribution of economic gains. As a result, NTDs are found in environments characterized by poverty and income inequality, and other inequalities in access to health services, housing, safe water, and sanitation. This paper uses political ecology of health in the primarily biomedical field of NTDs to demonstrate that inequities are embedded within the broad political, socio-cultural, and economic systems that exacerbate NTD infection. The study recommends that NTD endemic countries in SSA formulate policies that enhance equity through capacity building and empowerment in order to enhance population wellbeing. Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) remain endemic to many regions of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) left behind by socioeconomic progress. As such, these diseases are markers of extreme poverty and inequity that are propagated by the political, economic, social, and cultural systems that affect health and wellbeing. As countries embrace and work towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the needs of such vulnerable populations need to be addressed in local and global arenas. The research uses primary qualitative data collected from five NTD endemic counties of Kenya: interviews key informants (n = 21) involved in NTD implementation programs and focus groups (n = 5) of affected individuals. Informed by theories of political ecology of health, the research focuses on post-devolution Kenya and identifies the political, economic, social, and cultural factors that propagate NTDs and their effects on health and wellbeing. Our findings indicate that structural factors such as competing political interests, health worker strikes, inadequate budgetary allocations, economic opportunity, marginalization, illiteracy, entrenched cultural norms and practices, poor access to water, sanitation and housing, all serve to propagate NTD transmission and subsequently affect the health and wellbeing of populations. As such, we recommend that post-devolution Kenya ensures local political, economic and socio-cultural structures are equitable, sensitive and responsive to the needs of all people. We also propose poverty alleviation through capacity building and empowerment as a means of tackling NTDs for sustained economic opportunity and productivity at the local and national level.

Pervasive cropland in protected areas highlight trade-offs between conservation and food security	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						conservation; food security; protected areas; area-based targets; CBD	LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES; POPULATION; EXPANSION	Global cropland expansion over the last century caused widespread habitat loss and degradation. Establishment of protected areas aims to counteract the loss of habitats and to slow species extinctions. However, many protected areas also include high levels of habitat disturbance and conversion for uses such as cropland. Understanding where and why this occurs may realign conservation priorities and inform protected area policy in light of competing priorities such as food security. Here, we use our global synthesis cropland dataset to quantify cropland in protected areas globally and assess their relationship to conservation aims and socio-environmental context. We estimate that cropland occupies 1.4 million km(2) or 6% of global protected area. Cropland occurs across all protected area management types, with 22% occurring in strictly protected areas. Cropland inside protected areas is more prevalent in countries with higher population density, lower income inequality, and with higher agricultural suitability of protected lands. While this phenomenon is dominant in midnorthern latitudes, areas of cropland in protected areas of the tropics and subtropics may present greater trade-offs due to higher levels of both biodiversity and food insecurity. Although area-based targets are prominent in biodiversity goal-setting, our results show that they can mask persistent anthropogenic land uses detrimental to native ecosystem conservation. To ensure the long-term efficacy of protected areas, post-2020 goal setting must link aims for biodiversity and human health and improve monitoring of conservation outcomes in cropland-impacted protected areas.

Household Energy Insecurity and COVID-19 Have Independent and Synergistic Health Effects on Vulnerable Populations	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						COVID-19; energy insecurity; household; health effects; health inequity; vulnerable populations		Household energy insecurity (HEINS) is detrimental to the health of the poor and most vulnerable in resource-poor settings. However, this effect amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the uneven implementation of restrictions can create a synergistic burden of diseases and health risks for the most vulnerable in low- and middle-income countries, exacerbating the health equity gap. Based on existing literature, this paper develops three key arguments: (1) COVID-19 increases the health risks of energy insecurity; (2) HEINS increases the risk of spreading COVID-19; and (3) the co-occurrence of COVID-19 and HEINS will have compounding health effects. These arguments make context-specific interventions, rather than a generic global health approach without recourse to existing vulnerabilities critical in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and mitigating the effects of energy insecurity. Targeted international efforts aimed at financing and supporting resource security, effective testing, contact tracing, and the equitable distribution of vaccines and personal protective equipment have the potential to ameliorate the synergistic effects of HEINS and COVID-19 in resource-poor countries.

J	Meyer, S; Reeves, E				Meyer, Silke; Reeves, Ellen			Policies, procedures and risk aversity: police decision-making in domestic violence matters in an Australian jurisdiction	POLICING & SOCIETY			English	Article						Domestic violence; policing; protection orders; policy reforms; risk		Domestic violence (DV) is an issue of global concern, which has been subject to public health and criminal justice reforms for decades. Much attention has been paid to legal responses to DV, specifically the policing of this social issue. Police responses have frequently been scrutinised for not taking DV seriously, not placing sufficient emphasis on perpetrator accountability and not recognising and acknowledging victim survivor preferences sufficiently. The current study examines police responses to DV in an Australian jurisdiction that has been subject to substantial DV-focused policy and law reforms in recent years. Drawing on focus group data from 19 police officers and prosecutors, this article examines the factors that shape police decision making when responding to DV. Findings identify a shift towards more proactive and protective policing of DV, guided by a strong emphasis on operational policies and procedures, risk perceptions and aversity. Findings further reveal limited room for victim preferences in police responses to DV, highlighting the need for specialist DV units to provide holistic and nuanced responses to families affected by DV.

J	Wald, HS; Monteverde, S				Wald, Hedy S.; Monteverde, Settimio			COVID-19 era healthcare ethics education: Cultivating educational and moral resilience	NURSING ETHICS			English	Article						Ethics education; health inequities; moral resilience; professional identity formation; reflective practice	PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY FORMATION; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; STRATEGIES; INTEGRITY; HUMANISM	The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has had profound effects on global health, healthcare, and public health policy. It has also impacted education. Within undergraduate healthcare education of doctors, nurses, and allied professions, rapid shifts to distance learning and pedagogic content creation within new realities, demands of healthcare practice settings, shortened curricula, and/or earlier graduation have also challenged ethics teaching in terms of curriculum allotments or content specification. We propose expanding the notion of resilience to the field of ethics education under the conditions of remote learning. Educational resilience starts in the virtual classroom of ethics teaching, initially constituted as an "unpurposed space" of exchange about the pandemic's challenging impact on students and educators. This continuously transforms into "purposed space" of reflection, discovering ethics as a repertory of orientative knowledge for addressing the pandemic's challenges on personal, professional, societal, and global levels and for discovering (and then addressing) that the health of individuals and populations also has moral determinants. As such, an educational resilience framework with inherent adaptability rises to the challenge of supporting the moral agency of students acting both as professionals and as global citizens. Educational resilience is key in supporting and sustaining professional identify formation and facilitating the development of students' moral resilience and leadership amid moral complexity and potential moral transgression-not only but especially in times of pandemic.

Whereas most studies show a positive association between public spaces and physical activity, there are still mixed results, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The objectives of this mixed-methods study were: (i) to assess the quantitative association between access to public spaces and physical activity; (ii) to assess the modification of the association by public spaces quality, area-level walkability, and social stratifiers; (iii) to explain the quantitative results using qualitative data. Quantitative data were obtained with a household survey in two arid-climate Mexican cities in 2017-2018. physical activity was measured with the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Access to public spaces was measured in buffers centered on survey blocks, walkability with area-level indicators, and public spaces quality with the Physical Activity Resources Assessment. Qualitative data were obtained with semi-structured interviews and neighborhood observation. No quantitative association between access to public spaces and physical activity was found, as well as no interactions between access to public spaces and other variables. Walkability was positively associated with physical activity. Qualitative analysis showed that local public spaces were rarely used by adults because they were perceived as small, unequipped, unattractive, and unsafe.

J	Dong, XW; Ng, N				Dong, Xiaowei; Ng, Nawi			Contribution of multiple pathways to the relationship between visual impairment and depression: Explaining mental health inequalities among older Chinese adults	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Depression; Health inequality; Vision; Older adults; Causal mediation	BODY-MASS INDEX; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; INCOME INEQUALITY; VISION IMPAIRMENT; JOLLY FAT; SYMPTOMS; ASSOCIATION; ORGANIZATION; MORTALITY; RATIO	Background: Though visual impairment is a strong predictor for late-life depression, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper investigated the contribution of material, psychosocial and behavioural pathways in mediating a vision-depression association. Methods: The study used cross-sectional data from the WHO Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE), including 11,531 older Chinese adults. Depression was assessed based on an adaptation of the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Causal mediation analyses using inverse odds ratio weighting (IORW) approach were conducted to assess the mediating roles of material (wealth quintiles and perceived income inadequacy), behavioural (leisure activity, BMI and sleep) and psychosocial factors (social participation, trust and sense of safety). Results: The participants with visual impairment had a 43% higher odds of depression than those with normal vision. In the mediation analysis, the material pathway contributed the most to the total effect, accounting for 31.7% of it. The proportion of the total effect which was mediated by psychosocial and behavioural factors was 24.2% and 22.5% respectively. When these three mediators were considered together in the full model, they accounted for 43.5% of the total effect of visual impairment on depression. Limitations: There still existed unexamined mediating factors. The cross-sectional study design might restrict temporal sequence. Conclusion: Visually-impaired population as high-risk group should be provided better access to screening, diagnosis and treatment of depression. Material, behavioural and psychosocial factors may serve as relevant points of entry for developing intervention programmes to improve the mental health conditions of visually-impaired people.

DesignStatistical modelling of global country- and region-specific data from 2016. SettingGlobal. Participants/CasesThe units of the analyses were countries (n = 180) and regions (n = 4) based on their Human Development Index (HDI). MeasurementsAlcohol-attributable harms [deaths, years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost] and risk relations were based on a recent study using World Health Organization (WHO) estimates for 2016. Human development was measured using the HDI, a summary score of life expectancy, education and gross national income from the United Nations Development Programme. Interactions between HDI and adult per-capita consumption (APC) affecting alcohol-attributable harms were assessed using likelihood ratio tests. Differences in alcohol-attributable harms per litre of APC between HDI groups were assessed using regression analyses and a reference group of low HDI. FindingsAPC is associated with alcohol-attributable deaths, YLL, YLDs and DALYs lost, while HDI is associated with alcohol-attributable deaths, YLL and DALYs lost. Statistical analyses indicated there is an interaction between HDI and APC in their associations with alcohol-attributable deaths, YLL and DALYs lost per 100000 people. The alcohol-attributable burden was highest in low HDI countries, with 11.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 10.75, 12.40] deaths and 495.61 (95% CI = 461.83, 569.23) DALYs lost per 100000 people per litre of APC, and lowest in very high HDI countries, with 4.15 (95% CI = 2.46, 5.71) deaths and 200.31 (95% CI = 122.78, 265.10) DALYs lost per 100000 people per litre of APC. However, no statistical differences between low and very high HDI groupings for these burdens were observed. ConclusionsThere appears to be an interaction between the Human Development Index and alcohol use in their associations with alcohol-attributable deaths, years of life lost and disability-adjusted life years lost but not with alcohol-attributable years lived with disability. Alcohol appears to have a stronger harmful impact per litre of alcohol consumed in lesser developed countries than in developed countries.

The EPA has rolled back environmental protections, lost ground on addressing climate change and environmental justice, and shed large numbers of experienced staff. All of this has accelerated a longer-term decline in EPA resources, expertise, and authority. Here, we present perspectives of EPA employees and retirees on reconfiguring and strengthening the agency to address current and future environmental health problems, based on qualitative data obtained through 100 semi-structured interviews with 76 current and former EPA employees. Interviewees emphasized a number of internal and external issues, including a hyper-partisan context in which the agency operates, lack of public understanding of the extent of domestic and global environmental problems, budget shortfalls, staffing and leadership challenges, reduced scientific capacity and use of science in decision-making, insufficient attention to environmental justice, and lagging technology. We argue that reforms cannot only be expert-driven but must also come from the public, incorporating community driven solutions and focusing on remedying environmental injustice.

Amongst the 2739 respondents, 84 % showed no interest to study abroad after the pandemic. For those respondents who will continue to pursue further degrees abroad, Asian regions and countries, specifically Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan, are listed in the top five, apart from the US and the UK. The pandemic has not only significantly decreased international student mobility but is also shifting the mobility flow of international students. This article also discusses the policy implications, particularly reflecting on how the current global health crisis would intensify social and economic inequalities across different higher education systems.

Over the past decades, TC incidence rates have been increasing. TC quality of care (QOC) has yet to be well understood. We aimed to assess the quality of TC care and its disparities. Methods We retrieved primary epidemiologic indices from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 1990-2017 database. We calculated four secondary indices of mortality to incidence ratio, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to prevalence ratio, prevalence to incidence ratio, and years of life lost (YLLs) to years lived with disability (YLD) ratio and summarized them by the principal component analysis (PCA) to produce one unique index presented as the quality of care index (QCI) ranged between 0 and 100, to compare different scales. The gender disparity ratio (GDR), defined as the QCI for females divided by QCI for males, was applied to show gender inequity. Results In 2017, there were 255,489 new TC incident cases (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 245,709-272,470) globally, which resulted in 41,235 deaths (39,911-44,139). The estimated global QCI was 84.39. The highest QCI was observed in the European region (93.84), with Italy having the highest score (99.77). Conversely, the lowest QCI was seen in the African region (55.09), where the Central African Republic scored the lowest (13.64). The highest and lowest socio-demographic index (SDI) regions scored 97.27 and 53.85, respectively. Globally, gender disparity was higher after the age of 40 years and in favor of better care in women. Conclusion TC QOC is better among those countries of higher socioeconomic status, possibly due to better healthcare access and early detection in these regions. Overall, the quality of TC care was higher in women and younger adults. Countries could adopt the introduced index of QOC to investigate the quality of provided care for different diseases and conditions.

This study examined the association between barriers to healthcare access and implementation of the 2016 WHO antenatal care services model among pregnant women seeking antenatal care in selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods This study considered only Demographic and Health Survey data collected in 2018 in sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, the Demographic and Health Survey data of four countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, Mali, Guinea and Zambia) were used. A sample of 6761 from Nigeria, 1973 from Mali, 1690 from Guinea and 1570 from Zambia was considered. Antenatal care visits, categorized as < 8 visits or >= 8 visits, and time of the first antenatal care visit, categorized as <= 3 months or > 3 months (as per the WHO recommendations) were the outcome variables for this study. Both descriptive statistics and ordinal logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Crude odds ratios (cOR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and p-values < 0.05 were used for the interpretation of results. Results With timing of antenatal care visits, getting money needed for treatment (aOR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.03-1.92) influenced early timing of antenatal care visits in Mali whereas getting permission to visit the health facility (aOR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.15-2.33) motivated women to have early timing of antenatal care visits in Guinea. We found that women who considered getting money needed for treatment as not a big problem in Nigeria were more likely to have the recommended number of antenatal care visits (aOR = 1.38, 95% CI= 1.11-1.73). On the contrary, in Guinea, Zambia and Mali, getting permission to visit health facilities, getting money for treatment, distance to the health facility and not wanting to go alone were not barriers to having >= 8 antenatal care visits. Conclusion Our study has emphasized the role played by barriers to healthcare access in antenatal care utilization across sub-Saharan African countries. There is the need for governmental and non-governmental organizations to ensure that policies geared towards improving the quality of antenatal care and promoting good interaction between health care seekers and health care providers are integrated within the health system.

This study aims to delineate the association between household economic inequalities, and anemia among reproductive age group women in Bangladesh, along with other confounders. Methods A cross-sectional population sample from Bangladesh Demographic and health survey data comprising of 5920 reproductive age group women aged between 15 and 49 years was used in this study. The analyses were performed through the application of proportional odds into four models (viz., Model:1 socio-economic, Model:2 socio-demographic factors, Model 3: diabetics and maternity statis, Model 4: nutritional status.) Results The respondents from low and medium socioeconomic status (SES) households vs. richest households were 1.90 (95% CI, 1.65,2.17; p < .01) and 1.41 (95% CI, 1.12,1.78; p < .01) times more likely to suffer from anemia (Model 1). From the model 2 it appears that he likelihood of being anemic reduces for the low and medium SES groups vs. high SES group when sociodemographic variables are added (OR, 1.69, 95% CI, 1.43,1.99 and OR, 1.35, 95% CI, .07,1.70; p < 0.01, respectively). Model 3 evident that after adding the variables of diabetes and maternity status, the association between having anemia belonging to low and medium SES vs. high SES becomes weaker (OR1.36, 95% CI,0.85,2.15 and OR, 1.15, 95% CI, 0.6,2.19; p > .05, respectively). Moreover, the strength of the association between anemia and the subjects with pregnant vs. the subjects without these (OR: 1.7 (1.12, 4.02; p < 0.05) 1.47(0.11,3.399; p < 0.05) conditions was reduced after factoring body mass index (BMI, model 4). Besides, thin women (MBI < 18.50 Kg/m(2)) shows significantly become more likely to be anemic in comparison to women of normal BMI (OR:1.34, .92,1.96; p < 0.05) (model 4). Conclusions BMI, pregnancy, and diabetes mellitus were observed to be significantly associated with anemia, and the strength of the association was low with anemia and socioeconomic inequality.

Adolescent, caregiver and community experiences with a gender transformative, social emotional learning intervention	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Developmental science; Adolescence; Social emotional learning; Gender equity	CLUSTER RANDOMIZED EVALUATION; PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT; VIOLENCE; GIRLS; PREVENTION; PROGRAMS; BEHAVIOR; TRAUMA; HEALTH; PERIOD	Background Inequitable gender norms, beliefs and behaviors, are shaped by learning experiences during key developmental stages in an individual's life course, and can have negative impacts on health and well-being outcomes. Very early adolescence represents one stage when formative learning experiences about gender inequity can have the potential to support or hinder more equitable gender norms, beliefs and behaviors. The aim of this qualitative study was to evaluate the effect of a gender transformative, social emotional learning intervention for very young adolescents (VYAs) that included experiential learning with peers, parents/caregivers and community members. Methods This study examined the effects of an intervention designed to provide social emotional learning opportunities for adolescents ages 10-11 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The qualitative sample included 279 participants. Qualitative methods included 102 in-depth interviews with VYAs, 22 focus groups with 117 VYAs, 60 in-depth interviews with parents/caregivers and 54 participant observations. A grounded theory approach was used to identify emergent themes. Results Participants reported growth in targeted areas of social emotional mindsets and skills, including a shift in gender norms, beliefs and behaviors. VYAs reported that experiential learning in mixed gender teams provided opportunities to actively practice and reflect on gender norms, beliefs and behaviors. VYAs also reported active practice of social emotional mindsets and skills with peers, parents/caregivers and the community. Parents/caregivers reported changes in VYAs' social emotional mindsets and skills within the home, with the community and with siblings and peers. Both adolescents and parent/caregivers reported positive change towards more equitable gender norms, beliefs and behaviors through participation in experiential learning activities and reflective discussions. Conclusions These findings suggest that an intervention providing social and emotional experiential learning opportunities during the developmental window of very young adolescence can be effective in transforming gender norms, beliefs and behaviors. Involvement of peers, parents/caregivers and community members was effective at supporting learning social emotional mindsets and skills in VYAs. Findings encourage local and global adolescent programming to include gender transformative content paired with social emotional experiential learning with peers, family and the community and can stimulate positive change in gender norms, beliefs and behaviors to promote gender equity.

Household-level quantitative energy analyses enable better understanding regarding interconnections between the level and composition of energy use, and SDG achievement. This study examines the household-level energy footprints in Nepal, Vietnam, and Zambia. We calculate the footprints using multi-regional input-output with energy extensions based on International Energy Agency data. We propose an original perspective on the links between household final energy use and well-being, measured through access to safe water, health, education, sustenance, and modern fuels. In all three countries, households with high well-being show much lower housing energy use, due to a transition from inefficient biomass-based traditional fuels to efficient modern fuels, such as gas and electricity. We find that households achieving well-being have 60%-80% lower energy footprint of residential fuel use compared to average across the countries. We observe that collective provisioning systems in form of access to health centers, public transport, markets, and garbage disposal and characteristics linked to having solid shelter, access to sanitation, and minimum floor area are more important for the attainment of well-being than changes in income or total energy consumption. This is an important finding, contradicting the narrative that basic well-being outcomes require increased income and individual consumption of energy. Substantial synergies exist between the achievement of well-being at a low level of energy use and other SDGs linked to poverty reduction (encompassed in SDG1), health (SDG3), sanitation (SDG6), gender equality (SDG5), climate action and reduced deforestation (SDG 13 and SDG15) and inequalities (SDG10).

Methods: In 2019, a group of Belgian health economic and clinical experts, supported by 2 senior international vaccination experts (1 American, 1 Belgian), convened 4 roundtable meetings to highlight which particular value elements of vaccination remain neglected in economic evaluations. Results: They concluded that the standard economic evaluation framework fails to reflect the full value of vaccination with respect to prevention of complications linked to some vaccine-preventable diseases, health gains for caregivers, herd effects, changes in exposure to and distribution of serotypes, the effect on antimicrobial resistance, productivity gains for caregivers and patients, and the distributive implications of vaccination programs. Conclusions: Here, suggestions are made regarding how these shortcomings can be addressed in future economic evaluations of vaccines and how a more level playing field between vaccines and other health programs can be created.

Intimate partner violence, contextual factors and under-5 mortality: a multilevel analysis of cross-sectional surveys from 20 Sub-Saharan African countries	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						maternal health; public health; health policies and all other topics	CHILD-MORTALITY; FAMILY-STRUCTURE; PREGNANCY; HEALTH; POLYGYNY; PREVALENCE; ETHIOPIA; WOMEN	Background Under-5 mortality remains a public health concern in low-income and middle-income countries. Africa contributes about one-fifth of the burden of global under-5 mortality; intimate partner violence (IPV) and polygyny, which are highly prevalent on the continent, have been linked to under-5 mortality at the individual level. This study examined the relationship between IPV and polygyny as contextual factors and the experience of under-5 mortality among women in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods We used data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 20 African countries with available data between 2010 and 2018 as of April 2020. We defined the experience of under-5 mortality as a woman's loss of at least one child before their fifth birthday. The DHS primary sampling unit was used to define contextual factors. The study involved a multilevel logistic regression analysis of 227 121 women of childbearing age (15-49). Results A quarter (24.5%) of women have lost at least one child under 5 years old, more than two-thirds (40.1%) have experienced at least one form of IPV, and about two-thirds of women were in polygynous union. Our multilevel logistic regression showed that parity, polygynous union and experience of IPV were strongly associated with women's experience of under-5 mortality. The results showed that 39.9% and 19.2% of variances in odds of a woman losing a child before their fifth birthday are attributable to community-level and country-level factors, respectively. Contextual prevalence of IPV, polygynous union and gender equity attenuate the strength of associations observed at the individual level. The interaction between contextual prevalence of polygyny and IPV exacerbates the risk of under-5 mortality. Women in SSA countries with higher Human Development Index were less likely to experience under-5 mortality. Conclusion This study established that beyond individual-level effects, contextual prevalence of IPV and polygyny and their interactions shape women's experience of under-5 mortality in Africa. In designing policies and interventions to address under-5 mortality, contextual factors, especially those linked to culturally laden social norms and practices, must be considered to ensure effectiveness and sustainable impact.

J	Machado, S; Goldenberg, S				Machado, Stefanie; Goldenberg, Shira			Sharpening our public health lens: advancing im/migrant health equity during COVID-19 and beyond	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Public health; Immigrant health; Health equity; COVID-19		Background Differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have brought deeply rooted inequities to the forefront, where increasing evidence has shown that racialized immigrant and migrant (im/migrant) populations face a disproportionate burden of COVID-19. Im/migrant communities may be worst affected by lockdowns and restrictive measures, face less opportunity to physically distance or stay home sick within 'essential' jobs, and experience severe barriers to healthcare. Insufficient attention to experiences of racialized im/migrants in current pandemic responses globally highlights an urgent need to more fulsomely address unmet health needs through an anti-racist, equity-oriented lens. This commentary aims to highlight the need for public health and clinical training, research, and policy to thoughtfully prioritize im/migrant health equity during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Main text Global pandemic responses have neglected im/migrants by continuing to ignore or insufficiently address inequities, exacerbating COVID transmission, xenophobia, and occupational injustice. Deaths, illness, stress, and other negative outcomes of the overlapping epidemics of COVID-19 and structural racism disproportionately borne by racialized im/migrants suggest the urgent need for action. As evidence mounts about how im/migrants have been left behind in times of crises, we need enhanced focus on health equity within COVID-19 research and interventions, including research that examines and pursues structural interventions necessary to mitigate these impacts, and that identifies patterns and harms of xenophobic policy, structural racism, and white supremacy in shaping im/migrant health outcomes. We must also strengthen anti-racist and equity-oriented curriculum within health education, and ensure sufficient attention to the needs of im/migrant communities within public health, clinical, and research training. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated and rendered more visible the deeply rooted health and social inequities faced by racialized im/migrants across diverse settings. We argue for a greater emphasis on equity-focused and anti-racist im/migrant health research, interventions, and training. Policymakers and practitioners must ensure that healthcare policies and practices do not exacerbate inequities, and instead meaningfully address unmet needs of communities, including racialized im/migrants. Ethical and respectful community engagement, commitment and collaboration with global, national, and local communities, policymakers, academics, and educators, as well as accountability across sectors, is critical.

Now known to the world as COVID-19, the devastating disease of what has become a pandemic started its spread from Wuhan, China and swiftly engulfed the whole world with almost 11 million cases, in a span of around six months. It has not only increased the global burden of disease but has heavily dented many social institutions, including education. Methods: This study investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures of lockdown, quarantine, and social distancing have affected students. We look specifically into the effects on individuals' mental health, that is, the stress and anxiety levels of college and university students using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Results: Among 494 respondents, 61% were females, and the majority (77.3%) of the students were in the age group of 19-25 years. Among the respondents, 125 (25.3%), 45 (9.1%) and 34 (6.9%) experienced minimal to moderate, severe, and most extreme levels of anxiety, respectively. The variables of gender, age and year of study were significant at the 0.25 level by univariate analyses. Nevertheless, the ordinal regression indicates that only gender was significant. The odds of a female student being more anxious are higher compared to a male student (OR = 1.779, 95% CI [1.202-2.634], P = 0.004). The most prominent stressors attained from the qualitative feedback from the Pakistani students are associated with online teaching, concerns about their academic performance and completion of the current semester, uncertainty related to exam dates, and the status of the following semester. Conclusions: This study will add to the existing body of literature on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and psychological health of students. The study outcomes will provide basic data for further applied and action research and a framework for universities and policy makers in Pakistan and the neighboring countries in the region with the same cultural contexts. Thus, relevant health interventions can be designed for better mental health and educational attainments of students from higher educational institutions. This pathological pandemic may well lead to another pandemic of mental and behavioral illness. All stakeholders should join force regardless of pre-existing differences and inequalities to ensure the well-being of future generations, specifically students from higher educational institutions. The long-lasting impacts and the aftermath of this pandemic will unquestionably need further and future investigations.

However, a wealth of evidence both from high-income and low-income countries is accruing on the broader consequences of such interventions on economic and public health inequalities, as well as on pre-existing programmes targeting endemic pathogens. We provide an overview of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on hepatitis B virus (HBV) programmes globally, focusing on the possible consequences for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Ongoing disruptions to infrastructure, supply chains, services and interventions for HBV are likely to contribute disproportionately to the short-term incidence of chronic hepatitis B, providing a long-term source of onward transmission to future generations that threatens progress towards the 2030 elimination goals.

During this period, a series of control measures were used including population-wide interventions implemented via a four-level alert system, border restrictions, and a test, trace, and isolate system. Mathematical modelling played a key role in informing the government response and guiding policy development. In this paper, we describe the development of a stochastic mathematical model for the transmission and control of COVID-19 in New Zealand. This includes features such as superspreading, case under-ascertainment, testing and reporting delays, and population-wide and case-targeted control measures. We show how the model was calibrated to New Zealand and international data. We describe how the model was used to compare the effects of various interventions in reducing spread of the virus and to estimate the probability of elimination. We conclude with a discussion of the policy-modelling interface and preparedness for future epidemic outbreaks.

Trends and variations in the global health burden of psoriasis are evaluated by time, age, gender, geographical location, and socioeconomic status, using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from the Global Burden of Disease Study. Methods: The health burden of psoriasis was evaluated by DALYs, which combined years lost to disability (a morbidity component) with years of life lost (a mortality component). The global and national DALYs number, crude DALYs rate, and age-standardized DALYs rate were obtained from the GBD 2017 study database. The corresponding human development index (HDI) was collected from the United Nations Development Programme. Results: From 1990 to 2017, the DALYs number and crude DALYs rate due to psoriasis increased by 73 and 22%, respectively. In comparison, the age-standardized DALYs rate showed a slight increase. Patients in the age range of 65-69 years bear a more significant psoriasis burden. Both males and females showed an increasing trend in burden caused by psoriasis over the past 27 years, with females bearing a more significant psoriasis burden than males. The health burden of psoriasis was substantially unequal in geography with a Gini coefficient of 0.27. The concentration indexes indicated a socioeconomic associated inequality in psoriasis burden with values of 0.22, accounting for 48.64% variance across countries (R2 = 0.4864, p < 0.001). Between-nation inequality in the distribution of psoriasis burden continued to decline throughout the past 27 years. Gini coefficients of psoriasis burden decreased from 0.280 in 1990 to 0.265 in 2017. The concentration indexes indicated the same trend with 0.236 in the 1990s and 0.223 in 2017. Conclusions: Global health progress in psoriasis together with inequality in the past few decades. Although the inequality of psoriasis burden has shown some improvement during the past 27 years, disparities still exist in age, gender, geographical location, as well as socioeconomic status. The findings of this study highlight the global importance of psoriasis and is important in policy planning for psoriasis services on a global scale.

Merely identifying some inequities without understanding all of them can lead to harmful misrepresentations and deepening disparities. Applying an 'equity lens' to bring inequities into focus without a vision to extinguish them is short-sighted. Interventions to address inequities should be as diverse as the pluralistic populations experiencing them. We present the first validated equity framework applied to COVID-19 that sheds light on the full spectrum of health inequities, navigates their sources and intersections, and directs ethically just interventions. The Equity Matrix also provides a comprehensive map to guide surveillance and research in order to unveil epidemiological uncertainties of novel diseases like COVID-19, recognising that inequities may exist where evidence is currently insufficient. Successfully applied to vaccines in recent years, this tool has resulted in the development of clear, timely and transparent guidance with positive stakeholder feedback on its comprehensiveness, relevance and appropriateness. Informed by evidence and experience from other vaccine-preventable diseases, this Equity Matrix could be valuable to countries across the social gradient to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by abating the spread of inequities. In the race to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, this urgently needed roadmap can effectively and efficiently steer global leadership towards equitable allocation with diverse strategies for diverse inequities. Such a roadmap has been absent from discussions on managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and is critical for our passage out of it.

Identifying mechanisms of community engagement in local alcohol decision-making	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY			English	Article						Community engagement; Participation; Policy; Alcohol; Local government; Licensing; UK; Community	SYSTEMS THINKING; HEALTH; POLICIES; IMPACT; AVAILABILITY; PARTNERSHIPS; INDUSTRY	Background: Engaging the community in decisions-making is recognised as important for improving public health, and is recommended in global alcohol strategies, and in national policies on controlling alcohol availability. Yet there is little understanding of how to engage communities to influence decision-making to help reduce alcohol-related harms. We sought to identify and understand mechanisms of community engagement in decision-making concerning the local alcohol environment in England. Methods: We conducted case studies in three local government areas in England in 2018, purposively selected for examples of community engagement in decisions affecting the local alcohol environment. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with residents, workers, local politicians and local government practitioners, and analysed documents linked to engagement and alcohol decision-making. Results: Four rationales for engaging the community in decision-making affecting the alcohol environment were identified: i) as part of statutory decision-making processes; ii) to develop new policies; iii) as representation on committees; and iv) occurring through relationship building. Many of the examples related to alcohol licensing processes, but also local economy and community safety decision-making. The impact of community inputs on decisions was often not clear, but there were a few instances of engagement influencing the process and outcome of decision-making relating to the alcohol environment. Conclusions: While influencing statutory licensing decision-making is challenging, community experiences of alcohol-related harms can be valuable 'evidence' to support new licensing policies. Informal relationship-building between communities and local government is also beneficial for sharing information about alcohol-related harms and to facilitate future engagement. However, care must be taken to balance the different interests among diverse community actors relating to the local alcohol environment, and extra support is needed for those with least capacity to engage but who face more burden of alcohol-related harms, to avoid compounding existing inequalities.

J	Das, R; Banerjee, A				Das, Rituparna; Banerjee, Ankhi			Identifying the parameters for assessment of child-friendliness in urban neighborhoods in Indian cities	JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS			English	Article								The child-friendly city concept is relatively new in India. In 1989, the United Nations endorsed a Convention on the Rights of the Child, which aimed at identifying the important services and rights for every child globally. Subsequently, several other initiatives have been undertaken by various governments at global, national, regional, and city levels, primarily focusing on providing basic services for children, such as education, health care, safety, and sanitation, thereby ensuring social equity and improved quality of life. The initiatives formulated were generic in nature, whereas their successful implementation depended upon viable policy at the micro level; that is, at the neighborhood level in an urban area. Children can be good benchmarks of a livable, healthy city. With the increased rate of urbanization, there has been a considerable decline in accessibility to play areas and recreational and community facilities, coinciding with reduced traffic safety and increased levels of criminal activity. It is thereby imperative to develop places for children within their neighborhoods that will nurture their cognitive ability and physical skills. This study therefore aims to identify the parameters that can be used for further analysis and streamlining methodology for the planning of a healthy and safe, child-friendly metropolitan neighborhood and develop a framework based on the pilot survey, based on the literature review.

AI approaches hold promise for improving health systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health equity within and between countries, we must consider the ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical issues have been identified in relation to AI in the field of health, including from a global health perspective? Methods Eight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts of health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were independently screened by two reviewers and were included if they reported on AI in relation to health and ethics and were written in the English language. Data was charted on a piloted data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was performed. Results Upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the predetermined inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily focused on the ethics of AI in health care, particularly on carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health. The literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility, and bias. Largely missing from the literature was the ethics of AI in global health, particularly in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Conclusions The ethical issues surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex. While AI holds the potential to improve health and health systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of literature on the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also points to a critical need for further research into the ethical implications of AI within both global and public health, to ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for everyone, everywhere.

The extent to which countries succeed in reconciling these goals is context specific but depends largely on how we organize society and on what policy options and strategies we use. We present a model for sustainable development consisting of six indicators and assign thresholds that define a sustainable development space. The distances between the indicator values and their corresponding thresholds constitute the sustainable development gap. We then apply a cluster analysis technique to group 117 countries into six clusters that face similar challenges in closing this gap. Finally, we use illustrative spider web diagrams to assess the performance of these clusters at two points in time. We show that some countries have clearly been better than others at reconciling these goals, and many have reduced their sustainable development gap over time.

Recent research on delivery of psychological services in hospices in the United Kingdom (UK) on a national level, including inequalities or variation in practice, is limited. A nationwide survey will highlight any differences in provision and in doing so help focus future research and inform best practice both within the UK, and internationally. The specific objectives of this survey are to (1) chart the types of psychological support available to adult patients in hospices in the UK in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence model; (2) explore how services are organised; and (3) gather service perspectives on adequacy of care, and facilitators and barriers to appropriate practice. Methods A cross-sectional online survey emailed to adult hospices in the UK in November-December 2019. One staff member involved in the delivery and/or organisation of psychological support was invited to participate per hospice. Of 193 invited hospices, 116 took part. Results Sixteen percent rated their hospice psychological service as wholly adequate. The majority reported that services can access specialist professionals, but many relied on external referrals. Barriers to best practice included funding and staff capacity; facilitators included clear referral structures, audit and appropriate needs and outcome assessments. Conclusions Access to psychological professionals has improved since the last survey 15 years ago, but the majority of responders felt their overall service was not wholly adequate. Basic emotional support is largely felt to be sufficient, but our results indicate a need for improvements in access to more specialist care. Partnerships with external mental health services may be key. Our findings highlight core facilitators and barriers to providing good psychological care at the end of life that should be considered by services both within the UK and on an international level.

Following a focus of transforming Higher Education Institutions, this research analysed the problem that affects undergraduate students in six Spanish universities. The research goal is to improve the life quality of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex university students, breaking the silence that exists around the violence that this group suffer in Catalonia, Spain. Methods Following the Communicative Methodology, this study has identified violence based on sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression in the target universities and provided guidelines to improve anti-discrimination protocols. A qualitative method has reached experiences of university students, heads of equality commissions, professors and administrative staff regarding this conflict. Focussing on the qualitative research tools, 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted with university students and staff around issues related to the violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual transgender, queer and intersex students: 1) perception of violence and discrimination, 2) institutional measures, 3) actions against violence. An analysis of exclusionary and transformative dimensions was used to identify emergent themes. Results We have identified two dimensions for the analysis given their impact in contributing or overcoming violence: exclusionary and transformative. A wide range of forms of violence on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression perpetrated at universities have been identified as exclusionary facts and described by participants in the study. Equality commissions have not received reports of violence based on sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression, and university staff shows certain unfamiliarity regarding the measures and politics to prevent and intervene in cases of violence against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex community. Among the results identified as transformative are the ways through which actions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex groups against violence and the professors' commitment to intervene have a relevant impact on student's wellbeing. An improvement and implementation of anti-discrimination protocols with mandatory applicability has also been documented. Conclusions Findings highlight the need of collecting more evidence that contributes to the improvement of protocols, measures and politics to protect all the members of the university community. A better understanding of violence based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression in HEI's may guide national and international governments to improve the health and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex persons.

However, a significant number of challenges existed prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. The approach here is to align academic and practitioner legal research and illuminate for the business world from a legal perspective what the key commercial risks are for the energy sector in the years ahead. A further aim of this article is to demonstrate to interdisciplinary energy researchers how these commercial risks can influence energy activity and decision-making across the world at local, national and international levels. Often those in science or social science do not realise the vital role law plays in reducing or increasing the risk profile of energy activity. And that, in essence, is what this article aims to address: the knowledge gap around law and risk and how interdisciplinary scholars should understand the issue of commercial risk in the energy sector. This article identifies how commercial risk for the energy sector will change due to what can be classed as 'justice risks'. Resolving these justice risks will be necessary over the lifetime of a project from planning through construction, operation and decommissioning phases. For all stakeholders in the energy sector it is vital that there is a recovery and that new energy projects are built and that they contribute to a country's 2030 energy and climate goals. As the world faces the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19, financial and energy-climate crises, ensuring engagement with justice risks can provide a pathway forward to ensure investors commit to investment. Energy, a key sector in the global economy, will be affected but at the same time can enable economic recovery. It can be stated, therefore, that energy has a dual nature - rather like the health sector - being part of the problem but also the solution to the current financial crises (ie the panacea).

Women may employ strategies to avoid urination or defecation ('holding it') in the absence of safe sanitation, but the practice is not well understood. We quantitatively analyze survey data on women from urban slums across three cities in Maharashtra, India whose households constructed a toilet through an intervention programme. We assess relationships between household versus shared sanitation, perceptions of safety, and women's toilet avoidance behaviours, including diet restriction. At baseline, women have more than three times the odds of reporting avoidance behaviours if they perceive a community toilet to be unsafe, even after controlling for other factors. Household water insecurity is also instrumental in the relationship between avoidance and lack of safety. Finally, avoidance exhibits a significant and major drop upon provision of a household toilet. This study provides substantial support for the prevalence of habitual toilet avoidance among vulnerable urban women without access to safe sanitation. We conclude with recommendations for policy approaches and call for more attention to the health repercussions of habitual toilet avoidance among women as a consequence of sanitation insecurity.

Building Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity Into the Fabric of a New Medical School: Early Experiences of the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article								In July 2020, the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine opened in Pasadena, California, with an inaugural class of 50 students. The school endeavors to address systemic barriers that have contributed to health care and educational disparities in the United States. To realize its vision for change, equity, inclusion, and diversity (EID) have been woven throughout the school. Board members were chosen in part based on their commitment to the core values of EID. The board developed mission, vision, and values statements that explicitly avow a commitment to EID and recruited a dean (and the dean recruited leaders) who espoused and evinced these values. Leaders, faculty, and staff received training to foster an inclusive environment and ensure accountability. The school developed a curriculum that has been thoroughly evaluated for its representative and inclusive content by a team drawn from all departments. The diverse first class, selected through a holistic admissions approach, has access to student support systems that emphasize an appreciation of the distinct experiences and context of each student. The school plans a rigorous evaluation program to assess its performance in EID. Although the school may well fall short of achieving all of its EID objectives, by learning from its experiences and from evidence of others in academic medicine, the school recognizes its opportunity to continue to come closer to achieving its goals and to help shape and contribute to the national and international discourse on EID.

J	Zaidi, Z; Dewan, M; Norcini, J				Zaidi, Zareen; Dewan, Mantosh; Norcini, John			International Medical Graduates: Promoting Equity and Belonging	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article								International medical school graduates (IMGs) play a vital role in the health care system of the United States. They constitute roughly one-quarter of the physician workforce, comprising a significant proportion of the primary care providers in high-need rural and urban areas, where they provide equal and, in some instances, better care than U.S. graduates. Nonetheless, they face a series of hurdles in entering U.S. residency programs and throughout their training experiences. IMGs must expend significant resources to obtain Education Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates certification, which includes Steps 1, 2 Clinical Knowledge and 2 Clinical Skills of the United States Medical Licensing Examination. They encounter the uncertainty of matching and, if successful, obtaining a visa to enter the United States. Once here, they need to adapt to the complexities of the health care system and familiarize themselves with the cultural nuances, professional behaviors, and communication skills of another country. They encounter biases and microaggressions and lack support groups and mentors. Those who choose an academic career are less likely to obtain leadership positions. This Perspective provides an overview of these challenges and highlights opportunities for change at local and national levels. Specifically, it identifies strategies that would assist IMGs before entry, at entry, during training, at the transition to practice, and in practice.

Neoliberalism and Indigenous oral health inequalities: a global perspective	COMMUNITY DENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Indigenous; Corporate determinants of health; Oral health inequalities		Neoliberalism is the dominant ideology underpinning the operation of many governments. Its tenets include policies of economic liberalization such as privatization, deregulation, free trade and reduced public expenditures on infrastructure and social services. Champions of neoliberalism claim that expansion of global trade has rescued millions from abject poverty and that direct foreign investment successfully transfers technology to developing economies. However, critics have urged governments to pay greater attention to how neoliberalism shapes population health. Indigenous populations experience inequalities in ways that are unique and distinct from the experiences of other marginalised groups. This is largely due to colonial influences that have resulted in sustained loss of lands, identity, languages and the control to live life in a traditional, cultural way that is meaningful. Oral health is simultaneously a reflection of material circumstances, structural inequities and access to health services. Indigenous populations carry a disproportionate burden of oral health inequalities at a global level. In this commentary, we contend that neoliberalism has overwhelmingly contributed to these inequities in three ways: (1) increased dominance of transnational corporations; (2) privatization of health and; (3) the neoliberal emphasis on personal responsibility.

J	De Campos-Rudinsky, TC				De Campos-Rudinsky, Thana C.			Intellectual property and essential medicines in the COVID-19 pandemic	INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article								Global justice theorists have widely discussed how the international intellectual property rights regime (i.e., the TRIPs regime of the World Trade Organization) makes it more difficult to achieve the goal of universal access to generic (and more affordable) vital COVID-19 treatments (including potential COVID-19 vaccines). This article argues that while patents can impose certain barriers to universal access to generic COVID-19 treatments, the TRIPs regime itself is an integral part of an equitable global solution to the pandemic. More specifically, it argues that article 31bis of the TRIPs, in allowing for a cooperation strategy predicated on complementary importing and exporting of vital COVID-19 generic treatments, is key for successful pandemic suppression. By providing a normative interpretative analysis of article 31bis in light of the ethical requirements of global justice, and by responding to possible objections to its core argument, this article substantiates the ideal of multilateral solidarity among nations. In times of crisis-not only a crisis of global public health, but also a crisis of multilateralism-this complementary cooperation strategy that article 31bis allows for shows a way forward in upholding the global common good that the international legal order seeks to safeguard.

This paper explores the governance of human resources during the pandemic, looking at the Quebec health system as a revelatory case. We identify three issues related to health human resource (HHR) policies: working conditions, recognition at work and scope of practice. We empirically probe these issues based on an analysis of popular media, policy reports and participant observation by the lead authors in various forums and research projects. Using an integrated model of HHR, we identify major vulnerabilities in this domain. Persistent labour shortages, endemic deficiencies in working environments and inequity across occupational categories limit the ability to address critical HHR issues. We propose three ways to eliminate HHR vulnerabilities: reorganize work through participatory initiatives, implement joint policy making to rebalance power across the health workforce, and invest in the development of capacities at all system levels.

Given this scenario, in the absence of a vaccine or safe and effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, nonpharmacological measures are essential for prevention and control of the disease. However, many of these measures are not feasible for millions of individuals who live in territories with increased social vulnerability. The study aims to analyze the spatial distribution of COVID-19 incidence in Brazil's municipalities (counties) and investigate its association with sociodemographic determinants to better understand the social context and the epidemic's spread in the country. Methods This is an analytical ecological study using data from various sources. The study period was February 25 to September 26, 2020. Data analysis used global regression models: ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial autoregressive model (SAR), and conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the local regression model called multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). Findings The higher the GINI index, the higher the incidence of the disease at the municipal level. Likewise, the higher the nurse ratio per 1,000 inhabitants in the municipalities, the higher the COVID-19 incidence. Meanwhile, the proportional mortality ratio was inversely associated with incidence of the disease. Discussion Social inequality increased the risk of COVID-19 in the municipalities. Better social development of the municipalities was associated with lower risk of the disease. Greater access to health services improved the diagnosis and notification of the disease and was associated with more cases in the municipalities. Despite universal susceptibility to COVID-19, populations with increased social vulnerability were more exposed to risk of the illness.

J	Randall, A				Randall, Alan			Monitoring Sustainability and Targeting Interventions: Indicators, Planetary Boundaries, Benefits and Costs	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainability indicators; planetary boundaries; monitoring; targeting; downscaled planetary boundaries; weak sustainability; strong sustainability; cost minimization; cost&#8211; benefit approach	ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY; TRADE-OFFS; SYNERGIES; INDEX; SDGS	This article shows how sustainability indicators (SIs) which have proliferated, and downscaled planetary boundaries (DPBs) which have recently emerged, can be used to target remedial interventions. I offer an integrative analysis drawing upon the existing literature, challenging, clarifying, and amending it in some ways, and extending it with new insights. The exposition is couched in the example of pollution control, but the analysis also applies to resource management with only modest amendments. Key conclusions are summarized. (i) In a default case where damage is indifferent to location within the problem shed and transactions costs are trivial, minimizing abatement costs requires that all units face the same marginal price of emissions and can be implemented by price setting at the jurisdictional level or cap and trade in pollution reduction credits. Larger geographic scale tends to reduce the average cost of abatement, an argument for coordination at the problem-shed level. Deviations from the default policy may be appropriate for addressing large point sources and local hot spots where damage is concentrated. (ii) A framework winnowing the proliferation of SIs includes the following principles: for quantitative target setting, SIs should address sustainability in its long-term context; SIs should be measured in ratio scale, whereas ordinal-scale SIs are common; and SIs should be selected for their usefulness in mapping the relationships among emissions, ambient concentrations, and damage. (iii) Target setting requires science-based empirical relationships and social values to assess trade-offs between abatement and its opportunity costs and suggest upper limits on tolerable damage. (iv) PBs that address global public goods can usefully be downscaled to set abatement targets. The PBs are science based and, in their original form, propose replacing social values with imperatives: violating the PB will doom the planet, which is unacceptable given any plausible value system. Given that PB = n-ary sumation DPB over all jurisdictions, global trading of credits would minimize costs of honoring the PB. Trade among a willing subset of jurisdictions could minimize the costs of meeting its aggregate DPB. (v) In contrast to most SI approaches, a cost-benefit (CB) approach can deal with substitutability and complementarity among sustainability objectives and evaluate multi-component policies. Net benefits are maximized when the marginal cost of abatement equals the marginal benefit for all units in the problem shed. This can be attained by price setting at the jurisdictional level or trade in credits. (vi) A major advantage of the CB approach is its well-defined relationship to weak sustainability. However, its value measures over-weight the preferences of the well-off. Equity considerations suggest relief from strict CB criteria in the case of essentials such as human health and nutrition, and subsidization by rich countries of sustainability projects in low-income countries.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial correlations between urban characteristics, taking into account the socio-ecological aspects, and the emergence of infectious diseases. Using exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial regression between the infectious disease emergence data and 14 urban characteristics, we analyzed 225 spatial units in South Korea, where there was a re-emergence of measles and a 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. As results of exploratory spatial data analysis, the emerging infectious diseases had spatial dependence and showed spatial clusters. Spatial regression models showed that urban characteristic factors had different effects according to the type of infectious disease. Common factors were characteristics related to low socioeconomic status in water or food-borne diseases and manageable infectious diseases. Intermittent infections disease epidemics are related to high-quality residential environments and the response capacity of the local government. New infectious diseases are different than other infectious diseases, which are related to the ecological environment. This study suggests spatial policies for preventing infectious diseases considering the spatial relationships between urban characteristics and infectious diseases as well as the management of public health.

In order to assist difficult triage decisions, clinicians require clear guidelines on how to prioritise patients. Existing guidelines show significant variability in their development, interpretation, implementation and an urgent need for a robust synthesis of published guidance. To understand how to manage which patients are admitted to ICU, and receive mechanical ventilatory support, during periods of high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic review was performed. Databases of indexed literature (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Global Health) and grey literature (Google.com and MedRxiv), published from 1 January until 2 April 2020, were searched. Search terms included synonyms of COVID-19, ICU, ventilation, and triage. Only formal written guidelines were included. There were no exclusion criteria based on geographical location or publication language. Quality appraisal of the guidelines was performed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II (AGREE II) and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument Recommendation EXcellence (AGREE REX) appraisal tools, and key themes related to triage were extracted using narrative synthesis. Of 1902 unique records identified, nine relevant guidelines were included. Six guidelines were national or transnational level guidance (UK, Switzerland, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand, Italy, and Sri Lanka), with one state level (Kansas, USA), one international (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) and one specific to military hospitals (Department of Defense, USA). The guidelines covered several broad themes: use of ethical frameworks, criteria for ICU admission and discharge, adaptation of criteria as demand changes, equality across health conditions and healthcare systems, decision-making processes, communication of decisions, and guideline development processes. We have synthesised the current guidelines and identified the different approaches taken globally to manage the triage of intensive care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is limited consensus on how to allocate the finite resource of ICU beds and ventilators, and a lack of high-quality evidence and guidelines on resource allocation during the pandemic. We have developed a set of factors to consider when developing guidelines for managing intensive care admissions, and outlined implications for clinical leads and local implementation.

By contrast, a disproportionate care law persists in high-income countries, whereby socially disadvantaged people receive more health care, but of worse quality and insufficient quantity to meet their additional needs. Both laws are caused not only by financial barriers and fragmented health insurance systems but also by social inequalities in care seeking and co-investment as well as the costs and benefits of health care. Investing in more integrated universal health coverage and stronger primary care, delivered in proportion to need, can improve population health and reduce health inequality. However, trade-offs sometimes exist between health policy objectives. Health-care technologies, policies, and resourcing should be subjected to distributional analysis of their equity impacts, to ensure the objective of reducing health inequalities is kept in sight.

Tabletized Supramolecular Assemblies for Sublingual Peptide Immunization	ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS			English	Article						biomaterials; self&#8208; assembly; sublingual tablets; supramolecular assemblies; vaccine		Widespread vaccination is essential to global health. Significant barriers exist to improving vaccine coverage in lower- and middle-income countries, including the costly requirements for cold-chain distribution and trained medical personnel to administer the vaccines. A heat-stable and highly porous tablet vaccine that can be administered sublingually via simple dissolution under the tongue is described. SIMPL tablet vaccines (Supramolecular IMmunization with Peptides subLingually) are produced by freeze-drying a mixture of self-assembling peptide-polymer nanofibers, sugars, and adjuvant. Sublingual immunization with SIMPL tablets raises antibody responses against both a model epitope from ovalbumin and a clinically relevant epitope from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further, sublingual antibody responses are not diminished after heating the tablets for 1 week at 45 degrees C, in contrast to a more conventional carrier vaccine (KLH). This approach directly addresses the need for a heat-stable and easily deliverable vaccine to improve equity in global vaccine coverage.

J	Dobbins, S; Hubbard, E; Leutwyler, H				Dobbins, Sarah; Hubbard, Erin; Leutwyler, Heather			Education Mediates Racial Disparities in Cognitive Impairment Among Older Adults With Schizophrenia	CLINICAL GERONTOLOGIST			English	Article						Aging; cognitive impairment; mediation; racial disparities; schizophrenia; social determinants of health		Objectives: In the general population, the construct of race is associated with disparities in cognitive aging. There are notable racial group disparities and inequities among people living with schizophrenia (PLWSz). Despite the salience of the construct of race in schizophrenia, there remains a knowledge gap about racial disparities in cognitive impairment among older adults in this vulnerable population. Our study uses mediation analysis to examine racial disparities in cognitive impairment among older adults with schizophrenia. Methods: We assess global cognition in PLWSz over age 55 with the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia cognitive test battery in our "all-comer" sample (N = 64). The primary exposure is self-reported racial group. We examine mediation of cognitive impairment through educational attainment, adjusting for psychiatric illness severity, history of substance use, and vascular risk factors. Results: There was a Black/non-Black group racial disparity in global cognitive score (-2.8, 95% CI: -4.4, -1.3) after adjusting for confounding and interaction. This disparity was significantly mediated by years of education. Conclusions: There are notable racial disparities in cognitive impairment among older adults with schizophrenia; however, differences in cognitive scores between racial groups are mediated by level of education. Clinical Implications: Social determinants of health, particularly educational attainment, are important risk factors for cognitive impairment in PLWSz and should be considered by clinicians. Early screening and assessment of cognitive symptoms is essential to addressing health disparities/inequalities among older adults living with schizophrenia.

Less is known about young offenders' perspectives on their own language abilities. The study recruited an opportunity sample of 10 young men in custody at a Scottish youth offending institution who had recent experience of segregation. This mixed-methods study investigated participants' views on their language and communication abilities to inform future support and intervention, and formal language assessment was also administered to investigate indicative prevalence of language disorder within the sample. It focused on their communication with professionals and peers in justice, education and welfare settings. Results of standardised language assessment indicated the presence of language disorder in 44% (n = 4) of the sample (n = 9). Thematic analysis of interview data led to formulation of three themes: Valuing Communication, Literacy and Learning; Exerting Control; and Seeking Support. The first theme is discussed with reference to Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Model. Participants offered reflective and rich views on their lived experience. They provided perspectives on features of successful interaction with peers and authority figures, importance of effective communication and the difficulties they encountered. This study argues for additional communication support for young people in the justice system.

Our Voice Global Citizen Sci Res N	Community-Based Approaches to Reducing Health Inequities and Fostering Environmental Justice through Global Youth-Engaged Citizen Science	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						health inequities; community-based; citizen science; participatory research; youth; health promotion; health equity; digital health; built environment; environmental justice	BUILT ENVIRONMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; 21ST-CENTURY; WALKABILITY; TECHNOLOGY; CHILDREN; SUPPORT; AGENCY	Growing socioeconomic and structural disparities within and between nations have created unprecedented health inequities that have been felt most keenly among the world's youth. While policy approaches can help to mitigate such inequities, they are often challenging to enact in under-resourced and marginalized communities. Community-engaged participatory action research provides an alternative or complementary means for addressing the physical and social environmental contexts that can impact health inequities. The purpose of this article is to describe the application of a particular form of technology-enabled participatory action research, called the Our Voice citizen science research model, with youth. An overview of 20 Our Voice studies occurring across five continents indicates that youth and young adults from varied backgrounds and with interests in diverse issues affecting their communities can participate successfully in multiple contributory research processes, including those representing the full scientific endeavor. These activities can, in turn, lead to changes in physical and social environments of relevance to health, wellbeing, and, at times, climate stabilization. The article ends with future directions for the advancement of this type of community-engaged citizen science among young people across the socioeconomic spectrum.

Unlike other chronic diseases with established strategies for screening, there has been no consensus on whether health systems and governments should prioritize early identification and intervention for CKD. Guidelines on evaluating and managing early CKD are available but have not been universally adopted in the absence of incentives or quality measures for prioritizing CKD care. The burden of CKD falls disproportionately upon persons with lower socioeconomic status, who have a higher prevalence of CKD, limited access to treatment, and poorer outcomes. Therefore, identifying and treating CKD at the earliest stages is an equity imperative. In 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) held a controversies conference entitled "Early Identification and Intervention in CKD." Participants identified strategies for screening, risk stratification, and treatment for early CKD and the key health system and economic factors for implementing these processes. A consensus emerged that CKD screening coupled with risk stratification and treatment should be implemented immediately for high-risk persons and that this should ideally occur in primary or community care settings with tailoring to the local context.

J	Romanis, EC; Parsons, JA; Hodson, N				Romanis, Elizabeth Chloe; Parsons, Jordan A.; Hodson, Nathan			COVID-19 and reproductive justice in Great Britain and the United States: ensuring access to abortion care during a global pandemic	JOURNAL OF LAW AND THE BIOSCIENCES			English	Article							RIGHTS	In this paper we consider the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic is having on access to abortion care in Great Britain (GB) (England, Wales, and Scotland) and the United States (US). The pandemic has exacerbated problems in access to abortion services because social distancing or lockdown measures, increasing caring responsibilities, and the need to self-isolate are making clinics much more difficult to access, and this is when clinics are able to stay open which many are not. In response we argue there is a need to facilitate telemedical early medical abortion in order to ensure access to essential health care for people in need of terminations. There are substantial legal barriers to the establishment of telemedical abortion services in parts of GB and parts of the US. We argue that during a pandemic any restriction on telemedicine for basic healthcare is an unjustifiable human rights violation and, in the US, is unconstitutional.

The association between medical spending and health status: A study of selected African countries	MALAWI MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						healthcare expenditure; mortality rate; maternal deaths; HIV; tuberculosis; African countries	INFANT-MORTALITY; CARE EXPENDITURE; OUTCOMES; DETERMINANTS; REGION; MONEY	Background The report from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that health spending worldwide remains highly unequal as more than 80% of the world's population live in low and middle-income countries but only account for about 20% of global health expenditure. Another report by the WHO on the state of health financing in Africa published in 2013 intimates that countries that are part of their member states are still on the average level in meeting set goals in financing key health projects. Objective The study set out to investigate the association between public and private spending and health status for eight selected African countries, namely Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. Health status indicators include the incidence of tuberculosis, mortality rates, maternal deaths and prevalence of HIV. Methods Descriptive statistics and pairwise correlation are used to assess the relationship between healthcare spending and health status. Random and fixed effect models are further employed to provide insights into the association between descriptive statistics and pairwise correlation. We used annual data from the year 2000 to 2014 obtained from world development indicators. Results The relationship between healthcare spending (public and private) and health status is statistically significant. Public healthcare expenditure has a higher association than private expenditure in reducing the mortality rate, tuberculosis and HIV for the average country in our sample. For example, an increase in public healthcare spending is negatively associated and statistically significant at 5% or better in reducing female mortality, male mortality, tuberculosis and HIV. Private healthcare spending is more impactful in the area of maternal deaths, where it is associated negatively and statistically significant at 1%. An increase in private healthcare spending is linked to a reduction in maternal deaths. We also compared the association between an increase in healthcare spending on males versus females and observed that public health expenditure impacts the health status of both sexes equally, however, private health expenditure provides a greater positive benefit to males. It is worth remembering that two goals of the United Nations agenda on sustainable development are gender equality and ensuring healthcare for all. Conclusion The findings of this research call for the selected African countries to pay more attention to public healthcare expenditure in order to improve health status, especially since private healthcare which provides access to healthcare facilities for some poor people leads to costs that are a burden. So, future research should focus on analyzing components of private healthcare spending such as direct household out-of-pocket spending, private insurance and direct service payments by private corporations as dependent variables to understand what form of private investment should be encouraged.

J	Grant, R; Beasy, K; Emery, S; Coleman, B				Grant, Ruby; Beasy, Kim; Emery, Sherridan; Coleman, Bianca			Beyond 'safety': teachers and school staff approaches to LGBTI-inclusion in Tasmanian schools	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION			English	Article						Gender; inclusivity; LGBTI; sexuality; policy	TRANSGENDER; DIVERSITY; EDUCATION; EXPERIENCES; PROJECT; SUPPORT; YOUTH; QUEER; MODEL; GAY	Australian and international research consistently indicates that inclusive school cultures improve the educational outcomes and health and wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) students. Little is known, however, about how Tasmanian school staff are supporting LGBTI students or the needs of teachers and school staff in creating and sustaining inclusive school environments. To address this knowledge gap, this paper reports on findings from a qualitative inquiry conducted with teachers and school staff. Drawing on Szalacha's (2004. "Educating Teachers on LGBTQ Issues." Journal of Gay & Lesbian Issues in Education 1 (4): 67-79. doi:10.1300/J367v01n04_07.) three paradigms of LGBTI-inclusive education practices, this study found that teachers and school staff employ Safety and Equity approaches in an education system where there is little time or resources given to knowing and understanding relevant policy focused on supporting LGBTI students. We argue that the school staffs perception of school and departmental policy influences how they understand what is expected and what is possible in supporting LGBTI students. Findings from this study point to the need for inclusive education policies that inform and support teachers and foster potential for more critical approaches to equity and diversity.

Is the lack of smartphone data skewing wealth indices in low-income settings?	POPULATION HEALTH METRICS			English	Article						Wealth index; Smartphones; Socioeconomic status; Principal components analysis; Burkina Faso; Health inequality; Development; Household expenditures; Education		Background Smartphones have rapidly become an important marker of wealth in low- and middle-income countries, but international household surveys do not regularly gather data on smartphone ownership and these data are rarely used to calculate wealth indices. Methods We developed a cross-sectional survey module delivered to 3028 households in rural northwest Burkina Faso to measure the effects of this absence. Wealth indices were calculated using both principal components analysis (PCA) and polychoric PCA for a base model using only ownership of any cell phone, and a full model using data on smartphone ownership, the number of cell phones, and the purchase of mobile data. Four outcomes (household expenditure, education level, and prevalence of frailty and diabetes) were used to evaluate changes in the composition of wealth index quintiles using ordinary least squares and logistic regressions and Wald tests. Results Households that own smartphones have higher monthly expenditures and own a greater quantity and quality of household assets. Expenditure and education levels are significantly higher at the fifth (richest) socioeconomic status (SES) quintile of full model wealth indices as compared to base models. Similarly, diabetes prevalence is significantly higher at the fifth SES quintile using PCA wealth index full models, but this is not observed for frailty prevalence, which is more prevalent among lower SES households. These effects are not present when using polychoric PCA, suggesting that this method provides additional robustness to missing asset data to measure underlying latent SES by proxy. Conclusions The lack of smartphone data can skew PCA-based wealth index performance in a low-income context for the top of the socioeconomic spectrum. While some PCA variants may be robust to the omission of smartphone ownership, eliciting smartphone ownership data in household surveys is likely to substantially improve the validity and utility of wealth estimates.

Health technology assessment (HTA) can impact health inequities by informing healthcare priority-setting decisions. This paper presents a novel checklist to guide HTA practitioners looking to include equity considerations in their work: the equity checklist for HTA (ECHTA). The list is pragmatically organized according to the generic HTA phases and can be consulted at each step. Methods. A first set of items was based on the framework for equity in HTA developed by Culyer and Bombard. After rewording and reorganizing according to five HTA phases, they were complemented by elements emerging from a literature search. Consultations with method experts, decision makers, and stakeholders further refined the items. Further feedback was sought during a presentation of the tool at an international HTA conference. Lastly, the checklist was piloted through all five stages of an HTA. Results. ECHTA proposes elements to be considered at each one of the five HTA phases: Scoping, Evaluation, Recommendations and Conclusions, Knowledge Translation and Implementation, and Reassessment. More than a simple checklist, the tool provides details and examples that guide the evaluators through an analysis in each phase. A pilot test is also presented, which demonstrates the ECHTA's usability and added value. Conclusions. ECHTA provides guidance for HTA evaluators wishing to ensure that their conclusions do not contribute to inequalities in health. Several points to build upon the current checklist will be addressed by a working group of experts, and further feedback is welcome from evaluators who have used the tool.

Effective coverage of nutrition interventions across the continuum of care in Bangladesh: insights from nationwide cross-sectional household and health facility surveys	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						epidemiology; international health services; quality in health care; public health; nutrition &amp; dietetics	QUALITY; CHILD	Introduction Improving the impact of nutrition interventions requires adequate measurement of both reach and quality of interventions, but limited evidence exists on advancing coverage measurement. We adjusted contact-based coverage estimates, taking into consideration the inputs required to deliver quality nutrition services, to calculate input-adjusted coverage of nutrition interventions across the continuum of care from pregnancy through early childhood in Bangladesh. Methods We used data from the 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys to assess use of maternal and child health services and the 2014 Service Provision Assessment to determine facility readiness to deliver nutrition interventions. Service readiness captured availability of nutrition-specific inputs (including human resources and training, equipment, diagnostics and medicines). Contact coverage was combined with service readiness to create a measure of input-adjusted coverage at the national and regional levels, across place of residence, and by maternal education and household socioeconomic quintiles. Results Contact coverage varied from 28% for attending at least four ANC visits to 38% for institutional delivery, 35% for child growth monitoring and 81% for sick child care. Facilities demonstrated incomplete readiness for nutrition interventions, ranging from 48% to 51% across services. Nutrition input-adjusted coverage was suboptimal (18% for ANC, 23% for institutional delivery, 20% for child growth monitoring and 52% for sick child care) and varied between regions within the country. Inequalities in input-adjusted coverage were large during ANC and institutional delivery (14-17 percentage points (pp) between urban and rural areas, 15 pp between low and high education, and 28-34 pp between highest and lowest wealth quintiles) and less variable for sick child care (<2 pp). Conclusion Nutrition input-adjusted coverage was suboptimal and varied subnationally and across the continuum of care in Bangladesh. Special efforts are needed to improve the reach as well as the quality of health and nutrition services to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

Violence-related deaths among people released from incarceration: protocol for a systematic review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review						epidemiology; non-accidental injury; public health	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; MORTALITY; HEALTH; PRISON; RISK; HOMICIDE; YOUTH; POSTRELEASE; DETENTION; OFFENDERS	Introduction Young people and adults released from incarceration have a risk of dying from violence that far exceeds that in the general population. Despite this, evidence regarding the incidence, elevated risk and predictive factors for violence-related deaths after release have not yet been synthesised. This information is important to inform the development of evidence-based approaches to effectively prevent deaths from violence in this population. This systematic review will synthesise the literature examining the crude mortality rates (CMRs), standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and predictive factors for violence-related deaths among people released from incarceration. Methods and analysis We searched key electronic health, social science and criminology databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, CINCH, Criminal Justice Abstracts) for peer-reviewed cohort studies published in English on 14(th) September 2020. Our primary outcome of interest is violence-related deaths occurring in the community following release from incarceration. We will not restrict study eligibility by year of publication or age of participants. The Methodological Standard for Epidemiological Research (MASTER) scale will be used to assess the quality of included studies. If there are sufficient studies and homogeneity between studies, we will conduct meta-analyses to calculate pooled estimates of CMRs, SMRs or predictive factors for violence-related deaths. If there is a sufficient number of included studies, meta-regression will be conducted to examine the influence of subgroups and methodological factors on the CMRs, SMRs or predictive factors. If the studies do not report sufficient data, or if there is substantial heterogeneity, findings will be presented in a narrative form. Ethics and dissemination This review is exempt from ethics approval as it will synthesise findings from published studies that have already obtained ethics approval. Our findings will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal article, and national and international conference and seminar presentations.

J	Ferizovic, J				Ferizovic, Jasenka			The Case of Female Perpetrators of International Crimes: Exploratory Insights and New Research Directions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW			English	Article							SEXUAL VIOLENCE; WARTIME RAPE; GENDER; JUSTICE	Although conflicts are often considered to be an exclusively male domain, historical records of conflicts throughout the 20th century show that women also actively participate in warfare- not only as peace activists, humanitarian workers, health care providers, politicians and soldiers but also as perpetrators of crimes. Nevertheless, the participation of women in the commission of international crimes, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, has long been considered an anomaly that falls beyond the 'normal' scope of conflict-related criminality. Consequently, this topic has been deemed marginal in scholarly circles and, until recently, has remained significantly under-researched. This article contributes to the existing research by presenting an original analysis of the characteristics of conflict-related criminality among women and of criminal prosecutions of female perpetrators of international crimes in modern conflicts, primarily focusing on World War II, and the wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. It further offers a first systematic overview and analysis of domestic trials of women prosecuted for international crimes before the courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia.

Moreover, the pandemic is disrupting social fabrics in the conventional way we mourn our deads. In this context therefore, how can psychologists, psychiatrists and other health care professionals help bereaved families and individuals more effectively? This opinion paper proposed five recommendations that cover mental health care needs and challenges which may emerge from the management of these traumatic deaths. In all, efforts to comply with either DSM-5 or ICD-11 PGD guidelines could help COVID-19 bereaved persons with overwhelming distress, as they ensure therapists' use of appropriate terminologies in therapeutic alliances. However, clinicians need to have a global perspective of COVID-19 bereavement courses, political and public health measures due to the pandemic, and flexible attitudes about the ICD-11 and of DSM-5 time-criterion for diagnosis. This paper emphasizes the importance of social and collective recognition of COVID-19 deaths through various symbolic and materialized forms to free up collective and individual capacities for resilience. The necessity of individual and group interventions through online platforms is underscored, however these modes of therapies may not reinforce social inequalities by excluding bereaved individuals who really need them.

To acquire such understanding there is a need for the implementation of different types of technologies based on artificial intelligence (AI) that enable the identification of biomedically relevant patterns, facilitating progress towards individually tailored preventative and therapeutic interventions. Despite the significant scientific advances achieved so far, most of the currently used biomedical AI technologies do not account for bias detection. Furthermore, the design of the majority of algorithms ignore the sex and gender dimension and its contribution to health and disease differences among individuals. Failure in accounting for these differences will generate sub-optimal results and produce mistakes as well as discriminatory outcomes. In this review we examine the current sex and gender gaps in a subset of biomedical technologies used in relation to Precision Medicine. In addition, we provide recommendations to optimize their utilization to improve the global health and disease landscape and decrease inequalities.

HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH			English	Article						Child health; Evaluation; Health systems		Background The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) published their Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) approach to meet its strategic goals of ending preventable maternal, newborn and child deaths and promoting the health and development of all children and reducing inequities in health in 2016. UNICEF commissioned the University of Melbourne's Nossal Institute for Global Health to develop and deliver a pilot blended HSS program, involving 60 hours of online learning and 2 weeks of face-to-face teaching over a 6-month period. To assess the extent to which the HSS program had built the first 83 UNICEF 2017 graduates' capabilities to apply HSS actions by 2017, UNICEF funded an independent evaluator from the University of Melbourne. Methods A mixed-methods assessment was conducted using: online surveys of graduates at: enrolment, completion, 6 months post-HSS program; nine focus groups with graduates at face-to-face workshops; and interviews with purposive samples of UNICEF graduates and graduate Senior Managers 12 months post-HSS program. Results The HSS program content, structure and mode of delivery was positively received. Graduates reported increased confidence taking HSS actions and multiple changes in work practices (e.g., increased systems thinking and using of health system-based approaches). Graduates' Senior Manager interviews revealed mixed impressions of graduates applying HSS actions, partly explained by the fit between the HSS program learnings and UNICEF's workplace environment. Key contextual factors influencing graduates applying HSS actions included: workload; limited opportunities to apply HSS actions; limited HSS examples; and variable support to apply HSS actions. Graduate and Senior Manager suggestions to optimise applying HSS actions included: linking HSS program content with UNICEF priorities; increasing opportunities for graduates to apply HSS actions; increasing access to HSS support. Conclusions The paper concludes by presenting HSS program and assessment suggestions from the 2017 UNICEF Pilot HSS program assessment and actions taken for the 2018 UNICEF staff cohorts by HSS program developers, funders and beneficiaries.

The pandemic has disrupted acute neurology services and routine patient care and has impacted the clinical course in patients with chronic neurological disease. COVID-19 appears to have exposed inequalities of societies and healthcare systems and had a disproportionate impact on already vulnerable communities. The next challenge will be to set up initiatives to stop disparities in all aspects related to COVID-19. From the medical perspective, there is a need to consider inequalities in prevention, treatment and long-term consequences. Some of the issues of direct relevance to neurologists are summarised. With this appraisal, the European Academy of Neurology NeuroCOVID-19 Task Force intends to raise awareness of the potential impact of COVID-19 on inequalities in healthcare and calls for action to prevent disparity at individual, national and supranational levels.

J	Fan, W; Han, SQ				Fan, Wen; Han, Siqi			Explaining Cross-National Variation in the Health Benefits of Tertiary Education: What Are the Roles of the Skills Gap and the Earnings Gap?	EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article							LABOR-MARKET; INEQUALITIES	Recent studies have shown that the relationship between educational attainment and health varies across countries. To better understand the cross-national variation in the health benefits of higher education, we theorize and empirically examine two country-level factors-the skills gap and the earnings gap between adults with tertiary and intermediate education. We expect the skills gap and the earnings gap to moderate educational gradients in health through shaping information transparency and thus affecting labour market and marriage market opportunities, even though men and women may be affected in distinct ways. To test our hypotheses, we analyse a sample of 75,642 women and 68,004 men in 25 countries from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies data. Multilevel linear regression models show that, for women but not men, the relationship between tertiary education and self-reported health is magnified in countries with a greater skills gap; for men but not women, the relationship between tertiary education and self-reported health is magnified in countries with a greater earnings gap. Combined, these results indicate that the educational system, the labour market, and the partner selection process cross-cut and amplify one another to shape the (re)production of health inequalities in gendered ways.

GAP is the difference between them. This study systematically analyzed and projected LE, HALE, and GAP across global regions from 1995 to 2025. Methods We obtained the data of 195 countries/regions on their LE, HALE, and influencing factors from 1995 to 2017. We compared the overall changes of LE, HALE, and GAP Multiple linear regression analysis examined relationships among LE, HALE, GAP, and the associated factors. Using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, we projected trends in LE, HALE, and GAP for 2017-2025. Results During 1995-2017, LE, HALE, and their GAP in 195 countries/regions in the world showed overall increasing trends. Global average LE increased from 66.20 to 72.98 years, HALE from 57.59 to 63.25 years, and GAP from 8.62 to 9.72 years. LE and HALE in North America, Europe, and Australia were generally higher, while Africa had the lowest rates. Females' LE, HALE, and GAP were all higher than males', but females' growth rates of LE and HALE were lower. Different factors were included to project LE, HALE, and GAP, respectively, and prediction results showed that approximately 18% of the 195 countries/regions might achieve improved LE and HALE and lower GAP. Conclusions LE, HALE will likely continue to increase in most of countries and regions worldwide in the future and GAP will further expand. While striving to improve LE and HALE, more attention needs be made to reduce GAP and improve quality of life.

Setting global research priorities for private sector child health service delivery: Results from a CHNRI exercise	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article								Background The private health sector is an important source of sick child care, yet evidence gaps persist in best practices for integrated management of private sector child health services. Further, there is no prioritized research agenda to address these gaps. We used a Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) process to identify priority research questions in response to these evidence gaps. CHNRI is a consultative approach that entails prioritizing research questions by evaluating them against standardized criteria. Methods We engaged geographically and occupationally diverse experts in the private health sector and child health. Eighty-nine experts agreed to participate and provided 150 priority research questions. We consolidated submitted questions to reduce duplication into a final list of 50. We asked participants to complete an online survey to rank each question against 11 pre-determined criteria in four categories: (i) answerability, (ii) research feasibility, (iii) sustainability/equity, and (iv) importance/potential impact. Statistical data analysis was conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary NC, USA). We weighted all 11 evaluation criteria equally to calculate the research priority score and average expert agreement for each question. We disaggregated results by location in high-income vs low- and middle-income countries. Results Forty-nine participants (55.1%) completed the online survey, including 33 high-income and 16 low- and middle-income country respondents. The top, prioritized research question asks whether accreditation or regulation of private clinical and non-clinical sources of care would improve integrated management of childhood illness services. Four of the top ten research priorities were related to adherence to case management protocols. Other top research priorities were related to training and supportive supervision, digital health, and infant and newborn care. Research priorities among high-income and low- and middle-income country respondents were highly correlated. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first systematic exercise conducted to define research priorities for the management of childhood illness in the private sector. The research priorities put forth in this CHNRI exercise aim to stimulate interest from policy makers, program managers, researchers, and donors to respond to and help close evidence gaps hindering the acceleration of reductions in child mortality through private sector approaches.

SWPER Global: A survey-based women's empowerment index expanded from Africa to all low- and middle-income countries	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							AGENCY	Background In 2017, a survey-based women's empowerment index (SWPER) was proposed for African countries, including three domains: social independence, decision making and attitude to violence. External validity and predictive value of the SWPER has been demonstrated in terms of coverage of maternal and child interventions and use of modern contraception. To determine its value for global monitoring, we explored the applicability of the SWPER in national health surveys from low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) in other world regions. Methods We used data from the latest Demographic and Health Survey for 62 LMICs since 2000. 14 pre-selected questions (items) were considered during the validation process. Content adaptations included the exclusion of women's working status and recategorization of the decision-making related items. We compared the loading patterns obtained from principal components analysis performed for each country separately with those obtained in a pooled data set with all countries combined. Country rankings based on the score of each SWPER domain were correlated with their rankings in the Gender Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) for external validation. Results Consistency regarding item loadings for the three SWPER empowerment domains was observed for most countries. Correlations between the scores generated for each country and global score obtained from the combined data were 0.89 or higher for all countries. Correlations between the country rankings according to SWPER and GDI were, respectively, 0.74, 0.72 and 0.67 for social independence, decision-making, and attitude to violence domains. The correlations were equal to 0.81, 0.67, and 0.44, respectively, with GII. Conclusions The indicator we propose, named SWPER Global, is a suitable common measure of women's empowerment for LMICs, addressing the need for a single consistent survey-based indicator of women's empowerment that allows for tracking of progress over time and across countries at the individual and country levels.

The impact of women's empowerment on their children's early development in 26 African countries	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; HEALTH; FOUNDATION; RISK	Background Every year more than 200 million children under-five years fail to achieve their full developmental potential in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although women's empowerment has been associated with improved child health and development outcomes, this is a topic little studied in LMICs. We investigated the associations between women's empowerment and early childhood development among a sample population of 84537 children aged 36-59 months from national health surveys of 26 African countries. Methods We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) ranging from 2010 to 2018. Four developmental domains were assessed among children using the Early Childhood Development Index: literacy-numeracy, physical, learning and socioemotional. Women's empowerment in attitude to violence, social independence and decision-making was evaluated using the SWPER global, a validated survey-based index. We reported effect sizes for each country and a combined estimate of the association. The study covers all countries with surveys in the region and uses a novel approach for measuring women's empowerment, the SWPER. Results Across all countries, 15.1% of the children were on track in the literacy-numeracy domain, 92.3% in physical, 81.3% in learning and 67.8% in sodo-emotional. The odds of a child being on track in literacy-numeracy increased by 34% (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.31-1.37), 88% (OR =1.88; 95% CI =1.85-1.91) and 34% (OR= 1.34; 95% CI =1.29-1.39), with a one standard deviation increase in the scores of attitudes to violence, social independence and decision-making domains of empowerment, respectively. No effect of empowerment was observed for the other domains of child development. Conclusions Our results show a consistent positive effect of empowerment on the literacy-numeracy domain of child development cross-nationally in Africa and this was particularly evident for the social independence domain of the SWPER. Programs and interventions may also consider addressing the reduction of gender inequalities to improve child development.	[Ewerling, Fernanda; Victora, Cesar G.; Coll, Carolina V.

This study examines whether there is a relationship between the burden of these risk factors in countries of specific income bands as defined by the World Bank, and the number of primary studies included in Cochrane Systematic Reviews (CSRs) conducted in those countries. Methods Data was extracted from primary studies included in CSRs assessing two risk factors as outcomes. For each risk factor, data was obtained on its overall burden in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by World Bank Income Levels and examined for a link between DALYs, the number of primary studies and participants. Results A total of 1601 studies from 95 CSRs were included. Only 18.3% of the global burden for A&D is in high income-countries (HICs) but they produced 90.5% of primary studies and include 99.5% of participants. Only 14.2% of the dietary risk burden is in HICs but they produced 80.5% of primary studies and included 98.1% of participants. Conclusions This study demonstrates the unequal out put of research heavily weighted towards HICs. More initiatives with informed contextual understanding are required to address this inequality and promote health research in low and middle-income countries.

Ananya Study Grp	Impact of mHealth interventions for reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health and nutrition at scale: BBC Media Action and the <i>Ananya</i> program in Bihar, India	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; NATIONAL LEVELS; MORTALITY; COUNTRIES; COUNTDOWN; SURVIVAL; COVERAGE; INFANT; EQUITY; TRENDS	Background Mobile health (mHealth) tools have potential for improving the reach and quality of health information and services through community health workers in low- and middle-income countries. This study evaluates the impact of an mHealth tool implemented at scale as part of the statewide reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health and nutrition (RMNCHN) program in Bihar, India. Methods Three survey-based data sets were analysed to compare the health-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours amongst childbearing women exposed to the Mobile Kunji and Dr. Anita mHealth tools during their visits with frontline workers compared with those who were unexposed. Results An evaluation by Mathematica (2014) revealed that exposure to Mobile Kunji and Dr. Anita recordings were associated with significantly higher odds of consuming iron-folic acid tablets (odds ratio (OR)= 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)= 1.8-3.1) as well as taking a set of three measures for delivery preparedness (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.9-4.2) and appropriate infant complementary feeding (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.0-3.5). CARE India's Community-based Household Surveys (2012-2017) demonstrated significant improvements in early breastfeeding (OR= 1.64, 95% CI =1.5-1.78) and exclusive breastfeeding (OR = 1.46, 95% CI=1.33-1.62) in addition to birth preparedness practices. BBC Media Action's Usage & Engagement Survey (2014) demonstrated a positive association between exposure to Mobile Kunji and Dr. Anita and exclusive breastfeeding (58% exposed vs 43% unexposed, P<0.01) as well as maternal respondents' trust in their frontline worker. Conclusions Significant improvements in RMNCHN-related knowledge and behaviours were observed for Bihari women who were exposed to Mobile Kunji and Dr. Anita. This analysis is unique in its rigorous evaluation across multiple data sets of mHealth interventions implemented at scale. These results can help inform global understanding of how best to use mHealth tools, for whom, and in what contexts.

A systematic review and comprehensive legislative framework to address chemical assault globally	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Review						Chemical assault; acid attack; burn; health policy; legislation; global surgery	BURN MANAGEMENT; ACID ATTACKS; PREVENTION; VIOLENCE; WOMEN; GUIDELINES; HOSPITALS; GIRLS	The incidence of chemical assault is increasing globally. In response, a number of countries are proposing legislation. However, current legislative initiatives are uncoordinated and do not address the spectrum of activities to prevent and care for victims of chemical assaults. To fill this gap, we aimed to review legislation, policies and regulations relevant to chemical assault to classify and catalogue current strategies into a legislative framework. Terms related to chemical assault were used to systematically search the academic, lay and legal literatures. Chemical assault was defined as the use of acid or another caustic or corrosive substance or vitriol by one person against another with the intent to injure or disfigure. Reports that described the use of chemical weapons in warfare were excluded. A second search of national legislations of countries with reports of chemical assaults was performed to identify enacted laws and gaps in legislative approaches to chemical assault control. Data regarding relevant laws, policies and regulations were extracted. The findings were used to classify and catalogue current strategies into a legislative framework using content analysis. The search returned 3769 records. Chemical assaults were reported from 104 countries. Using legislation from those countries, a framework consisting of five legislative priorities was developed: (a) apply a public health approach; (b) adopt legal definitions specific to chemical assault; (c) control chemical supply, sales and procurement; (d) facilitate justice; and (e) support survivors. Although many countries have implemented one or more of these legislative priorities, no country has a comprehensive address to chemical assault control. Comparative policy analysis and assessments of the impacts of legislative efforts may further inform strategies to prevent, prosecute and mitigate the impact of chemical assaults. In the meantime, advocacy groups and governments might consider implementation and enforcement of one or more components of this legislative framework to control the growing epidemic of chemical assult.

J	Storeng, KT; Puyvallée, AD				Storeng, Katerini Tagmatarchi; de Bengy Puyvallee, Antoine			The Smartphone Pandemic: How Big Tech and public health authorities partner in the digital response to Covid-19	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Digital health; global health governance; technology public-private partnerships; COVID-19		Digital technologies harnessed through smartphones have been deployed widely to support the response to Covid-19 internationally, often through partnerships between 'Big tech' and telecoms corporations and public health authorities. This paper provides an overview and critical analysis of the rapid rise of such new forms of public-private cooperation, focusing on their manifestation in the European region in the first phase of the pandemic. Drawing on a review of international media and documents, we discuss three main domains of public health action in which private technology companies and public health authorities have converged: contact-tracing, epidemic modelling and public health communication to manage the 'infodemic' of misinformation about the new coronavirus. Critics have raised concerns about how the digital response to Covid-19 may threaten privacy and enable greater state surveillance and control, and the possibility that semi-automated decision-making may exacerbate existing discrimination and inequalities. Our analysis extends such critiques by considering what the digital response to Covid-19 reveals about tech corporations' growing power to influence public health agendas. We discuss how they promote technical solutions to public health challenges that are politically seductive, but that have uncertain effectiveness and societal implications that warrant critical scrutiny.

J	Alexander, SA; Shareck, M				Alexander, Stephanie A.; Shareck, Martine			Widening the gap? Unintended consequences of health promotion measures for young people during COVID-19 lockdown	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						COVID-19; inequalities; youth; physical activity; education	INTERVENTIONS	During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, global measures preventing the spread of the new coronavirus required most of the population to lockdown at home. This sudden halt to collective life meant that non-essential services were closed and many health promoting activities (i.e. physical activity, school) were stopped in their tracks. To curb the negative health impacts of lockdown measures, activities adapting to this new reality were urgently developed. One form of activity promoted indoor physical activity to prevent the adverse physical and psychological effects of the lockdown. Another form of activity included the rapid development of online learning tools to keep children and youth engaged academically while not attending school. While these health promoting efforts were meant to benefit the general population, we argue that these interventions may have unintended consequences and inadvertently increase health inequalities affecting marginalized youth in particular, as they may not reap the same benefits, both social and physical, from the interventions promoting at-home physical activities or distance learning measures. We elaborate on several interventions and their possible unintended consequences for marginalized youth and suggest several strategies that may mitigate their impact.

J	Young, SS; Cocallis, K				Young, Susan; Cocallis, Kelly			ADHD and offending	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION			English	Review						ADHD; Offending; Assessment; Treatment; Crime		Objectives International studies have reported disproportionately higher rates of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) among youth and adult offenders across police custody, prison, probation and forensic mental health settings, estimated to fall at around 25%. This review aimed to investigate the presentation and vulnerabilities of this subpopulation of people with ADHD compared to those with ADHD in the general population and consider how this may impact on the approach to assessment and treatment in this population. Methodology A selective review of the extant literature was conducted to investigate how offenders with ADHD may present differently from their non-ADHD peers in their clinical presentation, criminogenic behaviour and psychological vulnerabilities. Results Nearly all (around 96%) offenders with ADHD have additional comorbid problems, including mood, anxiety, conduct, substance use and personality disorders. Compared with offenders without ADHD, they become involved in the criminal justice system (CJS) at a younger age, have higher rates of recidivism, are more likely to make a false confession, engage in behavioural disturbances in custody, have health risk behaviours and a lower quality of life. Assessing and treating ADHD in this subpopulation may be more complex due to their presentation. Conclusions Offenders with ADHD are disadvantaged within the system by their ADHD symptoms being unrecognised and/or misunderstood; their diagnosis of ADHD may be missed or misdiagnosed. This is at cost to the individual, from both a health and rehabilitative perspective, as well as more broadly to society.

It is well-known that growing up in a socioeconomically disadvantaged context may lead to negative outcomes, both in childhood and in adulthood. Early intervention and prevention programmes are crucial for building resilience and improving health, well-being and equity. Bounce Forward is a school-based prevention programme implemented in Blackpool, a town in the United Kingdom facing multiple challenges. It was part of a whole town resilience approach and nascent global social movement known as the "Resilience Revolution." Between 2017 and 2019, the programme was delivered in all Year 5 classes at every primary school in Blackpool (n(school) = 36), reaching out to 3,134 students (ages 9-10; 50.4% male). The programme aimed to increase resilience in young people by building knowledge and skills about mental health and resilience through 10 sessions. In the current study, we longitudinally examined a range of protective factors, which are relevant to young people's resilience, as well as their mental health outcomes at three time points: before they participated in Bounce Forward, at the end of the programme, and 3-5 months later, when they started Year 6. The current sample included 441 Year 5 students (54.2% male) from 11 primary schools in Blackpool. Nineteen teaching staff also participated in the study and provided qualitative data regarding the impact of the programme on their students. Results showed improvement in some areas of young people's resilience after taking part in Bounce Forward. We also identified gender differences in several protective factors, indicating that boys may need further support. Teaching staff highlighted improvements in various areas; and also observed that their students have been using the strategies that they learnt from the programme. Altogether, findings suggested that young people benefitted from Bounce Forward. The programme is sustainable, offering a free to download teacher resource pack that allows schools to self-deliver it.

Developing an evidence assessment framework and appraising the academic literature on migrant health in Malaysia: a scoping review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review						statistics &amp; research methods; public health; health services administration &amp; management	KUALA-LUMPUR; MANUFACTURING-INDUSTRY; CONSTRUCTION WORKERS; MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; FOOD HANDLERS; SABAH; SEROPREVALENCE; TUBERCULOSIS; PREVALENCE; INEQUALITY	Background A large number of international migrants in Malaysia face challenges in obtaining good health, the extent of which is still relatively unknown. This study aims to map the existing academic literature on migrant health in Malaysia and to provide an overview of the topical coverage, quality and level of evidence of these scientific studies. Methods A scoping review was conducted using six databases, including Econlit, Embase, Global Health, Medline, PsycINFO and Social Policy and Practice. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were conducted in Malaysia, peer-reviewed, focused on a health dimension according to the Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative (BARHII) framework, and targeted the vulnerable international migrant population. Data were extracted by using the BARHII framework and a newly developed decision tree to identify the type of study design and corresponding level of evidence. Modified Joanna Briggs Institute checklists were used to assess study quality, and a multiple-correspondence analysis (MCA) was conducted to identify associations between different variables. Results 67 publications met the selection criteria and were included in the study. The majority (n=41) of studies included foreign workers. Over two-thirds (n=46) focused on disease and injury, and a similar number (n=46) had descriptive designs. The average quality of the papers was low, yet quality differed significantly among them. The MCA showed that high-quality studies were mostly qualitative designs that included refugees and focused on living conditions, while prevalence and analytical cross-sectional studies were mostly of low quality. Conclusion This study provides an overview of the scientific literature on migrant health in Malaysia published between 1965 and 2019. In general, the quality of these studies is low, and various health dimensions have not been thoroughly researched. Therefore, researchers should address these issues to improve the evidence base to support policy-makers with high-quality evidence for decision-making.

J	Kinshella, MLW; Moore, SE; Elango, R				Kinshella, Mai-Lei Woo; Moore, Sophie E.; Elango, Rajavel			Beyond Reproduction: The "First 1,000 Days" Approach to Nutrition through a Gendered Rights-Based Lens	HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS			English	Article							CHILD UNDERNUTRITION; HEALTH; WOMEN; INTERVENTIONS; PREGNANCY; MORTALITY; MOVEMENT; OUTCOMES; ORIGINS	The First 1,000 Days approach highlights the importance of adequate nutrition in early life-from conception to a child's second birthday-for good development and growth throughout the child's life and potentially onto their own offspring. The approach has been highly influential in mobilizing policy attention and resources to improve maternal and infant nutrition in global health and development. This paper undertakes a critical review of this approach from a gendered human rights lens, finding that the theoretical underpinnings implicitly reflect and reproduce gender biases by conceptualizing women within a limited scope of reproduction and child care. We explore the processes of systemic neglect through Pierre Bourdieu's theories on how social structures are reproduced. Understanding theory is important to the governance of global health, how we frame priorities, and how we act on them. Revisiting influential theories is a means of accountability to ensure inclusiveness and to reduce gender and health inequities in research. We argue that a greater focus on women could increase the potential impact of nutrition interventions.

Yet the actual content of an HRBA to health remains unspecific, and therefore implementation remains heterogeneous. This situation is even more challenging in the field of mental health, where human rights considerations are particularly complex and have emerged out of a history of myriad violations. Even when research has been conducted into mental health, it has focused predominantly on the Global North, raising questions of contextual and cultural relevance. Accordingly, this study examined the issue from the perspectives of stakeholders in Kenya who consider their work or the services they use to be rights based. It explored the key principles and interventions deemed to constitute an HRBA to mental health care and psychosocial support, the perceived benefits of such approaches, and the main barriers and supports relevant for implementation. The results produced seven key principles and corresponding interventions. Among other things, it highlighted the importance of economic well-being and self-efficacy, as well as the reduction of barriers to implementation, such as stigma and lack of adequate resourcing. Two key tensions were apparent-namely, the un/acceptability of coercion and the role of traditional and faith-based modalities in an HRBA to mental health care and psychosocial support.

Characterizing mothers and children at risk of being under-immunized in India: A latent class analysis approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Immunization; Inequalities; India; Child health; Latent class analysis	VACCINE HESITANCY; STRATEGIES; EDUCATION	Objectives: While India has made substantial progress in introducing new vaccines and scaling up immunization coverage, inequities persist sub-nationally. This study was performed to investigate the risk of under-immunization based on class membership and to identify heterogeneous classes based on sociodemographic characteristics in pediatric and maternal populations in India through latent class analysis. Methods: Data from the most recent National Family Health Survey conducted in 2015-2016 were used. Latent class analysis was used to model immunization coverage in children aged 12-23 months and mothers, and to identify subgroups to characterize those at risk of not being immunized. Results: Patterns of sociodemographic characteristics were found to contribute to non-immunization or under-immunization among pediatric and maternal populations in India. Individuals who fit into one of three categories were identified in both populations: those at high, medium, and lower risk of not being immunized. Lower socioeconomic status, lack of antenatal care, and lower maternal education put individuals at higher risk of not being immunized with routine childhood vaccines and maternal tetanus toxoid. Conclusions: Predisposing risk factors can persistently impact immunization status despite improvements in immunization access in India. Tailored programmatic interventions should be developed to improve immunization coverage among those children and mothers who are at highest risk of being underimmunized or not immunized.

While much of the previous literature highlights these factors individually, there is a lack of comprehensive synthesis regarding how the factors interact to influence the health of refugee women. We conducted a thematic analysis in our literature review to elucidate how providers can work with refugee women to prevent adverse health outcomes and intervene at multiple levels to improve their health outcomes after resettlement. We reviewed peer-reviewed literature from 2009 to 2019 from Google Scholar, JSTOR, Global Health, PubMed, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, and Social Service Abstracts, and also used citation chaining, to identify relevant information pertaining to refugee women's health. The key terms used for our literature review were, health care, violence, social support, and mental health. In total, we included 52 articles, 3 books, and 8 other sources. We found that refugee women are vulnerable to violence during migration and typically have high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder. There were also concerns of secondary victimization by providers after resettlement. We also found that social support is an important factor for reducing isolation, and improving access to health care, as well as improving mental health outcomes. However, social support was often difficult to maintain, and was moderated by factors such as English language fluency. Health care was influenced by health literacy, cultural difference, communication concerns, and access issues. The findings suggest that at the individual and interpersonal levels there is a need to address language barriers, improve provider-patient communication, and provide appropriate medical and mental health screenings. At the organizational level, inter-organizational communication and awareness are vital. At the community level, providers can work with community leaders, to educate, create dialogue and collaboration, to help facilitate understanding and bolster community social support. Improved communication and knowledge about the unique needs and concerns of refugee women through an integrated, multi-system approach is necessary to improve their health outcomes.

Stunting leads to several consequences on child survival, growth, and development. The absolute level of stunting has been decreasing in Tanzania from from 50% in 1991/92 to 34% in 2016 although the prevalence is still high (34%)Stunting varyies across socioeconomic determinants with a larger burden among the socioeconomic disadvantaged group. The reduction of inequalities in stunting is very crucial as we aim to reduce stunting to 28% by 2021 and hence attain zero malnutrition by 2030 under Sustainable Development Goal 2.2.This study aimed at determining the trend, contributing factors and changes of inequalities in stunting among children aged 3-59months from 2004 to 2016.MethodsData were drawn from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys. The concentration index (CIX) was used to quantify the magnitude of inequalities in stunting. The pooled Poisson regression model was used to determine the factors for stunting, decision criterion for significant determinants was at 5% level of significance. The CIX was decomposed using the Wagstaff and Watanabe decomposition methods., the percentage contribution of each factor to the toal concentration index was used to rank the factors for socioeconomic inequalities in stutning.ResultsInequalities in stunting were significantly concentrated among the poor; evidenced by CIX=-0.019 (p<0.001) in 2004, -0.018 (p<0.001) in 2010 and-0.0096 (p<0.001) in 2015. There was insignificant decline in inequalities in stunting; the difference in CIX from 2004 to 2010 was 0.0015 (p =0.7658), from 2010 to 2015/6 was -0.0081 (p =0.1145). The overall change in CIX from 2004 to 2015/6 was 0.00965 (p =0.0538). Disparities in the distribution of wealth index (mean contribution >84.7%) and maternal years of schooling (mean contribution >22.4%) had positive impacts on the levels of inequalities in stunting for all surveyed years. Rural-urban differences reduced inequalities in stunting although the contribution changed over time.ConclusionInequalities in stunting declined, differentials in wealth index and maternal education had increased contribution to the levels of inequalities in stunting. Reducing stunting among the disadvantaged groups requires initiatives which should be embarked on the distribution of social services including maternal and reproductive education among women of reproductive age, water and health infrastructures in remote areas.

Effects of trees, gardens, and nature trails on heat index and child health: design and methods of the Green Schoolyards Project	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Health equity; School physical activity; Climate change adaptation; Urban Heat Islands; Temperature; Playgrounds; Joint-use parks; Outdoor nature play	LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; AIR-TEMPERATURE; URBAN; RESILIENCE; OBESITY; IMPACT	BackgroundLatinx children in the United States are at high risk for nature-deficit disorder, heat-related illness, and physical inactivity. We developed the Green Schoolyards Project to investigate how green features-trees, gardens, and nature trails-in school parks impact heat index (i.e., air temperature and relative humidity) within parks, and physical activity levels and socioemotional well-being of these children. Herein, we present novel methods for a) observing children's interaction with green features and b) measuring heat index and children's behaviors in a natural setting, and a selection of baseline results.MethodsDuring two September weeks (high temperature) and one November week (moderate temperature) in 2019, we examined three joint-use elementary school parks in Central Texas, United States, serving predominantly low-income Latinx families. To develop thermal profiles for each park, we installed 10 air temperature/relative humidity sensors per park, selecting sites based on land cover, land use, and even spatial coverage. We measured green features within a geographic information system. In a cross-sectional study, we used an adapted version of System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) to assess children's physical activity levels and interactions with green features. In a cohort study, we equipped 30 3rd and 30 4th grade students per school during recess with accelerometers and Global Positioning System devices, and surveyed these students regarding their connection to nature. Baseline analyses included inverse distance weighting for thermal profiles and summing observed counts of children interacting with trees.ResultsIn September 2019, average daily heat index ranged 2.0 degrees F among park sites, and maximum daily heat index ranged from 103.4 degrees F (air temperature = 33.8 degrees C; relative humidity = 55.2%) under tree canopy to 114.1 degrees F (air temperature = 37.9 degrees C; relative humidity = 45.2%) on an unshaded playground. 10.8% more girls and 25.4% more boys interacted with trees in September than in November.ConclusionsWe found extreme heat conditions at select sites within parks, and children positioning themselves under trees during periods of high heat index. These methods can be used by public health researchers and practitioners to inform the redesign of greenspaces in the face of climate change and health inequities.

Space-time risk cluster of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazilian endemic region with high social vulnerability: An ecological time series study	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; STATE; IDENTIFICATION; COINFECTION; AREAS; POOR	Background Despite visceral leishmaniasis (VL) being epidemic in most Brazilian regions, the Northeast region is responsible for the highest morbidity and mortality outcomes within the country. Objective To analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics of VL cases to identify the temporal trends and high-risk areas for VL transmission, as well as the association of the disease with social vulnerability in Brazilian Northeast. Methods We carried out an ecological time series study employing spatial analysis techniques using all VL confirmed cases of 1,794 municipalities of Brazilian Northeast between the years 2000 to 2017. The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was used to represent the social vulnerability. Incidence rates were standardized and smoothed by the Local Empirical Bayesian Method. Time trends were examined through segmented linear regression. Spatiotemporal analysis consisted of uni- and bivariate Global and Local Moran indexes and space-time scan statistics. Results Incidence rate remained stable and ranged from 4.84 to 3.52 cases/100,000 inhabitants. There was higher case prevalence between males (62.71%), children and adolescents (63.27%), non-white (69.75%) and urban residents (62.58%). Increasing trends of new cases were observed among adult male subjects (>= 40 years old) and urban residents. Importantly, VL incidence showed a direct spatial dependence. Spatial and space-time clusters were identified in sertao and meio-norte sub-regions, overlapping with high social vulnerability areas. Conclusions VL is a persistent health issue in Brazilian Northeast and associated with social vulnerability. Space-time clustering of VL cases in socially vulnerable municipalities demands intersectoral public policies of surveillance and control, with focus on reducing inequalities and improving living conditions for regional inhabitants. Author summary Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) remains a worldwide health issue, with increasing rates of mortality being observed. Brazil has an epidemiological scenario of expanding VL transmission, especially in the Northeast region. In the present study, we analysed spatiotemporal dynamics of VL cases and its association with social vulnerability in Brazilian Northeast. Briefly, data was analysed of all VL confirmed cases during the years of 2000 to 2017 and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) from 1,794 municipalities of Brazilian Northeast. Results revealed that VL continues to spread heterogeneously, with space-time high-risk clusters in the most socially vulnerable areas. We observed increasing trends of new cases among male subjects >= 40 years of age and urban residents. Our study represents the first investigation that demonstrates associations between VL and social vulnerability in the Northeast region of Brazil. These findings could contribute to VL prevention, surveillance, and control through better understanding of disease distribution, affording effective prioritization of municipalities with higher vulnerability. Thus, reduction of social inequality and better living conditions should be part of the planning of public health policies related to VL control.	[Ribeiro, Caique J. N.; Lima, Shirley V. M.

Objectives: To describe the distribution of mortality from MCS by sex. age. and macroregion in Brazil. in individuals under the age of 20. between 2000 and 2015. Methods: A descriptive study of mortality rates and proportional mortality (PM) from MCS. other congenital malformations (OCM). circulatory system disease (CSD). ill-defined causes (IDC). and external causes (EC) in Brazil. Results: There were 1.367.355 deaths from all causes in individuals younger than 20. 55.0% under 1 year of age. A total of 144.057 deaths were caused by congenital malformations. 39% of them by MCS. In both sexes. the annual mortality from MCS was 5.3/100.000. PM from MCS was 4.2%. CSD 2.2%. IDC 6.2% and EC 24.9%. Unspecified MCS showed the highest PM rates in both sexes and age groups. especially in the north and northeast regions (60%). Deaths from malformations occurred 5.7 times more frequently during the first year of life than in other ages (MCS: 5.0; OCM: 6.4). Conclusions: MCS was the leading cause of death among all malformations. being twice as important as CSD. mainly under 1 year of age. The frequency of misdiagnosis of MCS as cause of death was high in all ages and both sexes. especially in the north and northeast regions. These findings highlight the need for the development of public health strategies focused on correct diagnosis and early treatment of congenital cardiopathies. leading to a reduction in mortality.

The two-digit codes related to ICDAS (International Caries Detection and Assessment System) for each tooth and the gingival bleeding score were recorded at school on 7,064 children (48.97% males and 51.03% females). The Gross National Product (GNP) per capita, the Gini Index and Unemployment rate in each Italian section, parents' educational levels, working status, smoking habit and their ethnic background were recorded. Zero-inflated-negative-binomial (ZINB) models were run, using caries-free teeth, teeth with enamel lesions, cavitated lesions and restorations as functions of socioeconomic explanatory variables, to evaluate the effects of justifiable economic factors of geographical distribution. The mean number of enamel lesions, cavitated lesions and filled per teeth were statistically significant (p < 0.01) dissimilar among the Italian section. GNP per capita, Gini Index and Unemployment rate were significantly correlated to ICDAS scores and filled teeth. Important differences in ICDAS score values remain among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Efforts should be made to improve awareness and knowledge regarding oral health practice and to implement preventive programs and access to dental services in Southern Italy where the disease is still unresolved.

Socioeconomic inequalities in hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions: a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, 1990-2018	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Review						Ambulatory care sensitive conditions; Hospitalization; Socioeconomic status; Health inequalities; Observational studies; Systematic review		Background: Hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions are an important indicator of health system equity and performance. Chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions refer to chronic diseases that can be managed in primary care settings, including angina, asthma, and diabetes, with hospitalizations for these conditions considered potentially avoidable with adequate primary care interventions. Socioeconomic inequities in the risk of hospitalization have been observed in several health systems globally. While there are multiple studies examining the association between socioeconomic status and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, these studies have not been systematically reviewed. The objective of this study is to systematically identify and describe socioeconomic inequalities in hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions amongst adult populations in economically developed countries reported in high-quality observational studies published in the peer-reviewed literature. Methods: Peer-reviewed literature was searched in six health and social science databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, ASSIA, and IBSS using search terms for hospitalization, socioeconomic status, and chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Study titles and abstracts were first screened followed by full-text review according to the following eligibility criteria: 1) Study outcome is hospitalization for selected chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions; 2) Primary exposure is individual- or area-level socioeconomic status; 3) Study population has a mean age +/- 1 SD < 75 years of age; 4) Study setting is economically developed countries; and 5) Study type is observational. Relevant data was then extracted, and studies were critically appraised using appropriate tools from The Joanna Briggs Institute. Results were narratively synthesized according to socioeconomic constructs and type of adjustment (minimally versus fully adjusted). Results: Of the 15,857 unique peer-reviewed studies identified, 31 studies met the eligibility criteria and were of sufficient quality for inclusion. Socioeconomic constructs and hospitalization outcomes varied across studies. However, despite this heterogeneity, a robust and consistent association between lower levels of socioeconomic status and higher risk of hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions was observed. Conclusions: This systematic review is the first to comprehensively identify and analyze literature on the relationship between SES and hospitalizations for chronic ambulatory care sensitive conditions, considering both aggregate and condition-specific outcomes that are common to several international health systems. The evidence consistently demonstrates that lower socioeconomic status is a risk factor for hospitalization across global settings. Effective health and social interventions are needed to reduce these inequities and ensure fair and adequate care across socioeconomic groups.

This may be partially due to the delayed availability of accurate and comparable data from overwhelmed systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. However, early methods to procure and develop treatments and vaccines by some high-income countries reflect ongoing protectionist and nationalistic attitudes that can systemically exclude access for people in regions with weaker health systems. What's needed is a global coordinated effort, based on the principle of solidarity, to foster equitable health care access.

SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS ON THE EVOLUTION OF MORTALITY IN EUROPE IN THE XXI CENTURY: POLICY PROPOSALS TO FACE THE COVID-19 CRISIS	REVISTA DE ECONOMIA MUNDIAL			English	Article						Socio-economic factors; COVID-19; Mortality; Panel Data; Europe	HEALTH; SPECIFICATION; CARE	In the midst of adverse effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy has been confronted with new challenges, among which is an increase in mortality as a consequence of the virus. The main objective of this article is to examine the socio-economic factors influencing the evolution of mortality in Europe in the 21st century, using a panel data for a fixed effects model. The findings suggest that the determinants most strongly connected to the evolution of mortality in Europe include: inequality, the number of beds available in hospitals and the unemployment rate. These results further highlight the importance of developing specific strategies to control these factors, and to assist developed economies in order to face potential economic and health crises, like the current pandemic, more effectively in the future.

Canadian data have been sparse until very recently, and correctional officers and forensic psychiatric staff have rarely been included. Working as a correctional officer is associated with negative health outcomes and increased work-related stress, with several variables affecting reported levels of stress. Healthcare staff also report higher rates of PTSD, especially those who are exposed to aggression in their workplace. In the present study, we compare current symptoms of diverse staff working in correctional occupations. Method: Data were collected from a Canadian national online survey of public safety personnel, including employees of correctional services at the federal level. Correctional officers and wellness services staff were compared for prevalence of mental disorders and suicidal ideation. Results: Correctional officers self-reported statistically significantly more exposure to potentially psychologically traumatic events than wellness services employees. Correctional officers also self-reported higher rates of symptoms of mental disorders, including PTSD, social anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. There were no statistically significant differences in reports of suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts. Contribution to Society: Correctional and forensic staff contribute to society by working with justice-involved individuals in correctional institutions. Trauma-related disorders and other mental health problems threaten the well-being of correctional and forensic staff. Mental health likely impacts the ability of correctional and forensic staff to develop a therapeutic or working alliance with persons in custody. Staff well-being must be recognized and addressed to ensure that prisoners and staff receive optimal treatment in prison. Conclusion: Our results add to the limited knowledge about the well-being of staff, particularly wellness staff in prisons, who provide daily treatment and care for prisoners with serious mental disorders. Our work is a step toward identifying avenues for promoting staff well-being.

The intersection of climate change with the era of COVID-19	PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING			English	Review						climate change; COVID-19; global warming; SARS-CoV-2		The purpose of this integrative review is to examine recent literature on the intersection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 novel coronavirus) and climate change that will lead to a greater understanding of the complexities of the urgent pandemic linked with the emerging climate crisis. A literature search for peer-reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID-19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID-19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID-19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human-environment issues; intersection of COVID-19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID-19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations' views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID-19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID-19, no literature addressed this topic. Public health nursing has a critical role in addressing climate change and the pandemic response to COVID 19 in the 21st century.

Although the influence of socioeconomic factors on PM2.5 has been studied, the constitution and the effect analysis of social vulnerability to PM2.5 remain unclear. In this study, a comprehensive theoretical framework with appropriate indicators for social vulnerability to PM2.5 was constructed. Using spatial autocorrelation analysis, a positive global spatial autocorrelation and notable local spatial cluster relationships were identified. Spatial econometric modeling and geographically weighted regression modeling were performed to explore the cause-effect relationship of social vulnerability to PM2.5. The spatial error model indicated that population and education inequality in the sensitivity dimension caused a significant positive impact on PM2.5, and biocapacity and social governance in the capacity dimension strongly contributed to the decrease of PM2.5 globally. The geographically weighted regression model revealed spatial heterogeneity in the effects of the social vulnerability variables on PM2.5 among countries. These empirical results can provide policymakers with a new perspective on social vulnerability as it relates to PM2.5 governance and targeted environmental pollution management.

Sexual health and COVID-19: protocol for a scoping review	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						COVID-19; Sexual health; Sexual minority; LGBT; Women		Background: Global responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed and exacerbated existing socioeconomic and health inequities that disproportionately affect the sexual health and well-being of many populations, including people of color, ethnic minority groups, women, and sexual and gender minority populations. Although there have been several reviews published on COVID-19 and health disparities across various populations, none has focused on sexual health. We plan to conduct a scoping review that seeks to fill several of the gaps in the current knowledge of sexual health in the COVID-19 era. Methods: A scoping review focusing on sexual health and COVID-19 will be conducted. We will search (from January 2020 onwards) CINAHL, Africa-Wide Information, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Gender Studies Database, Gender Watch, Global Health, WHO Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease Database, WHO Global Index Medicus, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Sociological s. Grey literature will be identified using Disaster Lit, Google Scholar, governmental websites, and clinical trials registries (e.g., , World Health Organization, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry). Study selection will conform to the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. Only English language, original studies will be considered for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. A narrative summary of findings will be conducted. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., content and thematic analysis) methods. Discussion: Original research is urgently needed to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 on sexual health. The planned scoping review will help to address this gap.

This study examined the associations between social capital and self-rated health while exploring the roles of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and socioeconomic status (SES) among middle-aged and older adults.MethodsCross-sectional data were collected from 662 middle-aged and older adults (Mean age: 58.1110.59years old) using the Qualtrics survey panel. Personal Social Capital Scale was used to measure bonding and bridging social capital and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess LTPA levels. SES was assessed by education and household income levels. Self-rated health was assessed using a single item, by which the participants were categorized into the two groups, having 'good' vs. 'not good' self-rated health. A series of univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were established to examine the independent and adjusted associations of social capital with self-rated health and to test mediating and moderating roles of LTPA and SES, respectively.ResultsBonding and bridging social capital were positively associated with self-rated health (Odds ratios=1.11 and 1.09; P's<.05, respectively), independent of LTPA that was also significantly associated with greater self-rated health (P-for-linear trends=.007). After adjusting SES, the associations of social capital were significantly attenuated and there was a significant interaction effect by household income (P-for-interaction=.012). Follow-up analyses stratified by household income showed that beneficial associations of social capital with self-rated health were more apparent among the people with low and high levels of household income; yet, LTPA was the stronger predictor of self-rated health among those in the middle class of household income.Conclusions Findings suggest that both social capital and LTPA are associated with better self-rated health; yet, these associations vary by SES. The health policymakers should address both social capital and LTPA for enhancing perceived health among aging populations but may need to consider varying SES backgrounds.

J	Malanski, PD; Dedieu, B; Schiavi, S				Malanski, Priscila Duarte; Dedieu, Benoit; Schiavi, Sandra			Mapping the research domains on work in agriculture. A bibliometric review from Scopus database	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Review						Work; Agriculture; Bibliometric analysis; Scientific communities	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; DOMESTIC WORK; CUT FLOWER; FARM WORK; LABOR; GENDER; ORGANIZATION; HORTICULTURE; EMPOWERMENT; HOUSEHOLDS	Near to half of world population lives in rural areas, and agriculture is responsible for 28% of global employment. Structural changes in agriculture impacting labor and the low attractivity of employment and working conditions in this sector are the major issues for the permanence and renewal of the rural workforce. Promoting decent work is essential to reach sustainable development. According to the ILO definition, decent work involves a wide range of conditions linked between them that include and go beyond farming work (e.g. gender equity, workplace security, fair income, among others). This complex situation requires for scientists the analysis of the diverse topics, as well as the development of interdisciplinary approaches to deal with this diversity. A review of the scientific literature is necessary to summarize the knowledge that has been produced and identify the current trends related to work in agriculture. In order to provide a background in this topic, the aim of this study was to review the state of the international literature related to work in agriculture, through a bibliometric analysis of scientific articles indexed in Scopus bibliographical database. Our findings show that USA, UK, France and China are the leaders in the scientific landscape according to: geographical production of knowledge, main journals and authors, and most-cited articles. The analysis of work in agriculture is declined in five main research domains: 1) social issues in rural areas; 2) labor market; 3) household strategies of labor allocation, 4) work organization in livestock farms; and 5) occupational health in farms. These research domains are investigated by four main scientific communities that prevail in the international literature: 1) agricultural economics; 2) ergonomics; 3) social issues for rural development; and 5) livestock farming systems. Besides those mainstream research, three major research trends emerged: 1) migration and precarious employment condition; 2) work issues in advisory services; and 3) labor governance in global value chains. These trends reflect ongoing transformations in agriculture that are important to think about the future of the work in this sector and its impacts on sustainable development. We show for the first time the characteristics of the main scientific communities that have performed the most relevant research indexed in Scopus database related to work in agriculture over the past 10 years. This review offers an overview in an interdisciplinary topic, and provides a benchmark for future cutting-edge research. The ILO definition of decent work can be a guideline for focus and deepen specific topics, since our findings indicate that several of them are linked to work-related issues in agriculture, which could support sustainable development on this sector.

J	Lloyd, SJ; Chalabi, Z				Lloyd, Simon J.; Chalabi, Zaid			Climate change, hunger and rural health through the lens of farming styles: An agent-based model to assess the potential role of peasant farming	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FOOD SECURITY; CHILD UNDERNUTRITION; IMPACTS; SCENARIOS; QUANTIFY; YIELDS	Undernutrition is a major contributor to the global-burden of disease, and global-level health impact models suggest that climate change-mediated reductions in food quantity and quality will negatively affect it. These models, however, capture just some of the processes that will shape future nutrition. We adopt an alternative standpoint, developing an agent-based model in which producer-consumer smallholders practice different 'styles of farming' in the global food system. The model represents a hypothetical rural community in which 'orphan' (subsistence) farmers may develop by adopting an 'entrepreneurial' style (highly market-dependent) or by maintaining a 'peasant' style (agroecology). We take a first look at the question: how might patterns of farming styles-under various style preference, climate, policy, and price transmission scenarios-impact on hunger and health-supporting conditions (incomes, work, inequality, 'real land productivity') in rural areas? imulations without climate change or agricultural policy found that style preference patterns influence production, food price, and incomes, and there were trade-offs between them. For instance, entrepreneurial-oriented futures had the highest production and lowest prices but were simultaneously those in which farms tended towards crisis. Simulations with climate change and agricultural policy found that peasant-orientated agroecology futures had the highest production, prices equal to or lower than those under entrepreneurial-oriented futures, and better supported rural health. There were, however, contradictory effects on nutrition, with benefits and harms for different groups. Collectively the findings suggest that when attempting to understand how climate change may impact on future nutrition and health, patterns of farming styles-along with the fates of the households that practice them-matter. These issues, including the potential role of peasant farming, have been neglected in previous global-level climate-nutrition modelling but go to the heart of current debates on the future of farming: thus, they should be given more prominence in future work.

INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						COVID-19; Health Policy Research; Infection Control; Nursing Capacity Building; Nursing Policy; Nursing Research; Pandemic		Aim Reflect upon the visibility of nursing-led research during the COVID-19 pandemic. Background The emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection has galvanized collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts in clinical and research practice worldwide. The scarce evidence-base to manage patients with COVID-19 has included limited nurse-led research. Introduction Clinical research nurses have greatly contributed to the delivery of COVID-19 research, yet the number of COVID-19 nursing-led research papers appears to be limited, with even fewer nurse-led research projects funded. Methods Authors' views and PubMed search on 'COVID-19 and nursing'. Findings There is a dearth of nursing-led research. Most papers describe the nursing contribution to COVID-19 care, changes in nursing working arrangements and emotional burden. There are opportunities to explore the consequences to vulnerable population groups of public health measures implemented to stop the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion Workforce gaps, limited integration in research structures and clinical redeployment may have hampered nurse-led research. COVID-19 may exacerbate staffing deficits by disrupting the education pipeline, obstructing the transition from clinical to academic practice, particularly in areas where clinical academic roles are yet to emerge. Conclusion The absence of nurse-led research in COVID-19 can be explained by chronic, underlying factors and the features of the pandemic response. Emerging models of care, effective staffing and inequalities related to COVID-19 appear obvious research areas. Nursing leadership needs to strengthen its political voice and lobbying skills to secure nurse-led research funding. Implications for Nursing Policy Embracing international nursing research, strengthening collaborations and lobbying policymakers for investment in nurse-sensitive research would enhance the response to COVID-19.

J	Howie, VA; Welch, AJ; Horton, ES; Wirihana, LA				Howie, Virginia Anne; Welch, Anthony Joseph; Horton, Eleanor Sandra; Wirihana, Lisa Anne			The quandary of registered nurses untrained in adult intellectual disability nursing when caring for this diverse patient group in acute care settings: An integrated literature review	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Review						acute care; hospitals; intellectual developmental disorder; intellectual disability; nurse-patient relations; nurses; nursing education; phenomenology; registered nurses		Aims and Objectives: To critically appraise relevant literature on the lived experiences of registered nurses caring for adults with intellectual disability in the acute care setting in Australia to determine current knowledge and gaps in the literature. Background: People with intellectual disability have the right to the highest attainable health care the same as everyone else. However, inequities still exist in the delivery of health care across the globe, including Australia that result in poorer health outcomes for this population group. Part of the problem is a lack of understanding of the complexities of ID care due to an absence of ID specific content in undergraduate curricula. Design: Integrative literature review. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for relevant empirical and theoretical literature. Additional articles were found by reviewing reference lists of selected articles resulting in ten articles for review. Selected articles were critically appraised using JBI critical appraisal tools. Data were analysed using comparative thematic analysis. PRISMA checklist completed the review. Results: Two main themes emerged from the data that informed the gap in knowledge: (a) Defining nursing practice; and (b) Confidence to practice. Conclusions: There was limited qualitative research published on the topic. International studies revealed that a lack of understanding of the ID condition due to inadequate education left registered nurses feeling underprepared, unsupported and struggling to provide optimal care. No studies were located on the phenomenon within the Australian context. A study exploring the lived experiences of RNs in Australia is needed to offer a deeper understanding of the phenomenon that will help inform practice. Relevance to practice: Including ID care in national undergraduate and postgraduate nursing curricula must become a nursing educational and professional priority to support nurses more fully in their practice to ensure patients with ID receive the highest attainable standard of nursing care.

No existing explanations account fully for these differences in life expectancy, although they do highlight the complexity and interaction of biological, social and health service factors. Methods: this paper is an exploratory explanation of gendered life expectancy difference (GLED) using a novel combination of epidemiological and sociological methods. We present the global picture of GLED. We then utilise a secondary data comparative case analysis offering explanations for GLED in Australia and Ethiopia. We combine a social determinant of health lens with Bourdieu's concepts of capitals (economic, cultural, symbolic and social). Results: we confirmed continuing GLED in all countries ranging from less than a year to over 11 years. The Australian and Ethiopian cases demonstrated the complex factors underpinning this difference, highlighting similarities and differences in socioeconomic and cultural factors and how they are gendered within and between the countries. Bourdieu's capitals enabled us to partially explain GLED and to develop a conceptual model of causal pathways. Conclusion: we demonstrate the value of combing a SDH and Bourdieu's capital lens to investigate GLED. We proposed a theoretical framework to guide future research.

J	García-Goñi, M; Stoyanova, AP; Nuño-Solinís, R				Garcia-Goni, Manuel; Stoyanova, Alexandrina P.; Nuno-Solinis, Roberto			Mental Illness Inequalities by Multimorbidity, Use of Health Resources and Socio-Economic Status in an Aging Society	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						mental illness; socioeconomic status; inequality; access to care; multimorbidity	INCOME-RELATED INEQUALITIES; MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CHRONIC DISEASES; INTEGRATED CARE; BASQUE COUNTRY; GLOBAL BURDEN; OLDER-ADULTS; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE	Background: Mental illness, multi-morbidity, and socio-economic inequalities are some of the main challenges for the public health system nowadays, and are further aggravated by the process of population aging. Therefore, it is widely accepted that health systems need to focus their strategies for confronting such concerns. With guaranteed access to health care services under universal coverage in many health systems, it is expected that all services be provided equally to patients with the same level of need. Methods: In this paper, we explore the existence of inequalities in the access to services of patients with mental illness taking into account whether they are multimorbid patients, their socioeconomic status, and their age. We take advantage of a one-year (2010-2011) database on individual healthcare utilization and expenditures for the total population (N = 2,262,698) of the Basque Country. Results: More comorbidity leads to greater inequality in prevalence, being the poor sicker, although with age, this inequality decreases. All health services are more oriented towards greater utilization of the poor and sicker, particularly in the case of visits to specialists and emergency care. Conclusions: Mental health inequalities in prevalence have been identified as being disproportionally concentrated in the least affluent areas of the Basque Country. However, inequalities in the utilization of publicly-provided health services present a pro-poor orientation. As this region has adopted a system-wide transformation towards integrated care, its mental health delivery model offers excellent potential for international comparisons and benchlearning.

Our Relationship to Water and Experience of Water Insecurity among Apsaalooke (Crow Indian) People, Montana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Native Americans; water insecurity; environmental justice; health disparities	DRINKING-WATER; POVERTY INDEX; HEALTH-RISKS; DISPARITIES; IMPACTS; CHALLENGES; QUALITY	Affordable access to safe drinking water is essential to community health, yet there is limited understanding of water insecurity among Native Americans. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to describe Apsaalooke (Crow Indian) tribal members' experiences with water insecurity. For Apsaalooke people, local rivers and springs are still vitally important for traditional cultural activities. We interviewed 30 Native American adults living on the Crow Reservation in Southeastern Montana. Participants answered six open-ended interview questions about their water access, costs of obtaining water and changes in their domestic and traditional water uses. Participants emphasized how the use of water has changed over time and described the complex challenges associated with addressing water insecurity in their community, including the importance of considering the spiritual and cultural impacts of water insecurity on health. Water insecurity is a growing global problem and more attention and efforts are needed to find appropriate and affordable solutions.

Obesity in childhood has dire long-term consequences on health, social and economic outcomes. Promising interventions using behavioural insights to address obesity in childhood have emerged. This systematic review examines the effectiveness and health equity implications of interventions using behavioural insights to improve children's diet-related outcomes. The search strategy included searches on six electronic databases, reference lists of previous systematic reviews and backward searching of all included studies. One-hundred and eight papers describing 137 interventions were included. Interventions using behavioural insights were effective at modifying children's diet-related outcomes in 74% of all included interventions. The most promising approaches involved using incentives, changing defaults and modifying the physical environment. Information provision alone was the least effective approach. Health equity implications were rarely analysed or discussed. There was limited evidence of the sustainability of interventions-both in relation to their overall effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The limited evidence on health equity, long-term effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of these interventions limit what can be inferred for policymakers. This review synthesises the use of behavioural insights to improve children's diet-related outcomes, which can be used to inform future interventions.

Structural stigma in this context relates to institutional policies, cultural norms, and organizational practices that limit consumers' access to health services, quality of care, and capacity to achieve optimal health and well-being. BPD is a serious mental illness with high morbidity and mortality, characterized by instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotional and behavioral deregulation, which stem from significant traumatic childhood/life events, and/or biological etiologies. The objectives of this scoping review are to explore the international literature on structural stigma in healthcare systems specific to BPD, and to provide an overview of the impact of structural stigma on health services for BPD consumers and their carers/families. Methods: This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review guidelines. We will search the following electronic databases (from inception onwards): MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and JBI-Evidence databases. Grey literature will be identified through the Google search engine. We will include all types of literature in English, published and unpublished, including any study design, reviews, clinical practice guidelines, policy reports, and other documents. No restrictions on publication date of sources of evidence will be applied. International literature should examine structural stigma associated with BPD in any healthcare setting such as, outpatients, inpatients, primary health care, or community-based facilities. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles, abstracts, and full-text citations. Quality appraisal of the included sources of evidence will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018 version. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., thematic analysis) methods. Discussion: This review is anticipated to enhance both identification and understanding of those structures in health systems (i.e., institutional policies, cultural norms, and practices) that manifest and perpetuate stigma experienced by consumers with BPD and their carers/families. The findings can be used to inform future research, policy, and practice relating to stigma reduction strategies that can be adopted to improve the provision of BPD-responsive services and care for this population.

J	Olsen, M; Norheim, OF; Memirie, ST				Olsen, Maria; Norheim, Ole F.; Memirie, Solomon Tessema			Reducing regional health inequality: a sub-national distributional cost-effectiveness analysis of community-based treatment of childhood pneumonia in Ethiopia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Global health; Health systems; Priority setting; Justice; Equity; Geographic equality; Cost-effectiveness; Pneumonia	CASE-MANAGEMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INFECTIONS; CHILDREN; LIFE	BackgroundIncreasing the coverage of community-based treatment of childhood pneumonia (CCM) is part of the strategy to improve child survival, increase life-expectancy at birth and promote equity in Ethiopia. However, full coverage of CCM has not been reached in any regions of the country. There are no sub-national cost-effectiveness analyses available to inform decision makers on the most equitable scale up strategy.ObjectivesOur first objective is to estimate the sub-national cost-effectiveness and the interindividual inequality impacts of scaling up CCM coverages to 90% in each region. Our second objective is to explore the costs, health effects, and geographical inequality impacts associated with three scale-up scenarios promoting different policy-aims: maximizing health, reducing geographical inequalities, and achieving 90% universal coverage.MethodsWe used Markov modelling to estimate the sub-national cost-effectiveness of CCM in each region. All data were collected through literature review and adjusted to the region-specific proportions of the rural population. Health effects were modeled as life years gained and under-five deaths averted. Interindividual and geographical inequality impacts were measured by the GINI index applied to health. In scenario analysis we explored three different scale-up strategies: 1) maximizing health by prioritizing the regions where the intervention was the most cost-effective, 2) reducing geographical inequalities by prioritizing the regions with high baseline under-five mortality rate (U5MR), and 3) universal upscaling to 90% coverage in all the regions.ResultsThe regional incremental-cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of scaling up the intervention coverage varied from 26 USD per life year gained in Addis to 199 USD per life year gained in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' region. Universal upscaling of CCM in all regions would cost about 1.3 billion USD and prevent about 90,000 under-five deaths. This is less than 15,000 USD per life saved and translates to an increase in life expectancy at birth of 1.6years across Ethiopia. In scenario analysis, we found that prioritizing regions with high U5MR is effective in reducing geographical inequalities, although at the cost of fewer lives saved as compared to the health maximizing strategy.ConclusionsOur model results illustrate a trade-off between maximizing health and reducing health inequalities, two common policy-aims in low-income settings.

There is consistent evidence of high exposure to discrimination among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous Australian) peoples, but impacts have not been fully quantified, in part due to limited measurement tools. We aim to validate instruments developed to measure interpersonal discrimination.MethodsInstruments were discussed at five focus groups and with experts, and field tested in developing Mayi Kuwayu: The National Study of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Wellbeing. Data from 7501 baseline survey participants were analysed. Acceptability was assessed according to extent of missingness, construct validity using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and reliability using Cronbach's alpha. Associations between each instrument and outcomes conceptually understood to be closely (community-level racism) or less closely (family wellbeing) related were quantified to test convergent and discriminant validity.ResultsAn 8-item instrument captures experiences of discrimination in everyday life and a 4-item instrument experiences in healthcare, each followed by a global attribution item. Item missingness was 2.2-3.7%. Half (55.4%) of participants reported experiencing any everyday discrimination, with 65.7% attributing the discrimination to Indigeneity; healthcare discrimination figures were 34.1% and 51.1%. Items were consistent with two distinct instruments, differentiating respondents with varying experiences of discrimination. Scales demonstrated very good reliability and convergent and divergent validity.ConclusionThese brief instruments demonstrate face validity and robust psychometric properties in measuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults' experiences of interpersonal discrimination in everyday life and in healthcare. They can be used to quantify population-level experiences of discrimination, and associated wellbeing consequences, and monitor change.

Brazil actively responded to contain the virus. This case study aims to examine Brazil's response to COVID-19 by investigating the country's actions and reflecting upon the outcomes throughout January and March 2020. The data collection strategy included gathering data from the country's intergovernmental organization's official website, epidemiological bulletins, and news reports, guided by intersectoral and interdisciplinary themes. Although the highest incidence rates were in the most rich and populated region in Brazil, it was the poorest region that had the highest case fatality rate. Nevertheless, Brazil took several non-pharmaceutical measures to control and mitigate the spread of the virus. However, the strategy seems to have failed to consider regional and social inequalities. The actions of the health minister were undermined by a conflicting discourse between the minister and the president. The outbreak of COVID-19 added an extra burden on the country's healthcare system and the existing economic crises; exacerbated the inherent social, political, and economic challenges; and exposed the country's contradictions.

There is scarcity of evidence about barriers to accessing healthcare services in Benin. Therefore, we examined the magnitude of the problem of access to healthcare services and its associated factors. Methods: We utilized data from the 2017-2018 Benin Demographic and Health Survey (n = 15,928). We examined the associations between the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of women using multilevel logistic regression. The outcome variable for the study was problem of access to healthcare service. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. Results: Overall, 60.4% of surveyed women had problems in accessing healthcare services. Partner's education (AOR = 0.70; 95% CI; 0.55-0.89), economic status (AOR = 0.59; 95% CI; 0.47-0.73), marital status (AOR = 0.44; 95% CI; 0.39-0.51), and parity (AOR = 1.85; 95% CI; 1.45-2.35) were significant individual-level factors associated with problem of access to healthcare. Region (AOR = 5.24; 95% CI; 3.18-8.64) and community literacy level (AOR = 0.69; 95% CI; 0.51-0.94) were the main community-level risk factors. Conclusions: Enhancing husband education through adult education programs, economic empowerment of women, enhancing national education coverage, and providing priority for unmarried and multipara women need to be considered. Additionally, there is the need to ensure equity-based access to healthcare services across regions.

Although research and analyses have attempted to draw important lessons on how to strengthen pandemic preparedness and response, few have examined the effect that fragmented governance for health has had on effectively mitigating the crisis. By assessing the ability of health systems to manage COVID-19 from the perspective of two key approaches to global health policy-global health security and universal health coverage-important lessons can be drawn for how to align varied priorities and objectives in strengthening health systems. This Health Policy paper compares three types of health systems (ie, with stronger investments in global health security, stronger investments in universal health coverage, and integrated investments in global health security and universal health coverage) in their response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and synthesises four essential recommendations (ie, integration, financing, resilience, and equity) to reimagine governance, policies, and investments for better health towards a more sustainable future.

J	Bhatta, DN; Bialous, S; Crosbie, E; Glantz, S				Bhatta, Dharma N.; Bialous, Stella; Crosbie, Eric; Glantz, Stanton			Exceeding WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Obligations: Nepal Overcoming Tobacco Industry Interference to Enact a Comprehensive Tobacco Control Policy	NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH			English	Article							HEALTH WARNING LABELS; CONTROL ADVOCACY; LOW-INCOME; IMPLEMENTATION; CIGARETTE; COUNTRIES; PRODUCTS; MEXICO	Background: The tobacco industry works to block, delay, and weaken national tobacco control legislation to implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). This article reviews how Nepal overcame industry opposition and to a comprehensive tobacco control law implementing the FCTC. Methods: We triangulated newspaper articles and policy documents with key informant interviews. Results: With the support of international health groups, local tobacco control advocates worked with policymakers in Nepal to pass a comprehensive tobacco control law that exceeded FCTC obligations. The tobacco industry exploited a time of political transition to block consideration by Parliament, arranged and sponsored foreign tours for legislators, made death threats to tobacco control advocates and their families, and argued for the economic importance of tobacco farms. Despite strong interference from Health, and Law and Justice ministers, a 2009 Supreme Court ruling helped tobacco control advocates secure a comprehensive tobacco control law in 2011 that included rotating pictorial health warning labels covering 75% of both sides of cigarette packages, 100% smoke free public places and workplaces, private homes and vehicles, and a tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship ban. Conclusions: Advocates in developing countries should utilize Nepal's experience to reject tobacco industry offers of compromise and continue educating politicians and legislators to generate political support to pass a comprehensive tobacco control law. Technical and financial support from international agencies, and effective collaboration and coordination of civil societies, and utilization of domestic litigation are helpful in LMICs where governance is weak (the abstract in Nepali is available as a Supplementary Material).

J	Hains, T; Rowell, D; Strand, H				Hains, Toni; Rowell, David; Strand, Haakan			The non-medical surgical assistant and inequity in the Australian healthcare system	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING			English	Review						Australian private healthcare sector; nurse practitioner; Australian government health policy; procedural justice; health insurance; distributive justice	NURSE-PRACTITIONERS; HISTORY; ROLES	Objectives: The objective of this discussion paper is two-fold. The first is to quantify if the non-medical surgical assistant increases access to surgery by investigating what percentages of cases these clinicians undertake in the private sector surgical units where they work. The second is to examine procedural and distributive justice and how they impact on private sector surgical care. Aim: The aim of this paper is to investigate if the non-medical surgical assistant increases equity via access, for the patient, to private sector surgical care; and if government policy has an impact on equity in the form of access. Background: The private healthcare sector completes approximately two-thirds of all elective surgery in Australia; without this contribution, there would be more pressure on the public healthcare sector. In the private sector, recognition and federal funding of the surgical assistant differs depending on whether this clinician has a medical or non-medical, eg. nursing, qualification. The role of the non-medical surgical assistant is well established internationally and this role has been practiced in Australia for more than 20 years. Discussion: Inequity; as a result of the procedural injustice of government funding policy, impacts the private sector surgical patient causing distributive injustice. This distributive injustice results in an out-of-pocket expense to the patient. Rising out-of-pocket expenses has started a trend of patients moving away from private health insurance and into the public sector. The registered nurse and nurse practitioner are qualified to practise as a non-medical surgical assistant and provide increased access to care, and effective care compared to the medical surgical assistant. The nurse practitioner is an eligible provider of Medical Benefits Schedule services but restricted from accessing the intraoperative assisting item numbers. Conclusion: The non-medical surgical assistant; or at least the nurse practitioner as non-medical surgical assistant; require access to the Medical Benefits Schedule intraoperative item numbers. Access would alleviate the out-of-pocket expense incurred by Australian patients when a non-medical surgical assistant assists with their surgery. Lack of access to these item numbers means patients may have their surgery delayed until an appropriately skilled medical surgical assistant is available, or the public healthcare sector can accommodate them. Implications for research, policy and practice: This paper illustrates a need for change in Australian government policy to reflect contemporary, evidence-based practice. What is already known about the topic? The international literature reports that advanced practice nursing roles increase access to healthcare. The nurse practitioner role in Australia is now well established, and the Australian literature illustrates increased access to care. The Medical Benefits Schedule Review Taskforce was formed to investigate a system that is not consistent with contemporary, evidence-based healthcare. What this paper adds: The nurse practitioner and registered nurse, in the role of non-medical surgical assistant, increase access to private sector surgical care. Australian government policy limits access to private sector surgical care through its inequitable policies that contravene the spirit of fair trade. According to peak professional bodies' policy and position statements, the nurse practitioner and registered nurse are legitimate providers of surgical assisting services.

So far, despite the major epidemiologic concerns about the quality of care, limited data are available for patients with HMs. Thus, we created a novel measure-Quality of Care Index (QCI)-to appraise the quality of care in different populations. Methods The Global Burden of Disease data from 1990 to 2017 applied in our study. We performed a principal component analysis on several secondary indices from the major primary indices, including incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to create the QCI, which provides an overall score of 0-100 of the quality of cancer care. We estimated the QCI for each age group on different scales and constructed the gender disparity ratio to evaluate the gender disparity of care in HMs. Results Globally, while the overall age-standardized incidence rate of HMs increased from 1990 to 2017, the age-standardized DALYs and death rates decreased during the same period. Across countries, in 2017, Iceland (100), New Zealand (100), Australia (99.9), and China (99.3) had the highest QCI scores for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia. Conversely, Central African Republic (11.5 and 6.1), Eritrea (9.6), and Mongolia (5.4) had the lowest QCI scores for the mentioned malignancies respectively. Overall, the QCI score was positively associated with higher sociodemographic of nations, and was negatively associated with age advancing. Conclusions The QCI provides a robust metric to evaluate the quality of care that empowers policymakers on their responsibility to allocate the resources effectively. We found that there is an association between development status and QCI and gender equity, indicating that instant policy attention is demanded to improve health-care access.

Although literature remained sparse, reports indicated that food insecurity is disproportionately high among African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) population since the outset of COVID-19. Hence, we assessed the food insecurity conditions of ACB populations globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Comprehensive searches in CINAHL, Medline (Ovid), PubMed (Medline), Food Science and Technology s, SCOPUS, EMBASE, AMED, CAB s, Cochrane Library (OVID), and PsycINFO were carried out. Title/abstract and full-text screening, quality appraisal (modified JBI QARI), and data extraction were carried out by double reviewers. Results The initial search yielded 354 articles. After removal of duplicates and irrelevant articles, a full-text review and critical appraisal, 9 papers were included in the study. After data extraction and synthesis, six major themes emerged from the analysis: increased food insecurity, adverse health outcomes of food insecurity, exacerbation of existing disparities, systemic inequities and adverse policies, racism, and sociocultural response and solutions. Conclusion/implications The study showed that COVID-19 had exacerbated food insecurity and other health disparities within racialized populations including ACB people, due to systemic anti-Black racism; inadequate representation in decision-making; and issues of cultural appropriateness and competency of health services. While sociocultural response by ACB people through the expansion of their social capital is imperative, specific policies easing access to food, medicine, and shelter for racialized communities will ensure equity while reducing global food insecurity and health crises during the COVID-19 pandemic.

J	Winter, JC; Darmstadt, GL; Davis, J				Winter, James C.; Darmstadt, Gary L.; Davis, Jennifer			The role of piped water supplies in advancing health, economic development, and gender equality in rural communities	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Water fetching; Water access; Rural water supply; Piped water; Productive use; Gender equality; Time poverty; Sub-saharan Africa	DIETARY DIVERSITY; INCOME COUNTRIES; SAFE WATER; ACCESS; DISTANCE; TIME; INSECURITY; HOUSEHOLDS; DISTRESS; IMPACTS	In rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, one in eight households obtain drinking water from a piped system; the rest fetch water from improved and unimproved sources located at some distance from their homes. This task falls primarily to women and girls, creating time poverty and risks to safety and health. In this paper, we present a conceptual model that elaborates the mechanisms linking access to piped water with food security and long-term economic impacts. These hypotheses were tested in a quasi-experimental study of four villages in rural Zambia using a combination of household surveys, Global Positioning System transponders, and water meters to measure time spent fetching water, water consumption, and how water was being utilized for domestic and productive activities. Households receiving the piped water intervention spent a median of 3.8 h per week less fetching water, savings that accrued primarily to women and girls. Household water consumption increased 32%, which was used for both domestic and productive uses. Increases in the frequency of gardening and the size of garden plots in treatment households were observed. Households receiving piped water reported being happier, healthier, and having more time to participate in work inside or outside the home. We find that piped water supplies can promote the economic development and well-being of rural households, with particular benefits to women and girls, conditional upon pricing and management models that ensure sustainable service.

J	Geyman, J				Geyman, John			COVID-19 Has Revealed America's Broken Health Care System: What Can We Learn?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article						COVID-19; medical-industrial complex; health policy; Medicare for All; public health		The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed long-standing system problems of U. S. health care ranging from access barriers, uncontrolled prices and costs, unacceptable quality, widespread disparities and inequities, and marginalization of public health. All of these have been well documented by international comparisons. Our largely privatized market-based system and medical-industrial complex have been ill equipped to respond effectively to the pandemic. The accompanying economic downturn exacerbates these problems that further reveal the failures of our largely for-profit private health insurance industry, dependent as it is on continued government subsidies while it profiteers on the backs of vulnerable Americans. This article brings historical perspective to these problems, and provides markers of the extent of our unpreparedness and ineffective response to the pandemic. Coherent national health and public health policies are urgently needed based on evidence-based science, not political pressures. Financing reform is necessary, such as through single-payer Medicare for All. Eight takeaway lessons are summarized that can help to inform now best to rebuild U. S. health care and public health, an urgent task for the incoming Biden administration.

Currently, a lack of EB-specific research limits these services to sexual health assessment and intervention strategies designed for the general population. Due to the unique challenges of EB, a rare skin-fragility condition causing blistering responses to minor skin trauma and other systemic and secondary complications, condition-specific strategies are needed to support people with EB in achieving valued sexual lifestyles. This CPG represents the work of an international panel comprised of thirteen members including a medical doctor, nurses, psychologists, a social worker, an occupational therapist, and patient population involvement members living with EB. It describes the development of EB-specific recommendations for two primary domains of assessment and intervention related to sexuality: psychosocial and mechanical. Following a rigorous evidence-based guideline development process, this CPG establishes the first internationally actionable clinical practice recommendations for sexuality-related assessment and intervention for this population. Future research priorities are identified. Supplemental materials included provide additional support to clinicians in developing the necessary understanding and skills to promote equity and efficacy in this care domain.

Methods: Almost 38,000 (n = 37,922) individuals were included from the Henan Rural Cohort Study. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to evaluate PA. Obesity was reflected by body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body fat percentage (BFP), and visceral fat index (VFI). The independent and interactive effects of SES and PA on obesity were analyzed by logistic regression models and generalized linear regression models, respectively. Results: Compared with high education level, the OR (95%CI) of obesity defined by BMI with low education level was 1.466 (1.337, 1.608), 1.064 (0.924, 1.225), and 1.853 (1.625, 2.114) in total population, men and women, respectively. Besides, the OR (95%CI) of obesity defined by BMI associated with per capita monthly income were 1.089 (1.015, 1.170), 1.192 (1.055, 1.347), 1.038 (0.951, 1.133) in total population, men and women, respectively. Similar results had been observed in other obesity measures. Negative interactive association of low education level and PA on obesity measures were observed only in women (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study suggests that women are more susceptible to obesity concerning low SES and that adequate PA may be a potential target for mitigating the negative effect of low SES on obesity in women.

J	Francis, JNP				Francis, June N. P.			A Macromarketing Call to Action-Because Black Lives Matter!	JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING			English	Article						racism; eurocentrism; white supremacy; critical race theory; decolonizing	RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; RACE; EDUCATION; ADVERTISEMENTS; PROPERTY; SYSTEMS; GENDER; HEALTH	This essay poses the question do Black Lives Matter to marketing? Putting the spotlight on research in marketing reveals the multiple ways in which the field has neglected a most pressing issue of our time-structural and systemic anti-Black racism. The global rallying cry in the Black Lives Matter protests alerts us to the urgency for transformative change in all spheres including the marketing academy. Macromarketing is particularly poised to lead this change given the commitment to justice in marketing systems and concerns with the bilateral impact of marketing on society. This essay issues a call to action to re-historize the role of transatlantic slavery, for researchers to be reflective in addressing systemic racism, and for the academy to adopt anti-racist strategies to propel this scholarship from the periphery of marketing thought to its core.

Analyze the spatial distribution pattern of late stage diagnosis and mortality for breast cancer and its correlation with socioeconomic and health service offer-related population indicators. Ecological study, developed with 161 Intermediate Region of Urban Articulation (IRUA). Mortality data were collected from the Mortality Information System (MIS). Tumor staging data were extracted from the Hospital Cancer Registry (HCR). Socioeconomic variables were obtained from the Atlas of Human Development in Brazil; data on medical density and health services were collected from the National Registry of Health Institutions (NRHI) and Supplementary National Health Agency. Global Moran's Index and Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) were utilized to verify the existence of territorial clusters. Multivariate analysis used models with global spatial effects. The proportion of late stage diagnosis of breast cancer was 39.7% (IC 39.4-40.0). The mean mortality rate for breast cancer, adjusted by the standard world population was 10.65 per 100,000 women (+/- 3.12). The proportion of late stage diagnosis presented positive spatial correlation with Gini's Index (p = 0.001) and negative with the density of gynecologist doctors (p = 0.009). The adjusted mortality rates presented a positive spatial correlation with the Human Development Index (p<0.001) and density of gynecologist doctors (p<0.001). Socioeconomic and health service offer-related inequalities of the Brazilian territory are determinants of the spatial pattern of breast cancer morbimortality in Brazil.

Beril			Translating a Global Emission-Reduction Framework for Subnational Climate Action: A Case Study from the State of Georgia	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Carbon footprint; Carbon neutrality; Equity; Climate roadmap	SOIL RESPIRATION; VULNERABILITY; GOVERNANCE; CARBON; MODEL	Subnational entities are recognizing the need to systematically examine options for reducing their carbon footprints. However, few robust and comprehensive analyses are available that lay out how US states and regions can most effectively contribute. This paper describes an approach developed for Georgia-a state in the southeastern United States called "Drawdown Georgia", our research involves (1) understanding Georgia's baseline carbon footprint and trends, (2) identifying the universe of Georgia-specific carbon-reduction solutions that could be impactful by 2030, (3) estimating the greenhouse gas reduction potential of these high-impact 2030 solutions for Georgia, and (4) estimating associated costs and benefits while also considering how the solutions might impact societal priorities, such as economic development opportunities, public health, environmental benefits, and equity. We began by examining the global solutions identified by Project Drawdown. The resulting 20 high-impact 2030 solutions provide a strategy for reducing Georgia's carbon footprint in the next decade using market-ready technologies and practices and including negative emission solutions. This paper describes our systematic and replicable process and ends with a discussion of its strengths, weaknesses, and planned future research.

At the Caritas Medical Centre for undocumented migrants and homeless in Rome, students obtain an educational experience of service. The aim of this study is to try to measure the long-term impact of this experience on the professional and life choices of the student participants. Methods: A questionnaire was designed and distributed by email to all 19-29 years old participants in the experience. Responses were collected and analysed in a quantitative descriptive way and in a qualitative way using the knowledge, skills and attitudes model. Results: One hundred and seven students responded from the total 763 questionnaires distributed. Ninety-five percent of participants expressed a very high overall satisfaction, 93% declared that the experience influenced his/her future personal choices, and 84% found that the experience influenced their professional choices. Results were arranged into 6 categories of comments: knowledge about the realities of migration, poverty, and marginalization; relational skills; collaborative skills; attitudes towards migrants, poor people and others; Attitudes towards future professions; Attitudes towards life. A final category was listed with self-reflective questions related to the experience. Conclusion: This research shows the importance of service-learning experiences made during academic studies from young students of medicine and other faculties. Developing a relationship with marginalized and homeless people, within a voluntary service setting, can influence the future professional and personal choices of students. Universities should recognize the value of such experiences and establish partnerships with non-profit organizations to allow future health professionals to confront health inequities and commit themselves to their reduction.

J	Yuan, M; Lin, H; Wu, HQ; Yu, MC; Tu, J; Lu, Y				Yuan, Ming; Lin, Han; Wu, Hengqin; Yu, Mingchuan; Tu, Juan; Lu, Yong			Community engagement in public health: a bibliometric mapping of global research	ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Public health; Community engagement; Bibliometric; Visualization	ALMA-ATA; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; COVID-19; RESILIENCE; SERVICES; OUTCOMES; COUNTY; ORGANIZATIONS; PERSPECTIVE; DISPARITIES	Background: Community engagement (CE) has been regarded as a critical element of successful health programs to achieve "the health for all" goals. Numerous studies have shown that it plays a significant role in reducing inequalities, improving social justice, enhancing benefits, and sharing responsibility towards public health. Despite this, the extant literature of community engagement in public health (CEPH) has topic-focused boundaries and is scattered across disciplinary. Large-scale studies are needed to systematically identify current status, hotspots, knowledge structure, dynamic trends, and future developments in this field. Methods: The bibliometric techniques were applied in the analysis of publications on CEPH in Web of Science Core Collection from Thomson Reuters. One thousand one hundred two papers out of 70.8 million publications over the period of 1980 to 2020 and their 15,116 references were retrieved as the sample set. First, basic characteristics of publications, including distributions of geography, journals and categories, productive authors and frequently cited articles, etc. were obtained. Then, four bibliometric methods, i.e. social network analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence clustering, and burst detection, were further conducted to sketch the contours of the structure and evolution of CEPH. Results: Between Jan 1, 1980, and Apr 25, 2020, CEPH has attracted a sharp increase in interest all over the world. Total 117 countries or regions have participated in the field of CEPH and the contributions are geographically and institutionally distinct. The United States is the key region performing such research, which accounts for more than half of the total number of publications. Developing countries, such as South Africa, India, Brazil and China also contributed a lot. The advancements of CEPH are marked by historically momentous public health events and evolved from macroscopic strategies to mesoscopic and microscopic actions. Based on keyword clustering and co-citation clustering, we propose a 4O (i.e. orientation, object, operation, and outcome) framework of CEPH to facilitate a better understanding of the current global achievements and an elaborate structuring of developments in the future. Conclusion: This study draws an outline of the global review on the contemporary and cross-disciplinary research of CEPH which might present an opportunity to take stock and understand the march of knowledge as well as the logical venation underlying research activities which are fundamental to inform policy making.

J	Wang, ZL; Zaman, QU; Zaman, S				Wang, Zilong; Zaman, Qamar Uz; Zaman, Shah			A dynamical assessment of multidimensional poverty in agro-climatic zones: an evidence from Punjab Pakistan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Multidimensional poverty; Agro-climate zones; Punjab; Pakistan	PRO-POOR GROWTH	The dynamics of poverty have become a controversial issue and one of the most common socio-economic problems in global economies, especially in developing economies as a whole. As per the importance of precise dilemma, the current study examines single as well as multidimensional poverty in the agro-climatic zones of Punjab, Pakistan, for the last 8 years from 2011-2012 to 2018-2019 by utilizing four available latest HIES (Household Integrated Economic Survey) datasets taken from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS). This study uses a couple of indexing methods, namely FGT (1984) and Alkire and Foster (2007). Temporal analysis of the first measure of poverty demonstrates that with a shorter (longer) time gap, poverty presents a hybrid (declining) trend in the uni-dimensional spectrum in the province of Punjab and its agro-climatic zones. While population decomposition for uni-dimensional poverty validates that residences of cotton-wheat Punjab and lower intensity Punjab is the major contributor to overall province poverty. Thus, to diminish poverty in a single-dimensional context, it is the need of time to take emergency steps like uplift economic growth, lessen income inequalities, and create job opportunities by the government for the improvement of the living standard of the residences of the overall province with special consideration on both these most affected zones. Similarly, calculations of the second measure of multidimensional poverty reveal that poverty also presents a hybrid (declining) trend with a shorter (longer) span of time in the overall province and all agro-climatic zones with the exception of the wheat-rice zone. However, dimensional decomposition for multidimensional poverty index demarcates that education and health are the major contributors to MDP, and declining the households' deprivation in both these dimensions is relatively helpful to nippy fall in poverty in the study area.

J	Conlon, K				Conlon, Katie			A social systems approach to sustainable waste management: leverage points for plastic reduction in Colombo, Sri Lanka	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY			English	Article						Plastic pollution; plastic waste; waste management; sustainability; systems thinking; Sri Lanka	HEALTH; DEBRIS; COUNTRIES; FRAMEWORK; CHINA	Global plastic production continues to increase at an exponential pace, and global waste projections show waste generation rising by 70% by 2050. Plastic waste connects to all social processes, especially within the context of urbanization and development; urban planning and land management; GHG emissions; labor; social equity; public health; rural-to-urban migration; increasing population; increasing consumption; climate change; etc. The focus of this research is an analysis of plastic waste management practices in Sri Lanka applying systems thinking, with a goal to better understand the social and ecological impacts of plastic waste in Sri Lanka. This research fills a gap in understanding the complex social dynamics that factor into plastic management, beyond the engineering of waste systems. The researcher works from the assumptions that waste is a social issue, that requires social responses that move beyond engineering and linear waste management; that designing a better or more efficient linear solid waste management system for the current realities of waste generation will only result in a continued, unsustainable waste system; and that plastics are truly a global challenge, relevant for global south contexts, and these challenges require local-appropriate solutions. The findings illuminate the network of local waste stakeholders, and highlight paths forward in waste reduction through patterns of behavior, structure, and mental modes that can lead towards a sustainable future for Colombo.

J	Colomé-Hidalgo, M; Campos, JD; de Miguel, AG				Colome-Hidalgo, Manuel; Donado Campos, Juan; Gil de Miguel, Angel			Exploring wealth-related inequalities in maternal and child health coverage in Latin America and the Caribbean	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Maternal and child health; Health inequalities; Socioeconomic factors; Latin America; Caribbean region	NEWBORN	Background: Maternal and child health have shown important advances in the world in recent years. However, national averages indicators hide large inequalities in access and quality of care in population subgroups. We explore wealth-related inequalities affecting health coverage and interventions in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health in Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods: We analyzed representative national surveys from 15 countries conducted between 2001 and 2016. We estimated maternal-child health coverage gaps using the Composite Coverage Index - a weighted average of interventions that include family planning, maternal and newborn care, immunizations, and treatment of sick children. We measured absolute and relative inequality to assess gaps by wealth quintile. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to test the association between the coverage gap and population attributable risk. Results: The Composite Coverage Index showed patterns of inequality favoring the wealthiest subgroups. In eight countries the national coverage was higher than the global median (78.4%; 95% CI: 73.1-83.6) and increased significantly as inequality decreased (Pearson r = 0.9; p < 0.01). Conclusions: There are substantial inequalities between socioeconomic groups. Reducing inequalities will improve coverage indicators for women and children. Additional health policies, programs, and practices are required to promote equity.

Currently, Peru is one of the principal Venezuelan migrant-receiving countries in Latin America. There are around one million Venezuelan refugees and migrants in the country. This study evaluates the association between self-perceived discrimination and mental health problems in Venezuelan population living in Peru. Method: We analyzed data from the Venezuelan Population Residing in Peru Survey 2018, a nationally representative urban sample aimed at collecting information on several dimensions of Venezuelan population wellbeing. We applied logistic regression models to assess the association between self-perceived discrimination and mental health problems. Moreover, we applied the propensity score matching method as a robustness check of our results. Results: Of 9487 Venezuelans surveyed, 6806 included complete information. From this sample, 6.3% reported mental health problems related to fear, anger, anxiety, or stress. Logistic regression models showed that Venezuelans who perceived being discriminated against had 2.4 higher odds of presenting mental health problems than their non-discriminated counterparts. Moreover, propensity score matching models showed that Venezuelans who perceived being discriminated against increased by 3.5 percentage points their probability of presenting mental health problems compared to their non-discriminated counterparts. Conclusions: There is evidence that self-perceived discrimination is associated with mental health deterioration in Venezuelan migrants living in Peru. Our findings are relevant in the current geopolitical context and could be useful in the decision making processes in international health.

J	Pramono, A; Smith, J; Desborough, J; Bourke, S				Pramono, Andini; Smith, Julie; Desborough, Jane; Bourke, Siobhan			Social value of maintaining baby-friendly hospital initiative accreditation in Australia: case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article							BREAST-FEEDING INITIATION; ACUTE OTITIS-MEDIA; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; HEALTH-BENEFITS; OBESITY; RATES; RISK; INTELLIGENCE; DURATION; OUTCOMES	BackgroundBreastfeeding has positive impacts on the health, environment, and economic wealth of families and countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) in 1991 as a global program to incentivize maternity services to implement the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (Ten Steps). These were developed to ensure that maternity services remove barriers for mothers and families to successfully initiate breastfeeding and to continue breastfeeding through referral to community support after hospital discharge. While more than three in four births in Australia take place in public hospitals, in 2020 only 26% of Australian hospitals were BFHI-accredited. So what is the social return to investing in BFHI accreditation in Australia, and does it incentivize BFHI accreditation? This study aimed to examine the social value of maintaining the BFHI accreditation in one public maternity unit in Australia using the Social Return on Investment (SROI) framework. This novel method was developed in 2000 and measures social, environmental and economic outcomes of change using monetary values.MethodThe study was non-experimental and was conducted in the maternity unit of Calvary Public Hospital, Canberra, an Australian BFHI-accredited public hospital with around 1000 births annually. This facility provided an opportunity to illustrate costs for maintaining BFHI accreditation in a relatively affluent urban population. Stakeholders considered within scope of the study were the mother-baby dyad and the maternity facility. We interviewed the hospital's Director of Maternity Services and the Clinical Midwifery Educator, guided by a structured questionnaire, which examined the cost (financial, time and other resources) and benefits of each of the Ten Steps. Analysis was informed by the Social Return on Investment (SROI) framework, which consists of mapping the stakeholders, identifying and valuing outcomes, establishing impact, calculating the ratio and conducting sensitivity analysis. This information was supplemented with micro costing studies from the literature that measure the benefits of the BFHI.ResultsThe social return from the BFHI in this facility was calculated to be AU$ 1,375,050. The total investment required was AU$ 24,433 per year. Therefore, the SROI ratio was approximately AU$ 55:1 (sensitivity analysis: AU$ 16-112), which meant that every AU$1 invested in maintaining BFHI accreditation by this maternal and newborn care facility generated approximately AU$55 of benefit.ConclusionsScaled up nationally, the BFHI could provide important benefits to the Australian health system and national economy. In this public hospital, the BFHI produced social value greater than the cost of investment, providing new evidence of its effectiveness and economic gains as a public health intervention. Our findings using a novel tool to calculate the social rate of return, indicate that the BHFI accreditation is an investment in the health and wellbeing of families, communities and the Australian economy, as well as in health equity.

Inequality amplifies the negative association between life expectancy and air pollution: A cross-national longitudinal study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Air pollution; Global health; Inequality; Particulate matter; Stratification; Sustainability	INCOME INEQUALITY; HEALTH; DISPARITIES; EXPOSURE; JUSTICE; STRESS; PM2.5; RISK	Ambient air pollution, in the form of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), poses serious population health risks. We estimate cross-national longitudinal models to test whether the negative relationship between life expectancy and PM2.5 concentration is larger in nations with higher levels of income inequality. The dependent variable is average life expectancy at birth, and the focal predictor variables include PM2.5 concentration, income inequality, and the two-way interaction between them. We also estimate the average marginal effects of PM2.5 concentration from low to high values of income inequality, and the predicted values of life expectancy from low to high values of PM2.5 concentration and income inequality. Results indicate that the negative relationship between life expectancy and PM2.5 concentration is larger in nations with higher levels of income inequality, and the reductions in predicted life expectancy are substantial when both PM2.5 concentration and income inequality are high. We suggest that the theoretical principles of Power, Proximity, and Physiology help explain our findings. This study underscores the importance in considering the multiplicative impacts of environmental conditions and socioeconomic factors in the modeling of population health. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we first explored spatial patterns of COVID-19 mortality rate in comparison to non-COVID-19mortality rate. Subsequently, we establishedmodels to investigate contributions of socioeconomic and environmental factors to spatial variations of COVID-19 mortality rate across England (N = 317). Two newly developed specifications of spatial regression models were established successfully to estimate COVID-19 mortality rate (R-2= 0.49 and R-2= 0.793). The level of spatial inequalities of COVID-19 mortality is higher than that of non-COVID-19mortality in England. Although global spatial association of COVID-19 mortality and non-COVID-19mortality is positive, local spatial association of COVID-19 mortality and non-COVID-19 mortality is negative in some areas. Expectedly, hospital accessibility is negatively related to COVID-19 mortality rate. Percent of Asians, percent of Blacks, and unemployment rate are positively related to COVID-19 mortality rate. More importantly, relative humidity is negatively related to COVID-19 mortality rate. Moreover, among the spatialmodels estimated, the 'randomeffects specification of eigenvector spatial filteringmodel' outperforms the 'matrix exponential spatial specification of spatial autoregressive-model'.

The consequences could be even more severe for those more vulnerable to the disease, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Indeed, there is evidence that such vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected in terms of both, their health and the socioeconomic impact. The aim of our study was to determine whether occupational health (OH) professionals thought that the COVID-19 pandemic might further disadvantage any particular group(s) of vulnerable workers globally, and if so, which group(s). A cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of OH professionals by means of an online questionnaire which was shared via email within the ICOH (International Commission for Occupational Health) community. Data was collected over a period of two weeks in May 2020 and 165 responses from 52 countries were received. In this paper, the responses relating to questions about vulnerable workers are reported and discussed. Globally, our responders felt that those in less secure jobs (precarious employment (79%) and informal work (69%)), or unemployed (63%), were the most at risk of further disadvantage from this pandemic. The majority felt that their governments could act to mitigate these effects. There were suggestions of short-term alleviation such as financial and social support, as well as calls for fundamental reviews of the underlying inequalities that leave populations so vulnerable to a crisis such as COVID-19.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						COVID-19; Conflict-countries		The relentless spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its penetration into the least developed, fragile, and conflict-affected countries (LDFCAC) is a certainty. Expansion of the pandemic will be expedited by factors such as an abundance of at-risk populations, inadequate COVID-19 mitigation efforts, sheer inability to comply with community mitigation strategies, and constrained national preparedness. This situation will reduce the benefits achieved through decades of disease control and health promotion measures, and the economic progress made during periods of global development. Without interventions, and as soon as international travel and trade resume, reservoirs of COVID-19 and other vaccine-preventable diseases in LDFCAC will continue 'feeding' developed countries with repeated infection seeds. Assuring LDFCAC equity in access to medical countermeasures, funds to mitigate the pandemic, and a paradigm change in the global development agenda, similar to the post-World War II Marshall Plan for Europe, are urgently needed. We argue for a paradigm change in strategy, including a new global pandemic financing mechanism for COVID-19 and other future pandemics. This approach should assist LDFCAC in gaining access to and membership of a global interdisciplinary pandemic taskforce to enable in-country plans to train, leverage, and maintain essential functioning and also to utilize and enhance surveillance and early detection capabilities. Such a task force will be able to build on and expand research into the management of pandemics, protect vulnerable populations through international laws/treaties, and reinforce and align the development agenda to prevent and mitigate future pandemics. Lifting LDFCAC from COVID-related failure will offer the global community the best economic dividends of the century. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

METHODS: Ecological study in which we used estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 for Central American countries. Results were expressed as U5MRs (deaths per 1000 live births), cause-specific mortality rates (deaths per 100 000 population,5 years of age), and regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: U5MRs decreased 65% (1990-2016), and in 2016, all countries but Guatemala had met SDG 3.2.1. The main causes of death were diarrheal diseases (1990; 311.1 per 100 000) and lower respiratory infections (LRIs) (2016; 78.1 per 100 000). When disaggregated by country (2016), congenital birth defects were the most important cause of death in all countries except for in Honduras (neonatal preterm birth) and Guatemala (LRIs). Nutritional status; availability of water, sanitation, and hygiene services; coverage of vaccines; and coverage of contraception were associated with a reduction in U5MRs. CONCLUSIONS: Central America has achieved a large reduction in U5MRs. Countries must address both the high mortality caused by LRIs and the rising mortality caused by noncommunicable causes of death through an improvement of SDG indicators that guarantees equitable progress in child survival in the region.

In the absence of sufficient laws and policies that mitigate discrimination and enhance reasonable work modifications, private employers have a high degree of agency and discretion in how they hire, manage, or terminate employees with chronic illnesses (ECI). There is a scarcity of research on how employers make decisions under these conditions. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we interviewed and analysed data from 30 human resource (HR) professionals and decision-makers within private organisations in Klang Valley, Malaysia (June 2015-September 2016). In this paper, we use 'ethics of care' as an analytic, and moral lens to present HR's decision-making rationales in caring for and managing ECI. Respondents described the positive influence of international practices, including through parent company policies, as a reference for best practice. While overt bias and discriminatory perceptions were predictably described, participants also discussed care as relational organisational culture, and strategy, albeit selectively. Apart from illness factors such as duration and severity, descriptions of 'selective caregiving' included considerations of an employee's duration in organisations, the perceived value of the employee to employers, organisation size, ethos, resources and capabilities, and how organisations managed the uncertainty of illness futures as a potential risk to organisation outcomes. Selective caregiving can contribute to social, economic and health inequalities in populations with chronic illness. Nevertheless, global health actors can use the problems identified by participants, as entry points to engage more closely with employers and the broader private and commercial sectors in LMICs, to facilitate more inclusive care, and care-based intersectoral work to address the social and economic determinants of health.

However, the theoretical aspects and polysemous character of social justice as applied in the field of public health are often assumed rather than explicitly explained. An intersectional justice approach to understanding health inequality, inequity, and injustice might be useful. It argues that preexisting class-, race/ethnicity-, and gender-based health injustice and the socially differentiated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are shaped, interconnectedly, by economic maldistribution, cultural misrecognition, and political misrepresentation. Pursuing health justice requires analyses, strategies, and interventions that integrate the economic, cultural, and political spheres of redistribution, recognition, and representation, respectively. Such an intersectional approach to health justice is even more relevant and compelling in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article is broadly about class, race/ethnicity, and gender political economy of public health-but with a narrower focus on maldistribution, misrecognition, and misrepresentation, shaping social and health injustices.

There is limited information on disparities of people with epilepsy (PWE) and, foremost, their caregivers. The objective of this study was to comprehensively compare between PWE and caregivers with low socioeconomic status (SES) and those with high SES for disparities in demographic and epilepsy characteristics, treatment and health care utilization, physical and psychosocial impact, and knowledge about epilepsy. Methods. PWE and caregivers completed surveys about the aforementioned outcomes during their epilepsy clinic visit or epilepsy monitoring unit admission. Associations were evaluated using SES as a binary independent variable and the patient and caregiver related outcomes as dependent variables. Results. Thirty-eight patients with low SES and 88 patients with high SES were recruited. Patients with low SES were more commonly non-white, uninsured, unemployed, of lower educational attainment and living in larger households. They were more likely to visit the emergency room for their seizures, were more frequently on polypharmacy and experienced more AED adverse effects. They exhibited higher depression and anxiety levels and worse quality of life. Twenty-two caregivers with low SES and 66 caregivers of high SAS were recruited. Caregivers with low SES were more likely to be non-white and single. They manifested poorer knowledge about epilepsy. Conclusion. There are notable inequalities in demographic, treatmentrelated and health care utilization aspects of care of PWE, as well as in the psychosocial impact of their disease. Additional demographic and epilepsy knowledge-related disparities are recognized in caregivers of PWE. Identification of those disparities is a critical step in the creation of appropriate interventions to eliminate them.

Whether mortality is converging in the EU remains unclear. We reviewed the literature on mortality convergence in the post-2004 EU territory as a whole. We also explored whether the study designs influenced the results and whether any determinants of mortality convergence had been empirically examined. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed. Our search included scientific databases and the websites of international governmental institutions and European demographic research institutes. Results: We uncovered 94 unique records and included seven studies that reported on 36 analyses. There was marked methodological heterogeneity, including in the convergence measures (beta and sigma convergence). All of the beta convergence analyses found narrowing mortality differentials, whereas most of the sigma convergence analyses found widening mortality differentials. The results are robust to the units of analysis and mortality and dispersion measures. Our results also suggest that there is a lack of evidence on the determinants of mortality convergence in the EU. Conclusions: There is general agreement that the EU regions and the Member States with high initial mortality rates improved the fastest, but this trend did not lead to overall mortality convergence in the EU. The harmonization of mortality convergence measures and research into determinants of mortality convergence are needed to support future EU cohesion policy. Policy-makers should consider supporting areas that have moderate but stagnant mortality rates, in addition to those with high mortality rates.

Yet, the timing and nature of gender inequalities during childhood and adolescence are less clear. We describe the emergence of gender inequalities in health and wellbeing across the first two decades of life. Methods We focused on the 40 low-income and middle-income countries in Asia and the Pacific. A measurement framework was developed around four key domains of wellbeing across the first two decades: health, education and transition to employment, protection, and a safe environment. Specific measurement constructs were then defined by considering gender indicator frameworks, the Sustainable Development Goals, indicator frameworks for child and adolescent health and wellbeing, and key stakeholder input. Available data were then mapped to define 87 indicators, subsequently populated using databases (UN agencies and the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study) and nationally representative surveys. Where possible, estimates in girls were compared with boys to report relative risks. Findings Although son preference is evident in some settings-as shown by higher than expected male-to-female sex ratios at birth in India, Vietnam, and China (all >1.10 compared with an expected ratio of 1.05) and excess mortality of girl children in some South Asian and Pacific nations-it is during early adolescence where marked gender inequalities consistently emerged. Adolescent girls face considerable disadvantage in relation to sexual and reproductive health (notably in South Asia and the Pacific), with high rates of child marriage (>= 30% of women aged 20-24 years married before 18 years in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Afghanistan), fertility (>= 65 livebirths per 1000 girls in Nauru, Laos, Afghanistan, Nepal, Marshall Islands, Bangladesh, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea), and intimate partner violence (>20% in Timor Leste, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Myanmar). Despite educational parity in many countries, females aged 15-24 years were less likely than males to be in education, employment, or training in 17 of 19 countries for which data were available. Compared with girls, adolescent boys experienced excess all-cause mortality and substantially higher mortality due to unintentional injury, interpersonal violence, alcohol and other drugs, and suicide, and higher prevalence of harmful drinking and tobacco smoking. Interpretation These findings call for a focus on gender policy and programming in later childhood and early adolescence before gender inequalities become embedded. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Objective: To analyse sex differences in patients encountering their general practitioner (GP) with respiratory symptoms with regard to incidence, GP's management and final diagnoses. Methods: Retrospective cohort study, using data of the Dutch Practice Based Research Network. All patients who encountered their GP from 01-07-2013 until 30-06-2018 with a new episode of care starting with a reason for encounter in the respiratory category (R) of the ICPC-2 classification were included (n = 16 773). Multi-level logistic regression was used to analyse influence of patients' sex on management of GPs with adjustment for possible confounders. Results: We found a significant higher incidence of respiratory symptoms in women than in men: 230/1000 patient years [95% confidence interval (CI) 227-232] and 186/1000 patient years (95% CI 183-189), respectively. When presenting with cough, GPs are more likely to perform physical examination [odds ratio (OR) 1.22; 95% CI 1.11-1.35] and diagnostic radiology (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.08-1.44), but less likely to prescribe medication (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.82-0.95) in men. When visiting the GP with dyspnoea, men more often undergo diagnostic imaging (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.05-1.66) and are more often referred to a specialist (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.13-1.62). Conclusions: Women encounter their GP more frequently with respiratory symptoms than men and GPs perform more diagnostic investigations in men. We suggest more research in general practice focussing on sex differences and possible confounders.	[Groeneveld, Johanna M.; van Boven, Kees; Akkermans, Reinier P.; Hartman, Tim C.

J	Simard-Duplain, G; St-Denis, X				Simard-Duplain, Gaelle; St-Denis, Xavier			Exploration of the Role of Education in Intergenerational Income Mobility in Canada: Evidence from the Longitudinal and International Study of Adults	CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY-ANALYSE DE POLITIQUES			English	Article						education; intergenerational income transmission; skills; social mobility	OCCUPATIONAL-MOBILITY; UNITED-STATES; INEQUALITY; TRANSMISSION; OPPORTUNITY; COLLEGE; MEN; PERSISTENCE; GRADUATE; ORIGINS	Canadian children experience a high level of intergenerational income mobility compared with US children. Moreover, their physical and mental health outcomes, school readiness, and post-secondary attendance are all less tightly associated with parental outcomes than in the United States. In this article, we investigate the role played by children's education in the intergenerational transmission of income in Canada. Existing research has produced macro-level estimates of mobility to draw comparisons over time and across places and has studied the micro-level mechanisms that underlie the relationship between parents' and children's outcomes. However, evidence on the extent to which the different factors investigated drive the broader numbers is still limited. To remedy this, we exploit the Longitudinal and International Study of Adults, a rich panel of integrated survey and administrative data covering 1982-2013. We estimate that the education level of children accounts for 40.5-50.1 percent of the correlation between their income and their parents', similar to the United States. Moreover, we discuss evidence suggesting that the greater mobility of Canadian children is linked not only to their lower returns to education but also to the weaker association between their education and their parents' income. Finally, we find that almost half of the effect linked to education is associated with the skills respondents use at work, such as reading or communication. Les enfants canadiens profitent d'un niveau de mobilite intergenerationnelle eleve par rapport a celui des enfants nes aux Etats-Unis. De plus, leur sante physique et mentale, leur preparation a l'ecole et leur participation aux etudes postsecondaires sont toutes moins etroitement liees aux resultats parentaux que ce n'est le cas aux Etats-Unis. Les auteurs etudient le role que joue le niveau d'education des enfants dans la transmission intergenerationnelle du revenu au Canada. Des etudes existantes fournissent des estimations de la mobilite a un niveau macro, ce qui permet d'effectuer des comparaisons geographiques et historiques, et ont explore les mecanismes qui sous-tendent la relation entre les caracteristiques des parents et celles de leurs enfants au niveau micro. Cependant, peu de travaux documentent la mesure dans laquelle les differents mecanismes etudies influent sur les estimations au niveau macro. Afin de remedier a cette lacune, les auteurs exploitent l'Etude longitudinale et internationale des adultes (ELIA), un riche panel integrant des donnees d'enquete et des donnees administratives qui couvrent la periode s'echelonnant de 1982 a 2013. Ils estiment que le niveau de scolarite des enfants explique de 40,5 a 50,1 pour cent de la correlation entre leur revenu et celui de leurs parents, un resultat similaire a celui que l'on peut observer aux Etats-Unis. De plus, les resultats que presentent les auteurs indiquent que le niveau de mobilite plus eleve des enfants canadiens semble lie non seulement au plus faible taux de rendement de l'education, mais aussi a une plus faible association entre leur niveau de scolarite et le revenu de leurs parents. Enfin, les auteurs demontrent que pres de la moitie de l'effet lie a l'education est associee aux competences que les repondants utilisent au travail comme la lecture et la communication verbale.

J	Stevano, S; Johnston, D; Codjoe, E				Stevano, Sara; Johnston, Deborah; Codjoe, Emmanuel			Better decisions for food security? Critical reflections on the economics of food choice and decision-making in development economics	CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						Decision-making; food; well-being; development; food industry	INTRAHOUSEHOLD RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; BOUNDED RATIONALITY; MATERNAL EDUCATION; COLLECTIVE MODELS; HOUSEHOLD; EMPOWERMENT; INEQUALITY; PRODUCTS; POVERTY; WELFARE	With malnutrition recognised as a key public health issue, attention has been placed on how individuals can make better decisions to attain food and nutrition security. Nevertheless, food practice entails a complex set of decisions that are not fully understood. This paper interrogates the focus on food choice by investigating how socio-economic relations shape practices of food provisioning. Given the surge of behavioural approaches in development economics and our focus on a middle-income country, we contextualise food choice in the transformations of the conceptualisations of decision-making in development economics. We draw on mixed-method evidence on food consumption practices among schoolchildren in Accra, Ghana. We find that the food decision-making process is complex in that it entails multiple moments and people, and embodies contradictory motivations. Decisions are negotiated outcomes reflecting social relations of power among the actors involved. Socio-economic inequality fragments the urban food environment and material living conditions. Furthermore, the concentration of capital gives the food industry the power to shape material and cultural relations to food in ways that extraordinarily limit the scope for individual choice. This is a critical case study to understand the contemporary dynamics of malnutrition in the urban Global South, with broader relevance for the analysis of food poverty elsewhere.

In this respect, a country can improve its economic situation by identifying and controlling the factors that exert an influence on life expectancy. Previous studies in the field have intensively approached this topic, but the results obtained are still conflicting. The objective of our paper is to continue research and investigations in accordance with previous studies, by analyzing the influence of four explanatory indicators (GDP, health expenditures, individual income and household consumption) on life expectancy (as a dependent variable in the case of males and females) in the particular case of European Union, and seven countries in the EU (Romania, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Lithuania and Slovakia). In order to achieve our research objective, we used the Toda-Yamamoto approach of the Granger causality for the data collected for the period 1995-2017. Our study reveals the fact that only in the particular case of Bulgaria the GDP and final consumption do influence life expectancy for men. Wages were found to influence life expectancy only for females in Romania and for men in Poland, thus suggesting differences between genders. Some inverse causalities were also demonstrated. We believe that our research will have theoretical implications by deepening the knowledge in the field regarding life expectancy, and also practical implications allowing the identification of the factors that influence life expectancy (important for countries to take appropriate action). Our research brings value to the field, by analyzing in a unitary manner (same data source, same methodology, same geographical coordinates) the effect of four different explanatory variables, with economic substance, on life expectancy from 2 perspectives: male and female. Also, we analyze the particular case of seven countries in the EU, with similar economic backgrounds, to see if results can be extrapolated. Unfortunately, the results obtained are debatable and generally mixed. Further research is needed in order to identify the underlying causes of the results obtained.

Prior to the pandemic, some studies reported that telehealth was an efficient and effective form of health care delivery, particularly for older people. There has been increased use of telehealth and publication of new literature on this topic during the pandemic, so we conducted a scoping review and evidence synthesis for telehealth use in geriatric care to summarize learning from these new data. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 global research database for articles published between 1 January and 20 August 2020. We included 79 articles that met our inclusion criteria. The information collected has been synthesized and presented as descriptive statistics. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) have also been discussed. Results: The articles included in our review provide some evidence of effective provision of preventive, curative, and rehabilitative telehealth services for older people, but they highlight a greater focus on curative services and are mostly concentrated in high-income countries. We identified convenience and affordability as the strengths of telehealth use in geriatric care. Weaknesses identified include the inability of telehealth to cater to the needs of older people with specific physical and cognitive limitations. While the threats of increasing inequity and the lack of standardization in the provision of age-friendly telehealth services remain, we identified opportunities for technologic advancements driven by simplicity and user-friendliness for older people. Conclusion: Telehealth offers futuristic promise for the provision of essential health care services for older people worldwide. However, the extent of these services via telehealth appears to be currently limited in low and low-middle income countries. Optimizing telehealth services that can be accessed by older people requires greater government investments and active engagement by broader participation of older people, their caregivers, physicians and other health care providers, technology experts, and health managers.

Based on theories of gender as a social system, we examine whether systematic gender inequality at the macro-level influences health of men and women. Method: Using harmonized panel data from the Gateway to Global Aging Data in 23 high- and middle-income countries (N = 168 873), we estimate disability prevalence and incidence for men and women ages 55-89 (2000-2016). Within each country or geographic region, we also investigate gender differences in age gradients of the probability of disability onset. We, then, pool data from all countries and test the hypothesis that gender inequality increases the probability of disability onset. Results: We found substantial cross-country variation in disability incidence rates, and this variation is greater for women than for men. Among ages 65-69, disability incidence rates ranged from 0.4 to 5.0 for men and from 0.5 to 9.4 for women. Our within-country analysis showed significant gender differences in age gradients of the probability of disability onset in the United States, Korea, Southern Europe, Mexico, and China, but not in Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe, England, and Israel. Testing hypothesized effects of gender inequality, we find that gender inequality is significantly associated with the probability of disability onset for women, but not for men. Conclusions: Macro-level societal gender inequality is significantly associated with the probability of disability onset for women. Reducing and eliminating gender inequality is crucial to achieving good health for women.

J	Fancourt, D; Steptoe, A; Bu, FF				Fancourt, Daisy; Steptoe, Andrew; Bu, Feifei			Trajectories of anxiety and depressive symptoms during enforced isolation due to COVID-19 in England: a longitudinal observational study	LANCET PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							GENERALIZED ANXIETY; MENTAL-HEALTH; DISORDER; IMPACT; QUARANTINE	Background There is major concern about the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak on mental health. Several studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries before and during enforced isolation (ie, lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed week by week over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the trajectories of anxiety and depression over the 20 weeks after lockdown was announced in England, and compare the growth trajectories by individual characteristics. Methods In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we analysed data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a panel study weighted to population proportions, which collects information on anxiety (using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder assessment) and depressive symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire) weekly in the UK since March 21, 2020. We included data from adults living in England who had at least three repeated measures between March 23 and Aug 9, 2020. Analyses were done using latent growth models, which were fitted to account for sociodemographic and health covariates. Findings Between March 23, and Aug 9, data from over 70 000 adults were collected in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. When including participants living in England with three follow-up measures and no missing values, our analytic sample consisted of 36520 participants. The average depression score was 6.6 (5 D=6 .0, range 0-27) and the average anxiety score 5.7 (SD=5.6, range 0-21) in week 1. Anxiety and depression levels both declined across the first 20 weeks following the introduction of lockdown in England (b=-1.93, SE=0.26, p<0.0001 for anxiety; b=-2. 52, SE=0. 28, p<0.0001 for depressive symptoms). The fastest decreases were seen across the strict lockdown period (between weeks 2 and 5), with symptoms plateauing as further lockdown easing measures were introduced (between weeks 16 and 20). Being a woman or younger, having lower educational attainment, lower income, or pre-existing mental health conditions, and living alone or with children were all risk factors for higher levels of anxiety and depression at the start of lockdown. Many of these inequalities in experiences were reduced as lockdown continued, but differences were still evident 20 weeks after the start of lockdown. Interpretation These data suggest that the highest levels of depression and anxiety occurred in the early stages of lockdown but declined fairly rapidly, possibly because individuals adapted to circumstances. Our findings emphasise the importance of supporting individuals in the lead-up to future lockdowns to try to reduce distress, and highlight that groups already at risk for poor mental health before the pandemic have remained at risk throughout lockdown and its aftermath.

This study examines the individual mobility patterns for all transport modes (walk, bicycle, motorcycle, car driven alone, car driven in company, bus, subway, tram, train, airplane) before and during the restrictions adopted in ten countries on six continents: Australia, Brazil, China, Ghana, India, Iran, Italy, Norway, South Africa and the United States. This cross-country study also aims at understanding the predictors of protective behaviors related to the transport sector and COVID-19. Findings hinge upon an online survey conducted in May 2020 (N = 9,394). The empirical results quantify tremendous disruptions for both commuting and non-commuting travels, highlighting substantial reductions in the frequency of all types of trips and use of all modes. In terms of potential virus spread, airplanes and buses are perceived to be the riskiest transport modes, while avoidance of public transport is consistently found across the countries. According to the Protection Motivation Theory, the study sheds new light on the fact that two indicators, namely income inequality, expressed as Gini index, and the reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants, aggravate respondents' perceptions. This research indicates that socio-economic inequality and morbidity are not only related to actual health risks, as well documented in the relevant literature, but also to the perceived risks. These findings document the global impact of the COVID-19 crisis as well as provide guidance for transportation practitioners in developing future strategies.

J	Grasham, CF; Neville, G				Grasham, Catherine Fallon; Neville, George			Socio-political processes must be emphasised alongside climate change and urbanisation as key drivers of urban water insecurity	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Ethiopia; Governance; Inequity; Urban; Water security	SERVICES; AFRICA; CHALLENGES; RESILIENCE; SECURITY	Urban water security is of critical global and local importance. Across many parts of low- and middle-income countries, urban water security either remains elusive or is becoming stressed. Rapid urbanisation and climate change are two key drivers of resource insecurity and at the forefront of urban water discourse. However, there are manifold and complex socio-political processes functioning alongside these megatrends that are often underemphasised. Drawing on three urban case studies in Ethiopia, we highlight these structural issues and the need for their continued consideration to fully understand and address urban water insecurity. Household water-use surveys, semi-structured interviews and participatory exercises with community residents, stakeholders and informal water vendors were used as part of a mixed-method approach in three urban areas. We found that government-managed urban water supplies were intermittent and unsafe, resulting in economic, health and time-use burdens for households, and that the socio-political dimensions reproducing urban water insecurity have historical roots. We argue that the uncertainty of climate change and unprecedented urbanisation do not offer sufficient explanation for why urban water insecurity persists. Moreover, we call for caution in only employing these narratives, to avoid obscuring deeply rooted challenges within socio-political systems. We call for socio-political processes to continue to be a central component of future interventions that seek to improve urban water insecurity.

There is a lack of scholarly evidence on the extent and reasons for the inequalities in NMRs in Angola. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the socio-economic, place of residence, region and gender inequalities in the NMRs in Angola. Methods: The World Health Organization Health Equity Assessment Toolkit software was used to analyse data from the 2015 Angola Demographic and Health Survey. Five equity stratifiers: subnational regions, education, wealth, residence and sex were used to disaggregate NMR inequality. Absolute and relative inequality measures, namely, difference, population attributable fraction (PAF), population attributable risk (PAR) and ratio, were calculated to provide a broader understanding of the inequalities in NMR. Statistical significance was calculated at corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals. Findings: We found significant wealth-driven [PAR = -14.16, 95% corresponding interval (CI): -15.12, -13.19], education-related (PAF = -22.5%, 95% CI: -25.93, -19.23), urban-rural (PAF = -14.5%, 95% CI: -16.38, -12.74), sex-based (PAR = -5.6%, 95% CI: -6.17, -5.10) and subnational regional (PAF = -82.2%, 95% CI: -90.14, -74.41) disparities in NMRs, with higher burden among deprived population subgroups. Conclusions: High NMRs were found among male neonates and those born to mothers with no formal education, poor mothers and those living in rural areas and the Benguela region. Interventions aimed at reducing NMRs, should be designed with specific focus on disadvantaged subpopulations.

The prevalence of depression and anxiety is on the rise in Malaysia. Low-income urban communities are among the key affected populations with regards to mental health problems. This cross-sectional study was aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety and stress, and their associated factors among adults in the low-income community of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A total of 248 participants aged 18-60 years old were recruited. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21). Chi-squared test was used to examine the association between the variables. Multiple ordinal regression model was introduced to identify the predictors of depression, anxiety and stress. The proportions of participants with depression, anxiety and stress were 24.2% (95% CI: 19.6-30.4), 36.3% (95% CI: 29.9-43.0), and 20.6% (95% CI: 15.4-26.5), respectively. There was a statistically significant association of ethnicity (p = 0.002) and age (p = 0.014) with the severity of depression, ethnicity (p = 0.001) and age (p = 0.024) with the severity of anxiety, and ethnicity (p < 0.001) and marital status (p = 0.006) with the severity of stress. In a multivariable analysis, only non-Malay ethnicity was an independent predictor of the severity of depression [OR = 2.43, 95% CI (1.25, 4.72), p = 0.009], anxiety [OR = 2.55, 95% CI (1.41, 4.62), p = 0.002] and stress [OR = 4.28, 95% CI (2.06, 8.89), p = <0.001]. Mental health interventions should target low-income communities to address social inequalities of mental health within economically disadvantaged populations.

The Kenya Non-Communicable Diseases and Injury (NCDI) Poverty Commission was established to estimate the burden of NCDIs, determine the availability and coverage of health services, prioritize an expanded set of NCDI conditions, and propose cost-effective and equity-promoting interventions to avert the health and economic consequences of NCDIs in Kenya. Methods: Burden of NCDIs in Kenya was determined using desk review of published literature, estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study, and secondary analysis of local health surveillance data. Secondary analysis of nationally representative surveys was conducted to estimate current availability and coverage of services by socioeconomic status. The Commission then conducted a structured priority setting process to determine priority NCDI conditions and health sector interventions based on published evidence. Findings: There is a large and diverse burden of NCDIs in Kenya, with the majority of disability-adjusted life-years occurring before age of 40. The poorest wealth quintiles experience a substantially higher deaths rate from NCDIs, lower coverage of diagnosis and treatment for NCDIs, and lower availability of NCDI-related health services. The Commission prioritized 14 NCDIs and selected 34 accompanying interventions for recommendation to achieve UHC. These interventions were estimated to cost $11.76 USD per capita annually, which represents 15% of current total health expenditure. This investment could potentially avert 9,322 premature deaths per year by 2030. Conclusions and Recommendations: An expanded set of priority NCDI conditions and health sector interventions are required in Kenya to achieve UHC, particularly for disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. We provided recommendations for integration of services within existing health services platforms and financing mechanisms and coordination of whole-of-government approaches for the prevention and treatment of NCDIs.

Income-Related Inequality In Affordability And Access To Primary Care In Eleven High-Income Countries	HEALTH AFFAIRS			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; PRICES; STILL	A high-performing health care system strives to achieve universal access, affordability, high-quality care, and equity, aiming to reduce inequality in outcomes and access. Using data from the 2020 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey, we report on health status, socioeconomic risk factors, affordability, and access to primary care among US adults compared with ten other high-income countries. We highlight health experiences among lower-income adults and compare income-related disparities between lower- and higher-ncome adults across countries. Results indicate that among adults with lower incomes, those in the US fare relatively worse on affordability and access to primary care than those in other countries, and income-related disparities across domains are relatively greater throughout. The presence of these disparities should strengthen the resolve to find solutions to eliminate income-related inequality in affordability and primary care access.

In this article, we utilize critical theories and engage with colonial histories to contextualize Afrodiasporic experiences in Australia, arguing that the conditional acceptance of Black bodies within Australian spaces is contingent upon the status quo of the white hegemony. The tropes and discourses that render the bodies of Black African migrants simultaneously invisible and hyper-visible indicate that immigration is not only a movement of bodies, but also a phenomenon solidly tied to global inequality, power, and the abjection of blackness. Drawing on critical race perspectives and theories of belonging, we highlight through use of literature how Black Africans in Australia are constructed as 'perpetual strangers'. As moral panics and discourses of hyper-criminality are summoned, the bordering processes are also simultaneously co-opted to reinforce scrutiny and securitization, with significant implications for social cohesion, belonging and public health.

Stigma and Substance Use Disorders: A Clinical, Research, and Advocacy Agenda	AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article						alcohol; discrimination; opioids; stigma; substance use disorders	MENTAL-HEALTH; MINORITY STRESS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; SPECIAL-ISSUE; DRUG; ADDICTION; LANGUAGE; PREJUDICE; ALCOHOL	The United States is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic, with deaths due to opioid overdoses persisting in many communities. This epidemic is the latest wave in a series of global substance use-related public health crises. As a fundamental cause of health inequities, stigma leads to the development of substance use disorders (SUDs), undermines SUD treatment efforts, and drives persistent disparities within these crises. Given their expertise in mental and behavioral health, psychologists are uniquely positioned to play a frontline role in addressing SUD stigma. The goal of this paper is to set an agenda for psychologists to address SUD stigma through clinical care, research, and advocacy. To set the stage for this agenda, key concepts are introduced related to stigma and SUDs, and evidence is reviewed regarding associations between stigma and substance use-related outcomes. As clinicians, psychologists have opportunities to promote resilience to stigma to prevent the development of SUDs, and leverage acceptance and mindfulness approaches to reduce internalized stigma among people with SUDs. As researchers, psychologists can clarify the experiences and impacts of stigma among people with SUDs over time and adapt the stigma-reduction toolbox to address SUD stigma. As advocates, psychologists can call for changes in structural stigma such as policies that criminalize people with SUDs, protest the intentional use of SUD stigma, and adopt stigma-free language in professional and social settings.

Bias and Racism Teaching Rounds at an Academic Medical Center	CHEST			English	Article						bias; racism; strategy	PHYSICIANS IMPLICIT	Racism and events of racial violence have dominated the US news in 2020 almost as much as the novel coronavirus pandemic. The resultant civil unrest and demands for racial justice have spawned a global call for change. As a subset of a society that struggles with racism and other explicit biases, it is inescapable that some physicians and health-care employees will have the same explicit biases as the general population. Patients who receive care at academic medical centers interact with multiple individuals, some of whom may have explicit and implicit biases that influence patient care. In fact, multiple reports have documented that some physicians, health-care workers, and health professional students have negative biases based on race, ethnicity, obesity, religion, and sexual identity, among others. These biases can influence decision-making and aggravate health-care disparities and patient-physician mistrust. We review four actual cases from academic medical centers that illustrate how well-intended physicians and health-care workers can be influenced by bias and how this can put patients at risk. Strategies to mitigate bias are discussed and recommended. We introduce what we believe can be a powerful teaching tool: periodic "bias and racism rounds" in teaching hospitals, in which real patient interactions are reviewed critically to identify opportunities to reduce bias and racism and to attenuate the impact of bias and racism on patient outcomes.

Population data has been collected from more than 1.5 million adolescents over 37 years by the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children: WHO Cross-National (HBSC) Study. The paper reviews the contribution that this long standing study has made to our understanding of the individual, developmental, social, economic, cultural determinants of adolescent mental health by organising the findings of 104 empirical papers that met inclusion criteria, into individual, microsystem, mesosystem and macrosystem levels of the framework. Of these selected papers, 68 were based on national data and the other 36 were based on international data, from varying numbers of countries. Each paper was allocated to a system level in the bio-ecological framework according to the level of its primary focus. The majority (51 papers) investigate individual level determinants. A further 28 concentrate primarily on the microsystem level, 6 on the mesosystem level, and 29 on the macrosystem level. The paper identifies where there is evidence on the determinants of mental health, summarises what we have learned, and highlights research gaps. Implications for the future development of this population health study are discussed in terms of how it may continue to illuminate our understanding of adolescent mental health in a changing world and where new directions are required.

An important open question is whether there are similar gradients in adult mortality in middle-income countries (MICs), where schooling and healthcare quality tends to be lower and health-related behaviors are often not strongly patterned by schooling. Methods: We present one of the first international-comparative studies on schooling differences in adult mortality across MICs using harmonizedlongitudinal data on adults ages 50+ from China, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, and South Korea. We use Cox proportional hazards models to estimate differences in the hazard of mortality across schooling groups overall and separately by sex and broad age groups. We also estimate schooling gradients in smoking and body mass index to determine whether risk factor gradients potentially explain mortality patterns. Results: Only adults with tertiary schooling have a consistent adult mortality advantage compared to those with no schooling. We do not find evidence that individuals with primary schooling have a lower hazard of mortality compared to individuals with no schooling in five of the six countries. The mortality advantage for individuals with secondary schooling is mixed, with evidence of lower mortality relative to those with no schooling in Mexico, South Africa, and South Korea. Gradients in BMI and smoking are inconsistent across countries and unlikely to explain mortality differences. Conclusions: We find that adult mortality and risk factor gradients in MICs can be much different than the established patterns seen in modern HICs. Our results highlight that adult mortality gradients are not an inevitability and are not found in all populations. Understanding what factors give rise to inequalities in adult mortality and what can be done to minimize gradients while still ensuring continued mortality improvements in MICs is a crucial focus for research and policy.

An Analysis of Professional Regulation-Comparing Outcomes in Fitness to Practice Proceedings for Social Workers, Nurses and Doctors	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						Professional practice; risk; regulation	PRACTICE HEARINGS; CARE COUNCIL; MASCULINITY; HEALTH; GENDER; RISK	The regulation of professional activity in the Health and Social Care sector in the UK is carried out by a number of statutory bodies that hold legal mandates to manage the risks of professional malpractice. The prime method used to perform this duty, and thereby protect the public, is the construction of a register of the suitability qualified-and creation of appropriate professional standards to establish a benchmark for practice. When registrant's performance or conduct is felt not to meet these standards, they are placed within a fitness to practice process administered by the regulatory body. This article examines the publicly available data on fitness to practice cases from UK regulatory bodies relating to the professions of social workers, nurses, midwives and doctors. Examining nearly 1,000 cases, the authors run a statistical analysis of the data to establish whether any differences are found amongst and between these professional groupings. We find there are several areas where significant differences arise, namely gender, attendance and representation. Most of these regulatory bodies are, in turn, regulated in the UK by the Professional Standards Authority (PSA), and the article concludes by suggesting ways forward for the PSA in addressing or further examining apparent inequalities. The analysis is placed within a wide range of literature, with an emphasis on the international transferability of the approach to professional regulation.

J							Network Peri operative Critical	Addressing priorities for surgical research in Africa: implementation of a multicentre cloud-based peri-operative registry in Ethiopia	ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						anaesthesia; clinical registries; postoperative morbidity; quality of care; surgery	GLOBAL SURGERY; HEALTH; OUTCOMES; SAFE; CARE	In resource-constrained settings, where inequalities in access to and quality of surgical care results in excess mortality, peri-operative care registries are uncommon. A south-south collaboration supported the implementation of a context specific, clinician-led, multicentre real-time peri-operative registry in Ethiopia. Peri-operative information, including the Ethiopian Ministry of Health's national 'Saving Lives through Safe Surgery initiative', was linked to real-time dashboards, providing clinicians and administrators with information on service utilisation, surgical access, national surgical key performance indicators and measures of quality of care. We recruited four hospitals representing 285 in-patient beds from the Amhara and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples regions and Addis Ababa city, and reported on 1748 consecutive surgical cases from April 2019 to April 2020. Key performance indicators included: compliance with the World Health Organization's Surgical Safety Checklist in 1595 (92.1%) surgical cases; adverse events during anaesthesia in 33 (3.1%) cases; and surgical site infections in 21 (2.0%) patients. This collaboration has successfully implemented a multicentre digital surgical registry that can enable measurement of key performance indicators for surgery and evaluation of peri-operative outcomes. The peri-operative registry is currently being rolled out across the Amhara region and Addis Ababa city administration. It will provide continuous granular healthcare information necessary to empower clinicians to drive context-specific priorities for service improvement and research, in collaboration with national stakeholders and international research consortiums.

J	Koski, A; Clark, S				Koski, Alissa; Clark, Shelley			Child Marriage in Canada	POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW			English	Article							ASSOCIATION; HEALTH; AGE	Child marriage, defined as formal or informal marriage before the age of 18, is a globally recognized indicator of gender inequality. Canada has placed itself at the forefront of global efforts to end child marriage as part of its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Despite these global aspirations, child marriage remains legal throughout Canada. Data from vital statistics agencies and recent censuses indicate that child marriage, although rare, is practiced across the country. In 2016, nearly 2,300 children between 15 and 17 years of age were in union, a prevalence of 0.2 percent. The vast majority (98 percent) of these were informal, common-law unions. Demographic patterns of child marriage in Canada are similar to those observed in many low- and middle-income countries. Girls were far more likely to be married as children than boys and typically wed much older spouses. There were marked differences in the prevalence of child marriage across the country, with the highest estimates found in Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and the territories. These findings draw attention to the discrepancy between Canada's domestic law and its foreign policy. They also highlight thorny challenges inherent in efforts to eradicate this practice in Canada and elsewhere.

Two contexts are the focus of this case analysis: Jordan, an acute conflict-induced refugee situation, and Rwanda, a protracted conflict-induced refugee setting. The study's main goal was to better understand ways humanitarian organizations and health care providers might best support ethically and contextually appropriate palliative care in humanitarian contexts. An unintended outcome of the research was learning lessons about ethical dimensions of transnational research partnerships, which is the focus of this case analysis. Discussion There exist ongoing challenges for international collaborative research in humanitarian conflict-induced settings. Research partnerships were crucial for connecting with key stakeholders associated with the full study (e.g., refugees with life limiting illness, local healthcare providers, aid organization representatives). While important relationships were established, obstacles limited our abilities to fully attain the type of mutual partnership we aimed for. Unique challenges faced during the research included: (a) building, nurturing and sustaining respectful and equitable research partnerships between collaborators in contexts of cultural difference and global inequality; (b) appropriate ethics review and challenges of responding to local decision-maker's research needs; and (c) equity and fairness towards vulnerable populations. Research strategies were adapted and applied to respond to these challenges with a specific focus on (d) research rewards and restitution. Conclusions This case analysis sheds light on the importance of understanding cultural norms in all research roles, building relationships with decision makers, and developing teams that include researchers from within humanitarian crisis settings to ensure that mutually beneficial research outcomes are ethical as well as culturally and contextually relevant.

Integrating different disciplines to describe and analyze the relationships of urban socio-ecological systems gives us usef u l empirical tools to formulate policies and programs in urban planning considering their spatial dimension. The objective of this study is to present a model that integrates and explains the socio-ecological urban relations of a Latin American city considering three high-level approaches: forestry, geography, and psychology. Thus, we defined fou r factors: a) urban forest and green areas; b) urban spatial segregation; c) perceived restoration; and d) subjective wellbeing. For these, we grouped 16 measured variables and collected them with three specific procedures: a) SPOT remote sensors and object-based classification of urban coverage; b) analysis of geospatial data with census information; and c) field surveys. We applied descriptive multivariate statistics and also proposed a structural equation model (SEM) that integrates a l l the variables and data. We found that the factor "urban green areas" had a direct positive relationship with the factors "urban spatial segregation" and "perceived restoration." We observed that urban green areas were meeting spaces between different socioeconomic categories, reducing segregation and multiplying opportunities for the psychological restoration of citizens. However, we found no evidence that green areas are related to subjective wellbeing. The model quantified the socio-ecological relationships produced by combining various factors of urban socio-ecological systems, suggesting the benefits of this method to generate knowledge towards planning and managing Latin American cities. Ou r results are encouraging in terms of environmental justice and wellbeing. In developing countries where forecasts indicate rising urban populations, the need to establish planning processes based on scientific information is vital to meet the challenges of sustainability in the twentyfirst century.

Method Data on MLLA, revascularisation surgeries, diagnostic exams and healthcare coverage were obtained from the Brazilian Public Hospital Information System. Socioeconomic data were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Spatial autocorrelation of the MLLA rates was tested using Moran's I method. Multivariate spatial regression models using ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to identify the variables significantly correlated with MLLA. Results A total of 5270 MLLA were included in the analysis. Mean MLLA rates were 24.32 (+/- 18.22)/100 000 inhabitants, showing a positive global spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I=0.66; p<0.001). Queen contiguity matrix demonstrates that MLLA rates ranged from 7.6 to 46.6/100 000 with five large clusters of high MLLA rates. OLS showed that four of the nine studied variables presented significant spatial correlation with MLLA rates. Colour Doppler ultrasound showed a negative association (p<0.001), while revascularisation surgeries and illiteracy showed a positive correlation (p<0.01). GWR presented the best model (adjusted R-2=0.77) showing that the predictors differentially affect the MLLA rates geographically. Conclusion The high MLLA rates in some regions of the state are influenced by the high rate of illiteracy and low utilisation rate of colour Doppler, indicating a social problem and difficulty in accessing health. On the other hand, the high rates of revascularisation surgeries are related to higher MLLA rates, possibly due to delayed access to specialised hospitals. This indicates that attention must be given to population access to public healthcare in the State of Parana in order to ensure proper and timely medical attention.

At the same time, the country was marked by steady economic growth, above the Latin American average. In addition, much of the political debate took place within and among the institutions of Colombian state and society, illustrating growing state capacity and a mature civil society. In this article, I describe the different aspects of this Colombian paradox- high levels of domestic unrest and political polarization surrounding unsolved structural issues and pending expectations about peace combined with superior economic performance and growing institutional strength-in an effort to provide an overview of the challenges overcome as well as those lying ahead.

Analysis, and understanding, of this global/national/regional reality would benefit from renal registry databases. The implementation of a CKD registry (including all categories) is difficult to achieve, given its high cost. On the other hand, patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are easily accessible and constitute the most severe subgroup in terms of comorbidities and healthcare costs. A kidney replacement therapy registry (KRTR) is defined as the systematic and continuous collection of a population-based data set from ESKD patients treated by dialysis/kidney transplant. The lack of available data, particularly in emerging economies, leaves information gaps on healthcare and outcomes in these patients. The heterogeneity/absence of a KRTR in some countries is consistent with the inequities in access to KRT worldwide. In 2014, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) proposed to determine the prevalence of patients on dialysis for at least 700 patients per million inhabitants by 2019 in every Latin American (LA) country. Since then, PAHO and the Sociedad LatinoAmericana de Nefrologia e Hipertension have provided training courses and certification of KRTR in LA. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide guidance on how to set up a new KRTR in countries or regions that still lack one. Advice is provided on the sequential steps in the process of setting up a KRTR, personnel requirements, data set content and minimum quality indicators required.

J	Martinho, G; Gonçalves, M; Matos, M				Martinho, Gabriela; Goncalves, Mariana; Matos, Marlene			Child trafficking, comprehensive needs and professional practices: A systematic review	CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW			English	Review						Child trafficking; Victims; Professionals; Needs; Practices	COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION; COMPLEXITIES; EXPERIENCES; WOMEN	Introduction: Human trafficking is a crime that affects adults but also children and youngsters, who are subjected to extreme violence and inhumane conditions. Associated with their immaturity, the inability to protect themselves and the difficulty accessing support systems make them even more vulnerable, creating conditions for traffickers to abuse and control them. It is crucial that professionals from several areas (education, health, protection and social services, justice) who come in contact with child trafficking be prepared to do the necessary screening, needs assessment, and act according to international recommendations. Aim: This systematic review of the literature aims to know the professionals' practices and their understanding of comprehensive needs when working with victims of child trafficking. Methodology: Six databases were consulted: Sage, Science Direct, WebScience, PubMed, Scopus and Psycinfo (Ovid). From the analysis of the results, 17 studies were selected. This systematic review followed the protocol based on PRISMA recommendations. Results: All studies selected in this systematic review were developed in the last decade (2010-2018), in 14 different countries. The participants were professionals from education, health, protection and social services, justice fields and/or stakeholders in child trafficking or/and other professionals (e.g., religious leaders). The studies used mainly a qualitative methodology, using semi-structured interviews in the data collection. The results presented in those studies were organized into two main categories of analyses: comprehensive needs and professional practices. Regarding comprehensive needs, when working with child trafficking, professionals identified that it is necessary to pay attention to the specific needs of the victims, the needs in terms of the functioning of institutions and human resources, the needs in the macro-societal level and finally the importance of investing in scientific research. Based on the results, it was also possible to organize professional practices, according to international recommendations, into (in)adequate, barriers and difficulties faced. Discussion and conclusion: Professionals who have contact with child victims of trafficking must act according to their needs. Thus, an efficient practice refers to a collaborative action assumed by a multidisciplinary team, which should integrate into their work a culturally sensitive posture, trauma-informed care and victim-centered approach. For that, professionals must receive specialized qualifications and training. This work may have implications for scientific research, public and institutional policies, but mainly for professionals' education and practices when dealing with this phenomenon, from screening to the (re)integration of the trafficked children into society.

Associations between socioeconomic status and ultrafine particulate exposure in the school commute: An environmental inequality study for Toronto, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Ultrafine particulate matter; Dosage; Children; Commuting; Socioeconomic status; Environmental inequality	AIR-POLLUTION EXPOSURE; PARTICLE CONCENTRATIONS; INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT; EMISSIONS; HEALTH; FINE; VARIABILITY; MORTALITY; PATTERNS; BIRTH	Ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) air pollution is unevenly distributed across urban environments. Disparities in routine activity patterns, such as the exposure risk we face at work or on the commute, can contribute to chronic exposure-related health outcomes that place excess burdening on vulnerable population groups. In Canada, there is disagreement in the literature on the nature of these exposure-related inequalities, and our understanding of disparities associated with specific activity patterns such as commuting is limited. In the context of UFP specific exposure, these relationships are almost entirely unexplored in the environmental inequality literature. Our study presents an exploratory analysis of UFP exposure patterns in Toronto, Canada. We examined UFP dosage disparities experienced by children during routine school commutes. We estimated single trip dosages that accounted for variation in ambient UFP concentration, route morphology (distance, slope) and their effect on inhalation rate and trip duration. We aggregated these values at the dissemination-area level and collected socioeconomic status descriptors from the 2016 census. Our OLS model showed significant spatial autocorrelation (MI = 0.59, p < 0.001), and we instead applied a spatial error model to account for spatial effects in our dataset. We identified significant associations related to median income (beta = -0.087, p < 0.05), government transfer dependence (beta = -0.107, p < 0.005), immigration status (beta = 0.119, p < 0.001), and education rates (beta = -0.059, p < 0.05). Our results diverged from other pollutants in Toronto-based literature and could indicate that UFPs exhibit unique patterns of inequality. Our findings suggest a need to further study UFP dosage from an environmental inequality perspective.

Health equity and health system strengthening - Time for a WHO re-think	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Equity; health systems; World Health Organization; social determinants; social justice		The pursuit of health equity is foundational to the global health enterprise. But while moral concerns over health inequities can galvanise political commitment, how such concerns can or should translate into practice remains less clear. This paper reviews evolving ways that equity goals have featured in key World Health Organization (WHO)-related policy documents, before discussing the heuristic value and empirical traction that the concept of equity can bring to the health system strengthening (HSS) agenda. We argue that while health equity is often presented as the overarching goal of HSS, in practice this is typically circumscribed to the provision of healthcare services. Although healthcare equity is important, we suggest that this narrow focus risks losing sight of the structural political, social and economic drivers of health and health inequities, as well as the broader contexts of care and complex socio-political mechanisms through which health systems are strengthened. Drawing on new lines of empirical inquiry, we propose that broadening the equity lens for HSS -offers exciting opportunities to put health systems at the heart of a more ambitious equity agenda in global health.

Using a series of regression models on panel and cross-sectional data this research found that increases in state spending on social and health care are associated with (1) increases in food availability and (2) increases in food access. However, the findings also suggest that increases in food supplies do not produce more food security. Thus, for the OECD countries in this analysis, food availability is unrelated to food accessibility. We conclude by suggesting that high income countries that seek to promote global health should not only focus their efforts on poverty reduction polices that increase food accessibility within their own boarders, but must simultaneously ensure a more equitable global distribution of food.

I.; Akl, Elie A.; Kristjannson, Elizabeth; Lotfi, Tamara; Petkovic, Jennifer; Petticrew, Mark P.; Pottie, Kevin; Tugwell, Peter; Welch, Vivian			A framework for identifying and mitigating the equity harms of COVID-19 policy interventions	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						COVID-19; Equity; Inequity; Adverse effects; Public health; Impact assessment	NEW-ZEALAND; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; PRIMARY-CARE; HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; COUNTRIES; DISORDER; IMPACT; ADULTS	Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Governments have implemented combinations of "lockdown" measures of various stringencies, including school and workplace closures, cancellations of public events, and restrictions on internal and external movements. These policy interventions are an attempt to shield high-risk individuals and to prevent overwhelming countries' healthcare systems, or, colloquially, "flatten the curve." However, these policy interventions may come with physical and psychological health harms, group and social harms, and opportunity costs. These policies may particularly affect vulnerable populations and not only exacerbate pre-existing inequities but also generate new ones. Methods: We developed a conceptual framework to identify and categorize adverse effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures. We based our framework on Lorenc and Oliver's framework for the adverse effects of public health interventions and the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework. To test its application, we purposively sampled COVID-19 policy examples from around the world and evaluated them for the potential physical, psychological, and social harms, as well as opportunity costs, in each of the PROGRESS-Plus equity domains: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Plus (age, and disability). Results: We found examples of inequitably distributed adverse effects for each COVID-19 lockdown policy example, stratified by a low- or middle-in come country and high-income country, in every PROGRESS-Plus equity domain. We identified the known policy interventions intended to mitigate some of these adverse effects. The same harms (anxiety, depression, food insecurity, loneliness, stigma, violence) appear to be repeated across many groups and are exacerbated by several COVID-19 policy interventions. Conclusion: Our conceptual framework highlights the fact that COVID-19 policy interventions can generate or exacerbate interactive and multiplicative equity harms. Applying this framework can help in three ways: (1) identifying the areas where a policy intervention may generate inequitable adverse effects; (2) mitigating the policy and practice interventions by facilitating the systematic examination of relevant evidence; and (3) planning for lifting COVID-19 lockdowns and policy interventions around the world.

These workers are mostly middle-aged women and racial/ethnic minorities who typically earn low wages. Despite being integral to patient care, these workers are often neglected by the medical community and society at large; thus, developing a health care system capable of addressing the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics requires a better understanding of the experiences of home health care workers. OBJECTIVE To understand the experiences of home health care workers caring for patients in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From March to April 2020, a qualitative study with 1-to-1 semistructured interviews of 33 home health care workers in New York City was conducted in partnership with the 1199SEIU Home Care Industry Education Fund, a benefit fund of the 1199 Service Employees International Union United Healthcare Workers East, the largest health care union in the US. Purposeful sampling was used to identify and recruit home health care workers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Audio-recorded interviews were professionally transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory. Major themes and subthemes were identified. RESULTS In total, 33 home health care workers employed by 24 unique home care agencies across the 5 boroughs of New York City participated. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.0) years, 32 (97%) were women, 21 (64%) were Black participants, and 6 (18%) were Hispanic participants. Five major themes emerged: home health care workers (1) were on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic but felt invisible; (2) reported a heightened risk for virus transmission; (3) received varying amounts of information, supplies, and training from their home care agencies; (4) relied on nonagency alternatives for support, including information and supplies; and (5) were forced to make difficult trade-offs in their work and personal lives. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this qualitative analysis, home health care workers reported providing frontline essential care, often at personal risk, during the COVID-19 pandemic. They experienced challenges that exacerbated the inequities they face as a marginalized workforce. Interventions and policies to better support these frontline health care professionals are urgently needed.

Economic complexity and health outcomes: A global perspective	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Economic complexity; Health outcomes; Life expectancy; Mortality	AGRICULTURAL GROWTH; NATURAL-RESOURCES; TRADE; CURSE; GLOBALIZATION; INSTITUTIONS; INEQUALITY; COUNTRIES; MORTALITY	Do a country's economic structures matter for its national health status? This study, for the first time, examines the extent to which the mix of products a country produces (and exports) affects population health. For this purpose, I employ the economic complexity index (ECI) that relies on the sophistication of export bundles to extract information on the availability of productive capabilities within an economy. Using unbalanced panel data for 103 countries between 1970 and 2015, this paper documents strong and robust evidence that countries exporting complex (high productivity) products, on average, enjoy better health outcomes, compared with those whose economic structures are mainly based on unsophisticated (low productivity) products. Additionally, there exists evidence that a key channel through which ECI transmits to health improvements is via strengthening employment opportunities. It follows from these findings that health improvements can be fostered by structural transformation toward producing a more diverse range of sophisticated products.

Evaluation of a national complex oral health improvement programme: a population data linkage cohort study in Scotland	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						community child health; public health; epidemiology	CHILDSMILE; DISEASES	ObjectivesChild dental caries is a global public health challenge with high prevalence and wide inequalities. A complex public health programme (Childsmile) was established. We aimed to evaluate the reach of the programme and its impact on child oral health.SettingEducation, health and community settings, Scotland-wide.InterventionsChildsmile (national oral health improvement programme) interventions: nursery-based fluoride varnish applications (FVAs) and supervised daily toothbrushing, community-based Dental Health Support Worker (DHSW) contacts and primary care dental practice visits-delivered to the population via a proportionate universal approach.Participants50379 children (mean age=5.5 years, SD=0.3) attending local authority schools (2014/2015).DesignPopulation-based individual child-level data on four Childsmile interventions linked to dental inspection survey data to form a longitudinal cohort. Logistic regression assessed intervention reach and the independent impact of each intervention on caries experience, adjusting for age, sex and area-based Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD).Outcome measuresReach of the programme is defined as the percentage of children receiving each intervention at least once by SIMD fifth. Obvious dental caries experience (presence/absence) is defined as the presence of decay (into dentine), missing (extracted) due to decay or filled deciduous teeth.Results15032 (29.8%) children had caries experience. The universal interventions had high population reach: nursery toothbrushing (89.1%), dental practice visits (70.5%). The targeted interventions strongly favoured children from the most deprived areas: DHSW contacts (SIMD 1: 29.5% vs SIMD 5: 7.7%), nursery FVAs (SIMD 1: 75.2% vs SIMD 5: 23.2%). Odds of caries experience were markedly lower among children participating in nursery toothbrushing (>3years, adjusted OR (aOR)=0.60; 95%CI 0.55 to 0.66) and attending dental practice (>= 6 visits, aOR=0.55; 95%CI 0.50 to 0.61). The findings were less clear for DHSW contacts. Nursery FVAs were not independently associated with caries experience.ConclusionsThe universal interventions, nursery toothbrushing and regular dental practice visits were independently and most strongly associated with reduced odds of caries experience in the cohort, with nursery toothbrushing having the greatest impact among children in areas of high deprivation.

Using the theory of fundamental causes, and concentration index, we investigate the determinants of tobacco use, and whether it disproportionately affects the poor. All data used in this study emanated from the 2014 Global Adult Tobacco Survey implemented in Kenya on a nationally representative sample of men and women aged 15 years and older. Our results suggest a link between tobacco use and socioeconomic inequality. Overall, poorer households are more affected by tobacco use than richer households. This socioeconomic inequality is more evident among men and households living in urban areas. The decomposition of the concentration index indicates that the overall socioeconomic inequality for current tobacco smokers is explained by 69.11% of household wealth. To reduce the prevalence rate of smoking in Kenya, policymakers could design and implement tobacco control programs through the equity lens. Community health workers could be used to promote non-smoking behaviors among the poor.

One of these socio-structural institutions is global capitalism. While critical scholarship has advanced our understanding of the relationships between capitalist globalization and health, more work is needed to understand the transnational economic, political, and cultural practices that affect various global health issues. This paper argues that the theory of global capitalism provides an important, critical perspective for understanding different phenomena associated with global health. The theory's key concepts of transnational corporations, financialization, consumerism, transnational social classes, and transnational state comprise the conceptual framework. When applied to various global health topics, the theory advances our understanding of the health-related institutional structures of today's global economy, provides a holistic view that integrates various strands of health research, highlights various forms of health activism, and offers new questions for addressing persistent health injustice across the world.

Oceans adjacent to Canada are affected by many anthropogenic stressors, with implications for human health and well-being. Climate change further escalates these pressures and can expose coastal populations to unique health hazards and distressing conditions. However, current research efforts, education or training curriculums, and policies in Canada critically lack explicit consideration of these ocean-public health linkages. The objective of this paper is to present multiple disciplinary perspectives from academics and health practitioners to inform the development of future directions for research, capacity development, and policy and practice at the interface of oceans and human health in Canada. We synthesize major ocean and human health linkages in Canada, and identify climate-sensitive drivers of change, drawing attention to unique considerations in Canada. To support effective, sustained, and equitable collaborations at the nexus of oceans and human health, we recommend the need for progress in three critical areas: (i) holistic worldviews and perspectives, (ii) capacity development, and (iii) structural supports. Canada can play a key role in supporting the global community in addressing the health challenges of climate and ocean changes.

J	Bunch, L				Bunch, Lauren			A Tale of Two Crises: Addressing Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy as Promoting Racial Justice	HEC FORUM			English	Article						Covid-19; Vaccine hesitancy; Racial disparities; Trust	CHILDREN	The year 2020 has yielded twin crises in the United States: a global pandemic and a public reckoning with racism brought about by a series of publicized instances of police violence toward Black men and women. Current data indicate that nationally, Black Americans are three times more likely than White Americans to contract Covid-19 (with further variance by state), a pattern that underscores the more general phenomenon of health disparity among Black and White Americans (Oppel et al. in The New York Times 2020; APM Research Lab Staff in APM Research Lab 2020). Once exposed, Black Americans are twice as likely to die of the virus. Unsurprisingly, Black Americans report higher levels of fear of Covid-19 than their White peers, but they also report higher levels of hesitancy toward a Covid-19 vaccine. This paper explores why this apparent discrepancy exists. It also provides practical recommendations for how government and public health leaders might address vaccine hesitancy in the context of the twin crises of 2020.

Menstrual hygiene management in schools: midway progress update on the "MHM in Ten" 2014-2024 global agenda	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Review						Adolescent health; Menstruation; Equity; Education; Girl&#8217; s education; Policy	EDUCATION; SANITATION; NEEDS; GIRLS	Progress has been made in recent years to bring attention to the challenges faced by school-aged girls around managing menstruation in educational settings that lack adequate physical environments and social support in low- and middle-income countries. To enable more synergistic and sustained progress on addressing menstruation-related needs while in school, an effort was undertaken in 2014 to map out a vision, priorities, and a ten-year agenda for transforming girls' experiences, referred to as Menstrual Hygiene Management in Ten (MHM in Ten). The overarching vision is that girls have the information, support, and enabling school environment for managing menstruation with dignity, safety and comfort by 2024. This requires improved research evidence and translation for impactful national level policies. As 2019 marked the midway point, we assessed progress made on the five key priorities, and remaining work to be done, through global outreach to the growing network of academics, non-governmental organizations, advocates, social entrepreneurs, United Nations agencies, donors, and national governments. This paper delineates the key insights to inform and support the growing MHM commitment globally to maximize progress to reach our vision by 2024. Corresponding to the five priorities, we found that (priority 1) the evidence base for MHM in schools has strengthened considerably, (priority 2) global guidelines for MHM in schools have yet to be created, and (priority 3) numerous evidence-based advocacy platforms have emerged to support MHM efforts. We also identified (priority 4) a growing engagement, responsibility, and ownership of MHM in schools among governments globally, and that although MHM is beginning to be integrated into country-level education systems (priority 5), resources are lacking. Overall, progress is being made against identified priorities. We provide recommendations for advancing the MHM in Ten agenda. This includes continued building of the evidence, and expanding the number of countries with national level policies and the requisite funding and capacity to truly transform schools for all students and teachers who menstruate.

Methods: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study using representative samples of the German population aged between 25 and 64 years in 1995, 1999, 2005, 2009, and 2013 (n = 857,264). Socio-economic position was measured by indicators for income, education, and occupation. Relative and absolute socioeconomic inequalities were estimated with the regression-based relative index of inequality and the slope index of inequality, respectively. Trends in inequalities were estimated with interaction terms for time and relative index of inequality/slope index of inequality. Results: Highest and increasing smoking prevalence was observed among long-term unemployed and people with less than 60% of the median household income. Between 1995 and 2013, relative increases in inequalities in smoking prevalence ranged from 31% (95% confidence interval, 26%-36%; men, occupation) to 94% (95% confidence interval, 84%-104%; women, education). Absolute increases ranged from 6.2 (95% confidence interval, 4.7-7.6) percentage points (men, occupation) to 20.3 (95% confidence interval, 18.9-21.7) percentage points (women, education). Conclusions: Relative and absolute socioeconomic inequalities in smoking prevalence increased in Germany between 1995 and 2013, with regard to income, education, and occupation, particularly among women.

J	Blackstock, C; Bamblett, M; Black, C				Blackstock, Cindy; Bamblett, Muriel; Black, Carlina			Indigenous ontology, international law and the application of the Convention to the over-representation of Indigenous children in out of home care in Canada and Australia	CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT			English	Article						Indigenous; Child welfare; Structural risks; Equity; Human rights; Ontology		This paper explores the efficacy of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Convention, UN General Assembly, 1989) through the lens of the over-representation of First Nations children placed in out-of-home care in Canada and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia. A general overview of Indigenous worldviews frames a discussion on the coherence of international human rights law and instruments, including the Convention, account for Indigenous Peoples' ontologies. The authors argue that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN General Assembly, 2007) and a new theoretical framework published by the Pan American Health Organization (2019) on health equity and inequity are useful tools to augment the Convention's coherence with Indigenous ontologies. The paper discusses how the Convention can be applied to structural and systemic risks driving the over-representation of First Nations and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out of home care in Canada and Australia. These two countries are included as First Nations and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in these countries have both had significant impact in advocating for their children despite experiencing similar barriers including contemporary colonialism. The advocacy work of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society in Canada and the Victorian Aboriginal Child Care Agency in Victoria, Australia are discussed. The paper ends by outlining some of the challenges ahead that include the need to meaningfully recognize Indigenous self-determination and equitable funding and resources to enable the actualization of self-determination. Further research contrasting international human rights instruments with Indigenous ontologies could help inform possible amendments to international human rights treaties and general comments.

Their right to participation is a critical driver for the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Youth prioritize the need to end violence against them, charging adults with safeguarding, and identify gender inequality as an underlying cause of child sexual exploitation (CSE). SDG 5 includes targets for ending sexual exploitation of girls; however, it is critical to review whether we are supporting both boys and girls adequately. Based on recent research, it is clear that male victims of CSE are prevalent, yet they have been relatively excluded in policy, research, and interventions. The aim is not to minimize the importance of understanding and eliminating CSE of girls, but to acknowledge that vulnerable sub-groups of boys exist in community (street-connected boys, refugees, sexual minorities) and service systems (justice, child welfare, humanitarian aid). Gender-based challenges persist in protection, disclosure, help-seeking, professional recognition, programming and prevention. In this discussion article, we outline responsibilities in human rights law to understand and address boys' CSE and overview key literature on its impact on boys. It is argued that gender-, trauma-, and violence-informed approaches are expanded to address the contribution of harmful gender norms, and to target prevention in the adolescent years for sexually transmitted infections, mental health, and substance abuse and violence problems. This discussion advances a pressing need for a global analysis of CSE among boys.

J	Madani, K				Madani, Kaveh			How International Economic Sanctions Harm the Environment	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						sanctions; environmental policy; environmental diplomacy; environmental economics; political economy; international relations	IRAN; IMPACT; HEALTH	As soft political tools, economic sanctions aim at isolating a sanctioned state and hurt its economy to force it to change course, policies, and actions. In response to sanctions and to evade their grip, a sanctioned state adopts a range of survivalist, aggressive, and unsustainable policies that reduce the economic pressure of sanctions at the expense of accelerated environmental degradation. While economic sanctions cannot be blamed as the cause of environmental problems in sanctioned states, their role in catalyzing environmental degradation is noteworthy. This paper takes the first step in setting the theoretical ground for exploring the environmental implications of sanctions by developing a generic causal model that explains how economic sanctions can impact the environment. It is shown that sanctions lower the priority of the environmental sector in the public policy agenda in a sanctioned state and increase the natural resource-intensity of its economy. It is argued that although the environmental damages of sanctions are mainly unintended by the sanctioning and sanctioned states, such damages are unavoidable in practice. The study calls for attention to the transgenerational and transboundary environmental impacts of economic sanctions and their justice and human rights implications for which the sanctioning and sanctioned states must be held accountable.

However, this positive trend has led to an increase in the number of older people with a growing need for a sustainable system for the long-term care of this part of the population, which includes social and health services that are essential for a high quality of life. Longevity also brings challenges in the form of a polymorbid geriatric population that places financial pressure on healthcare systems. Regardless, one disease dominates the debate about financial sustainability due to the increasing numbers of people diagnosed, and that is Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presented paper aims to demonstrate the economic burden of social and healthcare services. Data from two regions in the Czech Republic were selected to demonstrate the potential scope of the problem. The future costs connected with AD are calculated by a prediction model, which is based on a population model for predicting the number of people with AD between 2020 and 2070. Based on the presented data from the two regions in the Czech Republic and the prediction model, several trends emerged. There appears to be a significant difference in the annual direct costs per person diagnosed with AD depending on the region in which they reside. This may lead to a significant inequality of the services a person can acquire followed by subsequent social issues that can manifest as a lower quality of life. Furthermore, given the prediction of the growing AD population, the costs expressed in constant prices based on the year 2020 will increase almost threefold during the period 2020-2070. The predicted threefold increase will place additional financial pressure on all stakeholders responsible for social and healthcare services, as the current situation is already challenging.

Consequently, African literature in the field has remained obscure, out of consideration in global discourses around the subject.; and incoherent to policy-makers. The situation has also hampered the identification of and filling of regional research-gaps in the field. The aim of this study, therefore, was to conduct a systematic scoping review of available data on psychiatric morbidity among adolescents and youth within the juvenile justice system in subSaharan Africa. The search was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, Science Direct, EMBASE, CINAHL and Psych Info. Additional searches were done in Google Scholar and African Journal Online (AJOL) databases. Twenty-six studies from 21 different research projects were identified. More than two-thirds were conducted in Nigeria and published within the last decade. Similar to what has been established around the world, the prevalence rate of psychiatric disorder was often very high, with a range of 59.7% 63.0% among respondents. Key strengths of identified studies included use of standardized clinician-administered instruments for assessment and exploration of a wide range of psychiatric disorders. The main weaknesses in the studies included male gender-bias, lack of normative comparison groups, emphasis on custodial settings with little data on non-custodial systems, and considerable length of time-lag between the points of incarceration and psychiatric evaluation among the samples studied.. The study concluded that a modest number of studies have been conducted on psychiatric morbidity among justice-involved adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, but there are still significant research gaps which could be bridged in order to aid context-appropriate interventions.

J	Kusier, AO; Folker, AP				Kusier, Amalie Oxholm; Folker, Anna Paldam			The Satisfaction with Life Scale: Philosophical Foundation and Practical Limitations	HEALTH CARE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Well-being; Satisfaction with life scale; SWLS; Life satisfaction theory; Affective theory	TEMPORAL SATISFACTION; HAPPINESS; VALIDITY; SWLS	Research and policymaking on positive mental health and well-being have increased within the last decade, partly fueled by decreasing levels of well-being in the general population and among at-risk groups. However, measurement of well-being often takes place in the absence of reflection on the underlying theoretical conceptualization of well-being. This disguises the fact that different rating scales of well-being often measure very different phenomena because rating scales are based on different philosophical assumptions, which represent radically different foundational views about the nature of well-being. The aim of this paper is to examine the philosophical foundation of the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) in order to clarify the underlying normative commitments and the psychometric compromises involved in the translation of theory into practice. SWLS is widely used by psychologists, public health professionals, economists, and is popular in national and international surveys of well-being. This paper introduces the philosophical theory of life satisfaction and explores how three central discussions within life satisfaction theory are reflected in the construction of the SWLS; (1) Whether we should be equally satisfied with our past, present and future, (2) Whether we should be satisfied with all the various domains of our lives, and (3) How to avoid the trap of "false consciousness", i.e. that people fail to recognize the injustice or misfortune of their lives. In the end, life satisfaction theory is contrasted with affective foundational theories of well-being, to explore the magnitude and limits of SWLS as a rating scale based on life satisfaction theory.

Risk Factors and Effects of the Morbus: COVID-19 through the Biopsychosocial Model and Ecological Systems Approach to Social Work Practice	SOCIAL WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						COVID-19; biopsychosocial model; ecological systems theory; social inequalities; reciprocity	CORONAVIRUS; IMPACT; PREVENTION; INFECTION; HEALTH; POLICY; PRAYER	Utilizing the biopsychosocial model and the ecological systems theory, this disquisition explores on the risk factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The discourse shows the interconnectedness of biological, psychological, and social domains in expatiating on the COVID-19 pandemic. It calls for the need to strengthen the resilience of the global community in the face of health outbreaks such as COVID-19. It emphasizes on the perspectives that pandemics are managed before they emerge through building systems that are resilient. Thus, it appreciates the need for a therapeutic milieu as a building block to resilience. The article calls for the adoption of a developmental stance to analyzing health outbreaks and clinical issues. The adumbration shows the reciprocity effects of the health outbreak [macrocosms] and individual factors [microcosms]. To its end, the paper implies that COVID-19 is a call for integration toward effective health planning between social policy formulators, urban and rural planners, epidemiologists, development practitioners, clinicians, researchers to mention but a few. Ultimately, the paper calls for social workers to consider a developmental-clinical social work approach which helps foster "health in all policies" so as to build resilience against the morbus and limit the proliferation of diseases.

Adolescents and young people (10-24 years old) in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region represent over 1 quarter of the region's population. Adolescent nutrition and mental health are key policy priorities in the region. Despite the considerable diversity across the LAC region in economic development, welfare and health systems, little is known about the influence of level of national development or country-level income inequality on adolescent with overweight and obesity or suicidal ideation and planning. What did the researchers do and find? Using data from 21 LAC countries between 2009 and 2013, we found that adolescents living in more economically developed LAC countries were at higher risk of overweight and obesity. Suicidal ideation and planning was not associated with the level of development, but it was associated with overweight and obesity. What do these findings mean? This study shows that the risk of overweight and obesity is not only limited to individual or household level influences, but also to wider societal influences. Countries in the LAC region need to monitor and prevent adolescent overweight/obesity as they transition from lower to middle- and higher-income status. Background Adolescents and young people (10-24 years old) in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region represent approximately 25% of the region's population. Since the 2008 global economic crisis, the pace of reduction in poverty and income inequality in the LAC region has stalled. The region is characterised by high levels of inequities and is also vulnerable to many natural disasters. Food systems are changing with increased availability and marketing of packaged and fast foods and sugar-sweetened drinks. Adolescence is a formative phase of the life course with multiple physical, emotional and social changes which can make them vulnerable to health problems. We assess the potential impact of macro-determinants, human and economic development as well as income inequality, on 2 top-ranking regional priorities for adolescent nutrition and mental health, using measures of overweight and suicidal ideation and planning which some have shown to be associated. Methods and findings The Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) is a nationally representative self-administered, school-based survey. We examined overweight/obesity and suicidal ideation with planning by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita or human development index (HDI) in 10-19-year-old adolescents from 21 LAC countries between 2009 and 2013. Sample sizes varied from 943 in Anguilla to 27,988 in Argentina. A total of 55,295 adolescents had a measure of overweight/obesity status, and 59,061 adolescents reported about suicidal ideation with planning. There was equal representation by sex in the surveys (52% girls and 48% boys). A total of 28.8% of boys and 28.1% of girls had overweight/obesity, and 7.5% of boys and 17.5% of girls reported suicidal ideation with planning over the last 12 months. Adjusted for individual socioeconomic and risk behaviours, and relative to the highest GDP per capita tertile, the middle tertile was associated with 42% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59% to 17%, p = 0.003) and 32% (95% CI 60% to 5%, p = 0.023), and the lowest tertile with 40% (95% CI 55% to 19%, p = 0.001) and 46% (95% CI 59% to 29%, p < 0.001) lower chances of overweight/obesity for girls and boys, respectively. A similar positive effect was seen with HDI, with lowest chances of overweight in the lowest tertile compared with the highest tertile for both sexes. Overweight/obesity was positively related with suicidal ideation with planning for girls (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.22, p = 0.009) and weakly related for boys (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24, p = 0.182). In contrast to overweight/obesity status, suicidal ideation with planning was not related to macro-level indices despite both outcomes sharing common individual socioeconomic and risk behaviour correlates. Limitations include the dominance of Argentinians in the sample (40%), the exclusion of vulnerable adolescents who dropped out of school, and reporting bias due to stigma of mental health-related issues. Conclusions This study shows that economic and human development were positively associated with adolescent overweight/obesity but not with suicidal ideation with planning. We also observed an interconnectedness between overweight/obesity and suicide ideation with planning among girls. These findings highlight the importance of strategies that engage with both upstream and downstream determinants to improve adolescent nutrition and mental health.

J	Forester, S; O'Brien, C				Forester, Summer; O'Brien, Cheryl			Antidemocratic and Exclusionary Practices: COVID-19 and the Continuum of Violence	POLITICS & GENDER			English	Article						Intersectionality; violence; gender; feminist security studies; militarization		The global coronavirus pandemic has reified divisions, inequity, and injustices rooted in systems of domination such as racism, sexism, neoliberal capitalism, and ableism. Feminist scholars have theorized these interlocking systems of domination as the "continuum of violence." Building on this scholarship, we conceptualize the U.S. response to and the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as reflective of the continuum of violence. We argue that crises like pandemics expose the antidemocratic and exclusionary practices inherent in this continuum, which is especially racialized and gendered. To support our argument, we provide empirical evidence of the continuum of violence in relation to COVID-19 vis-a-vis the interrelated issues of militarization and what feminists call "everyday security," such as public health and gender-based violence. The continuum of violence contributes theoretically and practically to our understanding of how violence that the pandemic illuminates is embedded in broader systems of domination and exclusion.

Most of the developed and developing countries have adopted these plans to achieve the Agenda 2030, currently formed by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The analysis of the interactions between the SDGs is a growing area in research and of interest for governments. However, studies on how positive correlations can improve deteriorated goals are scarce for countries to date. This study aims at filling this gap by finding and quantifying the synergies and trade-offs among the SDGs of Spain. During the years 2000-2019, almost 80% of the SDG targets had significant interactions, either positive (synergy) or negative (trade-off). SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender Equality) and SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) contained the largest number of positive interactions, more than 60% in all of them. SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing) was strongly linked with indicators from SDG 4 (quality education) and also SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). Furthermore, indicators from SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) shared a high correlation with the ones from SGD 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (life on land). SDG 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 8 (decent work and economic growth) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities) had the slowest evolution during the years 2000-2019, showing contractions in some instances. We developed a regression model to assess the influence that selected targets have had on a less evolved target (target 8.6-proportion of youth not in education, employment or training). We managed to clarify high influence from target 1.3 (unemployment compensations), target 8.4 (domestic material consumption) and target 10.5 (non-performing loans) on the dependent variable. Identifying numerical dependencies between the SDGs may help nations to develop a roadmap where targets work as cogwheel towards achieving the Agenda 2030.

J	Glazebrook, T; Opoku, E				Glazebrook, Tricia; Opoku, Emmanuela			Gender and Sustainability: Learning from Women's Farming in Africa	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals; Africa; Ghana; women and gender; agriculture; food security; climate change; capital economics; care labor; logics; practices; ecosystem services	CLIMATE; AGRICULTURE	Africa was the only continent not to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development Goal of 50% poverty reduction. This paper asks whether Africa will fare better in meeting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) addressing poverty and hunger by 2030. To answer this question, we examine a diverse body of literature and provide relevant longitudinal data collected over 13 years of field research. We find that 'sustainable development' is a failed concept immersed in the contemporary global economic system that favors growth over ecosystem stability and international institutions that undervalue women's capacity for sustainability in their care-work as food providers. We examine barriers to women's farming (climate change, gender bias, limited access to land, technology, finance) and provide examples of women's innovative strategies for overcoming barriers in their care practices toward family and community well-being and ecosystem health. We find that Africa will likely repeat past failures without community-level interventions that empower women to achieve SDGs on poverty, hunger, gender equity, and ecosystem management. We uncover similar holistic thinking in women's agricultural practices and scientific conception of 'ecosystem services'.

J	Lopreite, M; Zhu, Z				Lopreite, Milena; Zhu, Zhen			The effects of ageing population on health expenditure and economic growth in China: A Bayesian-VAR approach	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian-VAR models; Ageing population structure; Health spending; Policy implications; China	CARE EXPENDITURE; LIFE EXPECTANCY; DEMOGRAPHIC-TRANSITION; CO2 EMISSIONS; PANEL-DATA; REFORM; INCOME; COUNTRIES; IMPACT; INEQUALITIES	The increasing proportion of the population aged 65 or over has generated a global rise of health spending due to higher demand for medical and long-term care services, which has become a growing challenge to the sustainability of public finances across countries. This phenomenon is especially prominent in China, which has experienced accelerated rates of both economic growth and population ageing over the past four decades. Using Bayesian-VAR (B-VAR) models we compute the impulse response functions (IRFs) and the forecast error variance decomposition functions (FEVDs) to empirically examine the dynamic relationships between ageing index, life expectancy, economic growth and health expenditure in China. We compare China with the USA which has distinct trajectories of population structure and economic development to better understand the former's dynamic patterns. We find a pronounced response for both the USA and China of ageing index to life expectancy and of health spending per capita to GDP per capita, while ageing population induces a relatively strong reaction from health expenditure per capita in China. Our results are robust with either nominal or real variables. These findings suggest that, in China, a well-rounded policy accommodating economic, social and health factors is needed to improve the quality of life of the ageing population for a sustainable development of the economy.

The relevance of schools for health and well-being of children and adolescents has long been recognised, and there is some research regarding the association of contextual and compositional characteristics of schools and classes with health, health behaviour and well-being in this population. Little is known about the role of meso-level characteristics in relation to health inequalities. The aim of this scoping review is to retrieve and synthesise evidence about the mediating or moderating role of compositional or contextual characteristics of schools for the association between students' socioeconomic position and health in primary and secondary education. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic search of electronic databases in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science and Education Resources Information Center. Studies must meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) The population must be students attending primary or secondary schools in developed economies. (2) The outcomes must include at least one indicator for individual health, health behaviour or well-being. (3) The study must include at least one contextual or compositional characteristic of the school context and one individual determinant of socioeconomic position. (4) The study must also examine the mediating or moderating role of the contextual or compositional characteristic of the school context for the associations between socioeconomic position and health, health behaviour or well-being. (5) The study must be published since 1 January 2000 in English or German language. We will provide a narrative synthesis of findings. Ethics and dissemination We will not collect primary data and only include secondary data derived from previously published studies. Therefore, ethical approval is not required. We intend to publish our findings in an international peer-reviewed journal and to present them at national and international conferences.

To date, there has been little characterization of the 'problem' of health inequity, and the normative assumptions implicit in the representation of the problem. Yet, such insights have implications for shaping the framing, incentivization, and implementation of health policies and their wider impact. Objective: In this article, we characterize how health (in)equity is represented as a policy issue, how this representation came about, and the underlying assumptions. Methods: We draw from Bacchi's 'what is the problem represented to be' approach to explore how national-level actors in the health sector constitute the problem. The data for our analysis encompass 23 key informant interviews with national health sector actors working in leadership positions on MNCH in Ethiopia, and six policy documents. Findings were derived from thematic and content analysis. Results: Health inequity is a normalized and inevitable concern that is regarded as actionable (can be altered) but not fully resolvable (can never be fully achieved). Operationally, health equity is viewed as a technocratic matter, reflected in the widespread use of metrics to motivate and measure progress. These representations are shaped by Ethiopia's rapid expansion of health services into rural areas during the 2000s leading to the positive international attention and funding the country received for improved MNCH indicators. Expanding the coverage and efficiency of health service provision, especially in rural areas, is associated with economic productivity. Conclusion: The metrication of health equity may detract from the fairness, justice, and morality underpinnings of the concept. The findings of this study point to the implications of global pressures in terms of maximizing health investments, and call into question how social, political, and economic determinants of health are addressed through broader development agendas.

Some of the most infected groups are Pacific communities and this has raised concern about the need to seriously address the issue of health and socio-economic inequality. One way of doing this is through social protection. The paper critically examines some of the conventional notions of social protection, especially those predicated on market-imperatives and assumptions and argues for new and community-relevant innovative social protection strategies to effectively mitigate the effects of COVID-19. It then discusses the integrated social protection approach (ISPA), The paper argues that while ISPA is an attempt to create an alternative, inclusive and participatory social protection strategy, the issues of equity in terms of distribution of resources and power still need to be fully addressed because of their potential to cause tension within the community. The meaningful participation and empowerment of the Pacific communities and the strategic use of their cultural norms in social protection framing and implementation are important in building up resilience and sustainability to mitigate effectively against the sudden onset of pandemics such as COVID-19.

Meeting the Global Target in Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health Care Services in Low- and Middle-Income Countries	GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article							COUNTDOWN; COVERAGE; EQUITY; TRENDS	Introduction: Improving reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) care services is imperative for reducing maternal and child mortaliiy. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are striving to achieve RMNCH-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We monitored progress, made projections, and calculated the average annual rate of change needed to achieve universal (100%) access of RMNCH service indicators by 2030. Methods: We extracted Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data of 75 LMICs to estimate the coverage of RMNCH indicators and composite coverage index (CCI) to measure health system strengths. Bayesian linear regression models were fitted to predict the coverage of indicators and the probability of achieving targets. Results: The projection analysis included 64 countries with available information for at least 2 DHS rounds. No countries are projected to reach universal CCI by 2030; only Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Honduras, Morocco, and Sierra Leone will have more than 90% CCI. None of the LMICs will achieve universal coverage of all RMNCH indicators by 2030, although some may achieve universal coverage for specific services. To meet targets for universal service access by 2030, most LMICs must attain a 2-fold increase in the coverage of indicators from 2019 to 2030. Coverage of RMNCH indicators, the probability of target attainments, and the required rate of increase vary significantly across the spectrum of sociodemographic disadvantages. Most countries with poor historical and current trends for RMNCH coverage are likely to experience a similar scenario in 2030. Countries with lower coverage had higher disparities across the subgroups of wealth, place of residence, and women's/mother's education and age; these disparities are projected to persist in 2030. Conclusion: None of the LMICs will meet the SDG RMNCH 2030 targets without scaling up essential RMNCH interventions, reducing gaps in coverage, and reaching marginalized and disadvantaged populations.

J	Park, JM; Lee, HY; Park, SH; Han, I				Park, Jung Min; Lee, Hyoung Yong; Park, Sang Hyun; Han, Ingoo			Value Relevance of Accounts Receivable Factoring and Its Impact on Financing Strategy under the K-IFRS after COVID-19 from the Perspective of Accounting Big Data	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						value relevance; accounts receivable factoring; recognition; disclosure; K-IFRS; leverage	INVESTMENT DECISIONS; DISCLOSURE; RECOGNITION; SECURITIZATIONS; INFORMATION; LEVERAGE; SALES	This study investigates whether recognized accounts receivable (AR) factoring is more value relevant than disclosed AR factoring. After the adoption of the Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS), AR factoring is recognized as short-term debt, thus increasing firms' leverage ratio. Using cross-sectional equity valuation regressions, we find that recognized AR factoring is value relevant, unlike disclosed AR factoring. Moreover, the market value of equity and AR factoring are more significantly correlated in highly leveraged firms than in less-leveraged ones. Accounting data are important from the perspective of big data. In the accounting industry as well, professionals started realizing the implications of big data. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a health crisis and wreaked havoc in an already-fragile global economy. Although there is no way to predict exactly what the economic damage from the COVID-19 pandemic will be, there must be widespread agreement that it will have severe financial impact on every company. Global financial markets have suffered dramatic falls due to the pandemic, and highly leveraged companies are in serious need of financing. While diving deeper, sound debt management and debt transparency are critical to ensure debt sustainability. Thus, companies would be willing to use AR factoring in order to overcome this financial status. This study also shows that highly leveraged firms decrease AR factoring after K-IFRS adoption.

This review provides an overview of global policies that optimize development, licensing, pricing, and reimbursement of orphan drugs. Methods: Pharmaceutical legislation and policies related to access and regulation of orphan drugs were examined from 194 World Health Organization member countries and 6 areas. Orphan drug policies (ODPs) were identified through internet search, emails to national pharmacovigilance centers, and systematic academic literature search. Texts from selected publications were extracted for content analysis. Results: One hundred seventy-two drug regulation documents and 77 academic publications from 162 countries/areas were included. Ninety-two of 200 countries/areas (46.0%) had documentation on ODPs. Thirty-four subthemes from content analysis were categorized into 6 policy themes, namely, orphan drug designation, marketing authorization, safety and efficacy requirements, price regulation, incentives that encourage market availability, and incentives that encourage research and development. Countries/areas with ODPs were statistically wealthier (gross national income per capita = $10 875 vs $3950, P < .001). Country/area income was also positively correlated with the scope of the respective ODP (correlation coefficient = 0.57, P < .001). Conclusions: Globally, the number of countries with an ODP has grown rapidly since 2013. Nevertheless, disparities in geographical distribution and income levels affect the establishment of ODPs. Furthermore, identified policy gaps in price regulation, incentives that encourage market availability, and incentives that encourage research and development should be addressed to improve access to available and affordable orphan drugs.

However, these interlinkages have not been examined in depth in recent discussions on urban sustainability and global urban science. This paper fills that gap by elaborating in detail the multiple links between urban sustainability and human health and by mapping research gaps at the interface of health and urban sustainability sciences. As researchers from a broad range of disciplines, we aimed to: 1) define the process of urbanization, highlighting distinctions from related concepts to support improved conceptual rigour in health research; 2) review the evidence linking health with urbanization, urbanicity, and cities and identify crosscutting issues; and 3) highlight new research approaches needed to study complex urban systems and their links with health. This novel, comprehensive knowledge synthesis addresses issue of interest across multiple disciplines. Our review of concepts of urban development should be of particular value to researchers and practitioners in the health sciences, while our review of the links between urban environments and health should be of particular interest to those outside of public health. We identify specific actions to promote health through sustainable urban development that leaves no one behind, including: integrated planning; evidence-informed policy-making; and monitoring the implementation of policies. We also highlight the critical role of effective governance and equity-driven planning in progress towards sustainable, healthy, and just urban development.

A Cross-National Comparison of the Development of Adolescent Problem Behavior: a 1-Year Longitudinal Study in India, the Netherlands, the USA, and Australia	PREVENTION SCIENCE			English	Article						Adolescent; Problem behavior; Cross-national; Longitudinal	UNITED-STATES; DELINQUENT-BEHAVIOR; WASHINGTON-STATE; SUBSTANCE USE; HONG-KONG; DRUG-USE; RISK; PREVENTION; PREVALENCE; PROTECTION	The world youth population is the largest ever and the levels of problem behavior will influence future global health. Recognition of these issues raises questions as to whether adolescent development knowledge can be internationally applied. To date, most research examining adolescent problem behavior has been completed in the United States (USA) and there has been neglected analysis of health inequalities. The aim of the present study was to compare the structure and predictors of problem behavior in representative samples from the USA, Australia, India, and the Netherlands. Two timepoints of longitudinal data were analyzed from the International Youth Development Study that originally recruited state-representative student cohorts in 2002 in Washington State, USA (analytic sample N = 1942) and Victoria, Australia (N = 1957). Similar aged samples were recruited in Mumbai, India, in 2010 (N = 3.923) and the Netherlands in 2008 (N = 682). Surveys were matched and follow-up occurred over 1-year (average baseline ages 12 to 13). CFA identified a latent problem behavior construct comprised of substance use and antisocial behavior indicators. There were cross-national differences in the indicators for this construct. Factor loadings and items were similar between Australia and the USA; however, different items loaded on the construct for the Indian and Netherlands sample. SEM identified that problem behavior at time 2 was predicted by time 1 behavior, with cross-national differences evident. Low parent education was predictive in the USA and India. The number of risk factors present was predictive of problem behavior in all four nations. The findings suggest that evaluated preventative strategies to reduce adolescent problem behavior may have international applications. The analysis of cross-nationally matched longitudinal data appears feasible for identifying prevalence and predictor differences that may signify policy and cultural contexts, to be considered in adapting prevention programs.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						BMI; child obesity; convergence; clubs; gender differences	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; WORLDWIDE TRENDS; OVERWEIGHT; COUNTRIES; ADOLESCENTS; INEQUALITY; GROWTH; CONSEQUENCES; DISPARITIES; PREVALENCE	Childhood obesity has become one of the most serious global health challenges of our time. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity has rapidly increased worldwide during the last two decades, especially in some developing countries where obesity is reaching levels on a par with some industrialized countries, or even higher. This fast growth has occurred especially in countries in the midst of rapid social-economic transitions. Most international comparisons focus on the adult population while analyses focusing on the child population are more limited. Using the methodology developed by Phillips and Sul, this paper studies the worldwide evolution of children's body mass index (BMI), overweight and obesity prevalence for a large sample of countries during the period 1975-2016. Our results indicate that the figures for BMI or the prevalence of obesity in different countries do not converge, while the opposite is the case for overweight prevalence in children. Furthermore, there is a non-linear relationship between obesity and income or human capital, indicating that low and middle-income countries require a strong initiative for health policies targeting obesity prevention.

At the same time, inequalities in access to mental health care are observed. Methods: In order to evaluate whether the Parisian public psychiatric system is optimally structured to meet the needs of this population, we examined data on mental health and service use considering three different levels: the global system treatment level, a psychiatric reception center, and mobile teams specializing in access to psychiatric care for asylum seekers. Results: We found higher treatment rates among migrants than among natives (p < 0.001) but inequalities in pathways to care: more mandatory admissions (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02-1.80) and fewer specialized consultations (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.81). We observed a mismatch between increased need and provision of care among migrants without stable housing or seeking asylum. Conclusions: Inequalities in the provision of care for migrants are observed in the Parisian public psychiatric system, particularly for those experiencing poor social and economic conditions. There is a need to facilitate access to mental health care and develop more tailored interventions to reduce discontinuity of care.

J	Zorzano, MP				Zorzano, Maria-Paz			Gender Balance in Mars Exploration: Lessons Learned from the Mars Science Laboratory	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						solar system exploration; gender balance; mars science laboratory; sustainable goals	GLOBAL HEALTH; MISSION; EQUALITY; MEDICINE; SURFACE; VIEW	There is, recently, a global concern about the gender gap in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas, starting from education role models, student applications, through the academic, industrial and management career progression. Given the high visibility and popularity of all subjects related to space exploration, female participation in this field may be used to change the existing stereotypes and provide role models to the younger generations, thus having a positive influence on education while also demonstrating to other organizations how to promote diversity in the working environment. Previous studies on spacecraft science teams, considering only principal and co-Investigators, PIs and co-investigators (CoIs), respectively, show that the percentage of women in the role of investigators has remained flat at 15.8% since 2000. The NASA Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission is taken here as an example to perform a statistical analysis of the gender profile for the period 2004-2018. The results are compared with: (1) data from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) about gender distribution in STEM postdoctoral profiles and faculty members; (2) the trend of planetary exploration team profiles; (3) research and innovation statistics in Europe; (4) proposals of the EU FP6 funding program; and (5) the percentage of female researchers from the Elsevier status report. This analysis shows that the process of continually holding open calls for Participating Scientists based on individual merit and the application of a flat working structure have allowed gender balance within the MSL team to improve naturally while maximizing individual and team performance. Women represent approximately 30.6% of the team, in agreement with the current percentage of female planetary exploration researchers and senior faculty members in academia. Interestingly, the percentage of female-led articles has been above the MSL women percentage trend. While the percentage of women in planetary science appears to be increasing, their role on the proposing teams is still low. As in other STEM fields, attention should be paid to secure the adequate promotion of younger generations to achieve the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 5 of achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls by 2030.

J	Cimpoeru, S				Cimpoeru, Smaranda			MACRO-ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF MIGRATION. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS FOR OLD VS. NEW EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES	ECONOMIC COMPUTATION AND ECONOMIC CYBERNETICS STUDIES AND RESEARCH			English	Article						migration; migration determinants; panel data regression; unemployment; earnings; economic freedom; Gini index	INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; RELATIVE DEPRIVATION; UNEMPLOYMENT; INEQUALITY; CORRUPTION	The objective of this paper is to identify and measure the macroeconomic factors having a significant impact on migration flows in European countries. A comparative analysis is proposed between Old Member States (traditionally receiving countries for migrants) and New Member States (with lower net migration rates). Thus, two panel data regression models are estimated for identifying the determinants of net migration (period 2000 2017). The factors considered are consistent with the migration theories: labour market factors (unemployment, income), social factors (Gini inequality coefficient, poverty rate) and other factors (economic freedom, health system). Obtained results confirm the economic theories of migration. Unemployment is a significant and strong supply push factor for migration, while income emerges as a significantfactor only for the Old Member States. Inequality is endorsed as a significant push factor for all countries, while economic freedom has a significant positive influence on the net migration rate only for the New Member States. Health related variables are not validated as migration determinants. The findings of this paper can be further used for developing migration projections but also for establishing migration policies recommendations that could lead to better integration of migrants.

Methods: We summarized the epidemic prevention and control policies in Japan, Italy, China, and Singapore, and analyzed the policy effects of these four countries by using the data published by Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Results: As of May 27, 2020, the growing trend of new cases in Japan, Italy, China and Singapore has stabilized. However, the cumulative number of confirmed cases (231139) and case-fatality rate (14.3%) in Italy far exceeded those in the other three countries, and the effect of epidemic control was inferior. Singapore began to experience a domestic resurgence after April 5, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases reaching 32,876, but the case-fatality rate remained extremely low (0.1%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in China (84547) was almost stagnant, and the case-fatality rate was low (5.5%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in Japan (16661) increased slowly, and the case-fatality rate (4.8%) was slightly lower than that in China. Conclusion: This study divided the epidemic prevention and control policies of the four countries into two categories: the blocking measures adopted by China and Singapore, and the mitigation measures adopted by Japan and Italy. According to the Epidemic control results of these four countries, we can conclude that the blocking measures were generally effective. As the core strategy of blocking measures, admitting mild patients into hospital and cases tracing helped curb the spread of the outbreak in Singapore and China. Countries should choose appropriate response strategies on the premise of considering their own situation, increase investment in health resources to ensure global health equity, and eventually control the spread of infectious diseases in the world effectively.

They exacerbate existing patterns of discrimination and inequity, impacting especially those already facing intersecting social, economic and health vulnerabilities. In this article, we explore the nature and extent of racism sparked by COVID-19. We briefly introduce the relationship between historical pandemics and racist sentiments and discuss ethnic and racial disparities in relation to COVID-19. We contextualize racism under COVID-19, and argue that an environment of populism, resurgent exclusionary ethno-nationalism, and retreating internationalism has been a key contributor to the flare-up in racism during the COVID-19. We then discuss links between racism, nationalism and capitalism, and consider what intercultural relations may look like in a post-outbreak world. We conclude by highlighting the potential effects of COVID-racism on intercultural relations, and the national and global implications for social policy.

Decolonising global health in the time of COVID-19	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						COVID-19; Africa; colonialism; decolonising; global health		The persistent influence of coloniality both from external actors and from within threatens the response to COVID-19 in Africa. This essay presents historical context for the colonial inheritance of modern global health and analyses two controversies related to COVID-19 that illustrate facets of coloniality: comments made by French researchers regarding the testing of BCG vaccine in Africa, and the claims by Madagascar's president Andry Rajoelina that the country had developed an effective traditional remedy named Covid-Organics. Leveraging both historical sources and contemporary documentary sources, I demonstrate how the currents of exploitation, marginalisation, pathologisation and saviourism rooted in coloniality are manifested via these events. I also discuss responses to coloniality, focussing on the misuse and co-optation of pan-Africanist rhetoric. In particular, I argue that the scandal surrounding Covid-Organics is a reflection of endogenised coloniality, whereby local elites entrench and benefit from inequitable power structures at the intersubjective (rather than trans-national) scale. I conclude with a reflection on the need for equity as a guiding principle to dismantle global health colonialism.

This article examines the impact of energy poverty on children and young people in developing Pacific islands Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga and developed New Zealand. We argue that children and young people have a greater burden of cumulative exposure to energy poverty than adults, which exposes them to greater risks of negative health and wellbeing. We draw on the geographically defined, but economically and politically diverse area of the Pacific islands to provide comparative examples demonstrating how energy policy in both lowand high income countries entrenches energy inequalities in children and young people. After examining the energy profiles of countries in the Pacific, we provide case examples from our research in Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga and New Zealand to demonstrate the everyday realities of children experiencing energy poverty in the region. We call for a reframing of the energy poverty debate in relation to those who are most vulnerable to climate change and the reshaping of regionaland stateenergy policy priorities to address these inequalities.

Our initial 6-month trial (previously reported) using mobile texting and lay health supporters, called LEAN, significantly improved medication adherence from 0.48 to 0.61 (adjusted mean 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.20, P=.007) for adults with schizophrenia living in a resource-poor village in rural China. Objective: We explored the effectiveness of our texting program in improving participants' medication adherence, functioning, and symptoms in an extended implementation of the intervention after its initial phase. Methods: In an approximated stepped-wedge wait-list design randomized controlled trial, 277 community-dwelling villagers with schizophrenia were assigned 1:1 in phase 1 into intervention and wait-list control groups. The intervention group received (1) lay health supporters (medication or care supervisors), (2) e-platform (mobile-texting reminders and education message) access, (3) a token gift for positive behavioral changes, and (4) integration with the existing government community-mental health program (the 686 Program) while the wait-listed control group initially only received the 686 Program. Subsequently (in the extended period), both groups received the LEAN intervention plus the 686 Program. The primary outcome was antipsychotic medication adherence (percentage of dosages taken over the past month assessed by unannounced home-based pill counts). The secondary outcomes were symptoms measured during visits to 686 Program psychiatrists using the Clinical Global Impression scale for schizophrenia and functioning measured by trained student assessors using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Other outcomes included data routinely collected in the 686 Program system (refill records, rehospitalization due to schizophrenia, death for any reason, suicide, wandering, and violent behaviors). We used intention-to-treat analysis and missing data were imputed. A generalized estimating equation model was used to assess program effects on antipsychotics medication adherence, symptoms, and functioning. Results: Antipsychotics medication adherence improved from 0.48 in the control period to 0.58 in the extended intervention period (adjusted mean difference 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.19; P=.004). We also noted an improvement in symptoms (adjusted mean difference -0.26, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.02; P=.04; Cohen d effect size 0.20) and a reduction in rehospitalization (0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; P=.007; number-needed-to-treat 8.05, 95% CI 4.61 to 21.41). There was no improvement in functioning (adjusted mean difference 0.02, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.06; P=.18; Cohen d effect size 0.04). Conclusions: In an extended implementation, our intervention featuring mobile texting messages and lay health workers in a resource-poor community setting was more effective than the 686 Program alone in improving medication adherence, improving symptoms, and reducing rehospitalization.

J	Erasmus, N				Erasmus, N.			Age discrimination in critical care triage in South Africa: The law and the allocation of scarce health resources in the COVID-19 pandemic	SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							PREDICTIONS; UNIT	No one may be refused emergency medical treatment in South Africa (SA). Yet score-based categorical exclusions used in critical care triage guidelines disproportionately discriminate against older adults, the cognitively and physically impaired, and the disabled. Adults over the age of 60, who make up 9.1% of the SA population, are most likely to present with disabilities and comorbidities at triage. Score-based models, drawn from international precedents, deny these patients admission to an ICU when resources are constrained, such as during influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa and the South African Medical Association adopted the Clinical Frailty Scale, which progressively withholds admission to ICUs based on age, frailty and comorbidities in a manner that potentially contravenes constitutional and equality prohibitions against unfair discrimination. The legal implications for healthcare providers are extensive, ranging from personal liability to hate speech and crimes against humanity. COVID-19 guidelines and score-based triage protocols must be revised urgently to eliminate unlawful discrimination against legally protected categories of patients in SA, including the disabled and the elderly. That will ensure legal certainty for health practitioners, and secure the full protections of the law to which the health-vulnerable and those of advanced age are constitutionally entitled.

In this Commentary we aim to reveal underlying problems of this crisis, that may be an underestimated global driver of the pandemic and a serious risk to health and healthcare systems. We set the focus on informal work and related poorly regulated sub-contracting which create poor work conditions as one dimension of the social determinants of health. We use the examples of Germany and Brazil, as opposite sides geographically and concerning the pandemic, to highlight a need for greater attention to these risks and for systematic inclusion in health systems resilience. In both countries, informal work may turn into hot spots of COVID-19, thus reinforcing social inequalities on a grand scale both nationally and globally. Our two contrasting country cases thus reveal a global threat that should be treated as such. There is much to learn for Europe and the world from Brazil and Latin America on what happens when informal labour and poor work environments backfire during the COVID-19 pandemic. We should listen carefully to these lessons.

Structural competency and global health education	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Social determinants of health; structural competency; global health; education		Structural competency is a new curricular framework for training health professionals to recognise and respond to disease and its unequal distribution as the outcome of social structures, such as economic and legal systems, healthcare and taxation policies, and international institutions. While extensive global health research has linked social structures to the disproportionate burden of disease in the Global South, formal attempts to incorporate the structural competency framework into US-based global health education have not been described in the literature. This paper fills this gap by articulating five sub-competencies for structurally competent global health instruction. Authors drew on their experiences developing global health and structural competency curricula-and consulted relevant structural competency, global health, social science, social theory, and social determinants of health literatures. The five sub-competencies include: (1) Describe the role of social structures in producing and maintaining health inequities globally, (2) Identify the ways that structural inequalities are naturalised within the field of global health, (3) Discuss the impact of structures on the practice of global health, (4) Recognise structural interventions for addressing global health inequities, and (5) Apply the concept of structural humility in the context of global health.

Effect of a Community-Based Gender Norms Program on Sexual Violence Perpetration by Adolescent Boys and Young Men A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							DATING VIOLENCE; PREVENTION; BEHAVIORS; ATTITUDES; WOMEN; RISK	Importance Engaging adolescent boys and young men in preventing violence against women is a potentially impactful public health strategy. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based, gender-transformative program (ie, Manhood 2.0) on perpetration of gender-based violence by adolescent boys and young men. Design, Setting, and Participants In this unblinded cluster randomized clinical trial, neighborhoods were designated as the unit of clustering (1:1 allocation). Three-month (ie, time point 2 [T2]) and 9-month (ie, time point 3 [T3]) follow-ups were conducted. The trial took place in 20 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, neighborhoods and 1 centrally located site with concentrated disadvantage. Pittsburgh-based adolescent boys and young men (ages 13 to 19 years) were recruited between July 27, 2015, and June 5, 2017, through youth-serving organizations and community-based alternatives to residential placement for juvenile justice-involved youth. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted from June 2018 to November 2019. Interventions Manhood 2.0, an international program adapted for adolescent boys and young men in US urban communities, encourages these individuals to challenge gender norms that foster violence against women and unhealthy sexual relationships. Individuals in the control population received job-readiness training. Each program was 18 hours. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change in participant-level perpetration of sexual violence (SV) or adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) at T3. Results Among 866 participants, 465 individuals (54%) enrolled in 11 intervention clusters and 401 individuals (46%) enrolled in 10 control clusters. In the intervention group, 325 participants (70%) were analyzed at T2 and 334 participants (72%) were analyzed at T3; in the control group, 262 participants (65%) were analyzed at T2 and 301 participants (75%) were analyzed at T3. Mean (SD) age was 15.5 (1.6) years; 609 participants (70%) self-identified as non-Hispanic Black, and 178 (20%) self-identified as Hispanic, multiracial, or other race/ethnicity other than White. Among individuals in the intervention group, 296 participants (64%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at baseline, and 173 participants (52%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at T3. Among individuals in the control group, 213 participants (53%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at baseline, and 124 participants (41%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at T3). The difference in reduction between groups was not significant. There was no evidence of an intervention effect for the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% CI, 0.86-2.01; P = .20). Conclusions and Relevance The findings from this evaluation of a community-based gender-transformative program for adolescent boys and young men did not show a significant intervention effect in reducing SV or ARA perpetration between Manhood 2.0 and a job-readiness control program. Combining gender-transformative approaches with job-readiness programs may be relevant for violence prevention in low-resource urban settings. Attention to improving implementation and strategies to sustain such community-based efforts are needed. This cluster randomized clinical trial compares the effects of a gender norms program with those of a job-readiness program on sexual violence perpetration by adolescent boys and young men in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

J	Besnier, E				Besnier, Elodie			Women's political empowerment and child health in the sustainable development era: A global empirical analysis (1990-2016)	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Women empowerment; child health; political empowerment; sustainable development; global health	SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; ARMED CONFLICT; 195 COUNTRIES; DEMOCRACY; HETEROSCEDASTICITY; ASSOCIATIONS; INEQUALITIES; TERRITORIES; DISEASE	Empowering women is presented as a key strategy to achieve several goals of the sustainable development (SDG) agenda, including child health. However, the literature on the subject shows mixed results and is limited regarding political empowerment. Responding to this gap, we explore whether women's political empowerment is associated with positive health outcomes for children under 5 years of age. We use the V-Dem project's 'Women's Political Empowerment Index' (WPEI) in combination with selected SDG indicators of child health from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's 2017 Global Burden of Disease, for 161 countries, between 1990 and 2016. We estimate fixed-effects regressions for the WPEI against child mortality, stunting and immunisation coverage, controlling for structural and socio-economic indicators from the SDGs and potential lagged effects. The WPEI is associated with improved nutrition and immunisation but its substantive effect is small. High-, low-income and least developed countries benefit more from the effect of women's political empowerment on child mortality. The effect of women's political empowerment on stunting is stronger in middle-income countries while its effect on immunisation is more relevant to low-income and least developed countries. Our study demonstrates the complexity of the relations between women's political empowerment and child health.

J	Sekalala, S				Sekalala, Sharifah			Categorising the Gendered Harms to Caregivers During Humanitarian Emergencies: An Analysis of Law and Practice During Ebola Crises	SOCIAL & LEGAL STUDIES			English	Article						COVID-19; Ebola; front-line workers; gender; human rights; humanitarian crisis; international law; private law; social reproduction	POLITICAL-ECONOMY; VIRUS DISEASE; GLOBAL HEALTH; WEST-AFRICA; EPIDEMIC; INFECTION; WORKERS; RIGHTS; KENEMA; WOMEN	Recent global health emergencies have highlighted the critical role of health care workers in stemming the spread of pandemics. Healthcare workers provide an essential service to local communities impacted by epidemics such as Ebola. Global health scholars suggest that carers may suffer harm while performing this essential work. Building on feminist theories of 'harm' and 'social reproduction', this article uses as case studies the early 21st century Ebola epidemics that broke out in West Africa and the DRC to ask how do women carers in humanitarian crises experience harm? The article illustrates the hierarchical and gendered nature of harm, and how those at the bottom of social hierarchies face intersectional harms stemming from their race, class and economic status. The article highlights an urgent need to rethink how law at both the domestic and international levels has contributed to the reproduction of inequalities faced by these carers.

In many low- and middle-income countries different forms of malnutrition (including obesity and undernutrition) can co-exist within the same population. This double burden of malnutrition is placing a disproportional strain on health systems, slowing progress towards universal health coverage (UHC). Poor nutrition also impedes the growth of local economies, ultimately affecting the global economy. In this article, we argue that comprehensive primary health care should be used as a platform to address the double burden of malnutrition. We use a conceptual framework based on human rights and the Astana Declaration on primary health care to examine existing recommendations and propose guidance on how policy-makers and providers of community-oriented primary health care can strengthen the role of nutrition within the UHC agenda. Specifically, we propose four thematic areas for action: (i) bridging narratives and strengthening links between the primary health care and the nutrition agenda with nutrition as a human rights issue; (ii) encouraging primary health-care providers to support local multisectoral action on nutrition; (iii) empowering communities and patients to address unhealthy diets; and (iv) ensuring the delivery of high-quality promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative nutrition interventions. For each theme we summarize the available strategies, policies and interventions that can be used by primary health-care providers and policy-makers to strengthen nutrition in primary health care and thus the UHC agenda.

However, there remain concerns about the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in low-resource countries. Ethiopia has been implementing the primary health-care approach since the mid-1970s, with primary health care at the core of the health system since 1993. Nevertheless, comprehensive and systemic evidence on the practice and role of primary health care towards UHC is lacking in Ethiopia. We made a document review of publicly available qualitative and quantitative data. Using the framework of the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative we describe and analyse the practice of primary health care and identify successes and challenges. Implementation of the primary health-care approach in Ethiopia has been possible through policies, strategies and programmes that are aligned with country priorities. There has been a diagonal approach to disease control programmes along with health-systems strengthening, community empowerment and multisectoral action. These strategies have enabled the country to increase health services coverage and improve the population's health status. However, key challenges remain to be addressed, including inadequate coverage of services, inequity of access, slow health-systems transition to provide services for noncommunicable diseases, inadequate quality of care, and high out-of-pocket expenditure. To resolve gaps in the health system and beyond, the country needs to improve its domestic financing for health and target disadvantaged locations and populations through a precision public health approach. These challenges need to be addressed through the whole sustainable development agenda.

Findings from an Italian National Survey	HEALTHCARE			English	Article						gender medicine; physiotherapy; knowledge; physiotherapy' clinical practice; beliefs	GLOBAL HEALTH; PHYSICIAN GENDER; CHRONIC PAIN; SEX; SCIENCE; WOMEN; CALL; CARE	Background: Gender medicine permeates all sectors of medicine, from prevention to treatment and rehabilitation; it aims to customize the care path, ensuring equity in the access to health care system services. It is unclear to what extent physiotherapists' treatment choices align with gender medicine principles. The aim of this survey is to detect the need of Italian physiotherapists to deepen knowledge in gender medicine. Materials and methods: An 18-item survey assessed the characteristics of responders about knowledge of gender medicine. An online survey was performed in 2020 using SurveyMonkey Software. Data were analyzed by statistical regression. Results: A total of 617 physiotherapists voluntarily participated in the study (53.84% of the target population). The majority of responders (68.4%) declared having general information about gender medicine, but 55.43% of them claimed to have heard of it but did not know properly what gender medicine was about; 92.38% of the physiotherapists believed that they needed training to acquire knowledge in gender medicine. Conclusions: Gender equity matters for health. Moderate knowledge of gender medicine' principles and modest application of these findings were used in clinical practice of physiotherapy.

They give patients, health professionals, managers and policymakers a guide to essential care throughout the patient journey. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality and has a wide variation in treatment and outcomes in Europe. It is a major healthcare burden and has complex diagnosis and treatment challenges. Care must only be carried out in lung cancer units or centres that have a core multidisciplinary team (MDT) and an extended team of health professionals detailed here. Such units are far from universal in European countries. To meet European aspirations for comprehensive cancer control, healthcare organisations must consider the requirements in this paper, paying particular attention to multidisciplinarity and patient-centred pathways from diagnosis, to treatment, to survivorship.

Quality, Equity and Utility of Observational Studies during 10 Years of Implementing the Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative in 72 Countries	TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE			English	Article						STROBE; operational research; SORT IT; observational studies; universal health coverage; health systems research	AUTHORSHIP TRENDS; GLOBAL-HEALTH; CAPACITY; JOURNALS; POLICY	Introduction: Observational studies are often inadequately reported, making it difficult to assess their validity and generalizability and judge whether they can be included in systematic reviews. We assessed the publication characteristics and quality of reporting of observational studies generated by the Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SORT IT). Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of original publications from SORT IT courses. SORT IT is a global partnership-based initiative aimed at building sustainable capacity for conducting operational research according to country priorities and using the generated evidence for informed decision-making to improve public health. Reporting quality was independently assessed using an adapted version of 'Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology' (STROBE) checklist. Results: In 392 publications, involving 72 countries, 50 journals, 28 publishers and 24 disease domains, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) first authorship was seen in 370 (94%) and LMIC last authorship in 214 (55%). Publications involved LMIC-LMIC collaboration in 90% and high-income-country-LMIC collaboration in 87%. The majority (89%) of publications were in immediate open access journals. A total of 346 (88.3%) publications achieved a STROBE reporting quality score of >85% (excellent), 41 (10.4%) achieved a score of 76-85% (good) and 5 (1.3%) a score of 65-75% (fair). Conclusion: The majority of publications from SORT IT adhere to STROBE guidelines, while also ensuring LMIC equity and collaborative partnerships. SORT IT is, thus, playing an important role in ensuring high-quality reporting of evidence for informed decision-making in public health.

Pollution is controlled at a global level. The regulator internalizes that: (i) production generates pollution, which is bad for the wellbeing of population, and that (ii) pollution flows across space driven by a diffusion process. We solve analytically for the optimal investment and depollution spatiotemporal paths and characterize the optimal long-term spatial distribution when relevant. We finally explore numerically the variety of optimal spatial distributions obtained using a core/periphery model where the core differs from the periphery either in terms of input productivity, depollution efficiency, environmental awareness or self-cleaning capacity of nature. We also compare the distributions with and without diffusion. Key aspects in the optimal policy of the regulator are the role of aversion to inequality, notably leading to smoothing consumption across locations, and the control of diffusive pollution adding another smoothing engine.

Vaccination Inequality in India, 2002-2013	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							REGIONAL INEQUALITIES; HEALTH INEQUALITIES; IMMUNIZATION; CHILDREN; WEALTH; COVERAGE; GENDER; EQUITY	Introduction: India's childhood vaccination coverage has increased amid the implementation of national health policies intended to improve immunization levels. However, there is a dearth of contemporary studies comparing state-level childhood vaccination rates across India's highly diverse states and territories. This study assesses SES-based inequalities in childhood vaccination by state for 2002-2013. Methods: National surveys from 2002 to 2004, 2007 to 2008, and 2012 to 2013 were used for analyses. Household SES was assessed using an asset index created through principal component analysis. Full vaccination comprised 1 dose bacille Calmette-Guerin, 3 doses diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine, 3 doses oral polio vaccine, and 1 dose measles-containing vaccine at age 12-60 months. Inequality analyses were stratified by 3 time periods and by government-designated high focus group versus non-high focus group states. Results: Childhood vaccination steadily increased between 2002 and 2013 in high focus group states but fell in some non-high focus group states, whereas SES-based vaccination inequalities generally decreased in both. In 2012-2013, rural areas had lower vaccination rates than urban areas in high focus group states but similar vaccination rates as urban areas in non-high focus group states. Increases in vaccination rates were not consistently accompanied by improvements in SES-based inequalities in vaccination. Conclusions: Childhood vaccination in India has improved overall, although increases are more pronounced in high focus group states than in non-high focus group states over the study period. The gap in coverage between these states decreased over time owing in part to the latter experiencing reductions in full vaccination rates during 2007-2013. SES-based vaccination disparities persist in India, highlighting the need to improve vaccination rates for all children, especially those from disadvantaged and underserved groups.

Patterns in Wealth-related Inequalities in 86 Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Global Evidence on the Emergence of Vaccine Hesitancy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							PREVENTABLE DISEASES; IMMUNIZATION; MEASLES; REFUSAL; STATES; MUMPS; CARE	Introduction: Coverage of health interventions usually shows social gradients with higher levels among wealthy than among poor individuals. Owing to the upsurge of vaccine hesitancy in high-income countries, the authors hypothesized that the social gradient may also be changing over time in the low- and middle-income countries and set out to test this hypothesis. Methods: In January 2020, surveys conducted from 2010 to 2018 in 86 low- and middle-income countries were analyzed to assess full immunization coverage in children aged 12 23 months. The authors calculated full immunization coverage point estimates and 95% CIs for each country and wealth quintile. To explore wealth-related inequalities, the authors estimated the slope index of inequality and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between these values and per capita gross domestic product. Time trends were analyzed in 10 countries with recent evidence of hesitancy. Results: Pro-poor patterns were defined as significant slope index of inequality values with higher coverage among poor children, and pro-rich patterns were defined as the reverse pattern. A total of 11 countries showed pro-poor patterns in the most recent survey, accounting for 20% of upper middle- and 7% of low-income countries. The correlation between the slope index of inequality and log per capita gross domestic product was - 0.38 (p<0.001). Among the 10 countries with recent evidence of hesitancy, 5 showed full immunization coverage declines over time in the wealthiest quintiles, and 4 switched from pro-rich to pro-poor patterns throughout the years. Conclusions: Lower full immunization coverage was found among the wealthy than among the poor in 10 countries, especially in the upper middle-income group, consistent with the emergence of vaccine hesitancy.

Vaccine Delay and Its Association With Undervaccination in Children in Sub-Saharan Africa	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							IMMUNIZATION; COVERAGE; GAMBIA; IMPACT; BIRTH	Introduction: Improving the timeliness and completion of vaccination is the key to reducing under-5 childhood mortality. This study examines the prevalence of delayed vaccination for doses administered at birth and age 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, and 9 months and its association with undervaccination among infants in Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Pooling data across 33 Sub-Saharan Africa countries, vaccination timing and series completion were assessed for children aged 12-35 months who were included in the immunization module of the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2010 and 2019. Survey design-adjusted logistic regression modeled the likelihood of not fully completing the basic immunization schedule associated with dose-specific delays in vaccination. Data were obtained and analyzed in May 2020. Results: Among children with complete date records (n=70,006), the proportion of children vaccinated with delays by >= 1 month was high: 25.9% for Bacille Calmette-Guerin (at birth); 49.1% for the third dose of pentavalent combination vaccine (at 14 weeks); and 63.9% for the first dose of measles vaccines (at 9 months). Late vaccination was more common for children born to mothers with lower levels of educational attainment (p<0.001) and wealth (p<0.001). Controlling for place, time, and sociodemographics, vaccination delays at any dose were significantly associated with not completing the immunization schedule by 12 months (Bacille Calmette-Guerin: AOR=1.93, [95% CI=1.83, 2.02]; pentavalent 3: AOR=1.50 [95% CI=1.35, 1.64]; measles: AOR=3.76 [95% CI=3.37, 4.15]). Conclusions: Timely initiation of vaccination could contribute to higher rates of immunization schedule completion, improving the reach and impact of vaccination programs on child health outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In line with the introduction of universal health coverage in 2014, the Indonesian government plans to redress this by delegating detection and early intervention of mental health services to health practitioners without specialist training in mental health, however, there is limited evidence that they can perform this role effectively. This study aims to evaluate current workforce capacity by assessing differences in mental health literacy between Indonesian mental health and non-mental health practitioners. Compared to non-mental health practitioners, mental health practitioners are significantly less likely to hold stigmatising views towards individuals with mental illness. They are also significantly more likely to correctly recognise symptoms of depression and schizophrenia and recommend and implement evidence-based interventions for these conditions. These findings suggest that task-shifting is unlikely to be an effective solution to reduce the mental health treatment gap, and it is recommended that mental health system reform in Indonesia should initially focus on expansion and retention of the specialist mental health workforce.

Globalization and health equity: The impact of structural adjustment programs on developing countries	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						International Monetary Fund; Conditionality; Structural adjustment; Globalization; Health inequality; Cross-national	CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS; INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND; AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK; TRADE LIBERALIZATION; CHILD-MORTALITY; IMF CONDITIONALITY; INCOME INEQUALITY; POLITICS; GROWTH; NEGOTIATIONS	Among the many drivers of health inequities, this article focuses on important, yet insufficiently understood, international-level determinants: economic globalization and the organizations that spread market-oriented policies to the developing world. One such organization is the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which provides financial assistance to countries in economic trouble in exchange for policy reforms. Through its 'structural adjustment programs,' countries around the world have liberalized and deregulated their economies. We examine how policy reforms prescribed in structural adjustment programs explain variation in health equity between nations-approximated by health system access and neonatal mortality. Our empirical analysis uses an original dataset of IMF-mandated policy reforms for a panel of up to 137 developing countries between 1980 and 2014. We employ regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between these reforms and health equity, taking into account the non-random selection and design of IMF programs. We find that structural adjustment reforms lower health system access and increase neonatal mortality. Additional analyses show that labor market reforms drive these deleterious effects. Overall, our evidence suggests that structural adjustment programs endanger the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals in developing countries.

It has been shown that the use of welfare state typologies can be helpful to examine health inequalities in a comparative perspective. Against this background, analyses are focused on three research questions: (1) How did educational inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) develop between 2002 and 2016 in different European countries? (2) In how far can structural and functional aspects of social relations help to explain these inequalities? (3) Do these explanatory contributions vary between different types of welfare states? Methods: Data stem from the European Social Survey. Data from 20 countries across 8 waves (2002-2016) was included in the sample (allocated to 5 types of welfare states). Structural aspects of social relations were measured by living with a partner, frequency of social contacts and social participation. Availability of emotional support was used as functional dimension. Educational level was assessed based on the International Standard Classification of Education. SRH was measured in all waves on a five-point scale by one question: "How is your health in general? Would you say it is very good, good, fair, bad or very bad?" Results: Across all countries, educational inequalities were increasing between 2002 and 2016. Explanatory contribution of emotional support, living with a partner, and social contacts was small (5% or less across the eight waves). Social participation explained 11% of the educational inequalities in SRH in the European countries. There were small variations in the explanatory contribution of social participation between welfare states. Conclusions: Promoting social participation, especially of people with low education is a possible intervention to reduce inequalities in SRH in Europe.

J	Gracia-Arnaiz, M; Kraemer, FB; Demonte, FC				Gracia-Arnaiz, Mabel; Kraemer, Fabiana Bom; Carolina Demonte, Flavia			Acting against obesity: a cross-cultural analysis of prevention models in Spain, Argentina and Brazil	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION			English	Review						Food; obesity; health policies; preventive model; social inequality; cross-cultural analysis	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; DISCOURSE	This article analyses and compares preventive models for obesity in Spain, Argentina and Brazil through an examination of the respective measures adopted to counter it in those countries. Based on a qualitative study of the main actions carried out since 2004, the aim is to delineate the conceptual framework and reflect on the reasons for their relative effectiveness. The results show that in contexts where prevalence has increased rapidly, sociocultural causes acquire greater explanatory power as opposed to biological and/or behavioral factors. These models premise worsening diets and sedentary lifestyles as being the main culprits, and assume that contemporary societies generate obesogenic and toxic environments. The international health bodies have developed specific strategies to control and prevent obesity based on this diagnosis, and these have been supported by member states such as Spain, Argentina and Brazil. Although the measures reflect certain particularities, they conform to a common pattern organized from platforms promoting so-called "healthy lifestyles" and articulated mainly around the twin axes of a balanced diet and regular physical exercise. The discussion suggests that the excessive emphasis on individual responsibility and the underplaying of the role of food as a complex practice, as well as changing structural factors and the differential distribution of this disease, might largely explain the limited impact of these strategies.

J	Hwang, H; Young, TA				Hwang, Hyunseok; Young, Tiffany Amorette			How does community philanthropy function?: Direct effects of the social problem and the moderating role of community racial diversity	SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Community philanthropy; Collective civic action; Environmental pollution; Social problems; Community racial diversity	LONGITUDINAL DATA; COLLECTIVE ACTION; ORGANIZATIONS; RESOURCES; ECOLOGY; CORPORATIONS; PERFORMANCE; INEQUALITY; POLLUTION; IMPACT	Based upon the existing literatures surrounding collective action and the environmental justice frame, consciousness-raising is a social tool for community constituents facing the hazards of environmental pollution to community health. Environmental pollution is a complex phenomenon that poses grand societal challenges including global implications and locally situated contexts. We believe that locally situated social problems, such as air pollution emissions, influence the functions of community philanthropy, a means of effective collective civic action. By drawing upon resource mobilization theory and organizational ecology theory, this study aims to examine the direct effects of the social problem of environmental pollution to community health and its impact on collective resource mobilization. This is accomplished by analyzing both the organizational growth of the environmental nonprofit sector in terms of the density and aggregated resources at the community level, conceptualized here as community philanthropy. Collective civic action supports environmental activism and is embodied in the shared beliefs, values, and understandings of a community whom seek a legitimate means of collective action; these opportunities are often provided by the nonprofit sector. We also examine the moderating role of community racial diversity on this relationship. Empirical results demonstrate that in racially diverse communities, community philanthropy is facilitated when facing the social problem of increased environmental pollution. Our problem-driven research implies that community racial diversity may impact the mobilization of collective resources when dealing with locally situated social problems.

J	Faure, MC; Munung, NS; Ntusi, NAB; Pratt, B; de Vries, J				Faure, Marlyn C.; Munung, Nchangwi S.; Ntusi, Ntobeko A. B.; Pratt, Bridget; de Vries, Jantina			Mapping experiences and perspectives of equity in international health collaborations: a scoping review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Review						Equity; International health collaborations; Global health; Scoping review	MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS; SOUTH; NORTH; SCIENTISTS; CAPACITY; AFRICA; STAKEHOLDERS; AUTHORSHIP; FRAMEWORK	Background: Whilst global health research often involves international collaborations, achieving or promoting equity within collaborations remains a key challenge, despite established conceptual approaches and the development of frameworks and guidelines to promote equity. There have also been several empirical studies documenting researchers' experiences of inequity and views on what is required to advance equity in global health collaborations. While these empirical studies provide critical insights, there has been no attempt to systematically synthetize what constitutes equity and how it can be achieved. To address this gap, we conducted a scoping review of qualitative studies, opinion and editorial pieces about what equity is and how it can be promoted in international collaborations. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to explore domains of equity in international health collaborations. This review included qualitative studies and opinion pieces or editorial pieces on equity in international health collaborations. We mapped the data and identified common themes using a thematic analysis approach. Results: This initial search retrieved a total of 7611 papers after removing duplicates. A total of 11 papers were included in this review, 10 empirical studies and 1 editorial piece. We conducted our search between October - November 2019. We identified 10 key domains which are important for promoting equity in international collaborations: funding; capacity building; authorship; sample ownership and export; trust; research agreement; acknowledging inequality; recognition and communication. Discussion: Our findings suggest that for international collaborations to be considered more equitable, it must at least consider the 10 domains we highlighted. The 10 domains map onto five key aspects of social justice theory, namely avoiding unequal power relations like subordination, group recognition and affirmation, promoting the well-being of all, inclusion in decision-making and ensuring self-development.

While the burden of HIV is historically concentrated in urban areas and high-risk groups, subnational estimates that cover multiple countries and years are missing. This paucity is partially due to incomplete vital registration (VR) systems and statistical challenges related to estimating mortality rates in areas with low numbers of HIV deaths. In this analysis, we address this gap and provide novel estimates of the HIV mortality rate and the number of HIV deaths by age group, sex, and municipality in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Mexico.MethodsWe performed an ecological study using VR data ranging from 2000 to 2017, dependent on individual country data availability. We modeled HIV mortality using a Bayesian spatially explicit mixed-effects regression model that incorporates prior information on VR completeness. We calibrated our results to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.ResultsAll countries displayed over a 40-fold difference in HIV mortality between municipalities with the highest and lowest age-standardized HIV mortality rate in the last year of study for men, and over a 20-fold difference for women. Despite decreases in national HIV mortality in all countries-apart from Ecuador-across the period of study, we found broad variation in relative changes in HIV mortality at the municipality level and increasing relative inequality over time in all countries. In all six countries included in this analysis, 50% or more HIV deaths were concentrated in fewer than 10% of municipalities in the latest year of study. In addition, national age patterns reflected shifts in mortality to older age groups-the median age group among decedents ranged from 30 to 45years of age at the municipality level in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico in 2017.ConclusionsOur subnational estimates of HIV mortality revealed significant spatial variation and diverging local trends in HIV mortality over time and by age. This analysis provides a framework for incorporating data and uncertainty from incomplete VR systems and can help guide more geographically precise public health intervention to support HIV-related care and reduce HIV-related deaths.

In this process, the collision of fundamental rights emerges as a crucial challenge for decision-making. Policy Options and Implications: This policy review analyzes selected articles by the PubMed searcher about extreme measures taken in several countries during precedent pandemics and the current pandemic, and selects hard decisions relating to the exceptional measures taken by judicial departments in Brazil, connecting them to the "collision of fundamental rights and law principles." The collision of rights and principles imposed on decision makers a duty to provide balanced rights, and to adopt the enforcement of some rights prioritization. Ethical concerns were also verified in this field involving rights limitations. During a pandemic, the importance of extreme measures to protect health rights and healthcare systems is instrumental for focused, fast, and correct decision making to avoid loss of life and the collapse of healthcare systems. The main goals of this research are to discuss the implications and guidelines for public health decision making, the indispensable ethical and legal aspects for safeguarding health systems and the lives of people, and the respect of the Justice principle and of fundamental health and dignity rights. We conclude that COVID-19 justifies the prioritization of collective and individual health access rights. Acceptable standards of fundamental rights restrictions are established at the constitutional and international levels and must be enforced by rules and governmental action, to ensure fast and accurate decision making during a pandemic. Freedom rights exercises must be linked to solidarity for the realization of social welfare, for the health rights of all individuals and for health systems to function well during a pandemic. Actionable Recommendations: All individuals are free and equal, therefore social exclusion is prohibited. Institutions must consider social inequalities when discussing public health measures and be guided by ethical standards, by law principles, and rules recognized by constitutional and international law for the benefit of all during a health pandemic. Conclusions: Collective and individual health rights prevail over the collision of rights when facing pandemic occurrences, case by case, in health systems protection, based on the literature, on precedent pandemics and on legitimate Public Health efforts.

There is an uneven distribution of research productivity by region and country income group, where countries with the highest burden of non-communicable diseases attributable to physical inactivity having low research productivity. A first step towards improving global research capacity is to objectively quantify patterns, trends, and gaps in PA research. This study describes national, regional and global trends and patterns of PA research from 1950 to 2019.MethodsA systematic review using searches in PubMed, SCOPUS and ISI Web of Knowledge databases was conducted in August 2017 and updated between January and May 2020. The review was registered at the PROSPERO database number CRD42017070153. PA publications per 100,000 inhabitants per country was the main variable of interest. Descriptive and time-trend analyses were conducted in STATA version 16.0.ResultsThe search retrieved 555,468 articles of which 75,756 were duplicates, leaving 479,712 eligible articles. After reviewing inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23,860 were eligible for data extraction. Eighty-one percent of countries (n=176) had at least one PA publication. The overall worldwide publication rate in the PA field was 0.46 articles per 100,000 inhabitants. Europe had the highest rate (1.44 articles per 100,000 inhabitants) and South East Asia had the lowest (0.04 articles per 100,000 inhabitants). A more than a 50-fold difference in publications per 100,000 inhabitants was identified between high and low-income countries. The least productive and poorest regions have rates resembling previous decades of the most productive and the richest.ConclusionThis study showed an increasing number of publications over the last 60years with a growing number of disciplines and research methods over time. However, striking inequities were revealed and the knowledge gap across geographic regions and by country income groups was substantial over time. The need for regular global surveillance of PA research, particularly in countries with the largest data gaps is clear. A focus on the public health impact and global equity of research will be an important contribution to making the world more active.

Closing the Gender Gap in Global Surgery: Trends at the Academic Surgical Congress	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Global surgery; Gender equity; Health disparities; Bibliometrics	PHYSICIAN GENDER; SCHOLARLY PRODUCTIVITY; QUALITY; WOMEN	Introduction: Female researchers are underrepresented in academic surgery. While they are increasingly producing original research, they lag male researchers in productivity. This disparity is not well understood within the nascent field of global surgery. The following study examines gender parity in global surgery research presented at the Academic Surgical Congress and within subsequent publications. Methods: Abstracts presented at the Academic Surgical Congress (ASC) between 2015 and 2019 in "Global Surgery" sessions were reviewed to obtain title, the first author (FA) and senior author (SA). The authors were classified by gender. The Scopus database was queried by two reviewers for abstracts with corresponding publications, citations, and journal impact factors. Statistical analysis was conducted using chi-square analysis and t tests where appropriate. Results: Of a total of 6635 abstracts, 218 global surgery abstracts over a 5-year period were identified. Of these abstracts, 96 (44%) had female FAs, while 56 (26%) had female SAs. When comparing gender, female (44%) FAs and male (56%) FAs were equally represented. While SAs were significantly less likely to be female (26% versus 74%, P < 0.0001), female senior authorship increased significantly within the study period. Output with respect to publications, citations, and journal impact factors were equal by gender. Conclusions: This study presents 5 y of gender trends in global surgery scholarly work presented at the ASC. Despite an overall predominance of male senior authors, the paradigm is shifting with a recent trend to gender parity. Male and female authors have equal output and are equally impactful. Findings of gender equity in academic global surgery are encouraging, and further study of other disciplines are warranted. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Perspectives on the trends, challenges and benefits of green, smart and organic (GSO) foods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GASTRONOMY AND FOOD SCIENCE			English	Review						Green food; Smart food; Organic food; Sustainability; Health	WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES; CONSUMERS; AGRICULTURE	Rapid rate of industrialization has turned our planet around in favor of fast foods, food fraud, food terrorism, food waste, food adulteration, food poisoning, food contamination and food injustice, paving the path for green, smart and organic products. Green foods are grown and harvested in the absence of any form of environmental pollution or harmful conditions. Smart foods are termed to be good for the consumers, farmers and the planet. Organic foods are regarded as "credence goods" because some of the attributes that consumers may consider are neither obvious nor easily verified. Therefore, these three terms are interconnected as they forge a substantive common denominator healthfulness. The concepts of green, smart and organic (GSO) foods are herein recounted together with their interdependence and relationship to health and sustainability. The processes, policies and global trends of GSO foods were discussed, whilst not undermining the benefits and challenges associated with them.

J	Dejaeghere, J; Arur, AA				Dejaeghere, Joan; Arur, Aditi Ashok			EDUCATION FOR ALL: How Schooling Is Creating Social Changes for Lowered-Caste Girls in Rural India	GENDER & SOCIETY			English	Article						gender; education; comparative; crossnational; inequality; caste; girls		Arguments for the expansion of formal schooling have long focused on individual outcomes from schooling, including increasing income, reducing poverty, delaying marriage, and improving health, particularly for girls and women. For nearly three decades now, global education agendas have supported girls' education in an effort to achieve these outcomes. A large body of research analyzes girls' individual empowerment from schooling, but less attention is given to how schooling is creating change in families and communities, particularly for lowered-caste girls in India. This article places longitudinal data from a three-year qualitative interview study of schoolgirls in Rajasthan alongside qualitative life-history interviews of girls who completed secondary school in Uttarakhand to understand how schooling affects social changes for lower castes. The analysis, using an intersectional and relational approach, illustrates how girls' schooling shifts kin and caste relations connected to marriage and work but in ways that do not transform the stickiness of caste and gender norms. We argue that educational policies and programs must attend to the ways in which caste is implicated in achieving outcomes of delayed marriage and formal employment for lowered-caste girls in Indian communities if schooling is to create positive social change.

Objective: This study evaluates the association between children placed in out-of-home care and neighborhood-level factors using eight years of administrative data. Participants and setting: Between 2011-2018, 33,890 unique instances of child welfare involvement were captured in a department of child and family services database in a southern state in the United States. Methods: Removal addresses were geocoded and linked to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to obtain census tract socioeconomic factors. Incidence overall and stratified by individual and neighborhood-level factors was computed. Rate ratios, relative indexes of inequality, and concentration curves quantified disparities in incidence of child welfare involvement by neighborhood-level factors. Results: Incidence of children less than 19 years old placed into out-of-home care was 255 per 100,000 person-years (95 % CI: 252, 258). At the individual level, incidence was highest among children <5 and 15-17 years old, comparable between male and female children, and higher among Black children. At the neighborhood level, incidence was highest in census tracts with lower median household incomes, higher percentages of households below poverty or of female-headed or single-parent households, higher unemployment rates, and fewer residents with some college education or health insurance. Conclusions: Incidence of children placed into out-of-home care is disproportionally higher for those who live in disadvantaged communities. Understanding neighborhood-level risk factors that may be linked to child welfare involvement can help inform policy and target prevention efforts.

COVID-19 and Quality of Life: Twelve Reflections	APPLIED RESEARCH IN QUALITY OF LIFE			English	Article						COVID-19; Reflections; Quality of life; Well-being		COVID-19 has severely affected the world since December 2020. Because of its sudden onset and highly contagious nature, the world has responded in a "crisis management" manner. With effective vaccines almost available, it is appropriate at this time to have some reflections about COVID-19 in relation to the quality of life issues. In this paper, we highlight twelve issues for reflection, which can help us better prepared for future pandemics. These include: digital divide, health inequality, gender inequality, economic disadvantage, family well-being, impact on holistic well-being, economic development versus saving lives, consumption versus environmental protection, individual rights versus collective rights, international collaboration versus conflict, prevention of negative well-being, and promotion of positive well-being.

Nurses as agents of disruption: Operationalizing a framework to redress inequities in healthcare access among Indigenous Peoples	NURSING INQUIRY			English	Article						cultural safety; healthcare access; health equity; health services accessibility; Indigenous peoples; nursing; trauma&#8208; and violence&#8208; informed care	CULTURAL SAFETY; ABORIGINAL PEOPLE; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; EXPERIENCES; DISCOURSES; DETERMINANTS; KNOWLEDGE; SERVICES; BARRIERS; EQUITY	Health equity is a global concern. Although health equity extends far beyond the equitable distribution of healthcare, equitable access to healthcare is essential to the achievement of health equity. In Canada, Indigenous Peoples experience inequities in health and healthcare access. Cultural safety and trauma- and violence-informed care have been proposed as models of care to improve healthcare access, yet practitioners lack guidance on how to implement these models. In this paper, we build upon an existing framework of equity-oriented care for primary healthcare settings by proposing strategies to guide nurses in operationalizing cultural safety and trauma- and violence-informed care into nursing practice at the individual level. This component is one strategy to redress inequitable access to care among Indigenous Peoples in Canada. We conceptualize barriers to accessing healthcare as intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural. We then define three domains for nursing action: practicing reflexivity, prioritizing relationships, and considering the context. We have applied this expanded framework within the context of Indigenous Peoples in Canada as a way of illustrating specific concepts and focusing our argument; however, this framework is relevant to other groups experiencing marginalizing conditions and inequitable access to healthcare, and thus is applicable to many areas of nursing practice.

To meet this objective, we quantitatively analyzed the effect of the earthquake that occurred in Haiti in 2010 based on data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). To measure the impact of the 2010 earthquake we used the differences in differences (DID) technique. The estimation shows how the negative effects of the disaster differed across regions, increasing with the intensity of the earthquake's impact, and that this was significantly statistically related to the wealth of families, regardless of the gender of the head of the family. However, we also observed that these negative effects were further intensified when the head of the household was a woman, thus increasing the gap between the wealth of femaleand male-headed households. The conclusions drawn from this work reinforce the idea that natural disasters have a more negative impact on women and, specifically, on the economic possibilities of female-headed households, and show that, at least in Haiti, the enormous gender inequalities that existed prior to the earthquake do not diminish postdisaster, but are indeed exaggerated. These findings have important political implications that should not be ignored.

Methods: We used a counterfactual approach to estimate the years of life expectancy lost associated with 45 potentially modifiable county-level contextual characteristics in the United States in the year 2016. Contextual data and life expectancy data were obtained from the County Health Ranking Project and the U.S. Small-Area Life Expectancy Estimates Project, respectively. Results: Median census-tract-level life expectancy was 78.90 (interquartile range, 76.30-81.00) years, and the range across census tracts spanned 41.20 years. Large variations in life expectancy existed within and between states and within and between counties; the gap between counties was 20.30 years and gaps within counties ranged from 0 to 34.60 years. An array of 45 county-level factors was associated with 4.30 years of life expectancy loss. County-level adult smoking, food insecurity, adult obesity, physical inactivity, college education, and median household income were associated with 1.24-, 0.89-, 0.58-, 0.35-, 0.33-, and 0.14-year losses in life expectancy, respectively; and altogether were associated with a 3.53-year loss in life expectancy. The contribution of contextual factors to years of life expectancy lost varied among states and was more pronounced in states with lower life expectancy and in areas of increased socioeconomic deprivation and increased percentage of Black race. Conclusion: Substantial geographic variation in life expectancy was observed. Six county-level contextual factors were associated with a 3.53-year loss in life expectancy. The findings may inform and help prioritize approaches to reduce inequalities in life expectancy in the United States.

A large evidence base links coal with negative consequences for human health. Environmental assessments (EAs) are regulated in nearly every country to assess and set conditions for large industry projects, including coal mines, but tend to exclude health impacts. This study investigated the institutional dynamics surrounding the inclusion of health in coal mining EAs in New South Wales, Australia. Semi-structured interviews with varied stakeholders were supported by a review of legislation, relevant case law and media analysis. Using insights from theories on power and institutions the findings show how EA practice is influenced by the politicization of coal mining that excludes potentially negative narratives surrounding the known human health impacts of coal. Poor EA practice is compounded by legislative ambiguity and lack of conceptual understanding about assessing health. EA's legislative purpose of approving projects undermines confidence that a balanced assessment of impacts has been made. EA is seen as a pro-industry process that disempowers those with dissenting voices. The research explains how the institutional dynamics of a policy process like EA challenge its potential to meaningfully engage with the impact of coal mining on human health.

J	Unger, JP; Morales, I; De Paepe, P				Unger, Jean-Pierre; Morales, Ingrid; De Paepe, Pierre			Objectives, methods, and results in critical health systems and policy research: evaluating the healthcare market	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Health policy; Health systems research; Research methodology	DISEASE-CONTROL; COSTA-RICA; COLOMBIA; SERVICES; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; COUNTRIES; DISTRICT; ACCESS; WORLD	BackgroundSince the 1980s, markets have turned increasingly to intangible goods - healthcare, education, the arts, and justice. Over 40years, the authors investigated healthcare commoditisation to produce policy knowledge relevant to patients, physicians, health professionals, and taxpayers. This paper revisits their objectives, methods, and results to enlighten healthcare policy design and research.Main textThis paper meta-analyses the authors' research that evaluated the markets impact on healthcare and professional culture and investigated how they influenced patients' timely access to quality care and physicians' working conditions. Based on these findings, they explored the political economic of healthcare.In low-income countries the analysed research showed that, through loans and cooperation, multilateral agencies restricted the function of public services to disease control, with subsequent catastrophic reductions in access to care, health de-medicalisation, increased avoidable mortality, and failure to attain the narrow MDGs in Africa.The pro-market reforms enacted in middle-income countries entailed the purchaser-provider split, privatisation of healthcare pre-financing, and government contracting of health finance management to private insurance companies. To establish the materiality of a cause-and-effect relationship, the authors compared the efficiency of Latin American national health systems according to whether or not they were pro-market and complied with international policy standards.While pro-market health economists acknowledge that no market can offer equitable access to healthcare without effective regulation and control, the authors showed that both regulation and control were severely constrained in Asia by governance and medical secrecy issues.In high-income countries they questioned the interest for population health of healthcare insurance companies, whilst comparing access to care and health expenditures in the European Union vs. the U.S., the Netherlands, and Switzerland. They demonstrated that commoditising healthcare increases mortality and suffering amenable to care considerably and carries professional, cultural, and ethical risks for doctors and health professionals. Pro-market policies systems cause health systems inefficiency, inequity in access to care and strain professionals' ethics.ConclusionPolicy research methodologies benefit from being inductive, as health services and systems evaluations, and population health studies are prerequisites to challenge official discourse and to explore the historical, economic, sociocultural, and political determinants of public policies.

Methods We evaluated the odds of International Classification of Disease (ICD)-coded asthma diagnosis in Latino (English and Spanish preferring) and non-Hispanic white children, overall (N = 524,456) and among those presenting with possible asthma indicators (N = 85,516) over a 13-year period, using electronic health record data from a multi-state network of community health centers. Results Among those with possible asthma indicators, Spanish-preferring Latinos had lower adjusted odds of ICD-coded asthma diagnosis compared to non-Hispanic whites (OR = 0.87, 95%CI = 0.77-0.99); English-preferring Latinos did not differ from non-Hispanic whites. Differences in ICD-coded diagnosis between ethnicity/language groups varied by presenting symptom. Conclusions Spanish-preferring Latino children may be less-likely to have ICD-coded asthma documented in the EHR when presenting with certain clinical indicators suggestive of asthma. Clinicians should be cognizant of the need for the follow-up of these indicators in Spanish-preferring Latino children.

However, Peru has one of the highest rates of transmission and mortality worldwide. This article analyses what the pandemic has unveiled with regards to the health system, arguing that a focus on meeting global development targets, including by promoting public-private partnerships in health, has distracted attention from the underlying structural causes of inequalities and enabled the continuation of a highly fragmented system, with access determined by income, gender, ethnicity and geography.

J	Formosa, M; Scerri, C				Formosa, Marvin; Scerri, Charles			Punching Above its Weight: Current and Future Aging Policy in Malta	GERONTOLOGIST			English	Article						Dementia; Demography; Education and training; Gerontology; Public policy	KNOWLEDGE	Malta has been at the forefront in aging policy and healthy aging development. It was the first country to highlight the need of a United Nations-led international action plan aimed at meeting the needs of an emerging global aging population. Through a number of initiatives, Malta has managed to put aging as a top priority on its national policy agenda. The country boasts of the longest life span spent in good health among all European Union countries with its inhabitants expected to live a significant portion of their life free of disability. Malta's ranking in the Active Ageing Index experienced consistent improvements in the past decade, registering the sharpest progress in the European Union. In response to an increase in individuals with dementia, Malta was also among the first countries to adopt a national strategic policy for dementia. Notwithstanding such significant progress, Malta still lags behind in developing policy directions addressing gender inequalities and minority groups' interests among its older population. Similar to other Southern European countries, Malta's accelerated rate of population aging raises concerns with regard to economic growth, sustainability of effective health care and pension systems, and the well-being of older persons. Gender will also feature prominently in the future planning of long-term care policy as older women are projected to increase threefold in the foreseeable years with the high risk of poverty associated with older single and widowed women, implying that a few would be able to opt for private care.

Research Design and Methods: This article presents the findings of a two-phase scoping study of the international literature on precarity in later life. Phase I involved a review of definitions and understandings of precarity and aging. Phase II explored two emerging subthemes of disability and im/migration as related to aging and late life. Results: A total of 121 published studies were reviewed across Phase I and Phase II. Findings reveal that the definition of precarity is connected with insecurity, vulnerability, and labor and that particular social locations, trajectories, or conditions may heighten the risk of precarity in late life. Implications and Discussion: The article concludes by outlining the need for conceptual clarity, research on the unique multidimensional features of aging and precarity, the delineation of allied concepts and emerging applications, and the importance of linking research results with processes of theory building and the development of policy directives for change.

Developing A Definition Of Climate And Health Literacy	HEALTH AFFAIRS			English	Review							EDUCATION; POLLUTION; EXERCISE	A new generation of activists is calling for bold responses to the climate crisis. Although young people are motivated to act on climate issues, existing educational frameworks do not adequately prepare them by addressing the scope and complexity of the human health risks associated with climate change. We adapted the US government's climate literacy principles to propose a definition and corresponding set of elements for a concept we term climate and health literacy. We conducted a scoping review to assess how the peer-reviewed literature addresses these elements. Our analysis reveals a focus on training health professionals; more international than US domestic content; and limited information about data and models, fossil fuels, and equity. We propose developing a framework that builds on the elements to support a broader educational agenda that prepares students and future leaders to recognize the complex health ramifications of a changing climate.

To protect public health and stabilize incomes, governments have implemented massive fiscal stimulus packages. These fiscal supports are crucial, though there is concern that sustainable and resilient development will be sacrificed in the rush to preserve incomes and industries. The aim of the paper is to review whether the Japanese governments' responses in terms of financial stimulus considers longer term resilience and sustainability. This paper reviews pertinent academic literature and publicly available data from governments and organisations. The research is a rapid analysis of emerging information provided by the government of Japan and other international organisations. Using the case of Japan, this paper suggests that it is possible both to protect public health and essential services, while also promoting resilience and sustainability. Japan's integrated solutions show that pandemic response can include accelerated decarbonization and resilient, sustainable development. The paper also warns also that failure to act on longterm sustainability risks increased inequality, higher opportunity costs, cascading hazards, and further retreat from planetary thinking and globalism.

Diabetes progression is influenced by food behaviors, and diet control is a critical aspect in disease management. Food habits have many cultural and symbolic implications. Guidelines recommend that every patient should receive appropriate self-management education according to cultural and socioeconomic characteristics. This study aims to test whether a customized diet and transcultural mediator's support can improve immigrants' food habits. A pre-post quali-quantitative study was conducted among 20-79-year-old Bangladeshi and North African diabetic immigrants. The INMP transcultural mediator, an expert in the social and health care field, actively participates in clinical activity by decoding linguistic and cultural needs expressed by the foreigner patient. Five culturally tailored dietary profiles were designed according to international diabetes guidelines and adjusted to traditional food habits. Data were collected with two different semi-structured questionnaires. Changes in food consumption were assessed through McNemar's test, while paired Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to analyze pre and post intervention. Fifty-five patients were enrolled. At follow-up, cereals, meat, and potatoes intake significantly improved, and the number of adequate dietary habits for each patient increased significantly. Transcultural mediator support was 90% positively evaluated. Adherence to dietary control is favorably influenced by a transcultural intervention, which is based on clinical and socio-cultural criteria, in compliance with patient's lifestyles.

Many developed countries have implemented policies to encourage health care professionals to work in rural and remote communities. This scoping review is an international synthesis of those policies, examining their effectiveness at recruiting and retaining nursing, dental and allied health professionals in rural communities. Study design: Using scoping review methods, we included primary research - published between 1 September 2009 and 30 June 2020 - that reported an evaluation of existing policy initiatives to address workforce maldistribution in high income countries with a land mass greater than 100 000 km(2). Data sources: We searched MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Emcare, Informit, Scopus, and Web of Science. We screened 5169 articles for inclusion by title and abstract, of which we included 297 for full text screening. We then extracted data on 51 studies that had been conducted in Australia, the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Norway. Data synthesis: We grouped the studies based on World Health Organization recommendations on recruitment and retention of health care workers: education strategies (n = 27), regulatory change (n = 11), financial incentives (n = 6), personal and professional support (n = 4), and approaches with multiple components (n = 3). Conclusion: Considerable work has occurred to address workforce maldistribution at a local level, underpinned by good practice guidelines, but rarely at scale or with explicit links to coherent overarching policy. To achieve policy aspirations, multiple synergistic evidence-based initiatives are needed, and implementation must be accompanied by well designed longitudinal evaluations that assess the effectiveness of policy objectives.

This article argues that theories of intersectionality can help us to understand these issues and develops the concept of 'hidden healthcare populations' - using the case of people who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Plus (LGBT+) in Nigeria, in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings present original qualitative data from a seldom heard population group about instances of abuse, rejection and marginalisation by healthcare providers working in public and private healthcare facilities, and the attempts of LGBT+ people to resist and survive in that context. We extend theoretical understandings of intersectionality in global public health and explore how the concept relates to the social determinants of health. The article has significant implications for policy and healthcare education and responds to a call from the World Health Organisation to generate context-specific data to guide interventions targeted at minority population groups. Additionally, our discussion has wider significance because it highlights the Western-centric nature of much theory in health policy - and offers analysis and reinterpretation that incorporates queer, postcolonial, African perspectives.

Its main purpose is to analyze the way in which both, the right to health and property rights should fit there. In doing so, relevant jurisprudence, normative and pragmatic arguments are provided. Some of the measures and strategies proposed so far to foster cohabitation between both branches of international law are challenged in an attempt to demonstrate that none of them will effectively contribute to better protect the right to health. Likewise, it offers less explored solutions, such as engaging the World Health Organization and the International Court of Justice, and a shift in the onus of proof through the application of the Precautionary Principle.

The study aim was to explain attitudes justifying IPVAW identifying individual and societal risk factors. Design and setting A multilevel cross-sectional study of the World Values Survey (WVS) in 54 global countries. Participants A representative transnational community-based sample of 81 516 participants (47.8% male, 52.1% female), aged mean of 42.41. Measures Attitudes justifying IPVAW, sociodemographic, sexism, self-transcendence and conservation values were measured using questions from WVS. Country and regional gender inequality were assessed by Gender Inequality Index. Results Around 16% (intraclass correlation=0.16) of individual differences in attitudes justifying IPVAW are explained by countries. Statistically significant predictors at individual and country level were: sex (B=-0.24, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.22), age (B=-0.08 to -0.25, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03), marital status (B=0.09 to 0.23, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.33), educational level (B=-0.10 to -0.14, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04), self-transcendence values (B=-0.10, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.12), sexism (B=0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.28), country (B=2.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.26) and regional (B=2.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.42) gender inequality. Country gender inequality (B=-0.18, p=0.12) and regional gender inequality (B=-0.21, p=0.10) did not moderate the associations between self-transcendence values and attitudes justifying IPVAW. In the same way for sexism, data did not provide support for a moderating role of country gender inequality (B=0.22, p=0.26) and regional gender inequality (B=0.10, p=0.66). Conclusions Individual and country predictors accounted for differences in attitudes justifying IPVAW. However, neither gender inequality of country nor gender inequality of region interacted with sexism and self-transcendence values. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.

However, few empirical studies of accessibility involve comparisons between cities from countries with different levels of development, in particular, across the Global South and North. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by focusing on two very distinct, but similarly sized, large metropolitan regions: Sao Paulo and London, for which we develop comparative metrics. These metrics are used to identify patterns for different occupational groups (used as a proxy to socioeconomic groups) and discuss transit accessibility inequalities. The issues imposed by a comparative study of urban regions with particular characteristics are discussed. The study applies the results of one metropolitan region to contrast with the other and explore how characteristics of each region's public transport system and spatial mismatch between residential and workplace locations are related to inequalities. Group's condition was represented in the Lorenz curve, also revealing a new strategy to be adopted by comparability studies on inequalities. The results from Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient reveal larger transit accessibility inequalities in Sao Paulo than London. The proposed group representation enriched the comparability perspective as a tool to support transport planning.

However, time trends in the USA and Canada remain uncertain because the most recent analyses of PE-related mortality were published in the early 2000s. Methods For this retrospective epidemiological study, we accessed medically certified vital registration data from the WHO Mortality Database (USA and Canada, 2000-17) and the Multiple Cause of Death database produced by the Division of Vital Statistics of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; US, 2000-18). We investigated contemporary time trends in PE-related mortality in the USA and Canada and the prevalence of conditions contributing to PE-related mortality reported on the death certificates. We also estimated PE-related mortality by age group and sex. A subgroup analysis by race was performed for the USA. Findings In the USA, the age-standardised annual mortality rate (PE as the underlying cause) decreased from 6.0 deaths per 100 000 population (95% CI 5.9-6.1) in 2000 to 4.4 deaths per 100 000 population (4.3-4.5) in 2006. Thereafter, it continued to decrease to 4.1 deaths per 100 000 population (4.0-4.2) in women in 2017 and plateaued at 4.5 deaths per 100 000 population (4.4-4.7) in men in 2017. Among adults aged 25-64 years, it increased after 2006. The median age at death from PE decreased from 73 years to 68 years (2000-18). The prevalence of cancer, respiratory diseases, and infections as a contributing cause of PE-related death increased in all age categories from 2000 to 2018. The annual age-standardised PE-related mortality was consistently higher by up to 50% in Black individuals than in White individuals; these rates were approximately 50% higher in White individuals than in those of other races. In Canada, the annual age-standardised mortality rate from PE as the underlying cause of death decreased from 4.7 deaths per 100 000 population (4.4-5.0) in 2000 to 2.6 deaths per 100 000 population (2.4-2.8) in 2017; this decline slowed after 2006 across age groups and sexes. Interpretation After 2006, the initially decreasing PE-related mortality rates in North America progressively reached a plateau in Canada, while a rebound increase was observed among young and middle-aged adults in the USA. These findings parallel recent upward trends in mortality from other cardiovascular diseases and might reflect increasing inequalities in the exposure to risk factors and access to health care.

Best evidence is provided by systematic reviews (SRs). None of the published bibliometric analysis specifically assess the production of SRs on PH in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The aim of our study is to investigate publication patterns and time trends of SRs reporting PH in the MENA region to evaluate the state of PH research performance in the region.MethodThe study protocol was developed a priori (protocol registration number: CRD42017076736). PubMed was searched. Two independent reviewers screened 5747 identified articles. We investigated author affiliation and collaboration, yearly citations of the SRs and journal information. Joinpoint regression was used to explore these characteristics overtime.ResultsOur meta-research included 387 SRs published between 2008 and 2016 which reported data on PH in 20 MENA countries. Publication of SRs increased over time in journals with impact factor <4 and in the categories of yearly number of citations <50 (p values <= 0.0024). Authors belonging to the region published increasingly (p value = 0.0001) over time. Thirty percent of the SRs were from authors solely from the region, while an additional 30% were from the region collaborating with Western country authors. Of these collaborative reviews, 79% were led by authors from the region. However, collaboration in the region (with the exclusion of collaboration with Western country authors) was rare (0.8%). These authors from the region published more in open-access journals while authors from Western countries collaborating or not with authors from the region published more in hybrid or non-open-access journals (p value <0.0001). Collaboration between authors from MENA and Western countries led to published SRs in journals with impact factor >= 10. Systematic reviews with global coverage were published more by authors from Western countries, while SRs with country-level coverage were published by authors from the region (p value <0.0001).ConclusionThe incremental trend of PH SR publications on MENA likely reflects the ongoing improvement in research performance in the region. Authors from the region appear to be taking a lead role in conducting and disseminating MENA PH research. Open-access journals are a major contributor in facilitating MENA research dissemination.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO registration number CRD42017076736	[Chaabna, Karima; Cheema, Sohaila; Abraham, Amit; Mamtani, Ravinder] Weill Cornell Med Qatar, Inst Populat Hlth, Doha, Qatar; [Maisonneuve, Patrick] IEO European Inst Oncol IRCCS, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, Milan, Italy; [Lowenfels, Albert B.] New York Med Coll, Dept Surg, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA; [Chaabna, Karima; Lowenfels, Albert B.] New York Med Coll, Dept Family Med, Valhalla, NY 10595 USA	Qatar Foundation (QF); Weill Cornell Medical College Qatar; New York Medical College; New York Medical College	Chaabna, K (corresponding author), Weill Cornell Med Qatar, Inst Populat Hlth, Doha, Qatar.	kac2047@qatar-med.cornell.edu	Lowenfels, Albert/ABD-8388-2021; Chaabna, Karima/H-9986-2019; Maisonneuve, Patrick/U-9789-2018	Chaabna, Karima/0000-0002-1443-207X; Maisonneuve, Patrick/0000-0002-5309-4704					58	8	8	0	1	BMC	LONDON	CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND		2046-4053		SYST REV-LONDON	Syst.

The objective of this study was to document the experiences with providing telemedicine for maternal and newborn healthcare during the pandemic among healthcare professionals globally. Methods The second round of a global online survey of maternal and newborn health professionals was conducted, disseminated in 11 languages. Data were collected between 5 July and 10 September 2020. The questionnaire included questions regarding background, preparedness and response to COVID-19, and experiences with providing telemedicine. Descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis were used to analyse responses, disaggregated by country income level. Results Responses from 1060 maternal and newborn health professionals were analysed. Telemedicine was used by 58% of health professionals and two-fifths of them reported not receiving guidelines on the provision of telemedicine. Key telemedicine practices included online birth preparedness classes, antenatal and postnatal care by video/phone, a COVID-19 helpline and online psychosocial counselling. Challenges reported lack of infrastructure and technological literacy, limited monitoring, financial and language barriers, lack of non-verbal feedback and bonding, and distrust from patients. Telemedicine was considered as an important alternative to in-person consultations. However, health providers emphasised the lower quality of care and risk of increasing the already existing inequalities in access to healthcare. Conclusions Telemedicine has been applied globally to address disruptions of care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some crucial aspects of maternal and newborn healthcare seem difficult to deliver by telemedicine. More research regarding the effectiveness, efficacy and quality of telemedicine for maternal healthcare in different contexts is needed before considering long-term adaptations in provision of care away from face-to-face interactions. Clear guidelines for care provision and approaches to minimising socioeconomic and technological inequalities in access to care are urgently needed.

Neocolonial patterns in global health at large and recent opinion reports indicate that stakeholders from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) may be under-represented at such conferences. This study aims to describe the factors that impact LMIC representation at global health conferences. Methods A systematic review of articles reporting factors determining global health conference attendance was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Articles presenting conference demographics and data on the barriers and/or facilitators to attendance were included. Articles were screened at title and abstract level by four independent reviewers. Eligible articles were read in full text, analysed and evaluated with a risk of bias assessment. Results Among 8765 articles screened, 46 articles met inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis yielded two themes: 'barriers to conference attendance' and 'facilitators to conference attendance'. In total, 112 conferences with 254 601 attendees were described, of which 4% of the conferences were hosted in low-income countries. Of the 98 302 conference attendees, for whom affiliation was disclosed, 38 167 (39%) were from LMICs. Conclusion 'Conference inequity' is common in global health, with LMIC attendees under-represented at global health conferences. LMIC attendance is limited by systemic barriers including high travel costs, visa restrictions and lower acceptance rates for research presentations. This may be mitigated by relocating conferences to visa-friendly countries, providing travel scholarships and developing mentorship programmes to enable LMIC researchers to participate in global conferences.

Ramani			NHS 'Learning from Deaths' reports: a qualitative and quantitative document analysis of the first year of a countrywide patient safety programme	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						health & safety; health policy; organisational development; quality in health care; qualitative research	CARE	Objectives To review how National Health Service (NHS) Secondary Care Trusts (NSCTs) are using the Learning from Deaths (LfDs) programme to learn from and prevent, potentially preventable deaths. Introduction Potentially preventable deaths occur worldwide within healthcare organisations. In England, inconsistencies in how NSCTs reviewed, investigated and shared LfDs, resulted in the introduction of national guidance on 'LfDs' in 2017. This guidance provides a 'framework for identifying, reporting, investigating and LfDs'. Amendments to NHS Quality Account regulations, legally require NSCTs in England to report quantitative and qualitative information relating to patient deaths annually. The programme intended NSCTs would share this learning and take measurable action to prevent future deaths. Method We undertook qualitative and quantitative secondary data, document analysis of all NSCTs LfDs reports within their 2017/2018 Quality Accounts (n=222). Results All statutory elements of LfDs reporting were reported by 98 out of 222 (44%) NSCTs. The percentage of deaths judged more likely than not due to problems in healthcare was between 0% and 13%. The majority of NSCTs (89%) reported lessons learnt; the most common learning theme was poor communication. 106 out of 222 NSCTs (48%) have shared or plan to share the learning within their own organisation. The majority of NSCTs (86%) reported actions taken and 47% discussed or had a plan for assessment of impact. 37 out of 222 NSCTs (17%) mentioned involvement of bereaved families. Conclusions The wide variation in reporting demonstrates that some NSCTs have engaged fully with LfDs, while other NSCTs appear to have disengaged with the programme. This may reveal a disparity in organisational learning and patient safety culture which could result in inequity for bereaved families. Many themes identified from the LfDs reports have previously been identified by national and international reports and inquiries.	[Brummell, Zoe; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia; Moonesinghe, S.

J	Watkins, JA; Griffiths, F; Goudge, J				Watkins, Jocelyn Anstey; Griffiths, Frances; Goudge, Jane			Community health workers' efforts to build health system trust in marginalised communities: a qualitative study from South Africa	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						qualitative research; public health; primary care; international health services	CARE	IntroductionCommunity health workers (CHWs) enable marginalised communities, often experiencing structural poverty, to access healthcare. Trust, important in all patient-provider relationships, is difficult to build in such communities, particularly when stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and now COVID-19, is widespread. CHWs, responsible for bringing people back into care, must repair trust. In South Africa, where a national CHW programme is being rolled out, marginalised communities have high levels of unemployment, domestic violence and injury.ObjectivesIn this complex social environment, we explored CHW workplace trust, interpersonal trust between the patient and CHW, and the institutional trust patients place in the health system.Design, participants, settingWithin the observation phase of a 3-year intervention study, we conducted interviews, focus groups and observations with patients, CHWs, their supervisors and, facility managers in Sedibeng.ResultsCHWs had low levels of workplace trust. They had recently been on strike demanding better pay, employment conditions and recognition of their work. They did not have the equipment to perform their work safely, and some colleagues did not trust, or value, their contribution. There was considerable interpersonal trust between CHWs and patients, however, CHWs' efforts were hampered by structural poverty, alcohol abuse and no identification documents among long-term migrants. Those supervisors who understood the extent of the poverty supported CHW efforts to help the community. When patients had withdrawn from care, often due to nurses' insensitive behaviour, the CHWs' attempts to repair patients' institutional trust often failed due to the vulnerabilities of the community, and lack of support from the health system.ConclusionStrategies are needed to build workplace trust including supportive supervision for CHWs and better working conditions, and to build interpersonal and institutional trust by ensuring sensitivity to social inequalities and the effects of structural poverty among healthcare providers. Societies need to care for everyone.

Rigorous evidence on the eGectiveness of these strategies in improving health care and health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is lacking; this is an update of the 2012 review on this topic. Objectives To assess the effects of paying for performance on the provision of health care and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and 10 other databases between April and June 2018. We also searched two trial registries, websites, online resources of international agencies, organizations and universities, and contacted experts in the field. Studies identified from rerunning searches in 2020 are under 'Studies awaiting classification.' Selection criteria We included randomized or non-randomized trials, controlled before-aLer studies, or interrupted time series studies conducted in LMICs (as defined by the World Bank in 2018). P4P refers to the transfer of money or material goods conditional on taking a measurable action or achieving a predetermined performance target. To be included, a study had to report at least one of the following outcomes: patient health outcomes, changes in targeted measures of provider performance (such as the delivery of healthcare services), unintended effects, or changes in resource use. Data collection and analysis We extracted data as per original review protocol and narratively synthesised findings. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Given diversity and variability in intervention types, patient populations, analyses and outcome reporting, we deemed meta-analysis inappropriate. We noted the range of effects associated with P4P against each outcome of interest. Based on intervention descriptions provided in documents, we classified design schemes and explored variation in eGect by scheme design. Main results We included 59 studies: controlled before-aLer studies (19), non-randomized (16) or cluster randomized trials (14); and interrupted timeseries studies (9). One study included both an interrupted time series and a controlled before-aLer study. Studies focused on a wide range of P4P interventions, including target payments and payment for outputs as modified by quality (or quality and equity assessments). Only one study assessed results-based aid. Many schemes were funded by national governments (23 studies) with the World Bank funding most externally funded schemes (11 studies). Targeted services varied; however, most interventions focused on reproductive, maternal and child health indicators. Participants were predominantly located in public or in a mix of public, nongovernmental and faith-based facilities (54 studies). P4P was assessed predominantly at health facility level, though districts and other levels were also involved. Most studies assessed the effects of P4P against a status quo control (49 studies); however, some studies assessed effects against comparator interventions (predominantly enhanced financing intended to match P4P funds (17 studies)). Four studies reported intervention effects against both comparator and status quo. Controlled before-aLer studies were at higher risk of bias than other study designs. However, some randomised trials were also downgraded due to risk of bias. The interrupted time-series studies provided insuGicient information on other concurrent changes in the study context. P4P compared to a status quo control For health services that are specifically targeted, P4P may slightly improve health outcomes (low certainty evidence), but few studies assessed this. P4P may also improve service quality overall (low certainty evidence); and probably increases the availability of health workers, medicines and well-functioning infrastructure and equipment (moderate certainty evidence). P4P may have mixed effects on the delivery and use of services (low certainty evidence) and may have few or no distorting unintended effects on outcomes that were not targeted (low-certainty evidence), but few studies assessed these. For secondary outcomes, P4P may make little or no diGerence to provider absenteeism, motivation or satisfaction (low certainty evidence); but may improve patient satisfaction and acceptability (low certainty evidence); and may positively aGect facility managerial autonomy (low certainty evidence). P4P probably makes little to no diGerence to management quality or facility governance (low certainty evidence). Impacts on equity were mixed (low certainty evidence). For health services that are untargeted, P4P probably improves some health outcomes (moderate certainty evidence); may improve the delivery, use and quality of some health services but may make little or no diGerence to others (low certainty evidence); and may have few or no distorting unintended effects (low certainty evidence). The effects of P4P on the availability of medicines and other resources are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). P4P compared to other strategies For health outcomes and services that are specifically targeted, P4P may make little or no diGerence to health outcomes (low certainty evidence), but few studies assessed this. P4P may improve service quality (low certainty evidence); and may have mixed effects on the delivery and use of health services and on the availability of equipment and medicines (low certainty evidence). For health outcomes and services that are untargeted, P4P may make little or no diGerence to health outcomes and to the delivery and use of health services (low certainty evidence). The effects of P4P on service quality, resource availability and unintended effects are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Findings of subgroup analyses Results-based aid, and schemes using payment per output adjusted for service quality, appeared to yield the greatest positive effects on outcomes. However, only one study evaluated results-based aid, so the effects may be spurious. Overall, schemes adjusting both for quality of service and rewarding equitable delivery of services appeared to perform best in relation to service utilization outcomes. Authors' conclusions The evidence base on the impacts of P4P schemes has grown considerably, with study quality gradually increasing. P4P schemes may have mixed effects on outcomes of interest, and there is high heterogeneity in the types of schemes implemented and evaluations conducted. P4P is not a uniform intervention, but rather a range of approaches. Its effects depend on the interaction of several variables, including the design of the intervention (e.g., who receives payments), the amount of additional funding, ancillary components (such as technical support) and contextual factors (including organizational context).

While developed nations have made significant improvement in providing adequate quality water and sanitation devoid of virus contaminations to a significant percentage of the residences, many of the developing countries are still lacking in these regards, leading to many death cases among the vulnerable due to ingestion of virus-contaminated water and other waterborne pathogens. However, the recent global pandemic of COVID-19 seems to have changed the paradigm by reawakening the importance of water quality and sanitation, and focusing more attention on the pervasive effect of the use of virus-contaminated water as it can be a potential driver for the spread of the virus and other waterborne diseases, especially in developing nations that are characterized by low socioeconomic development. Therefore, this review assessed the socioeconomic inequalities related to the usage of virus-contaminated water and other waterborne pathogens in developing countries. The socioeconomic factors attributed to the various waterborne diseases due to the use of virus-contaminated water in many developing countries are poverty, the standard of living, access to health care facilities, age, gender, and level of education. Some mitigation strategies to address the viral contamination of water sources are therefore proposed, while future scope and recommendations on tackling the essential issues related to socioeconomic inequality in developing nations are highlighted.

Many alternatives are suggested to address these urgent issues. Some of them are quite interesting, but with little practical application in the short or medium term. To realistically control infectious diseases, human, animal, and environmental factors need to be considered together, based on the One Health perspective. In this article, we highlight the most effective initiatives for the control and prevention of infectious diseases: vaccination; environmental sanitation; vector control; social programs that encourage a reduction in the population growth; control of urbanization; safe sex stimulation; testing; treatment of sexually and vertically transmitted infections; promotion of personal hygiene practices; food safety and proper nutrition; reduction of the human contact with wildlife and livestock; reduction of social inequalities; infectious disease surveillance; and biodiversity preservation. Subsequently, this article highlights the impacts of human genetics on susceptibility to infections and disease progression, using the SARS-CoV-2 infection as a study model. Finally, actions focused on mitigation of outbreaks and epidemics and the importance of conservation of ecosystems and translational ecology as public health strategies are also discussed.

One of the cornerstones of a physically active lifestyle is Motor Competence (MC). MC is a complex biocultural attribute and therefore, its study requires a multi-sectoral, multi-, inter- and transdisciplinary approach. MC is a growing area of research, especially in children and adolescents due to its positive association with a plethora of health and developmental outcomes. Many questions, however, remain to be answered in this field of research, with regard to: (i) Health and Developmental-related Associations of MC; (ii) Assessment of MC; (iii) Prevalence and Trends of MC; (iv) Correlates and Determinants of MC; (v) MC Interventions, and (vi) Translating MC Research into Practice and Policy. This paper presents a narrative review of the literature, summarizing current knowledge, identifying key research gaps and presenting questions for future investigation on MC in children and adolescents. This is a collaborative effort from the International Motor Competence Network (IMCNetwork) a network of academics and researchers aiming to promote international collaborative research and knowledge translation in the expansive field of MC. The knowledge and deliverables generated by addressing and answering the aforementioned research questions on MC presented in this review have the potential to shape the ways in which researchers and practitioners promote MC and physical activity in children and adolescents across the world.

Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated with seroprevalence. Results: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies. Conclusion: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Fatty liver disease associated with metabolic dysfunction is of specific concern in the ALEH region, where its prevalence is one of the highest globally, second only to the Middle East. A recent consensus from an international panel recommended a new definition of fatty liver disease associated with metabolic dysfunction, including a shift in name from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and adoption of a set of positive criteria to diagnose the disease, independent of alcohol intake or other liver diseases. Given, the importance of this proposal, ALEH invited leading members of regional nations to come to a consensus on it from a local perspective. We reached a consensus to endorse the proposal that the disease should be renamed as MAFLD and that the disease should be diagnosed by the proposed simple and easily applicable criteria. We expect that this change in nosology will result in improvements in disease awareness and in advances in scientific, economic, public health, political, and regulatory aspects of the disease.

Digital medicine is purported to enhance patient access to care while promising cost savings. Using institutional ethnography, we examined the potential for publicly funded digital testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) in Ontario, Canada. Our analyses draw from 23 stakeholder interviews with healthcare professionals conducted between 2019 and 2020, and textual analyses of government documents and private, for-profit digital healthcare websites. We uncovered a "two-tiered" system whereby private digital STI testing services enable people with economic resources to "pay to skip the line" queuing at public clinics and proceed directly to provide samples for diagnostics at local private medical labs. In Ontario, private lab corporations compete for fee-for-service contracts with government, which in turn organises opportunities for market growth when more patient samples are collected vis-a-vis digital testing. However, we also found that some infectious disease specimens (e.g., HIV) are re-routed for analysis at government public health laboratories, who may be unable to manage the increase in testing volume associated with digital STI testing due to state budget constraints. Our findings on public-private laboratory funding disparities thus discredit the claims that digital healthcare necessarily generates cost savings, or that it enhances patients' access to care. We conclude that divergent state funding relations together with the creeping privatisation of healthcare within this "universal" system coordinate the conditions through which private corporations capitalise from digital STI testing, compounding patient access inequities. We also stress that our findings bring forth large scale implications given the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid diffusion of digital healthcare, together with significant novel coronavirus testing activities initiated by private industry.

J	Mbali, M				Mbali, Mandisa			From AIDS to cancer: health activism, biotechnology and intellectual property in South Africa	SOCIAL DYNAMICS-A JOURNAL OF AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						Cancer activism; AIDS activism; biotechnology; intellectual property	BREAST-CANCER; BIOSIMILARS; TRASTUZUMAB	This article describes the evolution of access-to-medicines advocacy in South Africa from AIDS to cancer activism in a biotechnology era. It discusses the ways in which cancer-focused access-tomedicines activists have advocated for intellectual policy reform to enable the universal provision of cheaper biosimilar versions of trastuzumab, a highly effective treatment. Its central argument is that this cancer-focused access-to-medicines activism must be contextualised in relation to the history of AIDS advocacy on intellectual property and access to essential drugs. Firstly, as with the AIDS activism of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) for access to anti-retroviral drugs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, contemporary cancer-focused activism has been led by individual patients affected by the excessive prices of essential medicines. Secondly, both can be characterised as having been effectively integrated into transnational access-to-medicines advocacy networks. Thirdly, both types of activism have involved the popularisation of the science around different drugs. The transnational access-to-medicines movement has demonstrated how activists based in the global North and the global South can impactfully collaborate to achieve wider treatment access. We can, therefore, read contemporary transnational access-tomedicines activism as key in pressing for both the right to enjoy the benefits of science and global health justice.

Asylum seekers and refugees are generally vulnerable to violence and may be particularly vulnerable to IPV. The aim of this study is to identify factors associated with IPV perpetration and victimization in asylum seeking and refugee populations through a systematic review of the literature. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Global Health, PsycINFO, Westlaw, and Social Science Research Network databases were searched. Quantitative studies were included according to a population, exposure, outcome framework. Studies were critically appraised with the Joanna Briggs Institute's System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information tool and quality assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity. A complex multitude of factors associated with IPV perpetration and victimization in asylum seeking and refugee populations was found. Narrative synthesis of 23 studies showed an inverse association between both perpetrator and victim education level and IPV. Relationship factors, legal status, and age were also important factors associated with IPV. The majority of studies had a cross-sectional design. Heterogeneity in definitions of IPV, sample, methods, statistical procedures, and outcomes was reported. Low education level is a consistent modifiable factor associated with IPV in asylum seeking and refugee populations. This work points to a testable intervention that stakeholders could trial to address the unjust and unhealthy problem of IPV. More and better quality research using standardized definitions, longitudinal design, and sensitive tools is needed in this area.

This narrative review aimed to identify and document common themes and indicators across large-scale social accountability frameworks to facilitate development of initial operational constructs to evaluate social accountability in medical education. Method The authors searched 5 electronic databases and platforms and the World Wide Web to identify social accountability frameworks applicable to medical education, with a focus on medical schools. English-language, peer-reviewed documents published between 1990 and March 2019 were eligible for inclusion. Primary source social accountability frameworks that represented foundational values, principles, and parameters and were cited in subsequent papers to conceptualize social accountability were included in the analysis. Thematic synthesis was used to describe common elements across included frameworks. Descriptive themes were characterized using the context-input-process-product (CIPP) evaluation model as an organizational framework. Results From the initial sample of 33 documents, 4 key social accountability frameworks were selected and analyzed. Six themes (with subthemes) emerged across frameworks, including shared values (core social values of relevance, quality, effectiveness, and equity; professionalism; academic freedom and clinical autonomy) and 5 indicators related to the CIPP model: context (mission statements, community partnerships, active contributions to health care policy); inputs (diversity/ equity in recruitment/selection, community population health profiles); processes (curricular activities, community-based clinical training opportunities/learning exposures); products (physician resource planning, quality assurance, program evaluation and accreditation); and impacts (overall improvement in community health outcomes, reduction/prevention of health risks, morbidity/mortality of community diseases). Conclusions As more emphasis is placed on social accountability of medical schools, it is imperative to shift focus from educational inputs and processes to educational products and impacts. A way to begin to establish links between inputs, products, and impacts is by using the CIPP evaluation model.

J	Jones, R; Macmillan, A; Reid, P				Jones, Rhys; Macmillan, Alexandra; Reid, Papaarangi			Climate Change Mitigation Policies and Co-Impacts on Indigenous Health: A Scoping Review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						climate change; climate policy; environmental justice; Indigenous health; equity	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; GLOBAL HEALTH; AIR-QUALITY; EQUITY; BENEFITS; COMMUNITIES; ADAPTATION; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; INSIGHTS	Climate change mitigation policies can either facilitate or hinder progress towards health equity, and can have particular implications for Indigenous health. We sought to summarize current knowledge about the potential impacts (co-benefits and co-harms) of climate mitigation policies and interventions on Indigenous health. Using a Kaupapa Maori theoretical positioning, we adapted a validated search strategy to identify studies for this scoping review. Our review included empirical and modeling studies that examined a range of climate change mitigation measures, with health-related outcomes analyzed by ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Data were extracted from published reports and summarized. We identified 36 studies that examined a diverse set of policy instruments, with the majority located in high-income countries. Most studies employed conventional Western research methodologies, and few examined potential impacts of particular relevance to Indigenous peoples. The existing body of knowledge is limited in the extent to which it can provide definitive evidence about co-benefits and co-harms for Indigenous health, with impacts highly dependent on individual policy characteristics and contextual factors. Improving the quality of evidence will require research partnerships with Indigenous communities and study designs that centralize Indigenous knowledges, values, realities and priorities.

J	Callway, R; Pineo, H; Moore, G				Callway, Rosalie; Pineo, Helen; Moore, Gemma			Understanding the Role of Standards in the Negotiation of a Healthy Built Environment	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						health; wellbeing; standards; built environment; negotiation; urban sustainability; implementation		A growing number of international standards promote Healthy Built Environment (HBE) principles which aim to enhance occupant and user health and wellbeing. Few studies examine the implementation of these standards; whether and how they affect health through changes to built-environment design, construction, and operations. This study reviews a set of sustainability and HBE standards, based on a qualitative analysis of standard documents, standard and socio-technical literature on normalization and negotiation, and interviews with 31 practitioners from four geographical regions. The analysis indicates that standards can impact individual, organizational, and market-scale definitions of an HBE. Some changes to practice are identified, such as procurement and internal layout decisions. There is more limited evidence of changes to dominant, short-term decision-making practices related to cost control and user engagement in operational decisions. HBE standards risk establishing narrow definitions of health and wellbeing focused on building occupants rather than promoting broader, contextually situated, principles of equity, inclusion, and ecosystem functioning crucial for health. There is a need to improve sustainability and HBE standards to take better account of local contexts and promote systems thinking. Further examination of dominant collective negotiation processes is required to identify opportunities to better embed standards within organizational practice.

The aim of this study was to identify the spatial patterns and determinants of perinatal mortality in the country using a national representative 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. Methods The analysis was completed utilizing data from 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. This data captured the information of 5 years preceding the survey period. A total of 7230 women who at delivered at seven or more months gestational age nested within 622 enumeration areas (EAs) were used. Statistical analysis was performed by using STATA version 14.1, by considering the hierarchical nature of the data. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to identify community and individual-level factors associated with perinatal mortality. ArcGIS version 10.1 was used for spatial analysis. Moran's, I statistics fitted to identify global autocorrelation and local autocorrelation was identified using SatSCan version 9.6. Results The spatial distribution of perinatal mortality in Ethiopia revealed a clustering pattern. The global Moran's I value was 0.047 with p-value <0.001. Perinatal mortality was positively associated with the maternal age, being from rural residence, history of terminating a pregnancy, and place of delivery, while negatively associated with partners' educational level, higher wealth index, longer birth interval, female being head of household and the number of antenatal care (ANC) follow up. Conclusions In Ethiopia, the perinatal mortality is high and had spatial variations across the country. Strengthening partner's education, family planning for longer birth interval, ANC, and delivery services are essential to reduce perinatal mortality and achieve sustainable development goals in Ethiopia. Disparities in perinatal mortality rates should be addressed alongside efforts to address inequities in maternal and neonatal healthcare services all over the country.

J	Frank, JW; Matsunaga, E				Frank, John W.; Matsunaga, Etsuko			National monitoring systems for health inequalities by socioeconomic status - an OECD snapshot	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article								We assess the extent and quality of High-Income Countries' (HIC) practices in monitoring Socioeconomic Inequalities in Health (SIH) through routine data collection/collation and analysis systems. Official websites of government authorities of eligible countries were examined for any reports containing data on SIH, which were assessed for quality from an epidemiological perspective, using published guidelines for monitoring of socioeconomic inequalities in health status.Despite the global commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 10, and recommendations of the WHO 2008 Commission of Social Determinants of Health, most of the thirty-six HIC whose websites were searched appear not to be routinely monitoring SIHs. Only seven HIC websites were found to have SIH monitoring reports that were readily discoverable on their official websites. Only two countries (England and Scotland) have been publishing such trends in detail for more than a half-decade. Although an SIH monitoring system is not itself a sufficient condition for reducing SIH, it is likely a necessary one. For countries that are planning to establish a system, lessons from others who have established such systems include the value of routinely and automatically post-coding of major health outcomes, with robust assignment of average socio-economic status to each local area.

Objectives: This study's objective was to analyze recent trends in gender equity and identify historical and contextual factors that contributed to changes in gender equity in three countries: China, Nepal, and Nicaragua. Methods: To assess gender equity trends, we used the Gender Gap Index (GGI) from the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report (2006-2017). The GGI incorporated data on economic participation, educational attainment, health, and political empowerment for almost 150 countries. We selected China, Nepal, and Nicaragua because of their major changes in GGI and diversity in geographical location and economic status. We reviewed major social, economic, and political events during 2006-2017, and identified key events in each country. We compared countries' GGI with matched controls average using interrupted time-series analysis. Results: Nepal and Nicaragua both had dramatic increases in GGI (improvement in equity), Nepal (beta = 0.029; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.056) and Nicaragua (beta = 0.035; 95% CI: 0.005, 0.065). This was strongly influenced by political empowerment, which likely impacted access to education and employment opportunities. Despite major economic growth and new policies to address gender inequities (e.g. the One-Child Policy), China saw a significant decline in GGI between 2010 and 2017 (beta = -0.014; 95% CI: -0.024, -0.004), largely resulting from decreased gender equity in educational attainment, economic participation, and health/survival sub-indices. Conclusions: Key social, economic, and political events helped explain trends in countries' gender equity. Our study suggested that supportive social and political environments would play important roles in empowering women, which would advance human rights and promote health and well-being of individuals, households, communities, and countries.

Despite the recognition of gender in the global health agenda, limited evidence exists about the integration of gender considerations in interventions, including social marketing interventions, for the prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases. Social marketing is an ethical approach to behavior change aiming to benefit individuals, communities, and society. Since behaviors are gendered and affect disease transmission and healthcare patterns, one would expect social marketing interventions to be gender responsive. Objective: This study aims to understand the extent to which social marketing interventions focusing on neglected tropical diseases are gender responsive. Methods: This study uses data from social marketing interventions collected in a systematic review, this study examined 20 interventions addressing eight neglected tropical diseases in 13 countries. A modified version of the World Health Organization Gender Assessment Tool (GAT) was used to determine the gender responsiveness of the interventions, which was complemented by coding for intersectional sex and gender data. These results are presented in 12 themes. Results: One schistosomiasis intervention implemented in China was assessed as gender responsive. It was not possible to answer many questions from the GAT due to limited data reported in the publications describing the interventions. Despite this, strengths and limitations were found in all the interventions in relation to the use of sex and gender concepts, the disaggregation of data, the consideration of environmental factors, and the involvement of women or men in the different stages of the interventions. Conclusions: Many interventions showed positive actions towards gender responsiveness. However, only one was classified as gender responsive. Others failed to supply enough data for assessment. Recommendations about how sex and gender could be integrated into social marketing interventions are provided.	[Pastrana, Nathaly Aya; Suggs, L.

Interest in the global dimensions of oral health, a generally neglected area of global health, is growing; yet, no previously published research has defined the term 'global oral health.' As such, the Global Oral Health Interest Group of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health determined a need for an introductory definition of 'global oral health' to guide program planning, implementation, and evaluation. With the oversight of an expert senior Task Force for the Definition of Global Oral Health, we employed a mixed-methods approach using the more common expert consensus-building Delphi technique combined with the lesser utilized Q methodology. This approach allowed us to identify the interconnectedness of global oral health themes and integrate multiple, seemingly disparate, topics into a single streamlined concept. Our resulting definition is as follows:Global Oral Health aims for optimal oral health for all people and elimination of global health inequities through health promotion, disease prevention, and appropriate oral care approaches that consider common determinants and solutions and acknowledge oral health as part of overall health. The purpose of this short communication is to generate a narrative around our proposed definition of global oral health to support establishing guidelines and developing best practices for academic global oral health programs, policies, and practices that aim to achieve a goal of oral health globally.

A cross-sectional study	GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						SAGE; access; health care use; older people; community health fund; rural; Tanzania	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; SOUTH-AFRICA; GHANA; ACCESS; IMPACT; COUNTRIES; BENEFITS; SCHEMES; EQUITY; OLDER	Background: Health care systems in developing countries such as Tanzania depend heavily on out-of-pocket payments. This mechanism contributes to inefficiency, inequity and cost, and is a barrier to patients seeking access to care. There are efforts to expand health insurance coverage to vulnerable groups, including older adults, in Sub-Saharan African countries. Objective: To analyse the association between health insurance and health service use in rural residents aged 60 and above in Tanzania. Methods: Data were obtained from a household survey conducted in the Nzega and Igunga districts. A standardised survey instrument from the World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health was used. This comprised of questions regarding demographic and socio-economic characteristics, health and insurance status, health seeking behaviours, sickness history (three months and one year prior to the survey), and the receipt of health care. A multistage sampling method was used to select wards, villages and respondents in each district. Local ward and hamlet officers guided the researchers in identifying households with older people. Crude and adjusted logistic regression methods were used to explore associations between health insurance and outpatient and inpatient health care use. Results: The study sample comprised 1,899 people aged 60 and above of whom 44% reported having health insurance. A positive statistically significant association between health insurance and the utilisation of outpatient and inpatient care was observed in all models. The odds of using outpatient (adjusted OR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.54, 3.14) and inpatient services (adjusted OR = 3.20; 95% CI: 2.46, 4.15) were higher among the insured. Conclusion: Health insurance is a predictor of outpatient and inpatient health services in people aged 60 and above in rural Tanzania. Further research is needed to understand the perceptions of both the insured and uninsured regarding the quality of care received.

Using activity theory, the authors examine the educational response to this global health crisis in the United States and the United Kingdom. Data are drawn from three to four key news media publications in each country between 1 February and 31 May 2020. The authors critically examine the tensions and contradictions within and between interrelated systems (schooling, educational policy, home learning). They consider how remote digital pedagogy was perceived and enacted by different stakeholders: teachers, parents, policymakers. Tensions arose between digital pedagogy, system rules and teachers' digital skills, leading to different experiences for students. The division of labour shifted; parental responsibility for managing their children's learning increased.

Impact of Sources of Strengths on Coping and Safety of Immigrant Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence	AFFILIA-FEMINIST INQUIRY IN SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						coping; economic justice; immigrant; intimate partner violence; mezzo; research categories; safety; social work practice; social work; social welfare history and philosophy; strengths	HELP-SEEKING; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; WOMEN SURVIVORS; ACCULTURATION; LATINA; HEALTH; GENDER; RISK; PERCEPTIONS; PERSPECTIVE	Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a national and international public health and human rights concern. Immigrant women are disproportionately affected by IPV that includes homicides. This study explored the perspectives of survivors of IPV, who are immigrants to the United States, regarding their sources of strength that enhance their safety and promote coping in abusive relationships. Data for this qualitative study were collected from ethnically diverse immigrant women residing in Massachusetts, Arizona, Virginia, Washington, D.C., New York, Minnesota, and California, using purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Eighty-three in-depth interviews were conducted with adult immigrant survivors of IPV who self-identified as Asian (n = 30), Latina (n = 30), and African (n = 23). Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Women identified both external (e.g., community support, support from social service agencies) and internal (e.g., optimism, faith, beliefs) sources of strength. The study highlights how these sources can adequately address needs of survivors and offers areas for improvement in services for survivors. The findings are informative for practitioners serving immigrant survivors of IPV in legal, social service, and physical and mental health settings.

But few studies examine how neoliberalism specifically impacts health inequalities involving highly vulnerable populations, such as Indigenous groups. Even fewer take this perspective from an oral health viewpoint. From a lens of indigenous groups in five countries (the United States, Canada, Australia, Aotearoa/New Zealand and Norway), this commentary provides critical insights of how neoliberalism, in domains including colonialism, racism, inter-generational trauma and health service provision, shapes oral health inequalities among Indigenous societies at a global level. We posit that all socially marginalised groups are disadvantaged under neoliberalism agendas, but that this is amplified among Indigenous groups because of ongoing legacies of colonialism, institutional racism and intergenerational trauma.

The objective of this systematic scoping review is to synthesize information from the published literature on the methods/approaches, findings, and scope for research and interventions on the retail food sector servicing Indigenous Peoples in high-income countries. A structured literature search in two major international databases yielded 139 relevant peer-reviewed articles from nine countries. Most research was conducted in Oceania and North America, and in rural and remote regions. Several convergent issues were identified across global regions including limited grocery store availability/access, heightened exposure to unhealthy food environments, inadequate market food supplies (i.e., high prices, limited availability, and poor quality), and common underlying structural factors including socio-economic inequality and colonialism. A list of actions that can modify the nature and structure of retailing systems to enhance the availability, accessibility, and quality of healthful foods is identified. While continuing to (re)align research with community priorities, international collaboration may foster enhanced opportunities to strengthen the evidence base for policy and practice and contribute to the amelioration of diet quality and health at the population level.

However, while public health recommendations were broadly universal, human capacity to accordingly transform everyday life has differed significantly. We use the example of South Africa to highlight the privileged nature of the ability to transform one's life in response to COVID-19, arguing that the virus both highlights and exacerbates existing inequalities in access to infrastructure. For those living in urban poverty in South Africa, where access to basic infrastructure is limited, and where overcrowding and high density are the norm, it is frequently impossible to transform daily life in the required ways. The failure of global public health recommendations to recognize these inequalities, and to adapt advice to national and local contexts, reveals significant limitations that extend beyond this specific global pandemic.

Based on San Francisco's Rapid ART Program Initiative for HIV Diagnoses (RAPID) model, most iART programs in the US condense ART initiation, insurance acquisition, housing assessment, and mental health and substance use evaluation into an initial visit. However, the RAPID model does not explicitly address structural racism and homophobia, HIV-related stigma, medical mistrust, and other important factors at the time of diagnosis experienced more poignantly by African American, Latinx, men who have sex with men (MSM), and transgender patient populations. These factors negatively impact initial and subsequent HIV care engagement and exacerbate significant health disparities along the HIV care continuum. While iART has improved time to viral suppression and linkage to care rates, its association with retention in care and viral suppression, particularly in vulnerable populations, remains controversial. Considering that in the US the HIV epidemic is sharply defined by healthcare disparities, we argue that incorporating an explicit health equity approach into the RAPID model is vital to ensure those who disproportionately bear the burden of HIV are not left behind.

The effects of COVID-19 for this population are inextricably linked to areas of systemic oppression and disenfranchisement, which are exacerbated by COVID-19: (1) health care inequality; (2) segregation, overall health, and food insecurity; (3) underrepresentation in government and the medical profession; and (4) inequalities in participatory democracy and public engagement.

Yet air quality and related public health impacts linked to ethical and environmental justice elements are often marginalized or missing in planning and associated decision making. Industry and government policies and practices, laws and planning regulations lagged well behind the science in the United Kingdom. This paper explores the reasons for this and what shaped some of those policies. Why did shale gas policies in England fail to fully address public health priorities and neglect ethical and environmental justice concerns. To answer this question, an interdisciplinary analysis is needed informed by a theoretical framework of how air pollution and climate change are largely discounted in the complex realpolitik of policy and regulation for shale gas development in England. Sources, including official government, regulatory and planning documents, as well as industry and scientific publications are examined and benchmarked against the science and ethical and environmental justice criteria. Further, our typology illustrates how the process works drawing on an analysis of official policy documents and statements on planning and regulatory oversight of shale exploration in England, and material from industry and their consultants relating to proposed shale oil and gas development. Currently the oil, gas and chemical industries in England continue to dominate and influence energy and feedstock-related policy making to the detriment of ethical and environmental justice decision making with significant consequences for public health.

The pandemic's disastrous worldwide health impacts have been exacerbated by, and have compounded, the unsustainability of economic globalisation based on the neoliberal dismantling of state capabilities in favour of markets. Flow-on economic impacts have simultaneously created major supply and demand disruptions, and highlighted the growing within-country inequalities and precarity generated by neoliberal regimes of labour market regulation. Taking an Australian and international perspective, we examine these economic and labour market impacts, paying particular attention to differential impacts on First Nations people, developing countries, women, immigrants and young people. Evaluating policy responses in a political climate of national and international leadership very different from those in which major twentieth century crises were addressed, we argue the need for a national and international conversation to develop a new pathway out of crisis.

The demography of the population, including anticipated or estimated changes, is a factor in determining the 'universal' needs for health and well-being. Demography is concerned with the size, breakdown, age and gender structure and dynamics of a population. The same science, and its robust methodologies, is equally applicable to the demography of the health workforce itself. For example, a large percentage of the workforce close to retirement will impact availability, a geographically mobile workforce has implications for health coverage, and gender distribution in occupations may have implications for workforce acceptability and equity of opportunity. In a world with an overall shortage of health workers, and the expectation of increasing need as a result of both population growth in the global south and population ageing in the global north, studying and understanding demographic characteristics of the workforce can help with future planning. This paper discusses the dimensions of health worker demography and considers how demographic tools and techniques can be applied to the analysis of the health labour market. A conceptual framework is introduced as a step towards the application of demographic principles and techniques to health workforce analysis and planning exercises as countries work towards universal health coverage, the reduction of inequities and national development targets. Some illustrative data from Nepal and Finland are shown to illustrate the potential of this framework as a simple and effective contribution to health workforce planning.

One Health: How Interdependence Enriches Veterinary Ethics Education	ANIMALS			English	Article						one health; veterinary medicine; veterinary ethics; veterinary education interdependence; pedagogy; moral agency; mindfulness	ONE WELFARE; MINDFULNESS; WILDLIFE; ECOLOGY; IMPACT; EBOLA	Simple Summary The idea of One Health acknowledges the interdependence of human and non-human animal health against the backdrop of a shared environment. This requires collaboration across disciplines to tackle complex health problems. How does One Health affect the education of veterinary ethics, traditionally restricted to both animal and professional ethics? First, veterinary ethics education provides an opportunity within the curriculum for students to engage with the meaning and implication of One Health, so as to develop their own viewpoint. Similarly, One Health can enrich veterinary ethics. It does so by introducing relevant ethical fields and other cultural perspectives, as well as promoting ways of teaching that motivate and sensitize students to become aware of the underlying interdependency and complexity of health issues while at the same time fostering their capacity for ethical problem solving. Abstract What does One Health imply for veterinary ethics education? In order to answer this question, we will first have to establish what One Health itself involves. The meaning and scope of One Health, however, cannot be established without reference to its values-whose health matters? Veterinary ethics education is well equipped to facilitate such an open-ended inquiry into multispecies health. One Health also widens the scope of veterinary ethics by making salient, among other fields, environmental ethics, global health justice, and non-Western approaches to ethics. Finally, One Health requires students to engage with interdependence. Discussing three levels of interdependence, we argue that veterinary ethics stands to benefit from a more contemplative pedagogy.

Both developed and developing countries report geographically uneven distributions of the medical workforce. This scoping review synthesizes evidence from peer-reviewed and grey literature concerning approaches implemented to improve the recruitment, development, and retention of the rural medical workforce in both developed and developing countries. Methods: We will utilize the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework as the basis for this scoping review. The databases to be searched include Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL Plus, and PubMed for articles from the last decade (2010-2019). Searches for unpublished studies and grey literature will be undertaken using the Google Scholar Advanced Search tool. Quantitative and qualitative study designs will be included. Two authors will independently screen and extract relevant articles and information, with disagreements resolved by a third. Quantitative and qualitative analyses (thematic) will be conducted to evaluate and categorize the study findings. Discussion: The scoping review will aid in mapping the available evidence for approaches implemented to advance the process of recruitment, development, and retention of the medical workforce in the rural and remote areas in developed and developing nations.

Each year, about US$ 4 billion is invested to support programs and organizations led by local experts in various communities towards developing strategies and ways in which these three (HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis) diseases could be fought. The Global Fund has supported various innovative strategies used in tackling these infectious diseases. It is also worthy of note that 38 million lives have been saved through the Global Funds Partnership resulting in a 50% decline in mortality rate caused by tuberculosis, AIDS and Malaria in these reached countries. However, the Global Fund is not without its challenges as there has been lack of fund commitment from the G8 countries who instituted the idea in the first place. Another limitation being experienced is the poor risk management that has resulted in discrepancies of over US$4 million discovered in the Global Fund grants received by Nigeria as of 2016. This study discusses the current state of the Global Fund and suggests recommendations to policymakers that could be instrumental in strengthening health systems and achieving increased impact.

Programmes should measure their effects on gender norms, roles and relationships in the communities in which they operate to respond to unexpected health consequences. We conducted a gender analysis on a drowning reduction programme in rural Bangladesh to identify its impacts on gendered roles and behaviours in the community. Design A mixed-method approach was used. Quantitative programme monitoring data were analysed to assess gender differences in participation and engagement. A qualitative approach using interviews, focus group discussions and observations with purposively selected programme implementing staff and participants aimed at finding explanations for quantitative findings and additional impacts of the programme on gender in the community. The analysis was conducted using Family Health International 360's Gender Integration Framework, which identifies both internal (norms) and external (behaviours) effects. Results Fewer girls (n=5030) participated in swimming classes than boys (n=6425) due to cultural restrictions and involvement in domestic work. Women were not hired in leadership roles in the implementing organisation due to lower transportation access and their perceived ability to conduct labour-intensive activities. However, communities become more accepting of local women's mobility and employment due to their engagement as swim instructors. Women swim instructors were more satisfied with the pay and part-time nature of the work as men were able to earn more elsewhere. Menstruation management was ignored as all supervisory staff were men. Conclusions Systematised strategies are required to ensure equal participation of girls and enable equitable prevention outcomes. Within the implementing organisation, programmatic changes will support gender transformation, such as ensuring women's mobility and engagement in leadership roles. Strategies to combat perceptions that lower paying part time work is more suitable for women than men may be considered.

Elimination of cervical cancer in low- and middle-income countries: Inequality of access and fragile healthcare systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Review						Cervical cancer; Health systems; Human papillomavirus; Vaccine	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; PREVENTION; PROGRAM; ORGANIZATION; AUSTRALIA; EFFICACY; WOMEN; RISK	In 2018, WHO called for global action to eliminate cervical cancer. The complexity of the processes involved in terms of prevention is often underestimated. Low- and middle-income countries do not have a robust healthcare framework to ensure high-quality programs. The present article discusses how fragile healthcare systems are barriers to eliminating cervical cancer, and also reports the experience of a Brazilian prevention program. The article considers how cervical cancer can be interpreted as an indicator of inequality: how women's attitudes and access to care determine an early or late diagnosis, and how strategies combining vaccine and DNA-HPV tests are crucial. New vaccine schemes, the critical analysis of local data, strengthening communication, managing sentinel events, and integrating vaccination and screening data for the health information system are some of the key activities to sustainable improvement in both access and quality of care.

We propose broadening the approach to dealing with racial health inequity by considering the interplay of race and class in the politics of the United States. This approach, combined with a grasp of the historical roots of race relations in North America, could hold the promise of improving our country's abysmal showing in international comparisons of population health indicators, including birth outcomes.

J	Touré, L; Ridde, V				Toure, Laurence; Ridde, Valery			The emergence of the national medical assistance scheme for the poorest in Mali	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Social policy; agenda-setting; equity; universal health care; Mali		Universal health coverage is high up the international agenda. The majority of the West Africa's countries are seeking to define the content of their compulsory, contribution-based medical insurance system. However, very few countries apart from Mali have decided to develop a national policy for poorest population that is not based on contributions. This qualitative research examines the historical process that has permitted the emergence of this public policy. The research shows that the process has been very long, chaotic and suspended for long periods. One of the biggest challenges has been that of intersectoriality and the social construction of the poorest to be targeted by this public policy, as institutional tensions have evolved in accordance with the political issues linked to social protection. Eventually, the medical assistance scheme for the poorest saw the light of day in 2011, funded entirely by the government. Its emergence would appear to be attributable not so much to any new concern for the poorest in society but rather to a desire to give the social protection policy engaged in a guarantee of universality. This policy nonetheless remains an innovation within French-speaking West Africa.

J	Sourdin, T; Li, B; McNamara, DM				Sourdin, Tania; Li, Bin; McNamara, Donna Marie			Court innovations and access to justice in times of crisis	HEALTH POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Court innovations; Dispute resolution; Healthcare dispute resolution; COVID-19; Disruptive technology		Background: COVID-19 has disrupted not only the health sector but also justice systems. Courts around the world have had to respond quickly to the challenges presented by the pandemic and the associated social distancing restrictions. This has created significant challenges for the justice system and such chal-lenges are likely to be further compounded in the post-pandemic era as there is a 'tsunami' of COVID19-related disputes predicted. Methods: This study will examine how global court responses have transitioned from being primarily traditional, face-to-face proceedings to online court processes (as supported by internet technology). By adopting a comparative approach, we will analyse how some countries have adapted to this shift to online mode while also maintaining a focus on access to justice. Results: We argue that online modes of dispute resolution, often referred to as Online Dispute Resolution (ODR), can promote resolution while facilitating social distancing in this new COVID-era. The rapid shift from traditional court processes to an online mode has further assisted the public, lawyers and experts to access the justice system in some jurisdictions, even during the crisis. In light of the scale of recent changes, there have been concerns about the capacity of courts to adopt newer technologies as well as issues relating to the impact of a new online model of justice, particularly in terms of the barriers for more vulnerable members of society. Further, the use of disruptive technologies in some courts have posed questions around whether outcomes generated by these innovations reflect the meaning of 'justice' in its traditional sense. Conclusions: This article argues that courts should embrace newer technologies that support court services while being mindful of possible tech-related issues that can impact on justice objectives. We argue that by placing further emphasis on alternative dispute resolution methods and ODR into the future, this might offset the likely tsunami of COVID-related litigation which would enable courts, hospitals, medical professionals and patients to settle disputes in a just, equitable and more efficient manner.

J	Riot, C; O'Brien, W; Minahan, C				Riot, Caroline; O'Brien, Wendy; Minahan, Clare			High performance sport programs and emplaced performance capital in elite athletes from developing nations	SPORT MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article						Emplaced performance capital; Material; Sensory; Affects; Capacities	SUCCESSFUL TALENT DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT; TRACK	For elite athletes from developing countries, providing access to high performance services is often a low priority, when other issues such as basic social, health, and community needs take precedence. Little is known about how these athletes develop the skills necessary to compete at international events. Prior to the Commonwealth Games in Australia, a series of training camps were trialed, designed to expose athletes from a small group of developing countries in the Oceania region to the high-performance training environment. Drawing on data from focus groups conducted with athletes and coaches, the authors explore the struggles that occur as athletes negotiate the affects produced through the material and sensory world of their everyday lives. The authors propose the notion of emplaced performance capital to examine the complex interplay between field, capital and habitus and the place-events of training and performing. Implicit within these negotiations is how power is exercised in conflicts over resources to produce inequalities and marginalization. While the research is conducted in developing countries, the authors argue that athletes from developed countries are also situated in material and sensory environments producing affects that potentially impact performance.

How Statelessness, Citizenship, and Out-migration Contribute to Stratification Among Rural Elderly in the Highlands of Thailand	SOCIAL FORCES			English	Article						Immigration; Migration; Statelessness; Legal status; Inequality; Social stratification	ADULT CHILDREN; PARENTS; MOBILITY; LEGAL; IMMIGRANTS; CAMBODIA; IMPACTS; SYSTEM; HEALTH; CHINA	In rural communities across the Global South, families are relying on temporary and permanent out-migration for work to navigate destabilizing agrarian transformations. While research indicates that success of this household livelihood strategy may depend on the legal status of international migrants, precarious legal status is not solely a problem relegated to people who cross national borders. Indeed, millions worldwide are stateless in the countries of their birth. In this mixed-method study, we assess the importance of legal status for elderly well-being among highlanders in Northern Thailand-rural communities that are experiencing both extensive out-migration and protracted statelessness. We find that elderly wealth and work outcomes are shaped by the legal status of both out-migrants and of the rural elderly themselves. Specifically, we show that when rural elderly or their migrant relatives are stateless, the elderly are more likely to engage in wage work and less likely to gain financial benefits of out-migration to the extent that citizens do. Through ethnographic engagement, we locate the contributions of legal status to rural stratification in its complex entanglements with land access and ethno-nationalism in the region, and in the ways that state and market infrastructures deploy citizenship to surveil highlanders and other minorities in Thailand. Amidst growing calls to resolve statelessness in the Global South, our research suggests that the combination of out-migration and uneven extension of citizenship in rural communities is likely to exacerbate stratification, both for migrants and for those who rarely leave home.

J	Harris, J; Nisbett, N				Harris, Jody; Nisbett, Nicholas			The Basic Determinants of Malnutrition: Resources, Structures, Ideas and Power	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Malnutrition; Basic Determinants; Resources; Structures; Ideas; Power	HEALTH EQUITY; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; FOOD SOVEREIGNTY; DOUBLE BURDEN; CHILD HEALTH; NUTRITION; OBESITY; CONSEQUENCES; IMPROVEMENTS; AGRICULTURE	Background: While child undernutrition is improving overall, different population groups are experiencing different outcomes. What sets some groups apart is their experience of the 'basic determinants' of malnutrition, that underpin the 'immediate' and 'underlying' determinants, and that have been much less studied, defined and understood. Methods: We undertook a qualitative narrative review based in two sets of ideas: nutrition's basic determinants as laid out in the original United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) framework, and critical concepts emerging from development studies. These ideas informed searches in Google Scholar, and resulting papers formed the basis for the review. Results: Based on this literature, we expand and clarify the terminology of 'basic determinants' into a new framework, to include (1) resources and (material, human, social and natural) capitals at the basic level; (2) structures including social, market, legal and political systems driven by long-term demographic, economic, and environmental trends; and (3) ideas, beliefs and ideologies prevailing within a given society - crystallising into social norms and institutions - fundamentally shaping how societies are structured around power and marginalisation. We then illustrate with existing literature how these basic factors play out in the food, health and care determinants of malnutrition; and how theories of human rights and collective commons point us towards practical redressal options through improved participation and accountability. Conclusion: We show here that the basic determinants are not a black box of 'context,' but can be broken down into comprehensible issues that are amenable to change, and should be considered explicitly in research and action to reduce the global burden of malnutrition.

Alexander			Personal and Political: Post-Traumatic Stress Through the Lens of Social Identity, Power, and Politics	POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						psychological trauma; social identity; groups; PTSD; traumatic events	PTSD SYMPTOM SEVERITY; GLOBAL STATUS-REPORT; MENTAL-HEALTH; SOCIOPOLITICAL CONTEXT; NATIONAL IDENTITY; TERRORIST-ATTACKS; COLLECTIVE ACTION; NORTHERN-IRELAND; TRAUMATIC STRESS; PARTNER VIOLENCE	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has always been controversial and highly politicized. Here, using a social identity approach, we review evidence that trauma and its aftermath are fundamentally linked to social position, sociopolitical capital, and power. We begin this contribution by demonstrating how a person's group memberships (and the social identities they derive from these memberships) are inherently linked to the experience of adversity. We then go on to consider how it is through group memberships that individuals are defined by their trauma risk and trauma histories-that is, a person's group memberships and their trauma are often inherently linked. Considering the importance of group memberships for understanding trauma, we argue that it is important to see these, and group processes more generally, as more than just "demographic" risk factors. Instead, we argue that when groups are defined by their trauma history or risk, their members will often derive some sense of self from this trauma. For this reason, attributes of group memberships are important in developing an understanding of adjustment and adaptation to trauma. In particular, groups' status, their recourse to justice, and the level of trust and solidarity within the group are all central to the impact of traumatic events on individual-level psychological resilience. We review evidence that supports this analysis by focusing on the exacerbating effects of stigma and social mistrust on post-traumatic stress, and the value of solidarity and strong identities for resilience. We conclude that because of these group-related processes, trauma interweaves the personal with the political and that post-traumatic stress is fundamentally about power, positionality, and politics.

Without accounting for the interrelated nature of African Australians' social locations and intersecting systems of oppression/privilege, practice and policy responses may have limited impact. This qualitative empirical study utilizes intersectional analysis to understand concerns about African Australian health and well-being in Greater Melbourne gleaned from an Issues Paper produced by 50 African Australians, two group interviews, and 22 slow interviews. Participants included 35 African Australians and nine people of non-African backgrounds working with, and for, African Australians in the community sector. Systems of oppression/privilege that impact health outcomes for certain African Australians are found at the intersections of migration pathway, age, and gender and manifest within three Australian institutions, including via segregation and othering in education, labor market discrimination, and gendered racism in health care provision. As such, intersectional and equity-orientated practice and policy actions are recommended to shift the distribution of power across all social institutions and eradicate health inequities.

Barriers to the use of trained interpreters in consultations with refugees in four resettlement countries: a qualitative analysis using normalisation process theory	BMC FAMILY PRACTICE			English	Article						Refugees; Communication; Primary health care; Health equity; Health resources; Surveys and questionnaires	HEALTH-CARE; EXPERIENCES; SERVICES; IMPACT	Background Increasing numbers of primary care practitioners in refugee resettlement countries are providing care to refugees. Access to trained interpreters is a priority for these practitioners, but there are many barriers to the implementation of interpreted consultations in routine care. There is a lack of international, theoretically informed research. The purpose of this paper is to understand barriers to interpreter use in primary care consultations in four resettlement countries using Normalisation Process Theory. Method We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with networks of primary care practitioners (PCPs) who care for refugees in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the US (n = 314). We analysed qualitative data from the survey about barriers to interpreter use (n = 178). We completed an inductive thematic analysis, iteratively developed a Normalisation Process Theory (NPT)-informed coding frame and then mapped the emergent findings onto the theory's construct about enacting interpreted consultations. Results In all four countries, the use of an interpreter presented communication and interaction challenges between providers and patients, which can impede the goals of primary care consultations. Primary care practitioners did not always have confidence in interpreted consultations and described poor professional practice by some interpreters. There was variation across countries, and inconsistency within countries, in the availability of trained interpreters and funding sources. Conclusion There are shared and differential barriers to implementation of interpreted consultations in a consistent and sustained way in the four countries studied. These findings can be used to inform country-specific and international level policies and interventions focusing on improving skills and resources for interpreted consultations to improve implementation of interpreted primary care consultations.

This study aimed to gain new comprehensive information about functioning and equality in people affected by skeletal dysplasia compared to matched controls without skeletal dysplasia.MethodsFunctioning was assessed by questionnaire, which was formed by operationalizing International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) core set's categories into the items according to the ICF linking rules, using primarily Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PROMIS (R) - items.ResultsAltogether 80 subjects with skeletal dysplasia and 55 age-, gender- and place of residence -matched controls participated. People with skeletal dysplasia experienced more pain (p<0.001) and the pain interfered more their daily lives (p=0.037) compared to the controls. They had more problems related to musculoskeletal functions and exercise tolerance, difficulties in mobility, used more assistive products and technology and were more affected by climate and seasonal changes (p<0.001). They met challenges in self-care, acquisition of goods and services and household tasks (p<0.001) and in participating in close social relationships, leisure time activities (p<0.001) and associations and organizational services (p=0.007). They felt less satisfied with remunerative work (p=0.003), felt more inequality (p=0.008), met more negative attitudes of others (p<0.001) and felt having less support given by family and friends (p=0.022).

By building accessible environment and improving equal services, functioning could be improved.

This study explores if patient characteristics recorded at the initial service examination have an association with a poor response to this pathway of care in an advanced practice physiotherapist-led tertiary service. Methods Two hundred and forty nine patients undergoing non-surgical multidisciplinary management for their LBP across 8 tertiary public hospitals in Queensland, Australia participated in this prospective longitudinal study. Generalised linear models (logistic family) examined the relationship between patient characteristics and a poor response at 6 months follow-up using a Global Rating of Change measure. Results Overall 79 of the 178 (44%) patients completing the Global Rating of Change measure (28.5% loss to follow-up) reported a poor outcome. Patient characteristics retained in the final model associated with a poor response included lower Formal Education Level (ie did not complete school) (Odds Ratio (OR (95% confidence interval)) (2.67 (1.17-6.09), p = 0.02) and higher self-reported back disability (measured with the Oswestry Disability Index) (OR 1.33 (1.01-1.77) per 10/100 point score increase, p = 0.046). Conclusions A low level of formal education and high level of self-reported back disability may be associated with a poor response to non-surgical multidisciplinary management of LBP in tertiary care. Patients with these characteristics may need greater assistance with regard to their comprehension of health information, and judicious monitoring of their response to facilitate timely alternative care if no benefits are attained.

This study surveyed 81 forensic clinicians recruited via international professional association listserv postings and social media about their assessment and intervention practices in providing services to clients with FASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), along with their training experiences and needs in this area. Results indicated that the majority of clinicians had forensic experience working with clients who had FASD and other NDDs, although most identified limited relevant training experiences, gaps in their readiness for service provision, and practice barriers in effectively working with these populations. Clinicians also reported seeing fewer clients with FASD relative to other NDDs, and feeling less prepared for forensic practice with this population. Most clinicians endorsed the need for additional training and supports to increase their competency and enhance their practice, such as the development of screening tools, clinical guidelines, and access to experts or specialists for consultation. As awareness about FASD continues to grow in legal contexts, additional research, training, and policy consideration is required to develop and implement evidence-based practice resources for forensic clinicians.

J	Bahri, A				Bahri, Amrita			Women at the Frontline of COVID-19: Can Gender Mainstreaming in Free Trade Agreements Help?	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW			English	Article							LIBERALIZATION; LABOR	Health pandemics affect women and men differently, and they can make the existing gender inequalities much worse. COVID-19 is one such pandemic, which can have substantial gendered implications both during and in the post-pandemic world. Its economic and social consequences could deepen the existing gender inequalities and roll back the limited gains made in respect of women empowerment in the past few decades. The impending global recession, multiple trade restrictions, economic lockdown, and social distancing measures can expose vulnerabilities in social, political, and economic systems, which, in turn, could have a profound impact on women's participation in trade and commerce. The article outlines five main reasons that explain why this health pandemic has put women employees, entrepreneurs, and consumers at the frontline of the struggle. It then explores how free trade agreements can contribute in repairing the harm in the post-pandemic world. In doing so, the author sheds light on various ways in which the existing trade agreements embrace gender equality considerations and how they can be better prepared to help minimize the pandemic-inflicted economic loss to women.

To assess the association between type 2 diabetes (DM2) and socioeconomic inequalities, mediated by the contribution of body mass index (BMI), physical activity (PA), and diet (diet-DII). Materials and methods. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data of adults participating in the Diabetes Mellitus Survey of Mexico City. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics as well as height and weight, dietary intake, leisure time activity and the presence of DM2 were measured.We fitted a structural equation model (SEM) with DM2 as the main outcome, and BMI, diet-DII and PA served as mediator variables between socioeconomic inequalities index (SII) and DM2. Results. The prevalence of DM2 was 13.6%. From the fitted SEM, each standard deviation increases in the SII was associated with increased scores of DM2 (beta=0.174, P<0.001). Conclusion. The results in the present study show how high scores in the index of SII may influence the presence of DM2.

There is some indication that health and health behaviour is socially patterned in the age span of individuals in this transition (16-24 years) and that there are differences by socioeconomic position (SEP). However, evidence regarding this phenomenon has not been systematically mapped. In addition, little is known about the role of institutional characteristics (eg, of universities, workplaces) in the development of health and possible inequalities in health during this transition. Hence, the first objective of this scoping review is to systematically map the existing evidence regarding health and health behaviours (and possible health inequalities, for example, differences by SEP) in the age group of 16-24 years and during school-to-work transition noted in Germany and abroad. The second objective is to summarise the evidence on the potential effects of contextual and compositional characteristics of specific institutions entered during this life stage on health and health behaviours. Third, indicators and measures of these characteristics will be summarised. Methods and analysis We will systematically map the evidence on health inequalities during school-to-work-transitions among young adults (aged 16-24 years), following the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. The literature search is performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, International Labour Organization and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, using a predetermined search strategy. Articles published between January 2000 and February 2020 in English or German are considered for the review. The selection process follows a two-step approach: (1) screening of titles and abstracts, and (2) screening of full texts, both steps by two independent reviewers. Any discrepancies in the selection process are resolved by a third researcher. Data extraction will be performed using a customised data extraction sheet. The results will be presented in tabular and narrative form. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and presented at international conferences and project workshops.

A fundamental first step in addressing inequities in MNCH services is knowing what services exist in urban areas, where these are located, who provides them and who uses them. This study aims to institutionalise the Urban Health Atlas (UHA)-a novel information and communications technology (ICT) tool-to strengthen health service delivery and oversight and generate critical evidence to inform health policy and planning in urban Bangladesh. Methods and analysis This mixed-method implementation research will be conducted in four purposively selected urban sites representing larger and smaller cities. Research activities will include an assessment of information needs and task review analysis of information users, stakeholder mapping and cost estimation. To document stakeholder perceptions and experiences, key informant interviews and in-depth interviews will be conducted along with desk reviews to understand MNCH planning and referral decisions. The UHA will be refined to increase responsiveness to user needs and capacities, and hands-on training will be provided to health managers. Cost estimation will be conducted to assess the financial implications of UHA uptake and scale-up. Systematic documentation of the implementation process will be undertaken. Policy decision-making and ICT health policy process flowcharts will be prepared using desk reviews and qualitative interviews. Thematic analysis of qualitative data will involve both emergent and a priori coding guided by WHO PATH toolkit and Policy Engagement Framework. Stakeholder analysis will apply standard techniques and measurement scales. Descriptive analysis of quantitative data and cost estimation analysis will also be performed.

Longstanding social and spatial inequalities allowed COVID-19 to spread unchecked, propelling a surge in farmworker activism, while the state uses the crisis to rollback worker protections. The politics of this moment are rooted in racialized labor regimes characterized by "imported colonialism". We use the case of Florida, where farmworker movements have for decades organized for health and justice, to contribute to the global debate on COVID-19, and to show how a deep history of the present can illuminate opportunities and challenges for organizing.

J	Gautam, B				Gautam, Bikram			Chemical Evaluation of Trace Elements in Bottled Water	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING			English	Article							DRINKING-WATER; QUALITY; RISK; ESOPHAGEAL; METALS	Sales of bottled water have been increasing around the globe. This study was carried out to assess the trace elements present in bottled water. For the study of bottled water, a total of 100 samples of different volumes (20 L and 1 L) were selected. The physicochemical assessments were performed as per the methods described in the American Public Health Association, 2005. Average values of pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, and turbidity were found to be 5.96 +/- 0.54, 59.97 +/- 58.65, 4.42 +/- 3.69, and 0.408 +/- 0.19, respectively. Likewise, average values of total hardness (as CaCO3), calcium (as CaCO3), magnesium (as CaCO3), chlorine, iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, fluoride, sodium, and potassium were found to be 14.78 +/- 8.43, 3.26 +/- 1.55, 11.51 +/- 7.92, 7.51 +/- 3.21, 0.0032 +/- 0.0017, 0.0091 +/- 0.0116, 0.2520 +/- 0.0127, 0.0080 +/- 0.0082, 0.047 +/- 0.0139, 12.65 +/- 10.90, and 1.41 +/- 2.00, respectively; meanwhile residual chlorine, zinc, silver, cadmium, and lead were below detection limit. All the physicochemical characteristics of bottled water were found to be within International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) guidelines. From the physicochemical aspects, the bottled water was found to be within the permissible value set by IBWA. Pearson's correlation revealed significant association between trace elements. Levene's test for equity of variances indicated that the majority (iron, copper, cobalt, nickel, fluoride, sodium, and potassium) of trace elements and seasons (monsoon and postmonsoon) demonstrated a statistically significant distribution (at 95% confidence interval). At elevated concentrations, some elements can be harmful to human health and can cause morphological abnormalities, mutagenic effects, reduced growth, and increased morbidity and mortality in humans but it all depends upon a person's metabolic factors, genetic factors, and ability to excrete trace elements through different routes, etc. Water could have percolated down from the surface to the ground water and as such the difference in concentration of trace elements in monsoon and postmonsoon seasons could be noticeable.

J	de Soysa, I; Vadlamannati, KC				de Soysa, Indra; Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya			Does free-market capitalism drive unequal access to health? An empirical analysis, 1970-2015	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Free-market capitalism; healthcare equity; global competition; human capital		Many scholars, particularly in public health, argue that neoliberal capitalist economic forces adversely affect communities by increasing inequalities, ultimately affecting health. Apparently, corporate capitalism affects health and communitarian concerns because governments place corporate profits over the publics interests. Using unique data collected by the Varieties of Democracy (VDEM) project that capture the degree of access of the poorest segments of society to health services comparable with those available to the richest segments, this study finds that an index of economic freedom robustly reduces inequality of access to health. We argue that these results obtain because greater exposure to global markets increases the premium on the productivity of labour, increasing incentives for political elites to invest in productivity-enhancing public goods. Our results are robust to a number of alternative models and data, and robust to instrumental variables analyses addressing potential endogeneity. Rather than free-market capitalism increasing health-related neglect of society, our data suggest that free-market capitalist conditions promote equitable access to health. This is good news for governments wishing to grow their economies, reform broken health systems for gaining advantages in a competitive global economy, and serve communitarian interests, such as shared good health.

The complex geographies of telelactation and access to community breastfeeding support in the state of Ohio	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BAND DIGITAL DIVIDE; RURAL BROAD-BAND; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; HEALTH INFORMATION; UNITED-STATES; DEPRESSION; INITIATION; BENEFITS; ADOPTION; MOTHERS	The availability of breastfeeding support resources, including those provided by Baby-Friendly Hospitals, International Board Certified Lactation Consultants, breastfeeding counselors and educators, and volunteer-based mother-to-mother support organizations, such as La Leche League, are critically important for influencing breastfeeding initiation and continuation for the mother-child dyad. In addition, the emergence of community support options via information and communication technologies such as Skype and Facetime, social media (e.g., Facebook), and telelactation providers are providing mothers with a new range of support options that can help bridge geographic barriers to traditional community support. However, telelactation services that use information and communication technologies to connect breastfeeding mothers to remotely located breastfeeding experts require reliable, affordable, high-quality broadband connections to facilitate interaction between mothers and their support resources. The purpose of this paper is to explore the complex spatial landscape of virtual and face-to-face breastfeeding support options for mothers in the state of Ohio (U.S.), identifying barriers to support. Using a range of spatial and network analytics, the results suggest that a divide is emerging. While urban areas in Ohio benefit from both a density of face-to-face breastfeeding support resources and robust broadband options for engaging in telelactation, many rural areas of the state are lacking access to both. Policy implications and several potential strategies for mitigating these inequities are discussed.

Our final analytic sample included 4,918 White and 1,546 Black individuals from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health Wave IV (2007-2008) who had complete measures on BMI, demographics, SES, genetic data, and health behaviors. We used ordinary least-squares regression to assess variation in log(BMI) as a function of the aforementioned predictors, independently and mutually adjusted. All analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity in the main analysis, and further by sex. The age-adjusted variation in log(BMI) was 0.055 among Whites and 0.066 among Blacks. The contribution of SES and polygenic score ranged from less thanl% to 6% and from 2% to 8%, respectively, and majority of the variation (87%-96%) in log(BMI) remained unexplained. Differential distribution of socioeconomic resources, stressors, and buffers may interact to produce systematically larger variation in vulnerable populations. More understanding of the contribution of biological, genetic, and environmental factors, as well as stochastic elements, in diverse phenotypic variance is needed in population health sciences.

Cohesion Between Research Literature and Health System Level Efforts to Address Global Neurosurgical Inequity: A Scoping Review	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Global health; Global neurosurgery; Health systems; LMIC; Scoping review	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; DEVELOPING-WORLD; ADDIS-ABABA; CARE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PERSPECTIVE; EDUCATION	BACKGROUND: Research output on global neurosurgery (GNS) has exponentially increased in recent years. As research efforts increase, we must first analyze how the current body of GNS literature fits into the macroscopic schema of systems-based policies. The aim of this study was to identify and categorize GNS research based on health system domains. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase were searched for GNS literature published from 1999 to 2019. Then, health system domains were defined and itemized based on publicly available documents from the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change. This items chart was subsequently used to categorize the GNS literature into health system domains. RESULTS: A total 63 articles were determined to focus on a health system domain. Of these articles, 6 focused on multiple domains, yielding an adjusted total of 70 articles. Overall, the most represented health system domain was service delivery (21 articles), followed by workforce (19), infrastructure (15), financing (12) and information man-agement (3). A total of 30 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) were represented across all articles. In addition, the first author was affiliated with an institution from a high-income country for 71.4% of the articles. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlighted the pressing need for more research into information management in the context of GNS. In addition, health system-focused GNS literature represented only 20% of all LMICs (30/143). The trends in authorship should be noted, because many ethical (and practical) issues may arise if there is a disconnect in the objectives of the authors and the neurosurgeons in LMICs.

International Investment Agreements, Human Rights, and Environmental Justice: The Texaco/Chevron Case From the Ecuadorian Amazon	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW			English	Article								The Texaco/Chevron lawsuit, which started inNovember 1993 and is still being litigated in 2020, is a prominent example of the process of judicialization of environmental conflict. The Ecuadorian plaintiffs claim that the oil company's operations generated ruinous impacts on the environment and on the development prospects and health of nearby individuals and communities. The tortuous and lengthy judiciary process was further hindered by an arbitration process, an Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism nested in the Ecuador-United States Bilateral Investment Treaty. The significance of the case goes beyond the specifics of Ecuador and provides further arguments fuelling the protracted legitimacy crisis experienced by International Investment Agreements. The current praxis of Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanisms is generating an asymmetrical system, protecting the interest of investors, and intruding into the space ofhuman and environmental rights. These issues are resonating with social movements, activist scholars and policy makers who are reacting to the vulnerabilities engendered by International Investment Agreements through multipronged strategies. These asymmetries provide ammunition to resist the signing of new International Investment Agreements, support the inclusion of human and environmental rights safeguards in International Investment Agreements, and contribute to the rationale of pre-empting extractive projects that are likely to produce severe environmental liabilities. Some of the potential ways in which a somewhat more level playing field can be created include, in addition to denouncing investment agreements, transforming Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanisms towards a format that can also accommodate the complaints of affected communities or enacting moratoria on extraction projects that are prone to adverse socioenvironmental impacts. Both strategies could prove to be productive avenues towards the achievement of justice.

J	Hanieh, S; High, H; Boulton, J				Hanieh, Sarah; High, Holly; Boulton, John			Nutrition Justice: Uncovering Invisible Pathways to Malnutrition	FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						nutrition; malnutrition; child; adaptation; food security; hunger; justice	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHILD UNDERNUTRITION; LOW-INCOME; GROWTH; HEALTH; INTERVENTIONS; CONSEQUENCES; RISK	We propose the use of the analytic frame of "nutrition justice" to reconcile the separate imperatives of Global Health for nutritional sufficiency for all, the requirement to eradicate childhood malnutrition, and the need for strategies to check the emerging pandemic of the double burden of malnutrition in the Global South. Malnutrition and its consequences of growth stunting are the result of disruption to the nutritional ecology of childhood from structural violence. This is mediated through loss of food security and perturbation to the cultural status of food, and on the prerequisites for nurture during infancy and early childhood. These socio-political factors obscure the role of biological adaptation to nutritional constraint on growth and hence the causal pathway to the double burden of malnutrition. In this paper we describe how the effects of historical and contemporary structural violence on the nutritional ecology of childhood are mediated using the examples of remote Aboriginal Australia and the Lao PDR. Both populations live by force of circumstance in a "metabolic ghetto" that has disrupted the prerequisites for parental nurturing through loss of food security and of traditional sources of transitional staple foods for weaning. Growth faltering and stunting of stature are markers of adaptation to nutritional constraint yet are also the first steps on the track to the double burden. We discuss the implications of these observations for strategies for global food sufficiency by mean of a thought-experiment of the effect of food and nutrient sufficiency for growth on future health and metabolic adaptation.

J	Stratil, JM; Voss, M; Arnold, L				Stratil, Jan M.; Voss, Maike; Arnold, Laura			WICID framework version 1.0: criteria and considerations to guide evidence-informed decision-making on non-pharmacological interventions targeting COVID-19	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						health policy; public health; qualitative study	PUBLIC-HEALTH ETHICS; ACCOUNTABILITY; POLICY	Introduction Public health decision-making requires the balancing of numerous, often conflicting factors. However, participatory, evidence-informed decision-making processes to identify and weigh these factors are often not possible- especially, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While evidence-to-decision frameworks are not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, they can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered. Objective To develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges of decision-making on non-pharmacological interventions to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods We employed the 'best fit' framework synthesis technique and used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework as a starting point. First, we adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to case studies. Next, we conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide policymakers on the phasing out of applied lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we developed the WICID (WHO-INTEGRATE COVID-19) framework version 1.0. Results Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were analysed. The revised framework consists of 11+1 criteria, supported by 48 aspects, and embraces a complex systems perspective. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental human rights, acceptability and equity considerations, societal, environmental and economic implications, as well as implementation, resource and feasibility considerations. Discussion The proposed framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key stakeholder groups across the society. The WICID framework can be a tool to support comprehensive evidence-informed decision-making processes.

Inequality in physical activity, global trends by income inequality and gender in adults	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY			English	Article						Economy; Inactivity; Guidelines; Physical activity; Gini index; Inequality; WHO activity guidelines	POPULATION HEALTH; MORTALITY; DISEASE; ASSOCIATIONS; INACTIVITY; WALKING	BackgroundPhysical inactivity is a global pandemic associated with a high burden of disease and premature mortality. There is also a trend in growing economic inequalities which impacts population health. There is no global analysis of the relationship between income inequality and population levels of physical inactivity.MethodsTwo thousand sixteen World Health Organisation's country level data about compliance with the 2010 global physical activity guidelines were analysed against country level income interquantile ratio data obtained from the World Bank, OECD and World Income Inequality Database. The analysis was stratified by country income (Low, Middle and High) according to the World Bank classification and gender. Multiple regression was used to quantify the association between physical activity and income inequality. Models were adjusted for GDP and percentage of GDP spent on health care for each country and out of pocket health care spent.ResultsSignificantly higher levels of inactivity and a wider gap between the percentage of women and men meeting global physical activity guidelines were found in countries with higher income inequality in high and middle income countries irrespective of a country wealth and spend on health care. For example, in higher income countries, for each point increase in the interquantile ratio data, levels of inactivity in women were 3.73% (CI 0.89 6.57) higher, levels of inactivity in men were 2.04% (CI 0.08 4.15) higher and the gap in inactivity levels between women and men was 1.50% larger (CI 0.16 2.83). Similar relationships were found in middle income countries with lower effect sizes. These relationships were, however, not demonstrated in the low-income countries.ConclusionsEconomic inequalities, particularly in high- and middle- income countries might contribute to physical inactivity and might be an important factor to consider and address in order to combat the global inactivity pandemic and to achieve the World Health Organisation target for inactivity reduction.

However, there is wide variation in the duration of palliative care received before death reported across the research literature. This study aims to determine the duration of time from initiation of palliative care to death for adults receiving palliative care across the international literature.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018094718). Six databases were searched for articles published between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library, as well undertaking citation list searches. Following PRISMA guidelines, articles were screened using inclusion (any study design reporting duration from initiation to death in adults palliative care services) and exclusion (paediatric/non-English language studies, trials influencing the timing of palliative care) criteria. Quality appraisal was completed using Hawker's criteria and the main outcome was the duration of palliative care (median/mean days from initiation to death).ResultsOne hundred sixty-nine studies from 23 countries were included, involving 11,996,479 patients. Prior to death, the median duration from initiation of palliative care to death was 18.9 days (IQR 0.1), weighted by the number of participants. Significant differences between duration were found by disease type (15 days for cancer vs 6 days for non-cancer conditions), service type (19 days for specialist palliative care unit, 20 days for community/home care, and 6 days for general hospital ward) and development index of countries (18.91 days for very high development vs 34 days for all other levels of development). Forty-three per cent of studies were rated as 'good' quality. Limitations include a preponderance of data from high-income countries, with unclear implications for low- and middle-income countries.ConclusionsDuration of palliative care is much shorter than the 3-4 months of input by a multidisciplinary team necessary in order for the full benefits of palliative care to be realised. Furthermore, the findings highlight inequity in access across patient, service and country characteristics. We welcome more consistent terminology and methodology in the assessment of duration of palliative care from all countries, alongside increased reporting from less-developed settings, to inform benchmarking, service evaluation and quality improvement.

J	Lau, F; Antonio, M; Davison, K; Queen, R; Bryski, K				Lau, Francis; Antonio, Marcy; Davison, Kelly; Queen, Roz; Bryski, Katie			An Environmental Scan of Sex and Gender in Electronic Health Records: Analysis of Public Information Sources	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						sex; gender; electronic health records; standards; transgender persons	TRANSGENDER HEALTH; MEDICAL-RECORDS; IDENTITY DATA; CARE; COLLECTION; RECOMMENDATIONS; ORIENTATION	Background: Historically, the terms sex and gender have been used interchangeably as a binary attribute to describe a person as male or female, even though there is growing recognition that sex and gender are distinct concepts. The lack of sex and gender delineation in electronic health records (EHRs) may be perpetuating the inequities experienced by the transgender and gender nonbinary (TGNB) populations. Objective: This study aims to conduct an environmental scan to understand how sex and gender are defined and implemented in existing Canadian EHRs and current international health information standards. Methods: We examined public information sources on sex and gender definitions in existing Canadian EHRs and international standards communities. Definitions refer to data element names, code systems, and value sets in the descriptions of EHRs and standards. The study was built on an earlier environment scan by Canada Health Infoway, supplemented with sex and gender definitions from international standards communities. For the analysis, we examined the definitions for clarity, consistency, and accuracy. We also received feedback from a virtual community interested in sex-gender EHR issues. Results: The information sources consisted of public website descriptions of 52 databases and 55 data standards from 12 Canadian entities and 10 standards communities. There are variations in the definition and implementation of sex and gender in Canadian EHRs and international health information standards. There is a lack of clarity in some sex and gender concepts. There is inconsistency in the data element names, code systems, and value sets used to represent sex and gender concepts across EHRs. The appropriateness and adequacy of some value options are questioned as our societal understanding of sexual health evolves. Outdated value options raise concerns about current EHRs supporting the provision of culturally competent, safe, and affirmative health care. The limited options also perpetuate the inequities faced by the TGNB populations. The expanded sex and gender definitions from leading Canadian organizations and international standards communities have brought challenges in how to migrate these definitions into existing EHRs. We proposed 6 high-level actions, which are to articulate the need for this work, reach consensus on sex and gender concepts, reach consensus on expanded sex and gender definitions in EHRs, develop a coordinated action plan, embrace EHR change from socio-organizational and technical aspects to ensure success, and demonstrate the benefits in tangible terms. Conclusions: There are variations in sex and gender concepts across Canadian EHRs and the health information standards that support them. Although there are efforts to modernize sex and gender concept definitions, we need decisive and coordinated actions to ensure clarity, consistency, and competency in the definition and implementation of sex and gender concepts in EHRs. This work has implications for addressing the inequities of TGNB populations in Canada.

The urgent need for appropriate global health curricula in Germany	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						public health; health policy; health education and promotion	PUBLIC-HEALTH; NAME	Recently, representatives of politics, health officials and academia in Germany have advocated a greater role for Germany in matters concerning global health. However, health professionals in Germany are rarely taught about global health topics and accordingly real expertise in this field is lacking. To advance knowledge and competencies at German universities and adequately equip health professionals to achieve Germany's political goals, global health curricula must be developed at medical schools and other institutions. Such ambitions raise questions about the required content and dimensions of global health curricula as the field is currently highly heterogeneous and ill defined. To systematically identify strengths and shortcomings of current curricula, we scrutinised the global health curriculum at our institution, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, using an analytical framework that integrates the various approaches of global health. Our analysis identified that four (technical, social justice, security and humanitarian) of five approaches are present in our core global health curriculum. Local and global aspects of the field are equally represented. We propose that the use of such a structured analytical framework can support the development of GH curricula for all health professionals-in Germany and elsewhere. But it can also help to evaluate existing curricula like ours at Charite. This framework has the potential to support the design of comprehensive GH trainings, serving German aspirations in politics and academia to promote health worldwide.

This study aims to understand the priority-setting process of SRH interventions in the context of UHC, drawing on the Malaysian experience. A realist evaluation framework was adopted to examine the priority-setting process for three SRH tracer interventions: pregnancy, safe delivery and post-natal care; gender-based violence (GBV) services; and abortion-related services. The study used a qualitative multi-method design, including a literature and document review, and 20 in-depth key informant interviews, to explore the context-mechanism-outcome configurations that influenced and explained the priority-setting process. Four key advocacy strategies were identified for the effective prioritisation of SRH services, namely: (1) generating public demand and social support, (2) linking SRH issues with public agendas or international commitments, (3) engaging champions that are internal and external to the public health sector, and (4) reframing SRH issues as public health issues. While these strategies successfully triggered mechanisms, such as mutual understanding and increased buy-in of policymakers to prioritise SRH services, the level and extent of prioritisation was affected by both inner and outer contextual factors, in particular the socio-cultural and political context. Priority-setting is a political decision-making process that reflects societal values and norms. Efforts to integrate SRH services in UHC processes need both to make technical arguments and to find strategies to overcome barriers related to societal values (including certain socio-cultural and religious norms). This is particularly important for sensitive SRH services, like GBV and safe abortion, and for certain populations.

Women are at the forefront of improving health for conflict-affected populations through service delivery, education and capacity strengthening, advocacy and research. Women are also disproportionately affected by conflict and humanitarian emergencies. The growing evidence base demonstrating excess female morbidity and mortality reflects the necessity of evaluating the role of women in leadership driving health research, policy and programmatic interventions in conflict-related humanitarian contexts. Despite global commitments to improving gender equality, the issue of women leaders in conflict and humanitarian health has been given little or no attention. The aim of this paper focuses on three domains: importance, barriers and opportunities for women leaders in conflict and humanitarian health. Following thematic analysis of the material collected, we discuss the following themes: barriers of women's leadership domain at societal level, and organisational level, which is subcategorized into culture and strategy. Building on the available opportunities and initiatives and on inspirational experiences of the limited number of women leaders in this field, recommendations for empowering and supporting women's leadership in conflict health are presented. Methods A desk-based literature review of academic and grey sources was conducted followed by thematic analysis. Results There is very limited evidence on women leaders in conflict and humanitarian health. Some data shows that women have leadership skills that help to support more inclusive solutions which are incredibly important in this sector. However, deeply imbedded discrimination against women at the organisational, cultural, social, financial and political levels is exacerbated in conflict which makes it more challenging for women to progress in such settings. Conclusion Advocating for women leaders in conflict and health in the humanitarian sector, governmental bodies, academia and the global health community is crucial to increasing effective interventions that adequately address the complexity and diversity of humanitarian crises.

COVID-19, host response treatment, and the need for political leadership	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY			English	Review						COVID-19; Host response; Generic drugs; ACE2; Angiotensin receptor blockers; Statins	INFLUENZA	Health officials and scientists have warned that we face the threat of a potentially devastating influenza pandemic. Instead, we are now in the midst of a global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. National and international pandemic preparedness plans have focused on developing vaccines and antiviral treatments. Another way to confront the COVID-19 pandemic (and future pandemics) might be to treat patients with inexpensive and widely available generic drugs that target the host response to infection, not the virus itself. The feasibility of this idea was tested during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. This experience should inform our approach to treating COVID-19 patients. It could also save lives during outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases and episodes of everyday acute critical illness. If this "bottom up" syndromic approach to treating acute critical illness were shown to be effective, it could have a dramatic impact on health, equity and security throughout the world.

J	Sherratt, S				Sherratt, Sue			What are the implications of climate change for speech and language therapists?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS			English	Article						advocacy; prevention; climate change; equality of services; scope of practice; public health	HEALTH-CARE; NATURAL DISASTERS; COMMUNICATION DISABILITY; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; RECURRENT STROKE; WORLD REPORT; RISK; PEOPLE; CANCER	Background The emerging global issue of climate change has large-scale effects on health and well-being, including communication disorders. The broad range of the speech and language therapy profession's scope of practice incorporates prevention, advocacy and equality in service delivery. These act as a springboard for involvement in climate change and health. Aims This is an appeal to speech and language therapists (SLTs) to focus and take action on this issue and its considerable effects on communication and swallowing disorders. Methods & Procedures This article discusses the importance of taking a public health position on prevention and equality of services to manage environmental determinants of communication and swallowing disorders. It also describes the extent to which climate change affects these disorders and exacerbates the inequality of healthcare services in low- and middle-income countries. Main Contribution Five strategies are provided for action on fulfilling therapists' roles in reducing the incidence, development and exacerbation of climate-related communication and swallowing disorders, as well as the role of SLTs in acting as advocates. The case is made for expanding the scope of services to focus on prevention and service equality so as to best meet the needs of the wider community. Conclusions & Implications Despite other challenges currently facing SLTs, climate change and its increasing effects on communication disorders and dysphagia is difficult to ignore. SLTs owe it to their clients, the wider community, low- and middle-income countries, the economy, and the future to take action. What this paper adds What this paper adds to existing knowledgeWhat is already known on the subject What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities. The global effects will be higher temperatures, changes in precipitation, more droughts and heatwaves, stronger and more intense hurricanes, and a rising sea level which directly threaten the health of entire populations. Other health professions are beginning to take climate change into account in training and practice. Many disorders of communication and swallowing are caused or exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Increasing temperatures, extremes of precipitation, population displacement and air pollution contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, respiratory disease, malnutrition, premature birth, air- and water-borne diseases, and mental illness. These may affect the communication and swallowing abilities across the lifespan, but particularly those of children and older adults. SLTs' roles in prevention, advocacy and education act as a starting point for involvement in climate change and health. Three practical strategies for action include educating SLTs and other health professionals on climate change and its effects on communication and swallowing, promoting awareness with clients and their families, and gathering and disseminating reliable data.

Global prevalence of congenital heart disease in school-age children: a meta-analysis and systematic review	BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS			English	Review						Congenital heart disease; Prevalence; School children; Meta-analysis; National income	HAND-HELD ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; EISENMENGER-SYNDROME	BackgroundCongenital heart disease (CHD) is the commonest birth defect. Studies estimating the prevalence of CHD in school-age children could therefore contribute to quantifying unmet health needs for diagnosis and treatment, particularly in lower-income countries. Data at school age are considerably sparser, and individual studies have generally been of small size. We conducted a literature-based meta-analysis to investigate global trends over a 40-year period.Methods and resultsStudies reporting on CHD prevalence in school-age children (4-18 years old) from 1970 to 2017 were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Google Scholar. According to the inclusion criteria, 42 studies including 2,638,475 children, reporting the prevalence of unrepaired CHDs (both pre-school diagnoses and first-time school-age diagnoses), and nine studies including 395,571 children, specifically reporting the prevalence of CHD first diagnosed at school ages, were included. Data were combined using random-effects models. The prevalence of unrepaired CHD in school children during the entire period of study was 3.809 (95% confidence intervals 3.075-4.621)/1000. A lower proportion of male than female school children had unrepaired CHD (OR=0.84 [95% CI 0.74-0.95]; p=0.001). Between 1970-1974 and 1995-1999, there was no significant change in the prevalence of unrepaired CHD at school age; subsequently there was an approximately 2.5-fold increase from 1.985 (95% CI 1.074-3.173)/1000 in 1995-1999 to 4.832 (95% CI 3.425-6.480)/1000 in 2010-2014, (p=0.009). Among all CHD conditions, atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects chiefly accounted for this increasing trend. The summarised prevalence (1970-2017) of CHD diagnoses first made in childhood was 1.384 (0.955, 1.891)/1000; during this time there was a fall from 2.050 [1.362, 2.877]/1000 pre-1995 to 0.848 [0.626, 1.104]/1000 in 1995-2014 (p=0.04).ConclusionsGlobally, these data show an increased prevalence of CHD (mainly mild CHD conditions) recognised at birth/infancy or early childhood, but remaining unrepaired at school-age. In parallel there has been a decrease of first-time CHD diagnoses in school-age children. These together imply a favourable shift of CHD recognition time to earlier in the life course. Despite this, substantial inequalities between higher and lower income countries remain. Increased healthcare resources for people born with CHD, particularly in poorer countries, are required.

We investigated the relationship between EA and depressive symptoms in older individuals across four European regions. Methods We studied 108,315 Europeans (54% women, median age 63 years old) from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe assessing EA (seven educational levels based on International Standard Classification of Education [ISCED] classification) and depressive symptoms (>= 4 points on EURO-D scale). Logistic regression estimated the association between EA and depressive symptoms, adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related factors, testing for sex/age/region and education interactions. Results Higher EA was associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms, independent of sociodemographic and health-related factors. A threshold of the lowest odds of depressive symptoms was detected at the first stage of tertiary education (OR 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.65; p < 0.001; relative to no education). Central and Eastern Europe showed the strongest association (OR for high vs. low education 0.37; 95% CI 0.33-0.40; p < 0.001) and Scandinavia the weakest (OR for high vs. low education 0.69; 95% CI 0.60-0.80; p < 0.001). The association was strongest among younger individuals. There was a sex and education interaction only within Central and Eastern Europe. Conclusions Level of EA is reflected in later-life depressive symptoms, suggesting that supporting individuals in achieving EA, and considering those with lower EA at increased risk for depression, could lead to decreased burden of depression across the life course. Further educational support in Central and Eastern Europe may decrease the higher burden of depressive symptoms in women.

To improve access, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the integration of mental health services into primary care. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the types and characteristics of mental health services provided to migrants in primary care following resettlement in high-income countries. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Global Health, and other databases from 1 January 2000 to 15 April 2020. The inclusion criteria consisted of all studies published in English, reporting mental health services and practices for refugee, asylum seeker, or undocumented migrant populations, and were conducted in primary care following resettlement in high-income countries. The search identified 1627 citations and we included 19 studies. The majority of the included studies were conducted in North America. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed technology-assisted mental health screening, and one assessed integrating intensive psychotherapy and case management in primary care. There was a paucity of studies considering gender, children, seniors, and in European settings. More equity-focused research is required to improve primary mental health care in the context of global mental health.

There is a gap in the pharmacy literature in this regard. Through this commentary, authors will present a pathway for future global health researchers including generating ideas based on mutual needs of the partnership and the community; exploring the importance of regulations including the need to conduct research and partnership projects within the confines of each participant's professional scope of practice, expertise, and licensure; describing the need to develop agreements and the components that should be included in such an agreement; discussing ethical guidelines for research planning, obtaining ethical approval, and planning for adverse events; and illustrating ethical considerations for research implementation with considerations around consent, data collection, linking patients to care after the completion of the study, and dissemination. Global examples, with a pharmacy-specific approach where applicable, within each section highlight the importance of discussion and action around ethics and equity when pursuing collaborative research, recognizing that many of these situations involve difficult decisions.

J	Abebe, E				Abebe, Ephrem			Positioning global pharmacy research partnerships to advance health equity	RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY			English	Article							EDUCATION; MALARIA	Interest in global pharmacy research partnerships is growing, and many Schools and Colleges of Pharmacy are looking to expand their footprint in the global health arena. This will create opportunities for increased collaboration and synergy, but there will also be concerns for potential duplication and fragmentation. Such research partnerships also present unique opportunities for addressing unmet medication-related needs of populations around the word, especially for vulnerable populations living both in high income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pharmacy leaders and researchers engaged in global health partnerships or planning to start one can draw important lessons from other global health partnerships but also by studying the historical context and evolution of global health initiatives. To be meaningful, global pharmacy research partnerships must be grounded in local contexts and be sensitive to the myriad influences and actors that may determine success of their research endeavors, including health interventions. A deliberate and thoughtful investment in mentorship and faculty development for LMIC collaborators are also essential ingredients for sustainability of global research partnerships.

Virtually everyone is now familiar with the term Sustainable Development, from states to multinational corporations, and from affluent communities in the Global North to impoverished communities in the Global South. It received a new lease of life in 2015 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is recognized that sustainable development requires an inter-disciplinary, multi-level, and bottom-up approach, and that this ideal is easy to state but difficult to operationalize. Pursuant to deliberations at an international workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which aimed at fostering the exchange of ideas among diverse experts and developing solutions for effective inclusion of women and youth in climate change response strategies, we propose an innovative, practical three-dimensional model that enhances sustainability theory and practice with cross-cutting integration of human rights, gender equity, and Indigenous and local knowledge. We evaluate the utility of the model in two ways: First, we analyze how the model informs current approaches to environmental sustainability and human wellbeing including the SDGs, agroecology, de-growth principles, and planetary health metrics. Then, we explore the feasibility and added value of the approach through seven case studies from Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Malawi, Peru, Cote D'Ivoire, and Aotearoa-New Zealand. We conclude that the proposed model is congruent with current theory and practice. It builds on existing principles by identifying and addressing gaps. It enables practical action in a variety of settings and fosters a more integrated approach to sustainable wellbeing for humanity and our earth. We recommend continued development of this theoretical framework and related guidelines for program design, implementation and evaluation.

J	Townsend, B; Friel, S; Baker, P; Baum, F; Strazdins, L				Townsend, Belinda; Friel, Sharon; Baker, Phillip; Baum, Fran; Strazdins, Lyndall			How can multiple frames enable action on social determinants? Lessons from Australia's paid parental leave	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						paid parental leave; social policy; social determinants of health; healthy public policy	GLOBAL HEALTH; POLICY; EQUITY	How do public health advocates and practitioners encourage policy actors to address the social determinants of health? What strategies can be used to elevate healthy social policies onto government agendas? In this paper, we examine the case of Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, announced in 2009 after decades of policy advocacy. This scheme provides job-protected leave and government-funded pay at the minimum wage for 18weeks for eligible primary care givers on the birth of an infant, and has been shown to reduce health inequities. Drawing on documentary sources and interviews (n=25) with key policy actors, this paper traces the evolution of this landmark social policy in Australia, focusing on the role of actors, institutions and policy framings in setting the policy agenda. We find that advocates strategically deployed three different framings-for economy, gender equality and health-to drive paid parental leave onto the Government's agenda. They navigated barriers linked to power, gender ideology and cost, shifting tactics along the way by adopting different frames in various institutional settings and broadening their coalitions. Health arguments varied in different institutional settings and, at times, advocates selectively argued the economic or gender equality framing over health. The case illustrates the successful use of strategic pragmatism to provoke action, and raises broader lessons for advancing action on the social determinants of health. In particular, the case highlights the importance of adopting multiple synergistic policy framings to draw support from non-traditional allies and building coalitions to secure public policy change.

J	Tsang, VWL; Loh, L				Tsang, Vivian W. L.; Loh, Lawrence			Using a Health Equity Lens to Evaluate Short-Term Experiences in Global Health (STEGH)	ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; CARE; ELECTIVES	Background: The growing popularity of short-term experiences in global health (STEGH) has given rise to increasing criticism around their purported benefits and outcomes. With the global health and development community's growing focus on improving population health and equity worldwide as outlined in the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals, there is a growing opportunity to examine and optimize the conduct of STEGH using an outcomes and equity focused lens. Objectives: This viewpoint aims to develop a framework that can be used to plan and evaluate STEGH on outcomes underpinned by a health equity focus. Methods: Drawing on logic model theory, the analysis first identifies extant issues and their drivers around the planning, implementation, and evaluation of tradition STEGH (focused on clinical service provision.) The analysis then explores various definitions of health equity, settling on a broad definition around context that promotes health for all as opposed to equity of access to healthcare services. With that definition as the ultimate benchmark of success, the analysis then proposes questions that can be used to determine how and when a STEGH might best be deployed to meet that goal. Findings: Traditional reliance on process outputs from service-based approaches have historically limited an understanding of if and how STEGH might advance health equity. Using an outcomes-focused approach identifies critical questions around the value of such experiences, when weighed against a broad definition of equity and other key global health themes such as sustainability, cultural humility, and impact. Measuring STEGH against the goal of improving population health status and equity worldwide allows careful consideration of the appropriateness and effectiveness of such efforts on their own and in concert with other interventions. Conclusions: The extent to which health equity is advanced should be the ultimate metric used to evaluate not only STEGH, but any global health endeavours.	[Tsang, Vivian W.

As countries move forward with measures to combat climate change and adapt to its impacts, it is critical to understand how these efforts can be designed and implemented in ways that can respect, protect, and fulfill the human rights of disabled persons. Drawing on the human rights model of disability enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we set out a disability rights approach to climate governance that identifies the differential impacts of climate change for disabled persons and outlines the principles, obligations, and standards for designing and adopting accessible climate mitigation and adaptation policies and programs. On the whole, we argue that States should identify and pursue synergies between the realization of disability rights and the pursuit of initiatives to decarbonize their economies as well as prepare their societies against future climate impacts. In addition to fulfilling the rights of persons with disabilities and fostering a more inclusive world, disabilityinclusive climate solutions can have resonant outcomes that can enable a greater share of the population to contribute to the emergence of carbon neutrality and enhance the climate resilience of society as whole.

In aggregate terms, agriculture has been very successful in ensuring that global food production has more than kept pace with global population growth over recent decades. However, in recent years concerns have intensified about the quality, equity, sustainability and resilience of the food system. Only around one-third of all people on Earth are eating a healthy diet. The food system is the biggest user and polluter of land and water, the biggest driver of habitat and biodiversity loss, and on track to be the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus and the resultant COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the systemic risks to human health from current food production and distribution systems. How to produce more, healthier and safer food, much more efficiently and sustainably, in more difficult climates, and how to share it more equitably, is an existential challenge for humanity. Australian science, and rangeland science in particular, is well-placed to play a leadership role across the Indo-Pacific in this endeavour. The Australian innovation system in agriculture and natural resource management has long had to contend with highly variable climates and extreme weather events, to produce competitive products for global markets with minimal subsidies. The know-how, and associated policies and institutions developed in doing so, are a strategic national asset and an important element of Australian soft power in our region.

Implementation of Antibiotic Discovery by Student Crowdsourcing in the Valencian Community Through a Service Learning Strategy	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						antibiotic discovery; student crowdsourcing; antimicrobial resistance; service learning; soil bacteria; geolocation; Natura project; gender equality	SOIL; CULTIVATION; RESISTANCE; BACTERIA; FIELD	Antibiotic misuse is a public health problem due to the appearance of resistant strains in almost all human pathogens, making infectious diseases more difficult to treat. The search for solutions requires the development of new antimicrobials as well as novel strategies, including increasing social awareness of the problem. The Small World Initiative (SWI) and the Tiny Earth (TE) network are citizen science programs pursuing the discovery of new antibiotics from soil samples and the promotion of scientific culture. Both programs aim to bring scientific culture and microbiological research closer to pre-university students through a crowdsourcing strategy and a Service Learning (SL) educational approach, with a 2-fold objective: to encourage students to pursue careers in science and to involve them in the discovery of soil microorganisms producing new antimicrobials. SWI and TE projects were put into practice in Spain under the common name MicroMundo. MicroMundo@Valencia was implemented at the Universitat de Valencia (UV) during the academic years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. It trained 140 university students to disseminate this initiative into 23 high/secondary schools, and one primary school, involving about 900 people (teachers and students) as researchers. A total of 7,002 bacterial isolates were obtained from 366 soil samples and tested for antibiosis at UV and high/secondary school centers. About 1 or 7% of them produced inhibition halos for the Escherichia coli or Bacillus cereus target strains, respectively. Geolocation of sampling sites by an application developed ad hoc and Kriging analysis also allowed detection of soil foci of antibiotic-producing bacteria. Evaluation of the project by university, high/secondary, and primary school students revealed their strong positive perception and their increased interest in science, as a consequence of acquiring new scientific and pedagogical concepts and skills that they were able to pass on to other classmates, younger students, or relatives. To further expand the dissemination of the project in the Valencian Community, diverse extramural activities deemed to include a gender perspective and aimed at different age groups, were also carried out, obtaining very satisfactory results, increasing sensitivity and awareness to the global antibiotic crisis.

Global progress remains a general indicator as it is unclear if access is equitable across groups of the population. Agenda 2030 calling for `leaving no one behind', there is a need to focus on the variations of access in different groups of the population, especially in the context of low- and middle-income countries including Malawi. We analyzed data from Demographic Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) to describe emerging trends on progress and inequalities in water supply and sanitation services over a 25-year period (1992-2017), as well as to identify the most vulnerable populations in Malawi. Data were disaggregated with geographic and socio-economic characteristics including regions, urban and rural areas, wealth and education level. Analysis of available data revealed progress in access to water and sanitation among all groups of the population. The largest progress was generally observed in the groups that were further behind at the baseline year, which likely reflects good targeting in interventions/improvements to reduce the gap in the population. Overall, results demonstrated that some segments of the population - foremost poorest Southern rural populations - still have limited access to water and are forced to practise open defecation. Finally, we suggest including standardized indicators that address safely managed drinking water and sanitation services in future surveys and studies to increase the accuracy of national estimates.

Yet COVID-19 seems to have brought up new rules and approaches. Through document and critical discourse analysis, it emerges that there has been a surge in COVID-19 vaccines and treatments nationalism. Global solidarity is threatened, with the USA, United Kingdom, European Union and Japan having secured 1.3 billion doses of potential vaccines as of August 2020. Vaccines ran out even before their approval with three candidates from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca having shown good Phase III results in November 2020. Rich countries have gone years ahead in advance vaccines and treatments purchases. This is a testimony that the 2030 AfSD, especially SDG 3 focusing on health will be difficult to achieve. Low-income countries are left gasping for survival as the COVID-19 pandemic relegates them further into extreme poverty and deeper inequality. The paper recommends the continued mobilisation by the World Health Organisation and other key stakeholders in supporting the GAVI vaccine alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (COVAX) global vaccines initiative that seeks to make two billion vaccine doses available to 92 low and middle-income countries by December 2021.

Through the process of writing, we create a safe space to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic exposes our gendered, intersectional lives. Our writing gives voice to suppressed thoughts and embodied affects as they surface in relation to entrenched structural inequalities where we witness the marginalization of intersectional difference, in our case women, the feminine, and race in academia and neoliberal society. By rendering visible the structural inequalities that have become amplified during the pandemic, and the ways in which these inequalities have affected our everyday lives, we are able to give witness to intersectional differences. Our multi-vocal embodied text is offered as an emancipatory, affective mobilization of our lives, encompassing feelings of grief, loss, fear, anger, frustration, and vulnerability. This collective piece of writing gives rise to solidarity in a crisis-stricken world where we choose to live with hope.

Japanese Families and COVID-19: "Self-Restraint", Confined Living Spaces, and Enhanced Interactions	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE FAMILY STUDIES			English	Article						COVID-19; Japan; families; students; relationships; interactions		COVID-19 is transforming how families and societies respond to this public health crisis. This global public health issue has both short and long term ramifications for how people work, go to school, care for families, and communicate. This paper provides a portrait of the changes and effects brought upon by the pandemic and government appeals for "self-restraint" (as opposed to lockdown policies in other countries). In addition, the experiences of Japanese families from the perspective of university students, looking at several aspects such as work, schooling, and relationships. The observations suggest that there are notable impacts upon the Japanese family brought upon by new living arrangements. These include increased interactions and opportunities for more frequent communication between family members. On the other hand, significant issues including financial insecurity caused by reduced or stagnant incomes, tensions between family members due to work-at-home lifestyles, exacerbate existing problems faced by Japanese families. The stress from new living arrangements in small dwellings may have further intensified gender inequality in the division of housework and carework, and become a catalyst for greater strain in relationships. This paper provides an assessment of the current changes experienced by Japanese families based on news reports and statistical data, as well as perceptions of the pandemic from Japanese university students.

VERDC.; VIGNA-SUBTERRANEA; PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; SOIL-MOISTURE; COMMON BEANS; WEST-AFRICA; QUALITY; STORAGE	Rapid population growth, climate change, intensive monoculture farming, and resource depletion are among the challenges that threaten the increasingly vulnerable global agri-food system. Heavy reliance on a few major crops is also linked to a monotonous diet, poor dietary habits, and micronutrient deficiencies, which are often associated with diet-related diseases. Diversification-of both agricultural production systems and diet-is a practical and sustainable approach to address these challenges and to improve global food and nutritional security. This strategy is aligned with the recommendations from the EAT-Lancet report, which highlighted the urgent need for increased consumption of plant-based foods to sustain population and planetary health. Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.), an underutilized African legume, has the potential to contribute to improved food and nutrition security, while providing solutions for environmental sustainability and equity in food availability and affordability. This paper discusses the potential role of Bambara groundnut in diversifying agri-food systems and contributing to enhanced dietary and planetary sustainability, with emphasis on areas that span the value chain: from genetics, agroecology, nutrition, processing, and utilization, through to its socioeconomic potential. Bambara groundnut is a sustainable, low-cost source of complex carbohydrates, plant-based protein, unsaturated fatty acids, and essential minerals (magnesium, iron, zinc, and potassium), especially for those living in arid and semi-arid regions. As a legume, Bambara groundnut fixes atmospheric nitrogen to improve soil fertility. It is resilient to adverse environmental conditions and can yield on poor soil. Despite its impressive nutritional and agroecological profile, the potential of Bambara groundnut in improving the global food system is undermined by several factors, including resource limitation, knowledge gap, social stigma, and lack of policy incentives. Multiple research efforts to address these hurdles have led to a more promising outlook for Bambara groundnut; however, there is an urgent need to continue research to realize its full potential.

The goal of global health projects is to improve health for all people and address health inequities. Short-term projects lasting days to months can create challenges for volunteers and hosts. Despite attempting to do good, volunteer efforts may unwittingly cause harm to host organizations by planning projects without consideration for the local infrastructure, the community, and the health care staff. Although well-intentioned and often beneficial, volunteer efforts can fail to provide adequate follow-up or may disrupt or override local health efforts. In some low-resource settings, dire health needs and lack of supervision may result in volunteers practicing beyond their professional scope. Recently published guidelines, competencies, and position statements have addressed ethical behaviors for short-term global health experiences. Partnerships that are founded on principles of justice and autonomy provide an avenue for mutual collaboration. Short-term global health projects that focus on host needs are likely to strengthen local capacity to improve health outcomes. This article reviews guidelines for short-term global health experiences and addresses the ethical principles for planning effective projects.

Our objective was to evaluate differences in rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality (SMM&M) by rurality and race, and examine these trends over time. Materials and Methods: It involves the retrospective cohort study of delivery hospitalizations from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2017 from the National Inpatient Sample. We identified delivery hospitalizations using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis and procedure codes and diagnosis-related groups. We used hierarchical regression models controlling for insurance status, income, age, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics to model odds of SMM&M. Results: The eligible cohort contained 4,494,089 delivery hospitalizations. Compared with women from small cities, women in the most urban and most rural areas had higher odds of SMM&M (urban adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [1.04-1.14]; noncore rural aOR 1.24 [1.18-1.31]). Among White women, the highest odds of SMM&M were in noncore rural counties (aOR 1.20 [1.12-1.27]), while among Black women the highest odds were in urban (aOR 1.21 [1.11-1.31]) and micropolitan areas (aOR 1.36 [1.19-1.57]). Findings were similar for Hispanic, Native American, and other race women. Rates of SMM&M increased from 2012 to 2017, especially among urban patients. Conclusions: Women in the most urban and most rural counties experienced higher odds of SMM&M, and these relationships differed by race. These findings suggest particular areas for clinical leaders and policymakers to target to reduce geographic and racial disparities in maternal outcomes.

This compensation involves numerous ethical complexities, at times entailing competing risks. In the context of transnational research, often incorporating contexts of economic inequality, power differentials and post-colonialism, these issues extend into wider questions of ethical research conduct. Methods: We describe experiences of conducting a community-based study of air pollution in southern Malawi incorporating ethnographic, participatory and air quality monitoring elements. Decisions surrounding participant compensation evolved in response to changing circumstances in the field. Results: Attention to careful researcher-participant relationships and responsiveness to community perspectives allowed dynamic, contextualised decision-making around participant compensation. Despite widely cited risks, including but not restricted to undue influence of monetary compensation on participation, we learned that failure to adequately recognise and compensate participants has its own risks, notably the possibility of 'ethics dumping'. Conclusions: We recommend active engagement with research participants and communities with integration of contextual insights throughout, including participant compensation, as for all elements of research conduct. Equitable research relationships encompass four central values: fairness, care, honesty and respect.

J	Adewuyi, EO; Auta, A				Adewuyi, Emmanuel O.; Auta, Asa			Medical injection and access to sterile injection equipment in low- and middle-income countries: a meta-analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys (2010-2017)	INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						blood-borne infections; low- and middle-income countries; medical injection; sterile injection equipment	HEPATITIS-C; GLOBAL BURDEN; DRUG-USE; DISEASE; PREVENTION; HIV	Background: Unsafe injection practices contribute to increased risks of blood-borne infections, including human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of medical injections as well as assess the level of access to sterile injection equipment by demographic factors in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: We carried out a meta-analysis of nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) conducted between 2010 and 2017 in 39 LMICs. Random effects meta-analysis was used in estimating pooled and disaggregated prevalence. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 14 and Microsoft Excel 2016. Results: The pooled 12-month prevalence estimate of medical injection was 32.4% (95% confidence interval 29.3-35.6). Pakistan, Rwanda and Myanmar had the highest prevalence of medical injection: 59.1%, 56.4% and 53.0%, respectively. Regionally, the prevalence of medical injection ranged from 13.5% in west Asia to 42.7% in south and southeast Asia. The pooled prevalence of access to sterile injection equipment was 96.5%, with Pakistan, Comoros and Afghanistan having comparatively less prevalence: 86.0%, 90.3% and 90.9%, respectively. Conclusions: Overuse of medical injection and potentially unsafe injection practices remain a considerable challenge in LMICs. To stem the tides of these challenges, national governments of LMICs need to initiate appropriate interventions, including education of stakeholders, and equity in access to quality healthcare services.

Health inequality in the tropics and its costs: a Sustainable Development Goals alert	INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						inequality; macroeconomic costs; tropics	NATURAL DISASTERS; GEOGRAPHY; SYSTEMS	Background: It is known that health impacts economic performance. This article aims to assess the current state of health inequality in the tropics, defined as the countries located between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, and estimate the impact of this inequality on gross domestic product (GDP). Methods: We constructed a series of concentration indices showing between-country inequalities in disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs), taken from the Global Burden of Disease Study. We then utilized a non-linear least squares model to estimate the influence of health on GDP and counterfactual analysis to assess the GDP for each country had there been no between-country inequality. Results: The poorest 25% of the tropical population had 68% of the all-cause DALYs burden in 2015; 82% of the communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional DALYs burden; 55% of the non-communicable disease DALYs burden and 61% of the injury DALYs burden. An increase in the all-cause DALYs rate of 1/1000 resulted in a 0.05% decrease in GDP. If there were no inequality between countries in all-cause DALY rates, most high-income countries would see a modest increase in GDP, with low- and middle-income countries estimated to see larger increases. Conclusions: There are large and growing inequalities in health in the tropics and this has significant economic cost for lower-income countries.

Opportunities and Challenges of Embracing Green City Principles in Saudi Arabia Future Cities	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Green city; sustainable development; built environment	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; ENERGY; HEALTH; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK	In the modern era, population and economic growth have accelerated urban sprawl in Saudi Arabia. This has placed tremendous pressure on the country's natural resources, including water, energy, and raw materials. Hence, the conventional means of expanding the built environment is no longer appropriate, as it has been found to be one of major causes of climate change and global warming. In the early 1970s, the principles of sustainable development emerged in developed countries, in order to remedy this global issue. During this period, Saudi Arabia experienced dramatic development in all of its industries, but the principles of sustainable development were, to a large degree, overlooked. However, there is now an ambitious Vision 2030 for Saudi Arabia, one of the purposes of which is to promote greater sustainability in the country. This study seeks to assist decision makers to identify the challenges and opportunities of the current Saudi practices of city design, and their related operational aspects, and to enable the adoption of effective measures for implementing sustainable development principles. Employing an ethnographic research methodology, the fieldwork concerned includes a public perception survey, followed by a site inspection, in order to develop an insider's view of the current level of sustainable practice in the city of Najran. A public survey is distributed to well-informed citizens, with the goal of obtaining their insights, and to assess their willingness to embrace green city practices. This is followed by a site inspection visit that seeks to obtain in-depth information regarding site design and operational practices. A checklist of sustainable criteria is adapted from well-known systems. The major outcomes of the study reveal that many challenges are encountered the application of green city principles. The paper offers effective approaches and strategic actions for overcoming these challenges.

J	Waitzkin, H				Waitzkin, Howard			COVID-19 as Cause versus Trigger for the Collapse of Capitalism	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article						COVID-19; global economy; capitalism; pandemic; ideology; economics		According to the official narrative of COVID-19, the pandemic has caused the global capitalist economy to collapse, or at least to enter a deep recession and possibly a great depression. Assigning blame to a virus takes attention away from the structural contradictions and instabilities of capitalism that would have led to a crash in any case. This narrative also helps justify non-evidence-based public health policies, including lockdowns, travel bans, closed schools and factories, and forced quarantines of large populations rather than individuals and clustered groups who harbor the infection. Advantages of such drastic measures happen primarily in countries that did not prepare adequately, that did not respond quickly enough with more focused measures to test and isolate people infected with the virus, and that have health care systems either organized by capitalist principles or suffering cutbacks and privatization as a result of capitalist economic ideologies, such as austerity. Authoritarian tactics purportedly intended to protect public health pave the way to antidemocratic rule, militarism, and fascism. These harsh policies also exert their most adverse effects on poor, minority, incarcerated, immigrant, and otherwise marginalized populations, who already suffer from the worsening economic inequality that global, financialized capitalism has fostered.

Recognising and responding to intimate partner violence using telehealth: Practical guidance for nurses and midwives	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						guidance; health care; intimate partner violence; mobile health; nursing; quality assurance; referral and consultation; screening; telehealth	COMPASSION FATIGUE; INTERVENTION; ADAPT; DISPARITIES; TECHNOLOGY; POPULATION; COVID-19; SUPPORT; EQUITY; ACCESS	Aims: To synthesise the current, global evidence-informed guidance that supports nurses and midwives to recognise and respond to intimate partner violence (IPV), and how these practices can be translated from face-to-face encounters to care that is delivered through telehealth. Background: COVID-19-related social and physical distancing measures increase the risk for individuals who are socially isolated with partners who perpetuate violence. Providing support through telehealth is one strategy that can mitigate the pandemic of IPV, while helping patients and providers stay safe from COVID-19. Design and Methods: In this discursive paper, we describe how practical guidance for safely recognising and responding to IPV in telehealth encounters was developed. The ADAPT-ITT (Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical Experts, Integration, Testing, Training) framework was used to guide the novel identification and adaptation of evidence-informed guidance. We focused on the first six stages of the ADAPT-ITT framework. Conclusions: This paper fills a gap in available guidance, specifically for IPV recognition and response via telehealth. We present strategies for prioritising safety and promoting privacy while initiating, managing or terminating a telehealth encounter with patients who may be at risk for or experiencing IPV. Strategies for assessment, planning and intervention are also summarised. System-level responses, such as increasing equitable access to telecommunication technology, are also discussed. Relevance to clinical practice Integrating innovative IPV-focused practices into telehealth care is an important opportunity for nurses and midwives during the current global COVID-19 pandemic. There are also implications for future secondary outbreaks, natural disasters or other physically isolating events, for improving healthcare efficiency, and for addressing the needs of vulnerable populations with limited access to health care.

Analysis of COVID-19 Cases' Spatial Dependence in US Counties Reveals Health Inequalities	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						coronavirus; COVID-19; spatial autocorrelation; health rankings; neighborhood	LOCAL INDICATORS; SICK LEAVE; INFECTION; INFLUENZA; CHINA; CARE	On March 13, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 a pandemic. Since then the virus has infected over 9.1 million individuals and resulted in over 470,000 deaths worldwide (as of June 24, 2020). Here, we discuss the spatial correlation between county population health rankings and the incidence of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the United States. We analyzed the spread of the disease based on multiple variables at the county level, using publicly available data on the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, intensive care unit beds and socio-demographic, and healthcare resources in the U.S. Our results indicate substantial geographical variations in the distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths across the US counties. There was significant positive global spatial correlation between the percentage of Black Americans and cases of COVID-19 (Moran I = 0.174 and 0.264, p < 0.0001). A similar result was found for the global spatial correlation between the percentage of Black American and deaths due to COVID-19 at the county level in the U.S. (Moran I = 0.264, p < 0.0001). There was no significant spatial correlation between the Hispanic population and COVID-19 cases and deaths; however, a higher percentage of non-Hispanic white was significantly negatively spatially correlated with cases (Moran I = -0.203, p < 0.0001) and deaths (Moran I = -0.137, p < 0.0001) from the disease. This study showed significant but weak spatial autocorrelation between the number of intensive care unit beds and COVID-19 cases (Moran I = 0.08, p < 0.0001) and deaths (Moran I = 0.15, p < 0.0001), respectively. These findings provide more detail into the interplay between the infectious disease and healthcare-related characteristics of the population. Only by understanding these relationships will it be possible to mitigate the rate of spread and severity of the disease.

While awareness of South-South medical travels has increased, only a few studies investigated this phenomenon in depth from the perspective of sending countries. This article aims to contribute to these studies by reporting findings from a qualitative study of medical travels from Cambodia and associated costs. Data collection primarily involved interviews with Cambodian patients returning from Thailand and Vietnam, conducted in 2017 in the capital Phnom Penh and two provinces, and interviews with key informants in the local health sector. The research findings show that medical travels from Cambodia are driven and shaped by an interplay of socio-economic, cultural and health system factors at different levels, from the effects of regional trade liberalization to perceptions about the quality of care and the pressure of relatives and other advisers in local communities. Furthermore, there is a diversity of medical travels from Cambodia, ranging from first class travels to international hospitals in Bangkok and cross-border `medical tourism' to perilous overland journeys of poor patients, who regularly resort to borrowing or liquidating assets to cover costs. The implications of the research findings for health sector development and equitable access to care for Cambodians deserve particular attention. To some extent, the increase in medical travels can stimulate improvements in the quality of local health services. However, concerns remain that these developments will mainly affect high-cost private services, widening disparities in access to care between population groups.

While substantial effort has gone into the conceptualization of health system resilience, there has been no review of how the concept has been operationalized in empirical studies. We conducted an empirical review in three databases using systematic methods. Findings were synthesized using descriptive quantitative analysis and by mapping aims, findings, underlying concepts and measurement approaches according to the resilience definition by Blanchet et al. We identified 71 empirical studies on health system resilience from 2008 to 2019, with an increase in literature in recent years (62% of studies published since 2017). Most studies addressed a specific crisis or challenge (82%), most notably infectious disease outbreaks (20%), natural disasters (15%) and climate change (11%). A large proportion of studies focused on service delivery (48%), while other health system building blocks were sidelined. The studies differed in terms of their disciplinary tradition and conceptual background, which was reflected in the variety of concepts and measurement approaches used. Despite extensive theoretical work on the domains which constitute health system resilience, we found that most of the empirical literature only addressed particular aspects related to absorptive and adaptive capacities, with legitimacy of institutions and transformative resilience seldom addressed. Qualitative and mixed methods research captured a broader range of resilience domains than quantitative research. The review shows that the way in which resilience is currently applied in the empirical literature does not match its theoretical foundations. In order to do justice to the complexities of the resilience concept, knowledge from both quantitative and qualitative research traditions should be integrated in a comprehensive assessment framework. Only then will the theoretical `resilience idea' be able to prove its usefulness for the research community.

Data on ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Census data was used to calculate rates of within-country migration at the district level. We calculated differences in PM2.5 exposure between "current" (2016-2017) and "origin" (2012) districts for each migration patterns. Using an exposure-response relationship for PM2.5 extracted from a meta-analysis, and mortality rates from the Peruvian Ministry of Health, we quantified premature mortality attributable to each migration pattern. Changes in outdoor PM2.5 exposure were observed between 2012 and 2016 with highest levels of PM2.5 in the Department of Lima. A strong spatial autocorrelation of outdoor PM2.5 values (Moran's I=0.847, p-value=0.001) was observed. In Greater Lima, rural-to-urban and urban-to-urban migrants experienced 10-fold increases in outdoor PM2.5 exposure in comparison with non-migrants. Changes in outdoor PM2.5 exposure due to migration drove 137.1 (95%CI: 93.2, 179.4) premature deaths related to air pollution, with rural-urban producing the highest risk of mortality from exposure to higher levels of ambient air pollution. Our results demonstrate that the rural-urban and urban-urban migrant groups have higher rates of air pollution-related deaths.

Across the Arctic, patients' interactions with the healthcare system are influenced by challenges of access, historical inequities and social determinants. This scoping review sought to describe the range and nature of peer-reviewed literature on patient experience studies conducted within the circumpolar region. Design In a partnership between Danish/Greenlandic, Canadian and American research teams, a scoping review of published research exploring patient experiences in circumpolar regions was undertaken. Data sources Seven electronic databases were queried: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, 'Global Health 1910 to 2019 Week 11', CINAHL, PsycINFO and SveMed+. Eligibility criteria Articles were eligible for inclusion if they (a) took place in the circumpolar region, (b) reported patients' perspective and (c) were focussed primarily on patient experiences with care, rather than satisfaction with treatment outcome. Data extraction and synthesis Title and abstract screening, full-text review and data extraction was conducted by four researchers. Bibliometric information such as publication date and country of origin was extracted, as was information regarding study design and whether or not the article contained results relevant to the themes of Indigenous values, rural and remote context, telehealth and climate change. Two researchers then synthesised and characterised results relevant to these themes. Results Of the 2824 articles initially found through systematic searches in seven databases, 96 articles were included for data extraction. Findings from the review included unique features related to Indigenous values, rural and remote health, telehealth and climate change. Conclusions The review findings provide an overview of patient experiences measures used in circumpolar nations. These findings can be used to inform health system improvement based on patient needs in the circumpolar context, as well as in other regions that share common features. This work can be further contextualized through Indigenous methodologies such as sharing circles and community based participatory methods.

Mobile primary health care clinics for Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States: a systematic scoping review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Review						Global health; Health services; Indigenous health; Mobile health clinics; Primary health care	1ST NATIONS INDIVIDUALS; COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; SCREENING SERVICE; IMPROVING ACCESS; PROGRAM; IMPLEMENTATION; CHILDREN; PEOPLES; COMPLICATIONS; QUEENSLAND	Background Mobile clinics have been used to deliver primary health care to populations that otherwise experience difficulty in accessing services. Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States experience greater health inequities than non-Indigenous populations. There is increasing support for Indigenous-governed and culturally accessible primary health care services which meet the needs of Indigenous populations. There is some support for primary health care mobile clinics implemented specifically for Indigenous populations to improve health service accessibility. The purpose of this review is to scope the literature for evidence of mobile primary health care clinics implemented specifically for Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Methods This review was undertaken using the Joanna Brigg Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology. Review objectives, inclusion criteria and methods were specified in advance and documented in a published protocol. The search included five academic databases and an extensive search of the grey literature. Results The search resulted in 1350 unique citations, with 91 of these citations retrieved from the grey literature and targeted organisational websites. Title, abstract and full-text screening was conducted independently by two reviewers, with 123 citations undergoing full text review. Of these, 39 citations discussing 25 mobile clinics, met the inclusion criteria. An additional 14 citations were snowballed from a review of the reference lists of included citations. Of these 25 mobile clinics, the majority were implemented in Australia (n = 14), followed by United States (n = 6) and Canada (n = 5). No primary health mobile clinics specifically for Indigenous people in New Zealand were retrieved. There was a pattern of declining locations serviced by mobile clinics with an increasing population. Furthermore, only 13 mobile clinics had some form of evaluation. Conclusions This review identifies geographical gaps in the implementation of primary health care mobile clinics for Indigenous populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. There is a paucity of evaluations supporting the use of mobile clinics for Indigenous populations and a need for organisations implementing mobile clinics specifically for Indigenous populations to share their experiences. Engaging with the perspectives of Indigenous people accessing mobile clinic services is imperative to future evaluations.

Menstrual health is an integral part of overall health because between menarche and menopause, most women menstruate. Yet for tens of millions of women around the world, menstruation regularly and often catastrophically disrupts their physical, mental, and social well-being. Enhancing our understanding of the underlying phenomena involved in menstruation, abnormal uterine bleeding, and other menstruation-related disorders will move us closer to the goal of personalized care. Furthermore, a deeper mechanistic understanding of menstruation-a fast, scarless healing process in healthy individuals-will likely yield insights into a myriad of other diseases involving regulation of vascular function locally and systemically. We also recognize that many women now delay pregnancy and that there is an increasing desire for fertility and uterine preservation. In September 2018, the Gynecologic Health and Disease Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened a 2-day meeting, "Menstruation: Science and Society" with an aim to "identify gaps and opportunities in menstruation science and to raise awareness of the need for more research in this field." Experts in fields ranging from the evolutionary role of menstruation to basic endometrial biology (including omic analysis of the endometrium, stem cells and tissue engineering of the endometrium, endometrial microbiome, and abnormal uterine bleeding and fibroids) and translational medicine (imaging and sampling modalities, patient-focused analysis of menstrual disorders including abnormal uterine bleeding, smart technologies or applications and mobile health platforms) to societal challenges in health literacy and dissemination frameworks across different economic and cultural landscapes shared current state-of-the-art and future vision, incorporating the patient voice at the launch of the meeting. Here, we provide an enhanced meeting report with extensive up-to-date (as of submission) context, capturing the spectrum from how the basic processes of menstruation commence in response to progesterone withdrawal, through the role of tissue-resident and circulating stem and progenitor cells in monthly regeneration-and current gaps in knowledge on how dysregulation leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and other menstruation-related disorders such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, and fibroids-to the clinical challenges in diagnostics, treatment, and patient and societal education. We conclude with an overview of how the global agenda concerning menstruation, and specifically menstrual health and hygiene, are gaining momentum, ranging from increasing investment in addressing menstruation-related barriers facing girls in schools in low- to middle-income countries to the more recent "menstrual equity" and "period poverty" movements spreading across high-income countries.

In 2010, the principle of proportionate universalism (PU) has been proposed as a solution to reduce health inequalities. It had a great resonance but does not seem to have been widely applied and no guidelines exist on how to implement it. The two specific objectives of this scoping review were: (1) to describe the theoretical context in which PU was established, (2) to describe how researchers apply PU and related methodological issues. Methods. We searched for all articles published until 6th of February 2020, mentioning "Proportionate Universalism" or its synonyms "Targeted universalism" OR "Progressive Universalism" as a topic in all Web of Science databases. Results. This review of 55 articles allowed us a global vision around the question of PU regarding its theoretical foundations and practical implementation. PU principle is rooted in the social theories of universalism and targeting. It proposes to link these two aspects in order to achieve an effective reduction of health inequalities. Regarding practical implementation, PU interventions were rare and led to different interpretations. There are still many methodological and ethical challenges regarding conception and evaluation of PU interventions, including how to apply proportionality, and identification of needs. Conclusion. This review mapped available scientific literature on PU and its related concepts. PU principle originates from social theories. As highlighted by authors who implemented PU interventions, application raises many challenges from design to evaluation. Analysis of PU applications provided in this review answered to some of them but remaining methodological challenges could be addressed in further research.

The interaction between COVID-19 and the drop in economic activity will lead to increased food insecurity within and across countries. Higher food insecurity may act as a multiplier for the epidemic due to its negative health effects and increased migration. Research has shown that food insecurity affects within-country and cross-border migration. Besides the mean prevalence rate, the distribution of food insecurity affects the migration decision. The impacts of COVID-19 are particularly strong for people in the lower tail of the food-insecurity distribution. In the current context, the effect of food insecurity therefore could be increased migration, including both rural-urban migration and international migration. Importantly, the crisis might lead to a structural break in migration patterns. People might avoid heavily affected COVID-19 destination countries (e.g., United States, Italy, or Spain) and move to other countries. Due to the persistent nature of migration flows, this could have long-lasting effects.

Method Bibliographic databases and grey literature were searched using systematic review methodology and the machine learning tool "Abstrackr." Results Fifty-four relevant articles and reports published from 2010 to 2019 were identified. Nearly all (n = 53) were from high-income countries. Mortality disparities were apparent and consistent across countries and publication years, with no evidence of a decrease over time. People with ID can still expect to live 12-23 years less than the general population and are particularly vulnerable to deaths from respiratory infections and epilepsy. Conclusions Both population and individual-level approaches to prevention are indicated to tackle the continuing mortality disparities in people with ID, including consideration of reasonable adjustments in general population efforts to reduce health inequalities.

In India, childhood immunization is a priority health strategy with suboptimal uptake. Objective: To assess study feasibility and key implementation outcomes for the Tika Vaani model, a new approach to educate and empower beneficiaries to improve immunization and child health. Methods: A cluster-randomized pilot trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio was conducted in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, from January to September 2018. Villages were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. In each participating village, surveyors conducted a complete enumeration to identify eligible households and requested participation before randomization. Interventions were designed through formative research using a social marketing approach and delivered over 3 months using strategies adapted to disadvantaged populations: (1) mobile health (mHealth): entertaining educational audio capsules (edutainment) and voice immunization reminders via mobile phone and (2) face-to-face: community mobilization activities, including 3 small group meetings offered to each participant. The control group received usual services. The main outcomes were prespecified criteria for feasibility of the main study (recruitment, randomization, retention, contamination, and adoption). Secondary endpoints tested equity of coverage and changes in intermediate outcomes. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics to assess feasibility, penalized logistic regression and ordered logistic regression to assess coverage, and generalized estimating equation models to assess changes in intermediate outcomes. Results: All villages consented to participate. Gaps in administrative data hampered recruitment; 14.0% (79/565) of recorded households were nonresident. Only 1.4% (8/565) of households did not consent. A total of 387 households (184 intervention and 203 control) with children aged 0 to 12 months in 26 villages (13 intervention and 13 control) were included and randomized. The end line survey occurred during the flood season; 17.6% (68/387) of the households were absent. Contamination was less than 1%. Participation in one or more interventions was 94.0% (173/184), 78.3% (144/184) for the face-to-face strategy, and 67.4% (124/184) for the mHealth strategy. Determinants including place of residence, mobile phone access, education, and female empowerment shaped intervention use; factors operated differently for face-to-face and mHealth strategies. For 11 of 13 intermediate outcomes, regression results showed significantly higher basic health knowledge among the intervention group, supporting hypothesized causal mechanisms. Conclusions: A future trial of a new intervention model is feasible. The interventions could strengthen the delivery of immunization and universal primary health care. Social and behavior change communication via mobile phones proved viable and contributed to standardization and scalability. Face-to-face interactions remain necessary to achieve equity and reach, suggesting the need for ongoing health system strengthening to accompany the introduction of communication technologies.

J	Legido-Quigley, H; Chuah, FLH; Howard, N				Legido-Quigley, Helena; Leh Hoon Chuah, Fiona; Howard, Natasha			Southeast Asian health system challenges and responses to the 'Andaman Sea refugee crisis': A qualitative study of health-sector perspectives from Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Thailand	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article								Author summary Why was this study done? Relatively little is known about how health systems in Southeast Asia have responded to the challenges of forced migration and refugee-related health. We wanted to identify health system barriers, facilitators, and implications of existing health policies. What did the researchers do and find? We conducted semistructured interviews of policy-makers, experts, healthcare professionals, and academics with professional experience in refugee and asylum-seeker health. We used interpretive methods to identify health issues, barriers, and facilitators across the migratory journey. Participants recommended regional and multisectoral approaches led by national governments, recognising refugee and asylum-seeker contributions, and promoting inclusion and livelihoods. What do these findings mean? Inclusion of forcibly displaced populations remains difficult in these four countries despite their significant contributions to host-country economies. Potential benefits of migrant-inclusive approaches extend beyond preventing disease to improving social equity, livelihood, and population wellness. Background Southeast Asian countries host signficant numbers of forcibly displaced people. This study was conducted to examine how health systems in Southeast Asia have responded to the health system challenges of forced migration and refugee-related health including the health needs of populations affected by forced displacement; the health systems-level barriers and facilitators in addressing these needs; and the implications of existing health policies relating to forcibly displaced and refugee populations. This study aims to fill in the gap in knowledge by analysing how health systems are organised in Southeast Asia to address the health needs of forcibly displaced people. Methods and findings We conducted 30 semistructured interviews with health policy-makers, health service providers, and other experts working in the United Nations (n = 6), ministries and public health (n = 5), international (n = 9) and national civil society (n = 7), and academia (n = 3) based in Indonesia (n = 6), Malaysia (n = 10), Myanmar (n = 6), and Thailand (n = 8). Data were analysed thematically using deductive and inductive coding. Interviewees described the cumulative nature of health risks at each migratory phase. Perceived barriers to addressing migrants' cumulative health needs were primarily financial, juridico-political, and sociocultural, whereas key facilitators were many health workers' humanitarian stance and positive national commitment to pursuing universal health coverage (UHC). Across all countries, financial constraints were identified as the main challenges in addressing the comprehensive health needs of refugees and asylum seekers. Participants recommended regional and multisectoral approaches led by national governments, recognising refugee and asylum-seeker contributions, and promoting inclusion and livelihoods. Main study limitations included that we were not able to include migrant voices or those professionals not already interested in migrants. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is one of the first qualitative studies to investigate the health concerns and barriers to access among migrants experiencing forced displacement, particularly refugees and asylum seekers, in Southeast Asia. Findings provide practical new insights with implications for informing policy and practice. Overall, sociopolitical inclusion of forcibly displaced populations remains difficult in these four countries despite their significant contributions to host-country economies.

The Gini coefficient as a useful measure of malaria inequality among populations	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Inequality; Epidemiology; Heterogeneity; Statistical index; Infection; Prevalence; Public helath		Background Understanding inequality in infectious disease burden requires clear and unbiased indicators. The Gini coefficient, conventionally used as a macroeconomic descriptor of inequality, is potentially useful to quantify epidemiological heterogeneity. With a potential range from 0 (all populations equal) to 1 (populations having maximal differences), this coefficient is used here to show the extent and persistence of inequality of malaria infection burden at a wide variety of population levels. Methods First, the Gini coefficient was applied to quantify variation among World Health Organization world regions for malaria and other major global health problems. Malaria heterogeneity was then measured among countries within the geographical sub-region where burden is greatest, among the major administrative divisions in several of these countries, and among selected local communities. Data were analysed from previous research studies, national surveys, and global reports, and Gini coefficients were calculated together with confidence intervals using bootstrap resampling methods. Results Malaria showed a very high level of inequality among the world regions (Gini coefficient, G = 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.81), more extreme than for any of the other major global health problems compared at this level. Within the most highly endemic geographical sub-region, there was substantial inequality in estimated malaria incidence among countries of West Africa, which did not decrease between 2010 (G = 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.36) and 2018 (G = 0.31, 0.22-0.39). There was a high level of sub-national variation in prevalence among states within Nigeria (G = 0.30, 95% CI 0.26-0.35), contrasting with more moderate variation within Ghana (G = 0.18, 95% CI 0.12-0.25) and Sierra Leone (G = 0.17, 95% CI 0.12-0.22). There was also significant inequality in prevalence among local village communities, generally more marked during dry seasons when there was lower mean prevalence. The Gini coefficient correlated strongly with the standard coefficient of variation, which has no finite range. Conclusions The Gini coefficient is a useful descriptor of epidemiological inequality at all population levels, with confidence intervals and interpretable bounds. Wider use of the coefficient would give broader understanding of malaria heterogeneity revealed by multiple types of studies, surveys and reports, providing more accessible insight from available data.

J	Rodenhäuser, T				Rodenhaeuser, Tilman			The legal protection of persons living under the control of non-State armed groups	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE RED CROSS			English	Article						non-State armed groups; armed groups; international humanitarian law; human rights law; nexus; non-international armed conflict; governance; COVID-19; scope of application		In recent non-international armed conflicts in countries such as the Central African Republic, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen, various non-State armed groups (NSAGs) have exercised control over territory and people living therein. In many cases, and for a variety of reasons, NSAGs perform some form of governance in these territories, which can include the maintenance of order or the provision of justice, health care, or social services. The significance of such measures became particularly apparent when in 2020 not only governments but also armed groups took steps to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. This article examines key legal issues that arise in these contexts. First, it analyzes the extent to which international humanitarian law protects the life and dignity of persons living under the control of NSAGs, rebutting doubts as to whether this field of international law has a role in regulating what is sometimes called "rebel governance". Second, it provides a brief overview of aspects of the lives of people in armed group-controlled territory that are addressed by international humanitarian law and aspects that instead fall into the realm of human rights law. Third, the article discusses whether and to what extent human rights law can be said to bind NSAGs as a matter of law and flags issues that need further attention in current and future debates.

The contribution of service density and proximity to geographical inequalities in health care utilisation in Indonesia: A nation-wide multilevel analysis	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							ACCESS; BARRIERS; COST	Background Geographical inequalities in access to health care have only recently become a global health issue. Little evidence is available about their determinants. This study investigates the associations of service density and service proximity with health care utilisation in Indonesia and the parts they may play in geographic inequalities in health care use. Methods Using data from a nationally representative survey (N = 649625), we conducted a cross-sectional study and employed multilevel logistic regression to assess whether supply-side factors relating to service density and service proximity affect the variability of outpatient and inpatient care utilisation across 497 Indonesian districts. We used median odds ratios (MORs) to estimate the extent of geographical inequalities. Changes in the MOR values indicated the role played by the supply-side factors in the inequalities. Results Wide variations in the density and proximity of health care services were observed between districts. Outpatient care utilisation was associated with travel costs (odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70-0.97). Inpatient care utilisation was associated with ratios of hospital beds to district population (OR= 1.23, 95% CI = 1.05-1.43) and with travel times (OR = 0.72 95% CI = 0.61-0.86). All in all, service density and proximity provided little explanation for district-level geographic inequalities in either outpatient (MOR = 1.65, 95% Crl = 1.59-1.70 decreasing to 1.61, 95% Crl = 1.56-1.67) or inpatient care utilisation (MOR= 1.63, 95% Crl =1.55-1.69 decreasing to 1.60 95% Crl =1.54-1.66). Conclusions Supply-side factors play important roles in individual health care utilisation but do not explain geographical inequalities. Variations in other factors, such as the price and responsiveness of services, may also contribute to the inequalities. Further efforts to address geographical inequalities in health care should go beyond the physical presence of health care infrastructures to target issues such as regional variations in the prices and responsiveness of services.

Building on this advocacy, in the late 1990s, countries such as Sweden, Norway and New Zealand designed HPE curricula that address social justice. However, limited research has focused specifically on the enactment of social justice in HPE practice. Drawing on a larger international project involving Sweden, Norway and New Zealand the aim of this article is therefore to explore the constitution of social justice pedagogies across these three different HPE contexts and more specifically how HPE teaching practice may be understood from regulative, normative and cultural perspectives on social justice. The data reported on in this paper were generated from educational acts, curriculum documents, observations of HPE lessons in each of the three countries and follow-up teacher interviews. In order to analyse the data, we employed Scott's (2008. Institutions and organizations: Ideas and interests (3rd ed). Sage) institutional theory to further understand and discuss the enactment of social justice across the three different countries in HPE practice. In our representation and analysis of the findings we draw attention to how social justice pedagogies are informed differently by institutionalised governing systems and therefore they may be enacted differently by teachers in different societies. In particular, we highlight the influence of (i) regulative; (ii) normative; (iii) cultural-cognitive elements on practice. We conclude by pointing out the complex interplay between regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive elements that both enable and constrain HPE teachers' enactments of social justice in HPE practice.

Geospatial Mapping of International Neurosurgical Partnerships and Evaluation of Extent of Training and Engagement	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Capacity; Disparities; Epidemiology; Inequalities; Neurosurgery; Partnerships	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; GLOBAL SURGERY; HEALTH; CARE; EDUCATION; BARRIERS; BURDEN; NEED	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence, extent, and temporality of transnational neurosurgical partnerships, to understand and inform measures to address neurosurgical deficiencies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: A Web search was conducted to identify actors from high-income countries (HICs) participating in neurosurgical delivery and/or capacity-building with LMICs from 2010 to 2018. Descriptive data on current neurosurgical partnerships were collected from published case reports, literature reviews, reports from academic institutions, and information on stakeholder Web pages. The level of training and engagement of each partnership was separately graded based on prespecified criteria, in which grade 3 represented partnerships that have most extensive training and engagement, and grade 1, the least extent. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and geospatially depicted on ArcMap GIS software. RESULTS: A total of 123 unique HIC-LMIC partnerships were described. Of these partnerships, 85 (69%) are derived from HICs in North America, followed by Europe, with 23 (19%). The most common LMIC partners were from Africa (n = 56, 45%) and Latin America (n = 32, 26%). In addition, most partnerships provided services in pediatric neurosurgery (88%). The most frequent engagement classifications were grade 2 (35 degrees/0) or 1 (36%). Similarly, for training, the most common classifications were grade 1 (40%) or 2 (30%). CONCLUSIONS: A robust network of HIC-LMIC partnerships exists with varying degrees of engagement and training activities. Several regions are particularly suitable for growth and development. Systematic consolidation and indexing of transnational neurosurgical partnerships aim to enhance resource allocation and present opportunities for future partnership.

The aim of our study is to examine whether the trend can be explained by compositional changes within the population or contextual changes in the relationships between explanatory variables and BMI. Data from the Health Survey for England for 2002-2004 and 2012-2014 were used. BMI was our outcome variable and explanatory variables included age, sex, race, education, occupation, and physical activity. We examined how predictors of BMI varied at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles using unconditional quantile regressions. Oaxaca-Blinder type decomposition analysis was then applied to examine whether contextual or compositional explanations accounted for changes in the distribution between time periods. We found that changes in the nature of relationships observed by our coefficient values accounted for the majority of the difference in BMI at the 90th percentile in 2012-2014 compared to 2002-2004. Race, physical activity, and socio-economic status were the primary reasons for explaining the continued growth of the right tail of the BMI distribution. Compositional changes in the population were less influential, but may have offset some of the contextual changes to relationships. Changing relationships between predictors of BMI reflect systematic changes in the determinants of BMI, leading to the widening of the BMI distribution. Our results demonstrate the importance of multi-tiered policies aimed at tackling the varying influences across the BMI distribution.

As evidenced by the current global pandemic, access to reliable online health-related information and the ability to apply that information is critical to achieving health equity. Through a qualitative study on how Latino families collaborate to access online health resources, this work frames health literacy as a family-level mechanism. Interviews with parent-child dyads combined with online search tasks reveal how families integrate their individual skillsets to obtain, process, and understand online information about illnesses, symptoms, and even medical diagnoses. As they engage in intergenerational online health information searching and brokering, families creatively navigate information and communication technologies (ICTs) to address a range of health needs. Bilingual children help immigrant parents obtain urgent and non-urgent health information needed to care for other family members. When children are tasked with addressing a health need critical to their parent's wellbeing, they collaborate with their parents to obtain, interpret, and apply online health information. Intergenerational online health information searching and brokering thus reveals family-level strengths that can be leveraged to promote both health and digital literacy among marginalized populations.

As Chile is increasingly becoming a receiving country of South-South migration, immigrants face mental health inequities, with regards to outcomes and access to care. In order to identify and synthetize mental healthcare inequities faced by international migrants with regards to locals in Chile, a narrative review of the literature on national mental healthcare policies in Chile and a narrative review of the literature on migrants' mental healthcare in Chile were conducted, with a focus on describing mental health outcomes, policy environment and persisting gaps and barriers for both topics. The existing literature on mental healthcare in Chile, both for the general population and for international migrants, following the social determinant of health framework and categorised in terms of i) Inequities in mental health outcomes; ii) Description of the mental health policy environment and iii) Identification of the main barriers to access mental healthcare. Despite incremental policy efforts to improve the reach of mental healthcare in Chile, persisting inequities are identified for both locals and international migrants: lack of funding and low prioritisation, exacerbation of social vulnerability in the context of a mixed health insurance system, and inadequacy of mental healthcare services. International migrants may experience specific layers of vulnerability linked to migration as a social determinant of health, nested in a system that exacerbates social vulnerability. Based on the findings, the article discusses how mental health is a privilege for migrant populations as well as locals experiencing layers of social vulnerability in the Chilean context.

Herein, we attend to the generalization of this action throughout the world, specifically in its quest to reduce mortality and avoid infections. Considering the impact on the right to education from a global perspective, this article discusses how COVID-19 has exacerbated inequalities and pre-existing problems in education systems around the world. Therefore, the institutional responses to guaranteeing remote continuity of the teaching-learning process during this educational crisis was compared regionally through international databases. Three categories of analysis were established: infrastructure and equipment, both basic and computer-based, as well as internet access of schools; preparation and means of teachers to develop distance learning; and implemented measures and resources to continue educational processes. The results showed an uneven capacity in terms of response and preparation to face the learning losses derived from school closure, both in low-income regions and within middle- and high-income countries. We concluded that it is essential to articulate inclusive educational policies that support strengthening the government response capacity, especially in low-income countries, to address the sustainability of education.

J	Bernabé, E; Marcenes, W				Bernabe, Eduardo; Marcenes, Wagner			Can minimal intervention dentistry help in tackling the global burden of untreated dental caries?	BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ATRAUMATIC RESTORATIVE TREATMENT; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; ORAL CONDITIONS; 195 COUNTRIES; DISEASES; LIFE; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; DISABILITY; INJURIES	The latest estimates from the Global Burden of Disease study show that dental caries remains a neglected global health issue, with over two billion people suffering the consequences of this highly preventable disease globally. The two main goals of a national health system are to improve population health and reduce health inequalities, which are often achieved through prevention and promotion for everyone, as well as treatment and rehabilitation for the sick. Oral health promotion should be integrated with national policies for the prevention of non-communicable diseases, especially those targeting the intake of free sugars. The ongoing debate on universal health coverage (UHC) offers a unique opportunity to align dental care with essential health services, which all countries are expected to provide. Minimal intervention dentistry (MID) protocols for management of carious lesions, such as the atraumatic restorative technique, silver diamine fluoride and the Hall Technique, could help tackle the global burden of untreated caries as they are cost- effective in the long run. However, the successful implementation in primary dental care and training the new cadre of dentists adequately are pending issues if MID is to facilitate the inclusion of dental care as part of the UHC agenda.

DFS has recently been associated with adverse effects that could further impair the quality of life of diabetic patients, and increase the social and economic burden, morbidity, and premature mortality of the disease. The main physio-pathological basis of DFS is due to diabetes induced neuropathy and angiopathy in the lower limbs and feet. Patients diagnosed with DFS must significantly modify their daily habits in order to cope with signs and symptoms of DFS and this can alter their quality of life. The objective of this review is to summarize the evidence regarding the economic, physical and social limitations which can affect the quality of life (QoL) in patients with DES, the effects of ulcers and amputations on QoL outcomes. Results: Different aspects related to DFS such as physical alterations, psychological complaints and even disorders, socio-economic difficulties can affect the quality of life of these patients. However, the QoL related to low socio-economic factors gave mixed results and physical activity, education and type of footwear can influence the outcomes. There is a general gender-dependent higher prevalence of DFS in men, although it depends on the geographical area. DFS often co-occurs with other diabetes-induced complications (retinopathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular disorders') and comorbid obesity generally worsens it. Conclusion: Accessibility to health services aimed at reducing inequalities and constant health education and promotion and care regarding psychological and socio-economic issues should he continuously undertaken for individuals with DFS in order to improve their QoL.

Cardiovascular disease risk factors in Spain: A comparison of native and immigrant populations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ETHNIC-MINORITY GROUPS; HEART-DISEASE; GLOBAL BURDEN; SOCIAL-CLASS; HEALTH; OBESITY; ACCULTURATION; NETHERLANDS; CONSUMPTION; MORTALITY	Cardiovascular disease (CDV) risk factors are highly prevalent among adults with low social class in Spain. However, little is known on how these factors are distributed in the immigrant population, a socio-economic disadvantaged population. Thus, this study aims to examine inequalities in CVD risk factors among immigrant and native populations. We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 and used log-binomial regression to quantify the association of immigrant status on CVD risk factors among adults aged 25-64 years. The probabilities of having at least three CVD risk factors were higher for immigrants from Eastern Europe (PR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.15-1.35) and lower for immigrants from Africa (PR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.69-0.89) when compared with natives. The association of immigrant status and CVD risk factors varies with educational attainment (p-interaction = 0.001). Immigrants from Eastern Europe with low educational attainment have a higher probability of having at least three CVD risk factors compared with their native counterparts. In contrast, immigrants from Africa and Latin America with low educational attainment had a protective effect against having at least three CVD risk relative to natives. Health prevention and promotion strategies to reduce the burden of CVD taking should account for educational attainment given its differential effect among the immigrant population in Spain.

This criminal activity causes several negative effects on human health (zoonoses), animal health and welfare, market protection, consumer fraud and may be used as tool of agro/bio-terrorism. Illegal animal trade can facilitate the spread of zoonoses that are defined as diseases and infections that are transmitted by vertebrate animals to man. Humans are affected by more than 1,700 known pathogens: 60% of existing human infectious diseases are zoonotic and at least 75% of emerging infectious diseases of humans have an animal origin and 72% of zoonoses originate from wildlife or exotic animals. The Bio-Crime Project was developed in 2017 by Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (Italy) and Land Carinthia (Austria) together with other public institutions to combat illegal animal trade and to reduce the risk of disease transmission from animals to humans. Project partners agreed that a multi-agency approach was required to tackle the illegal animal trade that was high value, easy to undertake and transnational crime. The Bio-crime model of cross-border cooperation introduces the novel approach of replicating the cooperative framework given by the triad of Veterinary Public Health, Justice and Law Enforcements/Customs across borders using the International Police and Custom Cooperation Centres (IPCCCs) as a connection link among public entities of the neighbor countries. This model has been recognized as a best practice at European level because it can be easily replicated and scaled up without any supplementary cost for Member States.

We define a value as a quality or standard which a CE project is aiming for, whilst a principle is an objective which underpins the value and facilitates its achievement. The values of Clarity, Creativity, (being) Evidence-led, Equity, Interdisciplinarity, Sustainability and Flexibility were identified by a network of 40 researchers and practitioners who utilise CE approaches to tackle complex One Health challenges including, but not limited to, AMR. We present our understanding of these seven values and their underlying principles as a flexible tool designed to support stakeholders within CE for AMR projects. We include practical guidance on working toward each value, plus case studies of the values in action within existing AMR interventions. Finally, we consider the extent to which CE approaches are appropriate to tackle AMR challenges. We reflect on these in relation to the tool, and current literature for both CE and AMR research. Authors and co-producers anticipate this tool being used to scene-set, road map and trouble shoot the development, implementation, and evaluation of CE projects to address AMR and other One Health challenges. However, the tool is not prescriptive but responsive to the context and needs of the community, opening opportunity to build a truly collaborative and community-centred approach to AMR research.

Starting from the structured health injustice suffered by migrant workers during the pandemic and its impact on the health of others in both destination and source countries, I argue here for re-structuring the system for educating and distributing care workers around what I call a global ecological ethic. Rather than rely on a system that privileges nationalism, that is unjust, and that sustains and even worsens injustice, including health injustice, and that has profound consequences for global health, a global ecological ethic would have us see health as interdependent and aim at "ethical place-making" across health ecosystems to enable people everywhere to have the capability to be healthy.

J	Cordeiro-Rodrigues, L				Cordeiro-Rodrigues, Luis			Social Justice for Public Health: The COVID-19 Response in Portugal	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						Portugal; COVID-19; Social justice; Prisons; Immigrants; Domestic violence; Economic austerity; Public health	BRAZIL	The COVID-19 pandemic requires emergency policies to be put in place in order to avoid a global health catastrophe. At the same time, there has been an increasing preoccupation that argues urgent policies for public health neglect social justice. By looking at Portugal's successful confinement case during the early stages of the pandemic, I argue that ethically driven social justice policies are not just compatible but also an instrumentally important element in addressing this pandemic in an effective way. The Portuguese case study suggests that enhancing social justice towards socio-economically vulnerable groups correlates with the prevention of the spread of COVID-19; these benefits to public health can be explained by the fact that those policies create social distancing and less exposure to the COVID-19 virus and other contagious diseases and also remove disincentives to the use of healthcare services.

A country-level comparison of access to quality surgical and non-surgical healthcare from 1990-2016	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MORTALITY; MIDDLE	Background The Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) index, developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, uses estimates of amenable mortality to quantify health system performance over time. While much is known about general health system performance globally, few studies have portrayed the performance of surgical systems. In order to quantify access to quality surgical care, evaluate changes over time, and link these changes to health care investments, surgical and non-surgical Health Access and Quality sub-indices were developed. Design We categorized 32 amenable mortality causes as either surgical or non-surgical conditions. Using principal components analysis and scaled amenable mortality rates, we constructed a surgical and non-surgical Health Access and Quality sub-index. Using these sub-indices, relative improvement over time was compared. An expenditure model with country fixed effects was built to explore drivers of differences in relative improvement of sub-indices. Results Compared to low-income countries, high-income countries have been 2.77 times more effective at improving surgical care (p < .05). Government expenditure on healthcare has a larger effect on improving surgical Health Access and Quality (p < 0.05) while development assistance for health has a larger effect on improving non-surgical Health Access and Quality (p < 0.05). Conclusions and relevance Global health investment must prioritize strengthening health systems as opposed to the historically favored vertical programming. In order to achieve health equity in low-income countries, more focus should be placed on domestic financing of surgical systems. Health Access and Quality sub-indices can be used by countries to identify targets, monitor progress, and evaluate interventions aimed at improving access to quality surgical healthcare.

As practitioners, researchers and policy-makers grapple with the local health impacts of climate change, there is an increasing need to clarify key terminology to support public health actors engage and respond in ways that promote intersectoral collaboration. This contribution introduces the public health discourse on climate change, with a particular focus on its implications for health equity. After defining key terms and existing adaptation practices, climate justice and assets-oriented inquiry into the intersectional determinants of health are discussed as future opportunities for addressing health equity in climate and health-related research and practice.

In Burundi, the Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) is 25 per 1000 live births. However, high quality evidence on the over time evolution of inequality in NMR is lacking. This study aims to address the knowledge gap by systematically and comprehensively investigating inequalities in NMR in Burundi with the intent to help the country attain SDG 3.2 which aims to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births by 2030. Methods The Burundi Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data for the periods of 2010 and 2016 were used for the analyses. The analyses were carried out using the WHO's HEAT version 3.1 software. Five equity stratifiers: economic status, education, residence, sex and subnational region were used as benchmark for measuring NMR inequality with time over 6 years. To understand inequalities from a broader perspective, absolute and relative inequality measures, namely Difference, Population Attributable Risk (PAR), Ratio, and Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) were calculated. Statistical significance was measured by computing corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). Results NMR in Burundi in 2010 and 2016 were 36.7 and 25.0 deaths per 1000 live births, respectively. We recorded large wealth-driven (PAR = -3.99, 95% CI; - 5.11, - 2.87, PAF = -15.95, 95% CI; - 20.42, - 11.48), education related (PAF = -6.64, 95% CI; - 13.27, - 0.02), sex based (PAR = -1.74, 95% CI; - 2.27, - 1.21, PAF = -6.97, 95% CI; - 9.09, - 4.86), urban-rural (D = 15.44, 95% CI; 7.59, 23.29, PAF = -38.78, 95% CI; - 45.24, - 32.32) and regional (PAR = -12.60, 95% CI; - 14.30, - 10.90, R = 3.05, 95% CI; 1.30, 4.80) disparity in NMR in both survey years, except that urban-rural disparity was not detected in 2016. We found both absolute and relative inequalities and significant reduction in these inequalities over time - except at the regional level, where the disparity remained constant during the study period. Conclusion Large survival advantage remains to neonates of women who are rich, educated, residents of urban areas and some regions. Females had higher chance of surviving their 28th birthday than male neonates. More extensive work is required to battle the NMR gap between different subgroups in the country.

At the same time, gender is recognised as a key determinant of health and an important axis of health inequalities. To date, there has been limited attention paid to the ways in which the CDoH engage with and impact on gender inequalities and health. This review seeks to address this gap by examining evidence on the practices and strategies of two industries-tobacco and alcohol-and their interaction with gender, with a particular focus on women. We first describe the practices by which these industries engage with women in their marketing and corporate social responsibility activities, reinforcing problematic gender norms and stereotypes that harm women and girls. We then examine how tobacco and alcohol companies contribute to gender inequalities through a range of strategies intended to protect their market freedoms and privileged position in society. By reinforcing gender inequalities at multiple levels, CDoH undermine the health of women and girls and exacerbate global health inequalities.

This was a cross-sectional study using pooled data Nigeria Demographic and Health Surveys from years 2008, 2013 and 2018. Participants were 52,654 women of reproductive age who reported at least one birth in the five years preceding the surveys. The outcome variables were late attendance, first contact after first trimester and less than four antenatal visits using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The overall prevalence of late timing was 74.8% and that of insufficient ANC visits was 46.7%. In the multivariable regression analysis; type of residency, geo-political region, educational level, household size, use of contraceptives, distance to health service, exposure to the media and total number of children were found to be significantly associated with both late and insufficient ANC attendance. About half of the pregnant women failed to meet the recommendation of four ANC visits. Investing on programs to improve women's socio-economic status, addressing the inequities between urban and rural areas of Nigeria in regard to service utilization, and controlling higher fertility rates may facilitate the promotion of ANC service utilization in Nigeria.

Beyond drawing parallels between the cholera epidemics and the current crisis, the article argues for combining imperial and social histories in order to write richer and more grounded histories of internationalism. It explores this historiographical and methodological challenge by analysing the boardrooms of the international sanitary conferences, Middle Eastern quarantine stations catering for Mecca pilgrims, and ocean steamships aiming to move without delay during a worldwide health crisis.

However, relatively little is known about responses to these epidemics. Robust evaluations can generate evidence on response efforts and inform future improvements. This systematic review aimed to (i) identify epidemics reported in low-income and crisis settings, (ii) determine the frequency with which evaluations of responses to these epidemics were conducted, (iii) describe the main typologies of evaluations undertaken and (iv) identify key gaps and strengths of recent evaluation practice. Methods Reported epidemics were extracted from the following sources: World Health Organization Disease Outbreak News (WHO DON), UNICEF Cholera platform, Reliefweb, PROMED and Global Incidence Map. A systematic review for evaluation reports was conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Web of Science, WPRIM, Reliefweb, PDQ Evidence and CINAHL Plus databases, complemented by grey literature searches using Google and Google Scholar. Evaluation records were quality-scored and linked to epidemics based on time and place. The time period for the review was 2010-2019. Results A total of 429 epidemics were identified, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. A total of 15,424 potential evaluations records were screened, 699 assessed for eligibility and 132 included for narrative synthesis. Only one tenth of epidemics had a corresponding response evaluation. Overall, there was wide variability in the quality, content as well as in the disease coverage of evaluation reports. Conclusion The current state of evaluations of responses to these epidemics reveals large gaps in coverage and quality and bears important implications for health equity and accountability to affected populations. The limited availability of epidemic response evaluations prevents improvements to future public health response. The diversity of emphasis and methods of available evaluations limits comparison across responses and time. In order to improve future response and save lives, there is a pressing need to develop a standardized and practical approach as well as governance arrangements to ensure the systematic conduct of epidemic response evaluations in low-income and crisis settings.

Predictors of Burnout and Depression in Surgeons Practicing in East, Central, and Southern Africa	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Global surgery; Surgeon burnout; Surgeon depression; Surgery in Africa	HEALTH-CARE; PHYSICIAN BURNOUT; WORKFORCE; VALIDITY; SATISFACTION; EXPERIENCE; CAPTURE; STRESS	Background: Surgeons are at risk of burnout and depression, which can lead to medical errors, inefficiency, exhaustion, conflicts, and suicide. Significant challenges exist in sub-Saharan Africa that may increase the prevalence of burnout and depression, but no formal evaluation has identified stressors specific to this environment. Methods: A survey was distributed to all members of the College of Surgeons of East, Central, and Southern Africa (COSECSA). Burnout, depression, and stressors were assessed with validated measures: Maslach Burnout Inventory for Medical Personnel, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9, and Holmes-Rahe Life Stress Inventory. Results: There were 131 participants (98 African and 33 non-African surgeons). The incidence of moderate to severe depression was 48% (n = 63), and the incidence of burnout was as high as 38% (n = 48). There were no significant differences between African and non-African surgeons in marital status, number of children, partners in practice, or distribution of time. More African surgeons experienced birth of a child (18% versus 3%, P = 0.04) but had less workplace conflict (7.1% versus 10.7%, P = 0.045) than non-African surgeons. African surgeons more consistently felt they were positively influencing others (P = 0.008), enjoyed working with patients (P = 0.009), and were more satisfied (P = 0.04). For all surgeons, predictors of increased PHQ-9 depression were serious professional conflict (P = 0.02), difficulty accessing childcare (P = 0.04), and racial discrimination (P = 0.003). In the Maslach model, predictors of burnout were difficulty accessing childcare (P = 0.05) and denial of promotion based on gender (P = 0.006). Conclusions: Burnout and depression in surgeons practicing in East, Central, and Southern Africa are substantial. Despite significant challenges, African surgeons tended to have a more positive outlook on their work. Improvements can be made to reduce burnout and depression by focusing on work conditions, equality of promotion opportunities, work-place conflict management, childcare support, and increasing the numbers of surgeons in practice.

The experiences of female surgeons around the world: a scoping review	HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH			English	Review						Female surgeon; Gender equity; Women in surgery; Surgeons; Female; Surgical &#160; workforce; Global surgery	WOMEN SURGEONS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; ACADEMIC SURGERY; LIFE-STYLE; PRACTICE PATTERNS; PLASTIC SURGEONS; MEDICAL-STUDENTS; SURGICAL CAREER; UNITED-STATES; CHILD-CARE	Introduction The Lancet Commission for Global Surgery identified an adequate surgical workforce as one indicator of surgical care accessibility. Many countries where women in surgery are underrepresented struggle to meet the recommended 20 surgeons per 100,000 population. We evaluated female surgeons' experiences globally to identify strategies to increase surgical capacity through women. Methods Three database searches identified original studies examining female surgeon experiences. Countries were grouped using the World Bank income level and Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI). Results Of 12,914 studies meeting search criteria, 139 studies were included and examined populations from 26 countries. Of the accepted studies, 132 (95%) included populations from high-income countries (HICs) and 125 (90%) exclusively examined populations from the upper 50% of GGGI ranked countries. Country income and GGGI ranking did not independently predict gender equity in surgery. Female surgeons in low GGGI HIC (Japan) were limited by familial support, while those in low income, but high GGGI countries (Rwanda) were constrained by cultural attitudes about female education. Across all populations, lack of mentorship was seen as a career barrier. HIC studies demonstrate that establishing a critical mass of women in surgery encourages female students to enter surgery. In HICs, trainee abilities are reported as equal between genders. Yet, HIC women experience discrimination from male co-workers, strain from pregnancy and childcare commitments, and may suffer more negative health consequences. Female surgeon abilities were seen as inferior in lower income countries, but more child rearing support led to fewer women delaying childbearing during training compared to North Americans and Europeans. Conclusion The relationship between country income and GGGI is complex and neither independently predict gender equity. Cultural norms between geographic regions influence the variability of female surgeons' experiences. More research is needed in lower income and low GGGI ranked countries to understand female surgeons' experiences and promote gender equity in increasing the number of surgical providers.

J	Plouffe, V; Bicaba, F; Bicaba, A; Druetz, T				Plouffe, Veronique; Bicaba, Frank; Bicaba, Abel; Druetz, Thomas			User fee policies and women's empowerment: a systematic scoping review	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Women's empowerment; women's agency; User fee policies; Access to healthcare; Systematic review; Low- and middle-income countries	UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE; FACILITY-BASED DELIVERY; DECISION-MAKING; REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; CHILD-MORTALITY; RURAL WOMEN; CARE; IMPACT; SERVICES; AUTONOMY	BackgroundOver the past decade, an increasing number of low- and middle-income countries have reduced or removed user fees for pregnant women and/or children under five as a strategy to achieve universal health coverage. Despite the large number of studies (including meta-analyses and systematic reviews) that have shown this strategy's positive effects impact on health-related indicators, the repercussions on women's empowerment or gender equality has been overlooked in the literature. The aim of this study is to systematically review the evidence on the association between user fee policies in low- and middle-income countries and women's empowerment.MethodsA systematic scoping review was conducted. Two reviewers conducted the database search in six health-focused databases (Pubmed, CAB Abstracts, Embase, Medline, Global Health, EBM Reviews) using English key words. The database search was conducted on February 20, 2020, with no publication date limitation. Qualitative analysis of the included articles was conducted using a thematic analysis approach. The material was organized based on the Gender at Work analytical framework.ResultsOut of the 206 initial records, nine articles were included in the review. The study settings include three low-income countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Sierra Leone) and two lower-middle countries (Kenya, India). Four of them examine a direct association between user fee policies and women's empowerment, while the others address this issue indirectly -mostly by examining gender equality or women's decision-making in the context of free healthcare. The evidence suggests that user fee removal contributes to improving women's capability to make health decisions through different mechanisms, but that the impact is limited. In the context of free healthcare, women's healthcare decision-making power remains undermined because of social norms that are prevalent in the household, the community and the healthcare centers. In addition, women continue to endure limited access to and control over resources (mainly education, information and economic resources).ConclusionUser fee removal policies alone are not enough to improve women's healthcare decision-making power. Comprehensive and multi-sectoral approaches are needed to bring sustainable change regarding women's empowerment. A focus on "gender equitable access to healthcare" is needed to reconcile women's empowerment and the efforts to achieve universal health coverage.

Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) guidelines: explanation and elaboration	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						epidemiology	EQUITY LENS; ETHICS; INTERSECTIONALITY; DEFINITIONS; SERVICES	Over the past decade, two movements have profoundly changed the environment in which global health epidemiologists work: research integrity and research fairness. Both ought to be equally nurtured by global health epidemiologists who aim to produce high quality impactful research. Yet bridging between these two aspirations can lead to practical and ethical dilemmas. In the light of these reflections we have proposed the BRIDGE guidelines for the conduct of fair global health epidemiology, targeted at stakeholders involved in the commissioning, conduct, appraisal and publication of global health research. The guidelines follow the conduct of a study chronologically from the early stages of study preparation until the dissemination and communication of findings. They can be used as a checklist by research teams, funders and other stakeholders to ensure that a study is conducted in line with both research integrity and research fairness principles. In this paper we offer a detailed explanation for each item of the BRIDGE guidelines. We have focused on practical implementation issues, making this document most of interest to those who are actually conducting the epidemiological work.

In the fall of 2016, the Quebec government launched its first-ever Government Health Prevention Policy (Politique gouvernementale de prevention en sante (PGPS)) to influence factors that lead to improved health status and quality of life as well as reduced social inequalities in health in the population of Quebec. NutriQuebec is a web-based prospective open cohort study whose primary aim is to provide essential data for the evaluation of the PGPS on the Quebec population's eating and other lifestyle behaviours over time. Methods and analysis Over a first phase of 3 years, NutriQuebec will enrol 20 000 adults living in the province of Quebec in Canada through a multimedia campaign designed to reach different segments of the population, including subgroups with lower socioeconomic status. Participants will be invited to complete on a web platform nine core questionnaires on a yearly basis. Questionnaires will assess several dimensions related to lifestyle, including eating and physical activity behaviours, as well as a large number of personal characteristics and global health status. Temporal trends in eating and lifestyle behaviours will be analysed in relation to the implementation of the PGPS to provide essential data for its evaluation at a population level. Data analyses will use sociodemographic weights to adjust responses of participants to achieve, so far as is possible, representativeness of the adult Quebec population. Ethics and dissemination Universite Laval Research Ethics Board approved the NutriQuebec project. Data analysis, presentations in conferences and publication of manuscripts are scheduled to start in 2020.

J	Qi, F; Wang, Q				Qi, Fei; Wang, Qi			Guaranteeing the Health Rights of People with Disabilities in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives from China	RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEALTHCARE POLICY			English	Article						COVID-19; health equity; laws; infectious disease pandemic; IDP; judicature; people with disabilities; sustainable development goal; SDG		The question of how to guarantee the health rights of people with disabilities, and their health equity in particular, is frequently neglected in infectious disease pandemics. The international response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is no exception in this regard. This neglect is related to other forms of marginalization and exclusion, as people with disabilities are generally poorer and more vulnerable than their non-disabled counterparts. Sustainable Development Goal 3 lacks an appropriate human rights language that enshrines equality and inclusivity in pandemic prevention work and related policies and legislation; and, as a result, it does not sufficiently guarantee the health rights of people with disabilities. This paper draws on China's pandemic prevention work to extract relevant lessons, and seeks to explain how decision-making systems and resource allocation mechanisms impact on the health rights of people with disabilities. It discusses the unique roles of justice and legislation in helping to guarantee the health rights of people with disabilities in an infectious disease pandemic, and concludes that future research should more closely consider how Sustainable Development Goal 16 can support Sustainable Development Goal 3.

This study aimed to explore the nature of community mental health systems by conducting a participatory community assessment of the assets and needs for mental health in Uttarkashi, a remote district in North India. Methods: The data collection and analysis process were emergent, iterative, dialogic and participatory. Transcripts of 28 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with key informants such as traditional healers, people with lived experience and doctors at the government health centres (CHCs), as well as 10 participatory rural appraisal (PRA) meetings with 120 people in community and public health systems, were thematically analysed. The 753 codes were grouped into 93 categories and ultimately nine themes and three meta-themes (place, people, practices), paying attention to equity. Results: Yamuna valley was described as both 'blessed' and limited by geography, with bountiful natural resources enhancing mental health, yet remoteness limiting access to care. The people described strong norms of social support, yet hierarchical with entrenched exclusions related to caste and gender, and social conformity that limited social accountability of services. Care practices were porous, pluralist and fragmented, with operational primary care services that acknowledged traditional care providers, and trusted resources for mental health such as traditional healers (malis) and government health workers (accredited social health activists. ASHAs). Yet care was often absent or limited by being experienced as disrespectful or of low quality. Conclusion: Findings support the value of participatory methods, and policy actions that address power relations as well as social determinants within community and public health systems. To improve mental health in this remote setting and other South Asian rural locations, community and public health systems must dialogue with the local context, assets and priorities and be socially accountable.

The primary healthcare (PHC) system is crucial to achieving UHC, in order to address the rising incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more effectively and equitably. In this paper, we examine the Australian case as a mature system of UHC and identify lessons for UHC policy to support equity of access to PHC and reduce NCDs. Methods: Our qualitative research used policy mapping and monitoring and 30 key informant interviews, and applied policy theory, to investigate the implementation of Australian PHC policy between 2008 and 2018. Results: Although the Australian PHC system does support equity of access to primary medical care, other ideational, actor-centred and structural features of policy detract from the capacities of the system to prevent and manage NCDs effectively, deliver equity of access according to need, and support equity in health outcomes. These features include a dominant focus on episodic primary medical care, which is a poor model of care for NCDs, and an inequitable distribution of these services. Also, a mixed system of public and private insurance coverage in PHC contributes to inequities in access and health outcomes, driving additional NCD demand into the health system. Conclusion: Countries aiming to achieve UHC to support health equity and reduce NCDs can learn from strengths and weaknesses in the Australian system. We recommend a range of ideational, actor-centred and structural features of UHC systems in PHC that will support effective action on NCDs, equity of access to care according to need, and equity in health outcomes across geographically and ethnically diverse populations.

J	Lillehagen, I; Heggen, KM; Tomson, G; Engebretsen, E				Lillehagen, Ida; Heggen, Kristin M.; Tomson, Goran; Engebretsen, Eivind			Implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goals: How Is Health Framed in the Norwegian and Swedish Voluntary National Review Reports?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Sustainable Development Goals; Voluntary National Reviews; Discourse Analysis; Framing Analysis; Nordic Region	POLITICS; LESSONS; POWER	Background: The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are parts of an ambitious framework for global development, the 2030 Agenda. Voluntary national reviews (VNRs) are described as "cornerstones" in the follow-up system, which is premised on international sharing of knowledge and experience. Norway and Sweden are among the world's most sustainable countries, aiming to be leaders in the implementation of the SDGs. The objective of this article is to investigate and compare how health is framed in the VNRs of these two high-income countries, and to discuss the implications of these framings for potential actions. Methods: Discourse analysis inspired by the concept of 'framing,' which refers to the discursive presentation of an issue where certain problem definitions and solutions are privileged over others. Frames are structures that organise and direct attention to particular aspects of reality, and define what is seen. Results: Our analysis demonstrates that in the Norwegian VNR (NVNR), the issue of health is simplistically framed, focusing on the favourable situation of the majority, thus providing weak grounds for transformative action. In the Swedish VNR (SVNR), health is framed to highlight health as inextricably tied to societal inequalities. This underscores the need for integrated political action and leadership to counteract structural differences with negative consequences for health. Conclusion: Analysis of the two VNRs studied found a difference in how health is framed in these documents and these frames point to differences in approach and capacity to address health inequities and realise the holistic and integrative concept of health promoted in the 2030 Agenda. To realize the Agenda's vision of "leaving no one behind" discourses of implementation that support the Agenda's inclusive and holistic ambition must be developed. Further development of the follow-up and review system should acknowledge and address how frames can limit or enable integrative actions and are therefore important drivers of change	[Lillehagen, Ida; Heggen, Kristin M.; Engebretsen, Eivind] Univ Oslo, Ctr Sustainable Hlth Care Educ, Oslo, Norway; [Tomson, Goran] Royal Swedish Acad Sci & Presidents Off, Swedish Inst Global Hlth Transformat SIGHT, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tomson, Goran] Karolinska Inst Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden	University of Oslo; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Karolinska Institutet	Lillehagen, I (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Ctr Sustainable Hlth Care Educ, Oslo, Norway.	ida.lillehagen@medisin.uio.no	Engebretsen, Eivind/E-6411-2018	Engebretsen, Eivind/0000-0001-9455-110X	Centre for Sustainable Health Care Education, University of Oslo, Norway	Centre for Sustainable Health Care Education, University of Oslo, Norway	This work was funded by Centre for Sustainable Health Care Education, University of Oslo, Norway.		52	2	2	0	7	KERMAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES	KERMAN	JAHAD BLVD, KERMAN, 7619813159, IRAN		2322-5939		INT J HEALTH POLICY	Int.

The disease is presently a public health issue in the country. Hence, the use of mathematical model to gain insights into the transmission dynamics and derive the optimal control strategies for minimizing the spread of the disease is of great importance. Methods A model involving eight mutually exclusive compartments with the introduction of personal protection, larvicide and adulticide control strategies describing dengue fever transmission dynamics is presented. The control-induced basic reproduction number ((R) over tilde (0)) related to the model is computed using the next generation matrix method. Comparison theorem is used to analyse the global dynamics of the model. The model is fitted to the data related to the 2012 dengue outbreak in Johor, Malaysia, using the least-squares method. In a bid to optimally curtail dengue fever propagation, we apply optimal control theory to investigate the effect of several control strategies of combination of optimal personal protection, larvicide and adulticide controls on dengue fever dynamics. The resulting optimality system is simulated in MATLAB using fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme based on the forward-backward sweep method. In addition, cost-effectiveness analysis is performed to determine the most cost-effective strategy among the various control strategies analysed. Results Analysis of the model with control parameters shows that the model has two disease-free equilibria, namely, trivial equilibrium and biologically realistic disease-free equilibrium, and one endemic equilibrium point. It also reveals that the biologically realistic disease-free equilibrium is both locally and globally asymptotically stable whenever the inequality (R) over tilde (0) < 1 holds. In the case of model with time dependent control functions, the optimality levels of the three control functions required to optimally control dengue disease transmission are derived. Conclusion We conclude that dengue fever transmission can be curtailed by adopting any of the several control strategies analysed in this study. Furthermore, a strategy which combines personal protection and adulticide controls is found to be the most cost-effective control strategy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Considering that the economic dimension is not an end in itself, but a means for achieving the other two dimensions, we concentrated on the relation between environment and society. Using the framework of Sustainable Society Index, we applied path analysis for identifying the effects of human wellbeing components on environmental wellbeing for 71 countries around the world in 2016. The countries were grouped into two groups-factor-driven and innovation-driven economies-according to Global Competitiveness Report. The main results revealed that once the society develops, the pressure upon the environment tends to move from the necessity of offering the basic human needs to the one regarding superior societal needs. While the least developed nations have to pay attention especially to population growth, safe sanitation and health as primary channels of better protecting the environment, in the case of the most developed countries, the main directions of environmental improvement may be education and good governance. Thus, a high environmental concern has to be cultivated in the development process, whichever its stage, but with distinct directions of action, as shown by this study.

This study aimed to assess socioeconomic inequalities in basic vaccination coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Ethiopia. Design, setting and participants Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the two most recent (2011 and 2016) Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys were performed. This analysis included 1930 mother-child pairs in 2011 and 2004 mother-child pairs in 2016. Outcome measures Completion of basic vaccinations was defined based on whether a child received a single dose of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), three doses of diphtheria, tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP), three doses of oral polio vaccine and one dose of measles vaccine. Methods The concentration Curve and Concentration Indices (CCIs) were used to estimate wealth related to inequalities. The concentration indices were also decomposed to examine the contributing factors to socioeconomic inequalities in childhood vaccination. Results From 2011 to 2016, the proportion of children who received basic vaccination increased from 24.6% (95% CI 21.4% to 28.0%) to 38.6% (95% CI 34.6% to 42.9%). While coverage of BCG, DTP and polio immunisation increased during the study period, the uptake of measles vaccine decreased. The positive concentration index shows that basic vaccination coverage was pro-rich (CCI=0.212 in 2011 and CCI=0.172 in 2016). The decomposition analysis shows that use of maternal health services such as family planning and antenatal care, socioeconomic status, exposure to media, urban-rural residence and maternal education explain inequalities in basic vaccination coverage in Ethiopia. Conclusions Childhood vaccination coverage was low in Ethiopia. Vaccination was less likely in poorer than in richer households. Addressing wealth inequalities, enhancing education and improving maternal health service coverage will reduce socioeconomic inequalities in basic vaccination uptake in Ethiopia.

Nursing represents the greatest number of health workforce in the globe, dealing with these challenges in different paths, among them the training of human resources. In this context, the goal of this study was to compare the relationship between the objectives and research areas underlying nursing doctoral programs in Latin America and the SDGs. Method Documental research comparing data of all Latin American nursing doctoral programs and the SDGs, conducted between January and March 2020. Results From the total of 56 existing programs in Latin America, this study analyzed 52 of them, representing 92.8% of the total. Most nursing doctoral programs have contributed to SDG 3, in addition to goals 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16. The SDGs 11, 13, 14, 15 and 17 were not related to any of the analyzed programs. Data reveal that the training of nursing PhDs is essential to fulfilling these goals. Results also indicate a need of programs to remain committed to relationships that enhance nursing skills to cope with the current challenges in terms of global health, such as investments for the reduction of social and gender inequities. Conclusion The doctoral training of nurses in Latin America needs to be better aligned with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), since there is a high concentration in SDG 3. We believe that nursing will bring a greater contribution to the movement to protect planetary health as the principles governing nursing practices are better aligned with international health demands and agendas.

The two crises have also exposed a chronic social illness of our time-a deep, widespread inequality in society. Whilst the circumstances are unfortunate, the pandemic can provide an opportunity for sustainability scientists to focus more on human society and its inequalities, rather than a sole focus on the natural environment. It opens the way for a new normative commitment of science in a time of crises. We suggest three agendas for future climate and sustainability research after the pandemic: (1) focus on health and well-being, (2) moral engagement through empathy, and (3) science of loss for managing grief.

The mental health of adults from southern Europe was particularly affected during this period, however, much less is known about the impact of austerity on the mental health of children. This study measured the impact on Portuguese children's mental health of specific changes in family life during the 2008 economic crisis. Methods: In this study, a cross-sectional analysis of school-aged children (aged 7.5-11 years old, n = 1157) was conducted in 118 public and private schools of three Portuguese districts during 2016/2017. Parent reports of child's psychosocial functioning (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - SDQ) and children self-reports of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales, Children version - DASS-C) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL - KIDSCREEN-27), were compared according to eight yes/no questions specifically developed about changes to normal life during the economic crisis (e.g. During the economic crisis did you: "Started buying cheaper food?" "Had to change to more economic housing?"). General linear regression models were fitted to estimate mean scores of the selected mental health outcomes according to the positive or negative answers to each question about the changes to life during the economic crisis. The models were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status and district of residence. Results: Following the crisis 48.6% of the parents reported that they had to use their savings, and 6.8% reported that they had to change to a more economic housing. The questions about the changes to life that occurred during the crisis were associated with more frequent psychosocial problems, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms and with poorer HRQoL among children, after adjustment for potential confounders in the regression models. The effect sizes in mean differences for all mental health outcomes assessed according to the changes were small to moderate (Cohen's d from 0.01 to 0.68). Conclusion: Specific changes to normal life attributed to the economic crisis seem to have an independent negative impact on the mental health outcomes of primary school-aged children. These results highlight the need to tackle early-life determinants of inequalities in children mental health, particularly among those that were exposed to the economic crisis.

The HUNT study, Norway	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Norway; Coastal health; Public health; Small-scale fishing; Composition; Context; Geographical inequalities in health	SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; HOSPITAL ANXIETY; MORTALITY; EXPLANATION; COMMUNITIES; INDUSTRY; CONTEXT; PLACE; SCALE; OIL	Recent decades have shown an international trend of decline in small-scale fishing; a longstanding and vital industry for numerous coastal populations. The decline has resulted in a loss of livelihoods in many coastal communities, potentially afflicting public health. Still, knowledge about the health situation of these areas is limited. Former studies on coastal health have primarily defined coastal areas based solely on their proximity to the coast, therefore not targeting the traditional coastal communities with longstanding coastal involvement through small-scale fishing. In this paper, we aim to illuminate the health situation in these areas by introducing a more fine-grained classification of the coastal study population; considering both geographical proximity to the coast, population density and employment in fishing. Using data from the Norwegian population-based HUNT Study, we perform individual and simultaneous adjustments for employment, behavioural and psychosocial factors to assess the contributions of these factors to the association between geographical affiliation and selfrated general health. The rural coastal areas with a history of small-scale fishing show a poorer health situation compared to urban coastal, rural inland and rural fjord populations, and behavioural factors contribute the most to the observed health disparities. Our findings encourage greater focus on societal differences between coastal communities when studying coastal health.

While operational definitions and the actual planning of these cities can vary considerably (e.g., eco cities and low carbon cities), conceptually, at least, these terms overlap, particularly with regard to how they attempt to achieve both greener infrastructural design and healthier human lifestyles. This paper presents the findings of survey-based research carried out within Lingang New Town in Shanghai in 2019. In the cities of the Global North, the interplay between green infrastructural provision and public health has been of interest, especially in the context of social inequalities; however, there is little research from rapidly urbanizing countries where green urbanism is being increasingly promoted. Using this newly constructed example, we identified a clear positive correlation between moving to a green city and the adoption of healthier lifestyles. The structural equation modelling results suggest that behaviors around the use of green space as well as perceptions of different green space have notable impacts on residents' physical health, measured by body mass index (BMI). The findings further illustrate systemic inequalities among private housing, rental housing and public housing typologies with regard to the distribution of health benefits.

J	Pescheny, JV; Randhawa, G; Pappas, Y				Pescheny, Julia, V; Randhawa, Gurch; Pappas, Yannis			The impact of social prescribing services on service users: a systematic review of the evidence	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review							ADDRESSING HEALTH INEQUALITIES; PRIMARY-CARE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL; PRESCRIPTION; PATHWAYS; SUPPORT; HELP	Background: Social prescribing initiatives are widely implemented in the UK National Health Service to integrate health and social care. Social prescribing is a service in primary care that links patients with non-medical needs to sources of support provided by the community and voluntary sector to help improve their health and wellbeing. Such programmes usually include navigators, who work with referred patients and issue onward referrals to sources of non-medical support. This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence of service user outcomes of social prescribing programmes based on primary care and involving navigators. Methods: We searched 11 databases, the grey literature, and the reference lists of relevant studies to identify the available evidence on the impact of social prescribing on service users. Searches were limited to literature written in English. No date restrictions were applied, and searches were conducted to June 2018. Findings were synthesized narratively, employing thematic analysis. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Version 2011 was used to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. Results: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The evidence base is mixed, some studies found improvements in health and wellbeing, health-related behaviours, self-concepts, feelings, social contacts and day-to-day functioning post-social prescribing, whereas others have not. The review also shows that the evaluation methodologies utilized were variable in quality. Conclusion: In order to assess the success of social prescribing services, more high quality and comparable evaluations need to be conducted in the future.

Design/methodology/approach The first 15 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey are used to estimate a wage model that accounts for the endogeneity of health, unobserved heterogeneity and sample selection bias. Findings The results show that, after accounting for the endogeneity of health, unobserved heterogeneity and sample selection bias, better health increases wages for Australian male workers, but not for female workers. The results also show that accounting for the endogeneity of health, unobserved heterogeneity and potential sample selection bias is important in estimating the effects of health on wages. In particular, a simple ordinary least squares estimator would underestimate the effect of health on wages for males, while overestimate it for females, and simply addressing the endogeneity of health using instrumental variables could overestimate the effect for both genders. It is also found that the effects of health on wages fall under depressed macroeconomic conditions, perhaps due to reduced job mobility and increased presentism during a recession. Originality/value This study adds to the international literature on the effects of health on wages by providing empirical evidence from Australia. The model applied to estimate the effects takes advantage of a panel dataset to address the bias resulting potentially from all the sources of the endogeneity of health, unobserved heterogeneity and sample selection. The results indeed show that failing to address these issues would substantially bias the estimated effects of health on wages.

Geospatial evaluation of trade-offs between equity in physical access to healthcare and health systems efficiency	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						geographic information systems; health services research; health policy; health systems evaluation; public health	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CANCER CARE; RURAL HEALTH; SERVICES; RWANDA; IMPLEMENTATION; CHALLENGES; FACILITIES; COUNTRIES; COVERAGE	Introduction Decisions regarding the geographical placement of healthcare services require consideration of trade-offs between equity and efficiency, but few empirical assessments are available. We applied a novel geospatial framework to study these trade-offs in four African countries. Methods Geolocation data on population density (a surrogate for efficiency), health centres and cancer referral centres in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Rwanda were obtained from online databases. Travel time to the closest facility (a surrogate for equity) was estimated with 1 km resolution using the Access Mod 5 least cost distance algorithm. We studied associations between district-level average population density and travel time to closest facility for each country using Pearson's correlation, and spatial autocorrelation using the Global Moran's I statistic. Geographical clusters of districts with inefficient resource allocation were identified using the bivariate local indicator of spatial autocorrelation. Results Population density was inversely associated with travel time for all countries and levels of the health system (Pearson's correlation range, health centres: -0.89 to -0.71; cancer referral centres: -0.92 to -0.43), favouring efficiency. For health centres, negative spatial autocorrelation (geographical clustering of dissimilar values of population density and travel time) was weaker in Rwanda (-0.310) and Tanzania (-0.292), countries with explicit policies supporting equitable access to rural healthcare, relative to Kenya (-0.579) and Malawi (-0.543). Stronger spatial autocorrelation was observed for cancer referral centres (Rwanda: -0.341; Tanzania: -0.259; Kenya: -0.595; Malawi: -0.666). Significant geographical clusters of sparsely populated districts with long travel times to care were identified across countries. Conclusion Negative spatial correlations suggested that the geographical distribution of health services favoured efficiency over equity, but spatial autocorrelation measures revealed more equitable geographical distribution of facilities in certain countries. These findings suggest that even when prioritising efficiency, thoughtful decisions regarding geographical allocation could increase equitable physical access to services.

Impacts of land use, population, and climate change on global food security	FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY			English	Article						FEEDME model; food security; undernourishment	TEMPERATURE INCREASE; BASE-LINE; LIVESTOCK; AFRICA; GROWTH; COUNTRIES; NUTRITION	In recent years, global hunger has begun to rise, returning to levels from a decade ago. Climate change is a key driver behind these recent rises and is one of the leading causes of severe food crises. When coupled with population growth and land use change, future climate variability is predicted to have profound impacts on global food security. We examine future global impacts of climate variability, population, and land use change on food security to 2050, using the modeling framework FEEDME (Food Estimation and Export for Diet and Malnutrition Evaluation). The model uses national food balance sheets (FBS) to determine mean per capita calories, hence incorporating an assumption that minimum dietary energy requirements (MDER) remain constant. To account for climate variability, we use two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), alongside three Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios incorporating land use and population change within the model. Our results indicate that SSP scenarios have a larger impact on future food insecurity, in particular because of projected changes in population. Countries with a projected decrease in population growth had higher food security, while those with a projected rapid population growth tended to experience the worst impacts on food security. Although climate change scenarios had an effect on future crop yields, population growth appeared to be the dominant driver of change in undernourishment prevalence. Therefore, strategies to mitigate the consequences of projected population growth, including improved maternal health care, increasing equality of access to food at the national level, closing the yield gap, and changes in trade patterns, are essential to ensuring severe future food insecurity is avoided.

There has been a lack of research into how HLA affects renal function in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people in the UK, despite BAME people being disproportionately affected by renal dysfunction. This study included >27 000 UK Biobank subjects of six ethnicities (>12 100 Irish, >5400 Indian, >4000 Black Caribbean, >3000 Black African, >1600 Pakistani, and >1400 Chinese) aged 39 to 73. Subjects' high-resolution HLA genotypes were imputed using HLA*IMP:02 software. Regression analysis was used to compare 108 imputed HLA alleles with two measures of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): one based on serum creatinine; one based on serum cystatin. Secondary analysis compared CKD stage 2 subjects to healthy controls. Nine imputed HLA alleles were associated with eGFR (adjusted P < .05). Six associations were based on creatinine in Black African subjects: HLA-B*53:01 (beta = -2.628, adjusted P = 4.69 x 10(-4)); C*04:01 (beta = -1.667, adjusted P = .0269); DPA1*02:01 (beta = -1.569, adjusted P = .0182); and DPA1*02:02 (beta = -1.716, adjusted P = .0251) were linked to decreased renal function, while DRB1*03:01 (beta = 3.200, adjusted P = 3.99 x 10(-3)) and DPA1*01:03 (beta = 2.276, adjusted P = 2.31 x 10(-5)) were linked to increased renal function. Two of these (HLA-B*53:01 and C*04:01) are commonly inherited together. In Irish subjects, HLA-DRB1*04:01 (beta = 1.075, adjusted P = .0138) was linked to increased eGFR (based on cystatin); in Indian subjects, HLA-DRB1*03:01 (beta = -1.72, adjusted P = 4.78 x 10(-3)) and DQB1*02:01 (beta = -1.755, adjusted P = 2.26 x 10(-3))were associated with decreased eGFR (based on cystatin). No associations were found in the other three ethnic groups. Nine HLA alleles appear to be associated with kidney function in BAME people in the UK. This could have applications for the diagnosis and treatment of renal disease and could help reduce health inequalities in the UK.

J	Yu, GL; Zhao, FQ; Wang, H; Li, S				Yu, Guoliang; Zhao, Fengqing; Wang, Hao; Li, Sen			Subjective social class and distrust among Chinese college students: The mediating roles of relative deprivation and belief in a just world	CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Interpersonal distrust; Subjective social class; Individual relative deprivation; Group relative deprivation; Belief in a just world	SELF-RATED HEALTH; INCOME INEQUALITY HYPOTHESIS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; LIFE SATISFACTION; PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS; TRUST; ASSOCIATIONS; HOSTILITY; ATTITUDES; MISTRUST	Though the link between objective social class and interpersonal distrust has been well documented, the link between subjective social class and distrust has been less investigated. Besides, very little research has investigated the potential mechanism underlying this association. Based on relative deprivation theory and just world theory, the present study examined the relation between subjective social class and distrust as well as the mediating roles of individual/global relative deprivation and belief in a just world among college students in Chinese culture. A sample of 796 Chinese college students finished the measures of subjective social class, individual/group relative deprivation, belief in a just world, and interpersonal distrust. The result indicated that lower subjective social class was predictive of higher level of distrust. Path analyses indicated that individual relative deprivation mediated the association between subjective social class and distrust. Besides, belief in a just world and individual relative deprivation acted as sequential mediators between subjective social class and distrust. Furthermore, moderated mediation analysis did not support the moderating role of belief in a just world in the relationship model of subjective social class, individual/group relative deprivation, and interpersonal distrust. These findings highlight that to alleviate interpersonal distrust among students in the lower subjective social class, we should pay attention to students' perceptions of justice and individual relative deprivation and how that could be shaping their interpersonal trust.

This article examines South Korea's responses in terms of its incarcerated population during the crisis, provides a snapshot of how the coronavirus has impacted prisons, and outlines the mitigation strategies used to create COVID-19-safe spaces in the country. With correction officers being identified as some of the earliest COVID-19 cases in the country, South Korea has striven to manage the coronavirus in correctional facilities as part of the ecosystem of the entire country. This paper discusses South Korea's unique strategy, which focuses less on the size of the prison population and more on treating correction officers and prisoners, who also need to be protected from the virus. In particular, this paper analyzes the multifaceted strategies adopted by South Korea to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus within the criminal justice system, and specifically to protect inmates and correction officers from infection. Strategies centered on public health and human rights were implemented, combined with in-prison strategies, modestly downsizing the prison population and/or maintaining the status quo during the pandemic.

Application of the value of a statistical life (VSL) to monetize COVID-19 deaths produces a U.S. mortality cost estimate of $1.4 trillion for deaths in the first half of 2020. This article presents worldwide COVID-19 costs for over 100 countries. The total global mortality cost through July 2, 2020 is $3.5 trillion. The United States accounts for 25% of the deaths, but 41% of the mortality cost. Adjustments for the shorter life expectancy and lower income of the victims substantially reduces the estimated monetized losses, but may raise fundamental equity concerns. Morbidity effects of COVID-19 affect many more patients than do the disease's mortality risks. Consideration of the morbidity effects increase the expected health losses associated with COVID-19 illnesses by 10% to 40%.	[Viscusi, W.

It outlines historical and contemporary evidence of inequalities in pandemics-drawing on international research into the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918, the H1N1 outbreak of 2009 and the emerging international estimates of socioeconomic, ethnic and geographical inequalities in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. It then examines how these inequalities in COVID-19 are related to existing inequalities in chronic diseases and the social determinants of health, arguing that we are experiencing a syndemic pandemic. It then explores the potential consequences for health inequalities of the lockdown measures implemented internationally as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the likely unequal impacts of the economic crisis. The essay concludes by reflecting on the longer-term public health policy responses needed to ensure that the COVID-19 pandemic does not increase health inequalities for future generations.

The Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-Solving (HEADS-UP) symposium is an annual multidisciplinary scientific and educational forum targeting major inequities in cerebrovascular disease, with the ultimate objective of helping to bridge major inequities in stroke, and promptly translating scientific results into routine clinical practice, for the benefit of vulnerable and underserved populations. HEADS-UP is a collaborative undertaking by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the American Stroke Association and is held the day before the annual International Stroke Conference. In 2020, the HEADS-UP focused on the topic of racial/ethnic disparities in stroke and comprised invited lectures on determinants of racial/ethnic inequities in stroke as well as emerging interventions or promising strategies designed to overcome these inequities. Competitively selected travel award scholarships were given to 19 early stage investigators who presented posters at professor moderated sessions; engaged in several career development activities aimed imparting grant writing skills, knowledge about climbing the academic ladder, and striving for work-life balance; and participated in networking events. This Health Equity edition of Focused Updates will feature an overview of the HEADS-UP 2020 symposium proceedings and articles covering the key scientific content of the major lectures delivered during the symposium including the presentation by the award-winning plenary speaker. Starting in 2021, HEADS-UP will expand to include 5 major inequities in stroke (racial/ethnic, sex, geographic, socioeconomic, and global) and seeks to be a viable avenue to meet the health equity goals of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and World Stroke Organization.

The Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-solving symposium, a collaborative initiative of the American Heart Association and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, was the first-ever annual multidisciplinary scientific forum focused on race/ethnic inequities in cerebrovascular disease, with the overarching goal of reducing inequities in stroke and accelerating the translation of research findings to improve outcomes for race/ethnic minorities. The symposium featured esteemed invited plenary speakers, lecturing on determinants of race/ethnic inequities in stroke and interventions aimed at redressing the inequities. The Edgar J. Kenton III Award recognized Ralph Sacco, MD, MS, for his lifetime contributions to investigation, management, mentorship, and community service in the field of stroke inequities. Early career investigators were provided with travel awards to attend the symposium; presented their research at moderated poster and Think Tank sessions; received career development advice at the Building Momentum session; and networked with experienced stroke inequities researchers. Future conferences-The Health Equity and Actionable Disparities in Stroke: Understanding and Problem-solving 2021 to 2024-will broaden the focus to include 5 major persistent inequities (race/ethnic, sex, geographic, socioeconomic, and global). Each year will focus on a different theme (community and stakeholder engagement; clinical trials; implementation science; and policy and dissemination). By fostering a community of stroke inequities researchers, we hope to highlight promising work, illuminate research gaps, facilitate networking, inform policy makers, recognize achievement, inspire greater interest among junior investigators to pursue careers in this field, and provide networking opportunities for underrepresented minority scientists.

However, facing the challenges presented by health crises requires high volumes of financial and human resources, and cooperation efforts between different actors, which makes the challenge even more complex for developing countries. In this context, the formation of interorganizational networks, involving individuals and public and private organizations, is fundamental to face various outbreaks. This study, based on the case of the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil in 2015, aims to analyze the governance of an interorganizational health emergency network. The results point out new perspectives to identify and deal with these interorganizational networks' challenges, such as the coordination of institutional and individual actors, conflicts, issues related to the network's leadership, learning and mobilization regarding health emergencies - particularly in situations where there is little knowledge and evidence about the risks and effects of viruses and other pathogens, which makes the act of declaring emergency politically controversial.

HIV prevalence and HIV clinical outcomes of transgender and gender-diverse people in England	HIV MEDICINE			English	Article						gender identity; HIV; patient care; prevalence; transgender people	HEALTH OUTCOMES; WOMEN; CARE; MEN; SEX; RETENTION; DYSPHORIA; THERAPY; STATES; TRANS	Objectives We provide the first estimate of HIV prevalence among trans and gender-diverse people living in England and compare outcomes of people living with HIV according to gender identity. Methods We analysed a comprehensive national HIV cohort and a nationally representative self-reported survey of people accessing HIV care in England (Positive Voices). Gender identity was recorded using a two-step question co-designed with community members and civil society. Responses were validated by clinic follow-up and/or self-report. Population estimates were obtained from national government offices. Results In 2017, HIV prevalence among trans and gender-diverse people was estimated at 0.46-4.78 per 1000, compared with 1.7 (95% credible interval: 1.6-1.7) in the general population. Of 94 885 people living with diagnosed HIV in England, 178 (0.19%) identified as trans or gender-diverse. Compared with cisgender people, trans and gender-diverse people were more likely to be London residents (57% vs. 43%), younger (median age 42 vs. 46 years), of white ethnicity (61% vs. 52%), under psychiatric care (11% vs. 4%), to report problems with self-care (37% vs. 13%), and to have been refused or delayed healthcare (23% vs. 11%). Antiretroviral uptake and viral suppression were high in both groups. Conclusions HIV prevalence among trans and gender-diverse people living in England is relatively low compared with international estimates. Furthermore, no inequalities were observed with regard to HIV care. Nevertheless, trans and gender-diverse people with HIV report poorer mental health and higher levels of discrimination compared with cisgender people.	[Kirwan, P.

Whether caring for patients living with the human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, or Ebola, infectious diseases practitioners often interact with those at the margins of societies (eg, racial/ethnic/sexual/gender minorities), who disproportionately bear the brunt of these conditions. Therefore, cultural barriers between providers and patients are often salient in the infectious diseases context. In this article, we discuss cultural competence broadly, to include not only the knowledge and the skills needed at both the organizational and the individual levels to provide culturally appropriate care, but also to include "cultural humility"-a lifelong process of learning, self-reflection, and self-critique. To enhance the quality and the impact of our practices, we must prioritize cultural competence and humility and be mindful of the role of culture in the patient-provider-system interactions, in our larger healthcare systems, and in our research agendas and workforce development.

Online-accessible procedural documents are difficult to find, might be mistranslated or interpreted and usually do not address the needs of developing countries. Urinalysis, one of the most frequently performed diagnostic examinations worldwide, involves a series of tests aiming to detect particular disorders, such as urinary tract infections, kidney disease and diabetes. In this guideline, we present an alternative approach for clinical laboratories with limited resources to identify common bacterial uropathogens. We propose dividing the identification plan into two levels. The implicated pathogen will first be assigned into a bacterial group, basic identification, against which a suitable panel of antimicrobial agents shall be selected for the antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). Characterization of the pathogen to the genus or species level, advanced identification, will then be performed to ensure correct reading of the AST results and determine the epidemiology of clinically significant pathogens. Most of the proposed steps in our guideline are tailored to meet the needs of clinical laboratories in low-resource settings. Such guidelines are needed to strengthen the capacity of regional pathology laboratories and to enhance international initiatives on antimicrobial resistance and health equity.

As the social and economic costs of NCDs have escalated, action is needed to tackle important causes of many NCD's: low physical activity levels and unhealthy dietary behaviours. As these behaviours are driven by upstream factors, successful policy interventions are required that encourage healthy dietary behaviours, improve physical activity levels and reduce sedentary behaviours of entire populations. However, to date, no systematic research on the implementation and evaluation of policy interventions related to these health behaviours has been conducted across Europe. Consequently, no information on the merit, gaps, worth or utility of cross-European policy interventions is available, and no guidance or recommendations on how to enhance this knowledge across European countries exists. As part of the Joint Programming Initiative "A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life" (JPI HDHL), 28 research institutes from seven European countries and New Zealand have combined their expertise to form the Policy Evaluation Network (PEN). PEN's aim is to advance tools to identify, evaluate, implement and benchmark policies designed to directly or indirectly target dietary behaviours, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour in Europe, as well as to understand how these policies increase or decrease health inequalities. Using well-defined evaluation principles and methods, PEN will examine the content, implementation and impact of policies addressing dietary behaviour, physical activity levels and sedentary behaviour across Europe. It will realise the first steps in a bespoke health policy monitoring and surveillance system for Europe, and refine our knowledge of appropriate research designs and methods for the quantification of policy impact. It will contribute to our understanding of how to achieve successful transnational policy implementation and monitoring of these policies in different cultural, demographic or socioeconomic settings. PEN will consider equity and diversity aspects to ensure that policy actions are inclusive and culturally sensitive. Finally, based on three policy cases, PEN will illustrate how best to evaluate the implementation and impact of such policies in order to yield healthy diets and activity patterns that result in healthier lives for all European citizens.

While it is well-documented that health literacy is associated with health outcomes, most findings are generated from cross-sectional data. Along with the increasing importance of health literacy in policy, there is a lack of specificity and transparency about how to improve health literacy in practice. In this study, we are calling for a shift of current research paradigms from judging health literacy levels towards observing how health literacy skills are developed over the life course and practised in the real world. This includes using a life-course approach, integrating the rationale of precision public health, applying open science practice, and promoting actionable knowledge translation strategies. We show how a greater appreciation for these paradigms promises to advance health literacy research and practice towards an equitable, precise, transparent, and actionable vision.

J	Torp, S; Reiersen, J				Torp, Steffen; Reiersen, Jon			Globalization, Work, and Health: A Nordic Perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						health promotion; workplace; labor relations; collective bargaining; unionization; globalization; precarious work; equity; empowerment	TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT; CIVIL-SERVANTS; GRADE	The Nordic countries are among the world's leading countries in international rankings on prosperity, productivity, social equity, trust, and health. Such positive results may be linked to how these countries have organized their working life. The aim of this article is to describe core elements of the Nordic working life model (emphasizing Norway) and discuss how globalization may challenge the model, and thereby influence public health. Based on an extensive review of relevant research, we show that the Nordic working life model with a coordinated wage bargaining system between well-organized employers and employees results in productive enterprises, small wage differences, good working environments, and a high level of well-being. Global trends of liberalization of working life, increased labor migration, the platform economy, reduced unionization, and more precarious work challenge the Nordic working life model and its reliance on standard working contracts. Such a trend may result in increased inequity, reduced generalized trust, and poorer public health. Politicians and other stakeholders in the Nordic countries should cope appropriately with globalization and technological changes so that the Nordic countries will uphold their well-organized working life and good societal achievements.

A quarantined lodging stay: The buffering effect of service quality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hotel; Service quality; Loneliness; Anxiety; Terror management; Pandemic	TERROR MANAGEMENT THEORY; EMOTIONAL LONELINESS; CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS; SOCIAL EXCLUSION; WEISS TYPOLOGY; HEALTH-STATUS; BRAND EQUITY; SELF-ESTEEM; ANXIETY; DEPRESSION	How do guests feel during their stay at quarantine lodging? This study draws on terror management theory and social exclusion theory to synthesize a model that highlights guests' perceptions about their experience under enforced isolation. The model articulates guests' feeling of anxiety and loneliness, whereas quality of service presents warmth and care that activates an anxiety buffer mechanism that mitigates the effect of anxiety. In turn guests' level of anxiety is further explained by an interaction between their health status and the length of stay. Results point to a conduit for studying the dark side of hospitality, opening up research avenues that could help assess broader social behavioral changes during the global pandemic, while offering operators revelations for lodging management during a crisis.

The refugees are located in temporary settlements on hilly areas of Cox's Bazar with inadequate water and sanitation facilities, giving rise to diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea. This exploratory study reports drinking water security challenges in two Rohingya refugee camps within the larger camp network-Camp 2 and the recently-built Camp 4 Extension (Camp 4Ext)-to discover the key everyday issues refugees are facing related to drinking water. Both qualitative and quantitative methods have been applied to determining whether contamination is occurring during the collection, transportation, and storage of drinking water by comparing the water quality at the source with that in storage. The results show that Camp 4Ext is more suited for living in several respects compared with the other camps, attributable to significantly better planning during its construction: there is a lower prevalence of diseases, lower water collection times, higher standards of sanitation, and better access to water sources. This study's outcomes will help camp authorities and the various agencies working there to provide sustainable water and sanitation interventions to improve the wellness of the Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar. The outcomes will also provide useful information and strategic direction to the global scientific and development communities who are working in refugee camps in other parts of the world, to tackle water security challenges.

As public health systems are the first line of defense during pandemics, it has become clear that sustained investment in strengthening public health infrastructure is a major need in all countries, irrespective of income levels. Drawing on the successful experiences of Switzerland, Georgia, and New Zealand in dealing with COVID-19, we suggest prioritizing core public health capacities with links to the International Health Regulations, improving international cooperation, coordination, and multisectoral action, addressing health inequities by targeting vulnerable groups, and enhancing health literacy, including through sophisticated and sustained communication campaigns to build resilience. These measures will ensure that health systems and communities will be better prepared for the disruptions that future disease outbreaks will inevitably bring.

Medical Student Involvement in a Human Rights Program: Impact on Student Development and Career Vision	ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article							GLOBAL HEALTH; TORTURE SURVIVORS; US; PREVALENCE; EXPERIENCE; CURRICULUM; TRAUMA	Background: There is consensus among many medical school deans that exposure to human rights is a necessary component of physician training [7, 8], however little is known about the impact of engagement in human rights programs on students' personal and professional development [15-28]. Objective: This study aimed to examine medical students' experiences in the Mount Sinai Human Rights Program (MSHRP), their motivations for involvement, and the possible influence of engagement on their professional identities, personal growth, and career choices. Methods: Through semi-structured interviews, this qualitative study gathered the experiences of 15 fourth year and recently graduated medical students who participated in the comprehensive training, research, and direct service opportunities provided by the program. Responses were coded using a content analysis approach. Findings: The results of this research highlight the motivations behind students' involvement in a medical human rights program, as well as the challenges they experienced engaging with this work. The study captured students' perceptions of the role of the program on their personal growth, clinical skills, and career vision. Nearly all the students interviewed indicated they developed important, clinically applicable skills that enhanced their traditional medical education. Students indicated that their participation directly influenced their professional identities and future career directions by reinforcing previous interests in human rights and social justice work, impacting medical specialty and residency program selections and fostering commitment to working with immigrant populations. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that longitudinal involvement with the MSHRP contributed to the acquisition of important clinical skills that were not otherwise attained in students' early medical education. Findings suggest that there is significant opportunity for clinical and leadership development outside the traditional preclinical and clinical setting, and that exposure to human rights education shapes students' professional identities and career paths. Finally, the findings highlight the essential role of human rights and social justice in medical education.

Increasing the impact of science and technology to provide more people with healthier and safer food	FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY			English	Review						climate change; food security; genetic erosion; integrated pest management; mycotoxins; watersaving agriculture	INTEGRATED PEST-MANAGEMENT; NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA; BLADDER-CANCER RISK; OCCUPATIONAL-EXPOSURE; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; ORGANIC FOODS; CHEMICAL PESTICIDES; NUTRITIONAL QUALITY; PYVV INFECTION; USE EFFICIENCY	Ensuring adequate food availability to an increasing world population constitutes one of the biggest challenges faced by humankind. Scientific and technological advances in food production during the last century enabled agriculture to cope with the concomitant increase in food demand. For example, cereal yields have more than doubled from a global average of 1.5 metric tons per hectare in the 1960s up to 3.2 metric tons per hectare in 2018. This was made possible by the work in different research fields such as agronomy, engineering, and plant sciences, showing that an inter and multidisciplinary approach is indispensable for significant progress. This manuscript is aimed at generating reflexion and analysis about the challenges that agriculture faces at present to satisfy projected food demands, which implies a further doubling of food production by 2050, according to the latest estimates. Relevant issues related to food production (climate change, pollution of water and soils by pesticides and fertilizers, loss of germplasm and biodiversity) are discussed and potential solutions to achieve food security in quantity and quality are reviewed, mainly from the plant breeding and crop-production perspectives, always associated with environmental health preservation and improvement. A broad transdisciplinary effort is needed to increase the impact of science and technology to provide more people with healthier and safer food, produced in a sustainable way. Nonetheless, science and technology alone will not succeed to meet those challenges. Education and knowledge transfer strategies are needed to guarantee responsible production and consumption everywhere, therefore allowing the benefits of scientific and technological progress reach the world population. Simultaneously, adequate action by regulatory authorities and governments concerted at international level, with thorough application of the Precautionary Principle, and aiming at environmental and social justice are imperatively required to meet the challenge and achieve the goal.

FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						rural practice intention; rural medical practice; barriers and enablers; rural practice; human resources for health (HRH); LMIC = low; and middle-income countries; practice intentions; social accountability	EDUCATION; SYSTEMS; CARE	Equity in health outcomes for rural and remote populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited by a range of socio-economic, cultural and environmental determinants of health. Health professional education that is sensitive to local population needs and that attends to all elements of the rural pathway is vital to increase the proportion of the health workforce that practices in underserved rural and remote areas. The Training for Health Equity Network (THEnet) is a community-of-practice of 13 health professional education institutions with a focus on delivering socially accountable education to produce a fit-for-purpose health workforce. The THEnet Graduate Outcome Study is an international prospective cohort study with more than 6,000 learners from nine health professional schools in seven countries (including four LMICs; the Philippines, Sudan, South Africa and Nepal). Surveys of learners are administered at entry to and exit from medical school, and at years 1, 4, 7, and 10 thereafter. The association of learners' intention to practice in rural and other underserved areas, and a range of individual and institutional level variables at two time points-entry to and exit from the medical program, are examined and compared between country income settings. These findings are then triangulated with a sociocultural exploration of the structural relationships between educational and health service delivery ministries in each setting, status of postgraduate training for primary care, and current policy settings. This analysis confirmed the association of rural background with intention to practice in rural areas at both entry and exit. Intention to work abroad was greater for learners at entry, with a significant shift to an intention to work in-country for learners with entry and exit data. Learners at exit were more likely to intend a career in generalist disciplines than those at entry however lack of health policy and unclear career pathways limits the effectiveness of educational strategies in LMICs. This multi-national study of learners from medical schools with a social accountability mandate confirms that it is possible to produce a health workforce with a strong intent to practice in rural areas through attention to all aspects of the rural pathway.

J							InciSioN UK Collaborative	Global health education in medical schools (GHEMS): a national, collaborative study of medical curricula	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Global health; Medical education; Medical school; Collaborative; Curricula; Diversity; Pandemic; WHO	SYSTEMS; PROFESSIONALS; STUDENTS	Background Global health is the study, research, and practice of medicine focused on improving health and achieving health equity for all persons worldwide. International and national bodies stipulate that global health be integrated into medical school curricula. However, there is a global paucity of data evaluating the state of global health teaching in medical schools. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of global health teaching activities at United Kingdom (UK) medical schools. Methods A national, cross-sectional study assessing all timetabled teachings sessions within UK medical courses for global health content during the academic year 2018/19. Global health content was evaluated against a comprehensive list of global health learning outcomes for medical students. Results Data from 39 medical courses representing 86% (30/36) of eligible medical schools was collected. Typically, medical courses reported timetabled teaching covering over three-quarters of all global health learning outcomes. However, a wide degree of variation existed among granular global health learning objectives covered within the different medical courses. On average, each learning outcome had a 79% [95% CI: 73, 83%] probability of being included in course curricula. There were a number of learning outcomes that had a lower probability, such as 'access to surgeons with the necessary skills and equipment in different countries' (36%) [95% CI: 21, 53%], 'future impact of climate change on health and healthcare systems' (67%) [95% CI: 50, 81%], and 'role of the WHO' (54%) [95% CI: 28, 60%]. Conclusions This study served as the first national assessment of global health education and curricula within UK medical schools. Through a formalised assessment of teaching events produced by medical schools around the country, we were able to capture a national picture of global health education, including the strengths of global health prioritisation in the UK, as well as areas for improvement. Overall, it appears broad-level global health themes are widely discussed; however, the granularities of key, emerging areas of concern are omitted by curricula. In particular, gaps persist relating to international healthcare systems, multilateral global health agencies such as the WHO, global surgery, climate change and more.

J	Efevbera, Y; Bhabha, J				Efevbera, Yvette; Bhabha, Jacqueline			Defining and deconstructing girl child marriage and applications to global public health	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						Child marriage; Child; Definition; Girl; Health; Marriage	IMPACT; HIV	An estimated 650 million girls and women alive today married before their 18th birthday. Referred to as girl child marriage, the formal or informal union of the girl-child before age 18, the practice is increasingly recognized as a key roadblock to global health, development, and gender equality. Although more research than ever has focused on girl child marriage, an important gap remains in deconstructing the construct. Through an extensive review of primary and secondary sources, including legal documents, peer-reviewed articles, books, and grey literature across disciplines, we explore what the term "girl child marriage" means and why it more accurately captures current global efforts than other terms like early, teenage, or adolescent marriage. To do this, we dive into different framings on marriage, children, and gender. We find that there has been historical change in the understanding of girl child marriage in published literature since the late 1800s, and that it is a political, sociocultural, and value-laden term that serves a purpose in different contexts at different moments in time. The lack of harmonized terminology, particularly in the global public health, prevents alignment amongst different stakeholders in understanding what the problem is in order to determine how to measure it and create solutions on how to address it. Our intent is to encourage more intentional use of language in global public health research.

The trouble with trust: Time-series analysis of social capital, income inequality, and COVID-19 deaths in 84 countries	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Social capital; Income inequality; Pandemic	CASE RATES; HEALTH; ASSOCIATION	Can social contextual factors explain international differences in the spread of COVID-19? It is widely assumed that social cohesion, public confidence in government sources of health information and general concern for the welfare of others support health advisories during a pandemic and save lives. We tested this assumption through a time-series analysis of cross-national differences in COVID-19 mortality during an early phase of the pandemic. Country data on income inequality and four dimensions of social capital (trust, group affiliations, civic responsibility and confidence in public institutions) were linked to data on COVID-19 deaths in 84 countries. Associations with deaths were examined using Poisson regression with population-averaged estimators. During a 30-day period after recording their tenth death, mortality was positively related to income inequality, trust and group affiliations and negatively related to social capital from civic engagement and confidence in state institutions. These associations held in bivariate and mutually controlled regression models with controls for population size, age and wealth. The results indicate that societies that are more economically unequal and lack capacity in some dimensions of social capital experienced more COVID-19 deaths. Social trust and belonging to groups were associated with more deaths, possibly due to behavioural contagion and incongruence with physical distancing policy. Some countries require a more robust public health response to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19 due to economic and social divisions within them.

J	Martin, S; Siciliani, L; Smith, P				Martin, Steve; Siciliani, Luigi; Smith, Peter			Socioeconomic inequalities in waiting times for primary care across ten OECD countries	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Waiting times; Primary care; Socioeconomic status; Income; High-income countries; Inequalities	ACCESS; INSURANCE; INCOME	Waiting times for health care are a major policy concern across OECD countries. Waiting times are generally tolerated in publicly-funded health systems and perceived as equitable if access to care is not based on socioeconomic status. Although a growing literature has documented that socioeconomic status is negatively associated with waiting times for secondary care in several countries, less is known about waiting time inequalities in primary care, which is the focus of this study. We exploit the Commonwealth Fund's International Health Policy Survey of Adults in 2010, 2013 and 2016 and include ten OECD countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). Waiting time for primary care is measured by the time reported to get an appointment to see a doctor or a nurse. We employ interval regression models to investigate for each country whether socioeconomic status (household income and education) are associated with the waiting time for a primary care appointment. We control for age, gender, chronic conditions, and whether the individual holds private health insurance. We find a negative association between household income and waiting times in Canada, Germany, Norway and Sweden.

Integration of prevention and control measures for female genital schistosomiasis, HIV and cervical cancer	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION			English	Article							HAEMATOBIUM INFECTION; VIRUS-INFECTION; RISK-FACTOR; WOMEN; ASSOCIATION; TRANSMISSION; HIV/AIDS; DISEASES; TRACT	Female genital schistosomiasis as a result of chronic infection with Schistosoma haematobium (commonly known as bilharzia) continues to be largely ignored by national and global health policy-makers. International attention for large-scale action against the disease focuses on whether it is a risk factor for the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Yet female genital schistosomiasis itself is linked to pain, bleeding and sub- or infertility, leading to social stigma, and is a common issue for women in schistosomiasis-endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease should therefore be recognized as another component of a comprehensive health and human rights agenda for women and girls in Africa, alongside HIV and cervical cancer. Each of these three diseases has a targeted and proven preventive intervention: antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV; human papilloma virus vaccine for cervical cancer; and praziquantel treatment for female genital schistosomiasis. We discuss how female genital schistosomiasis control can be integrated with HIV and cervical cancer care. Such a programme will be part of a broader framework of sexual and reproductive health and rights, women's empowerment and social justice in Africa. Integrated approaches that join up multiple public health programmes have the potential to expand or create opportunities to reach more girls and women throughout their life course. We outline a pragmatic operational research agenda that has the potential to optimize joint implementation of a package of measures responding to the specific needs of girls and women.

Towards healthy settings for people with intellectual disabilities	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						health promotion; healthy settings; intellectual disability; settings approach; concept mapping	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PROMOTION; ADULTS; BARRIERS	People with intellectual disabilities (ID) depend on their environment for support to live healthily. The characteristics of healthy settings for people with ID are unknown. This study aims to conceptualize healthy settings for people with ID by conducting an international and multidisciplinary concept mapping study. As theoretical framework the settings approach, an ecological model with a whole system focus toward health promotion, was used. The integrative mixed-methods approach of this study involved concept mapping with researchers specialized in healthcare for people with ID and researchers specialized in healthy settings. The 41 participants generated statements that were later sorted and rated. Findings encompass 13 clusters relating to the social environment, the physical environment and societal preconditions. Specific factors of healthy settings for people with ID include: (i) universal design of the physical environment, (ii) the role of care professionals in the social environment to empower people with ID, (iii) possibilities for care providers to contribute to a health-promoting setting and (iv) preconditions that allow people to engage in society. These factors can be used in strategies to apply the approach in practice and give directions to put in place policies on developing enabling environments and decreasing health inequities.

Individual and group advocacy and activism in response to corporate products, practices or policy influences can mediate negative health impacts. This paper discusses the unequal power relations existing between TNCs that promote their own financial interests, and activists and advocates who support population and environmental health by challenging corporate power. It draws on interview data from 19 respondents who informed 2 health impact assessments conducted on TNCs; 1 from the fast food industry, and 1 from the extractive industries sector. It reveals the types of strategies that civil society organizations (CSOs) have used to encourage TNCs to act in more health promoting ways. It discusses the extent to which these strategies have been effective, and how TNCs have used their power to respond to civil society action. The paper highlights the rewards, and the very real challenges faced by CSOs trying to change TNC practices related to health, within a neoliberal policy environment. It aims to provide evidence for socially oriented actors to inform their advocacy for changes in public policy or corporate practices that can contribute to improving population health and equity and tackling commercial determinants of health.

However, there is concern over the lack of involvement of communities and 'bottom-up' approaches used within COVID-19 responses thus far. Identifying how community engagement approaches have been used in past epidemics may support more robust implementation within the COVID-19 response. Methodology A rapid evidence review was conducted to identify how community engagement is used for infectious disease prevention and control during epidemics. Three databases were searched in addition to extensive snowballing for grey literature. Previous epidemics were limited to Ebola, Zika, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndromeand H1N1 since 2000. No restrictions were applied to study design or language. Results From 1112 references identified, 32 articles met our inclusion criteria, which detail 37 initiatives. Six main community engagement actors were identified: local leaders, community and faith-based organisations, community groups, health facility committees, individuals and key stakeholders. These worked on different functions: designing and planning, community entry and trust building, social and behaviour change communication, risk communication, surveillance and tracing, and logistics and administration. Conclusion COVID-19's global presence and social transmission pathways require social and community responses. This may be particularly important to reach marginalised populations and to support equity-informed responses. Aligning previous community engagement experience with current COVID-19 community-based strategy recommendations highlights how communities can play important and active roles in prevention and control. Countries worldwide are encouraged to assess existing community engagement structures and use community engagement approaches to support contextually specific, acceptable and appropriate COVID-19 prevention and control measures.

Mothers and babies continue to die at high rates in many countries despite substantial increases in facility birth. One reason for this may be the current design of health systems in most low-income countries where, unlike in high-income countries, a substantial proportion of births occur in primary care facilities that cannot offer definitive care for complications. We argue that the current inequity in care for childbirth is a global double standard that limits progress on maternal and newborn survival. We propose that health systems need to be redesigned to shift all deliveries to hospitals or other advanced care facilities to bring care in line with global best practice. Health system redesign will require investing in high-quality hospitals with excellent midwifery and obstetric care, boosting quality of primary care clinics for antenatal, postnatal, and newborn care, decreasing access and financial barriers, and mobilizing populations to demand high-quality care. Redesign is a structural reform that is contingent on political leadership that envisions a health system designed to deliver high-quality, respectful care to all women giving birth. Getting redesign right will require focused investments, local design and adaptation, and robust evaluation.

We systematically review evidence for this approach. Methods We previously reported an evidence-and-gap map (http://srhr.org/masculinities/wbincome/) andsystematic review of reviewsof experimental intervention studies engaging men/boys in SRHR, identified through a Campbell Collaboration published protocol (https://doi.org/10.1002/CL2.203) without language restrictions between January 2007 and July 2018. Records for the current review of intervention studies were retrieved from those systematic reviews containing one or more gender-transformative intervention studies engaging men/boys. Data were extracted for intervention studies relating to each of the World Health Organization (WHO) SRHR outcomes. Promising programming characteristics, as well as underused strategies, were analysed with reference to the WHO definition of gender-transformative programming and an established behaviour change model, the COM-B model. Risk of bias was assessed usingCochrane Risk of Bias tools,RoB V.2.0 andRisk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions. Findings From 509 eligible records, we synthesised 68 studies comprising 36 randomised controlled trials, n=56 417 participants, and 32 quasi-experimental studies, n=25 554 participants. Promising programming characteristics include: multicomponent activities of education, persuasion, modelling and enablement; multilevel programming that mobilises wider communities; targeting both men and women; and programmes of longer duration than three months. Six of the seven interventions evaluated more than once show efficacy. However, we identified a significant risk of bias in the overall available evidence. Important gaps in evidence relate to safe abortion and SRHR during disease outbreaks. Conclusion It is widely acknowledged by global organisations that the question is no longerwhetherto include boys and men in SRHR buthowto do so in ways that promote gender equality and health for all and are scientifically rigorous. This paper provides an evidence base to take this agenda for programming and research forward.

Synergistic Disparities and Public Health Mitigation of COVID-19 in the Rural United States	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						Public health ethics; Rural health; Justice; Equity; Health disparities	DRINKING-WATER; ETHICS; INTERVENTIONS; ACCESS	Public health emergencies expose social injustice and health disparities, resulting in calls to address their structural causes once the acute crisis has passed. The COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting and exacerbating global, national, and regional disparities in relation to the benefits and burdens of undertaking critical basic public health mitigation measures such as physical distancing. In the United States, attempts to address the COVID-19 pandemic are complicated by striking racial, economic, and geographic inequities. These synergistic inequities exist in both urban and rural areas but take on a particular character and impact in areas of rural poverty. Rural areas face a diverse set of structural challenges, including inadequate public health, clinical, and other infrastructure and economic precarity, hampering the ability of communities and individuals to implement mitigation measures. Public health ethics demands that personnel address both the tactical, real-time adjustment of typical mitigation tools to improve their effectiveness among the rural poor as well as the strategic, longer-term structural causes of health and social injustice that continue to disadvantage this population.

The experience of law enforcement officers interfacing with suspects who have an intellectual disability - A systematic review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Intellectual disabilities; Police; Law enforcement officer; Vulnerability; United Nations' convention on the rights of persons with disabilities	MENTAL-HEALTH ENCOUNTERS; LEARNING-DISABILITIES; INTERROGATIVE SUGGESTIBILITY; SCREENING TOOL; POLICE WORK; PEOPLE; ADULTS; OFFENDERS; VICTIMS; COMMUNICATION	There is a high prevalence of people with intellectual disability (ID) among those in police custody. Consequently, law enforcement officers (LEOs) at the frontline of the criminal justice system are commonly required to interact with people who have ID. Notwithstanding the frequency of these interactions, research indicates that police exchanges with persons with ID frequently take place against a backdrop of tenuously-resourced disability awareness training. At the time of writing, a paucity of research data exists with respect to the experiences of LEOs operating within this training vacuum at an international level. A better understanding of their experiences could meaningfully inform research, training and improve support programmes for LEO's. We systematically reviewed six databases to identify studies published up to 1st December 2019 reporting the experience of LEOs interfacing with suspects who have an ID. Following a review of 670 abstracts, 16 studies were identified from five countries involving 983 LEOs. LEOs identified 1) a need for specialised training; 2) challenges in identifying people with ID; 3) a need to improve safeguards and 4) challenges in supporting/ communicating with individuals who have ID through the investigation process.

Timor-Leste is one of the countries in the region with the highest adolescent birth rate and huge disparities between socio-economic subgroups. Hence, this study assessed the magnitude and trends in adolescent fertility rates within different socio-demographic subgroups in Timor-Leste. Methods Using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software, data from the Timor-Leste Demographic and Health surveys (TLDHS) were analyzed between 2009 and 2016. We approached the inequality analysis in two steps. First, we disaggregated adolescent fertility rates by four equity stratifiers: wealth index, education, residence and region. Second, we measured the inequality through summary measures, namely Difference, Population Attributable Risk, Ratio and Population Attributable Fraction. A 95% confidence interval was constructed for point estimates to measure statistical significance. Results We found large socio-economic and area-based inequalities over the last 7 years. Adolescent girls who were poor (Population Attributable Fraction: -54.87, 95% CI; - 57.73, - 52.02; Population Attributable Risk: -24.25, 95% CI; - 25.51, - 22.99), uneducated (Difference: 58.69, 95% CI; 31.19, 86.18; Population Attributable Fraction: -25.83, 95% CI; - 26.93, - 24.74), from rural areas (Ratio: 2.76, 95% CI; 1.91, 3.60; Population Attributable Risk: -23.10, 95% CI; - 24.12, - 22.09) and from the Oecussi region (Population Attributable Fraction: -53.37, 95% CI; - 56.07, - 50.67; Difference: 60.49, 95% CI; 29.57, 91.41) had higher chance of having more births than those who were rich, educated, urban residents and from the Dili region, respectively. Conclusions This study identified disproportionately higher burden of teenage birth among disadvantaged adolescents who are, poor, uneducated, rural residents and those living in regions such as Oecussi, Liquica and Manufahi, respectively. Policymakers should work to prevent child marriage and early fertility to ensure continuous education, reproductive health care and livelihood opportunities for adolescent girls. Specialized interventions should also be drawn to the subpopulation that had disproportionately higher adolescent childbirth.

We measured the prevalence and risk factors of different forms of violence against women and girls in South Sudan, which has suffered decades of conflict, most recently in 2013. Methods A population-based survey was conducted among women aged 15-64 in three conflict-affected sites in South Sudan: Juba, Rumbek, and the Protection of Civilian Sites (PoCs) in Juba between 2015 and 2016. Findings A total of 2,244 women between the ages of 15-64 were interviewed. Fifty percent (in the Juba PoCs) to 65% (in Juba and Rumbek) of all female respondents experienced either physical or sexual violence from a partner or non-partner in the course of their lifetimes. Approximately 35% of respondents have experienced rape, attempted rape or other forms of sexual violence by a non-partner during their lifetime. For ever-partnered women, lifetime prevalence of physical and/or sexual partner violence ranged between 54% in the Juba PoCs and 73% in Rumbek. Restrictive marital practices and gender norms, and experiences of conflict were major drivers of both partner and non-partner violence. Conclusion Women and girls in South Sudan suffer among the highest levels of physical and sexual violence in the world. Although the prevalence of sexual assault by non-partners is four times the global average, women are still at greatest risk of physical and sexual assault from intimate partners. Conflict-related and intimate partner violence reinforce each other and are upheld by restrictive gender norms and marital practices. Expansion of comprehensive services, including health and psycho-social support for survivors is urgently needed. Moreover, policies and laws to prevent violence against women and provide survivors with access to justice should be given high priority within the ongoing peacebuilding process in South Sudan.

This is especially pertinent during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is only exacerbating health and economic disparities. This article reviews what a national human rights-aligned tax policy would look like, and then dissects how the international tax rules currently impede individual States, and particularly low- and middle- income countries, to bring their national tax policies in line with human rights. The authors then discuss how international human rights law, including theUN Guiding Principles on Human Rights Impact Assessments of Economic Reforms, can provide a stronger normative foundation to curb harmful tax competition and help resolve disputes over the right to tax multinational companies. Given the paucity of practical tools to embed human rights norms into the process and substance of reforming international tax policies, the authors then develop a set of assessment questions to help operationalise human rights norms into current efforts to re-write the international tax rules.

At the meso-level (institutional-level), early childcare facilities (eg, kindergartens, preschools) are the most important agent of socialisation next to families in young children aged 06 years. In recent years, an increasing amount of studies has focused on contextual and compositional characteristics of early childcare facilities and their association with health (eg, self-rated health), health behaviour (eg, physical activity) and well-being (eg, emotional well-being) in this age group. However, as currently no overview of the available literature on this topic exists, we will conduct a scoping review including various study designs (eg, cross-sectional studies, prospective studies, qualitative studies). Methods and analysis We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. A systematic search of the following scientific databases will be conducted: PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, Education Resources Information Center and The Cochrane Library. During the selection process, we will follow a two-step process. First, two reviewers will independently screen titles/abstracts of all potentially eligible articles by applying a set of previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the completion of the title/abstract screening, full texts of the remaining articles will be screened following the same procedure. To determine inter-rater agreement between reviewers, we will calculate Cohen's Kappa after both steps. Key characteristics (eg, country of origin, sample size, study design) of included articles will be extracted. We will map the evidence available by providing a summary table on the key characteristics extracted and by presenting the associations using various types of illustrations. Ethics and dissemination Since no primary data will be collected for this review, ethical approval is not required. Our findings will be published in an international peer-reviewed journal and presented at national and international conferences.

However, current dementia strategies have not explicitly considered sex and gender differences in the management of dementia to ensure equitable care. The objective of this study was to examine the moderating effect of sex on the quality of care following the implementation of the Quebec Alzheimer Plan (QAP). Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of the evaluation of the QAP consisting of a retrospective chart review of 945 independent, randomly-selected patient charts of males and females 75+ years old with dementia and a visit to one of 13 participating Family Medicine Groups before (October 2011-July 2013) and after (October 2014 - July 2015). The quality of dementia care score, based on Canadian and international recommendations and consensus guidelines, consisted of documented assessments in 10 domains. We used a mixed linear regression model to measure the interaction between sex and the implementation of the QAP on the quality of dementia care score, adjusting for age and number of medications. Results We found that improvements in the quality of dementia care following the QAP were larger for men than women (mean difference = 4.97; 95%CI: 0.08, 9.85). We found that men had a larger improvement in four indicators (driving assessments, dementia medication management, Alzheimer Society referrals, and functional status evaluation), while women had a smaller improvement in three (home care needs, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, and weight). Men were prescribed fewer anticholinergics post-QAP, while women were prescribed more. Cognitive testing improved in men but decreased for women following the QAP; the opposite was observed for caregiver needs. Conclusion While the overall quality of care improved after the implementation of the QAP, this study reveals differences in dementia management between men and women. While we identified areas of inequalities in the care received, it is unclear whether this represents inequities in access to care and health outcomes. Future research should focus on better understanding sex and gender-specific needs in dementia to bridge this gap and better inform dementia strategies.

Health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of diversion programs for low-level drug offenders: A model-based analysis	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article							INJECT DRUGS; HEPATITIS-C; PEOPLE; IMPACT; PRISON; CARE; RELEASE; RISK; INCARCERATION; TRANSMISSION	Background Cycles of incarceration, drug abuse, and poverty undermine ongoing public health efforts to reduce overdose deaths and the spread of infectious disease in vulnerable populations. Jail diversion programs aim to divert low-level drug offenders toward community care resources, avoiding criminal justice costs and disruptions in treatment for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and drug abuse. We sought to assess the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of a jail diversion program for low-level drug offenders. Methods and findings We developed a microsimulation model, calibrated to King County, Washington, that captured the spread of HIV and HCV infections and incarceration and treatment systems as well as preexisting interventions such as needle and syringe programs and opiate agonist therapy. We considered an adult population of people who inject drugs (PWID), people who use drugs but do not inject (PWUD), men who have sex with men, and lower-risk heterosexuals. We projected discounted lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 10-year time horizon with and without a jail diversion program and calculated resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the health system and societal perspectives. We also tracked HIV and HCV infections, overdose deaths, and jail population size. Over 10 years, the program was estimated to reduce HIV and HCV incidence by 3.4% (95% CI 2.7%-4.0%) and 3.3% (95% CI 3.1%-3.4%), respectively, overdose deaths among PWID by 10.0% (95% CI 9.8%-10.8%), and jail population size by 6.3% (95% CI 5.9%-6.7%). When considering healthcare costs only, the program cost $25,500/QALY gained (95% CI $12,600-$48,600). Including savings from reduced incarceration (societal perspective) improved the ICER to $6,200/QALY gained (95% CI, cost-saving $24,300). Sensitivity analysis indicated that cost-effectiveness depends on diversion program participants accessing community programs such as needle and syringe programs, treatment for substance use disorder, and HIV and HCV treatment, as well as diversion program cost. A limitation of the analysis is data availability, as fewer data are available for diversion programs than for more established interventions aimed at people with substance use disorder. Additionally, like any model of a complex system, our model relies on simplifying assumptions: For example, we simplified pathways in the healthcare and criminal justice systems, modeled an average efficacy for substance use disorder treatment, and did not include costs associated with homelessness, unemployment, and breakdown in family structure. Conclusions We found that diversion programs for low-level drug offenders are likely to be cost-effective, generating savings in the criminal justice system while only moderately increasing healthcare costs. Such programs can reduce incarceration and its associated costs, and also avert overdose deaths and improve quality of life for PWID, PWUD, and the broader population (through reduced HIV and HCV transmission). Author summaryWhy was this study done? Strategies for people with substance use disorder based on criminalization and aggressive law enforcement have created barriers to harm reduction while having little or no impact on the number of people who use drugs. Diversion programs redirect individuals with low-level drug and prostitution offenses away from the criminal justice system and into community-based services such as treatment for substance use disorder, housing, and mental health care. Our model-based analysis was designed to assess the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of a jail diversion program for low-level drug offenders. What did the researchers do and find? We developed a stochastic microsimulation model of adults in King County, Washington that captures sexual and injecting-based risk behaviors and partnerships and tracks the 10-year trajectories of people who inject drugs, people who use drugs but do not inject, and the lower-risk general population, with and without a diversion program. We projected HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) incidence, fatal overdoses, jail population size, and lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) experienced in the population, with and without a diversion program. We estimated that the diversion program would reduce cumulative HIV and HCV incidence, fatal overdoses, and the jailed population, would lead to gains in QALYs, and would be highly cost-effective. What do these findings mean? A 2016 United Nations AIDS Programme (UNAIDS) report found that the status quo of criminalizing drug abuse is failing from the public safety and public health perspectives. Our study demonstrates that these perspectives can be aligned. Our analysis suggests that diversion programs are likely to substantially reduce spending in the criminal justice system while moderately increasing spending in the healthcare sector and are likely to be highly cost-effective. The spread of infectious disease stemming from drug injection and the global overcrowding of jails and prisons suggest that, more than ever, effective, cost-effective, and innovative approaches are required to address these crises. Diversion programs are one such program.

N.; Abramson, Michael J.; Li, Shanshan; Guo, Yuming			Socioeconomic level and associations between heat exposure and all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization in 1,814 Brazilian cities: A nationwide case-crossover study	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article							AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; EXTREME HEAT; SPATIAL VARIATION; RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; URBAN; VULNERABILITY; AREA; HEALTH; MORBIDITY	Background Heat exposure, which will increase with global warming, has been linked to increased risk of a range of types of cause-specific hospitalizations. However, little is known about socioeconomic disparities in vulnerability to heat. We aimed to evaluate whether there were socioeconomic disparities in vulnerability to heat-related all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization among Brazilian cities. Methods and findings We collected daily hospitalization and weather data in the hot season (city-specific 4 adjacent hottest months each year) during 2000-2015 from 1,814 Brazilian cities covering 78.4% of the Brazilian population. A time-stratified case-crossover design modeled by quasi-Poisson regression and a distributed lag model was used to estimate city-specific heat-hospitalization association. Then meta-analysis was used to synthesize city-specific estimates according to different socioeconomic quartiles or levels. We included 49 million hospitalizations (58.5% female; median [interquartile range] age: 33.3 [19.8-55.7] years). For cities of lower middle income (LMI), upper middle income (UMI), and high income (HI) according to the World Bank's classification, every 5 degrees C increase in daily mean temperature during the hot season was associated with a 5.1% (95% CI 4.4%-5.7%,P <0.001), 3.7% (3.3%-4.0%,P <0.001), and 2.6% (1.7%-3.4%,P <0.001) increase in all-cause hospitalization, respectively. The inter-city socioeconomic disparities in the association were strongest for children and adolescents (0-19 years) (increased all-cause hospitalization risk with every 5 degrees C increase [95% CI]: 9.9% [8.7%-11.1%],P <0.001, in LMI cities versus 5.2% [4.1%-6.3%],P <0.001, in HI cities). The disparities were particularly evident for hospitalization due to certain diseases, including ischemic heart disease (increase in cause-specific hospitalization risk with every 5 degrees C increase [95% CI]: 5.6% [-0.2% to 11.8%],P =0.060, in LMI cities versus 0.5% [-2.1% to 3.1%],P =0.717, in HI cities), asthma (3.7% [0.3%-7.1%],P =0.031, versus -6.4% [-12.1% to -0.3%],P =0.041), pneumonia (8.0% [5.6%-10.4%],P <0.001, versus 3.8% [1.1%-6.5%],P =0.005), renal diseases (9.6% [6.2%-13.1%],P <0.001, versus 4.9% [1.8%-8.0%],P =0.002), mental health conditions (17.2% [8.4%-26.8%],P <0.001, versus 5.5% [-1.4% to 13.0%],P =0.121), and neoplasms (3.1% [0.7%-5.5%],P =0.011, versus -0.1% [-2.1% to 2.0%],P =0.939). The disparities were similar when stratifying the cities by other socioeconomic indicators (urbanization rate, literacy rate, and household income). The main limitations were lack of data on personal exposure to temperature, and that our city-level analysis did not assess intra-city or individual-level socioeconomic disparities and could not exclude confounding effects of some unmeasured variables. Conclusions Less developed cities displayed stronger associations between heat exposure and all-cause hospitalizations and certain types of cause-specific hospitalizations in Brazil. This may exacerbate the existing geographical health and socioeconomic inequalities under a changing climate.

Stunting in childhood: an overview of global burden, trends, determinants, and drivers of decline	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article						child; infant; nutrition; height; length; linear growth; stunting	NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES; CHILDREN; HEALTH; UNDERNUTRITION; MALNUTRITION; AGE; GROWTH; COUNTRIES; INCOME	Background: Progress has been made worldwide in reducing chronic undernutrition and rates of linear growth stunting in children under 5 y of age, although rates still remain high in many regions. Policies, programs, and interventions supporting maternal and child health and nutrition have the potential to improve child growth and development. Objective: This article synthesizes the available global evidence on the drivers of national declines in stunting prevalence and compares the relative effect of major drivers of stunting decline between countries. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of published peer-reviewed and gray literature analyzing the relation between changes in key determinants of child linear growth and contemporaneous changes in linear growth outcomes over time. Results: Among the basic determinants of stunting assessed wither regression-decomposition analyses, improvement in asset index score was a consistent and strong driver of improved linear growth outcomes. increased parental education was also a strong predictor of Unproved child growth. Of the underlying determinants of stunting, reduced rates of open defecation, improved sanitation infrastructure, and improved access to key maternal health services, including optimal antenatal care and delivery in a health facility or with a skilled birth attendant, all accounted for substantially improved child growth, although the magnitude of variation explained by each differed substantially between countries. At the immediate level, changes in several maternal characteristics predicted modest stunting reductions, including parity, interpregnancy interval, and maternal height. Conclusions: Unique sets of stunting determinants predicted stunting reduction within countries that have reduced stunting. Several common drivers emerge at the basic, underlying, and immediate levels, including improvements in maternal and paternal education, household socioeconomic status, sanitation conditions, maternal health services access, and family planning. Further data collection and in-depth mixed-methods research are required to strengthen recommendations for those countries where the stunting burden remains unacceptably high.

Drivers of stunting reduction in the Kyrgyz Republic: A country case study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article						stunting; linear growth; children; nutrition; exemplar; Kyrgyz Republic; Central Asia; mixed methods	CHILD UNDERNUTRITION; HEALTH; REFORM	Background: Chronic malnutrition among infants and children continues to represent a global public health concern. The Kyrgyz Republic has achieved rapid declines in stunting over the last 20 y, despite modest increases in gross domestic product per capita. Objective: This study aimed to conduct a systematic, in-depth assessment of national, community, household, and individual drivers of nutrition change and stunting reduction, as well as nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs, in the Kyrgyz Republic. Methods: This mixed methods study employed 4 inquiry methods, including: 1) a systematic scoping literature review; 2) retrospective quantitative data analyses, including linear regression multivariable hierarchical modeling, difference-in-difference analysis, and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition; 3) qualitative data collection and analysis; and 4) analysis of key nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs. Results: Stunting prevalence has decreased in the Kyrgyz Republic, however, subnational variations and inequities persist. Child growth Victora curves show improvements in height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) for children in the Kyrgyz Republic between 1997 and 2014, indicating, increased intrauterine growth and population health improvements. The decomposition analysis explained 88.9% (0.637 SD increase) of the predicted change in HAZ for children under 3 y (1997-2012). Key factors included poverty (61%), maternal nutrition (14%), paternal education (6%), fertility (6%), maternal age (3%), and wealth accumulation (2%). Qualitative analysis revealed poverty reduction, increased migration and remittances, food security, and maternal nutrition as key drivers of stunting decline. Systematic scoping literature review findings supported quantitative and qualitative results, and indicated that land reforms and improved food security represented important factors. Key nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs implemented involved breastfeeding promotion, social protection schemes, and land and health sector reforms. Conclusions: Improvements in stunting were achieved amidst political and economic changes. Multilevel enablers, including poverty reduction, improved food security, and introduction of land and health reforms have contributed to improvements in health, nutrition, and stunting among children in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Drivers of stunting reduction in Ethiopia: a country case study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article						stunting; linear growth; children; nutrition; exemplar; Ethiopia; East Africa; mixed methods	AGED 6-59 MONTHS; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; UNDER-5 CHILDREN; CHRONIC MALNUTRITION; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; LINEAR GROWTH; UNDERNUTRITION; DETERMINANTS; PREVALENCE; HOUSEHOLD	Background: Chronic undernutrition in children continues to he a global public health concern. Ethiopia has documented a significant decline in the prevalence of childhood stunting, a measure of chronic undernutrition, over the last 20 y. Objectives: The aim of this research was to conduct a systematic assessment of the determinants that have driven child stunting reduction in Ethiopia from 2000 to 2016, focused on the national, community, household, and individual level. Methods: This study employed both quantitative and qualitative methods. Specifically, a systematic literature review, retrospective quantitative data analysis using Demographic and Health Surveys from 2000-2016, qualitative data collection and analysis, and analyses of key nutrition-specific and -sensitive policies and programs were undertaken. Results: National stunting prevalence improved from 51% in 2000 to 32% in 2016. Regional variations exist, as do pro-rich, pro-urban, and pro-educated inequalities. Child height-for-age a score (HAZ) decomposition explained >100% of predicted change in mean HAZ between 2000 and 2016, with key factors including increases in total consumable crop yield (32% of change), increased number of health workers (28%), reduction in open defecation (13%), parental education (10%), maternal nutrition (5%), economic improvement (4%), and reduced diarrhea incidence (4%). Policies and programs that were key to stunting decline focused on promoting rural agriculture to improve food security; decentralization of the health system, incorporating health extension workers to improve rural access to health services and reduce open defecation; multisectoral poverty reduction strategies; and a commitment to improving girls' education. Interviews with national and regional stakeholders and mothers in communities presented improvements in health service access, women and girls' education, improved agricultural production, and improved sanitation and child care practices as drivers of stunting reduction. Conclusions: Ethiopia's stunting decline was driven by both nutrition-specific and -sensitive sectors, with particular focus on the agriculture sector, health care access, sanitation, and education.

Methods We extracted data from the GBD 2017 study. A series of comparative and descriptive analyses of the disease burden between females and males and countries with different socioeconomic development statuses (Social Demographic Index, SDI). We also analysed the temporal trends of age-standardised disability-adjusted life year rates (ASDR) of TBL cancer at the global and super-regional level by means of joinpoint regression. Finally, we also calculated Concentration Index to explore trends of between-country inequality in cancer burden from 1990 to 2017. Results During the past 27 years, the global incidence of TBL cancer cases and death cases has increased by 100% and 82.3% respectively, but the increase number was mainly influenced by population growth and ageing. After adjustment, from 1990 to 2017, the ASDR of TBL has increased by 3% and the age-standardised death rate has decreased by 7%. The global TBL cancer burden fell by 15.3%. The joinpoint analysis revealed that the overall trend of age-standardised TBL cancer burden for both females and males significantly changed twice between 1990 and 2017, and it varied across countries with different SDI values and was also different between females and males. Age-standardised TBL cancer burden was more concentrated in higher socioeconomic development countries, but the development of healthy inequality showed a downward trend in males while showing an upward trend in females. Conclusion The magnitude and temporal trends of TBL cancer burden varied across countries and sex. This study highlighted the importance of crafting health policy to adapt to local conditions to manage the global burden of TBL cancers.

J	Akaeda, N				Akaeda, Naoki			Contextual Social Trust and Well-Being Inequality: From the Perspectives of Education and Income	JOURNAL OF HAPPINESS STUDIES			English	Article						Contextual social capital; Well-being inequality; Education; Household income; Comparative longitudinal survey data; Three-level multilevel modeling	SELF-RATED HEALTH; LIFE SATISFACTION; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; HAPPINESS; WELFARE; WEALTH; IMPACT; HAPPY; DETERMINANTS; UNEMPLOYMENT	In recent decades, much attention has been paid to subjective well-being (SWB). Extensive research in several fields has frequently examined the determinants of SWB, and previous studies have reported well-being inequality within countries due to education and household income. However, knowledge regarding how well-being inequality due to education and household income varies among countries is limited. To fill this gap, this paper examines whether contextual social trust as a country characteristic reduces well-being inequality due to education and household income. This analysis employs repeated cross-sectional international comparative data from four waves of the European Quality of Life Survey conducted between 2003 and 2016 and two types of multilevel modeling, namely, three-level multilevel models with year fixed effects and cross-classified full models, to examine the cross-level interaction effects of contextual social trust and education and of contextual social trust and household income on SWB. By conducting an international comparative analysis, the present study has found that contextual social trust has negative moderation effects on the association between education and SWB and the association between household income and SWB. These results indicate that high contextual social trust reduces well-being inequality due to education and household income by improving the SWB of citizens with lower positions.

J	Smith-Greenaway, E; Weitzman, A				Smith-Greenaway, Emily; Weitzman, Abigail			Sibling mortality burden in low-income countries: A descriptive analysis of sibling death in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; ADULT MORTALITY; CHILD-DEATH; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; YOUNG-PEOPLE; BEREAVEMENT; HEALTH; FERTILITY; SURVIVAL; PARENTS	In high-income countries, emerging research suggests sibling bereavement can have significant health and life course consequences for young people. Yet, we know far less about its burden in lower-income countries. Due to higher fertility and mortality in lower-income countries, the level, timing, intensity, and circumstances surrounding sibling mortality are likely to follow patterns distinct from those in higher-income settings. Thus, in this study, we offer a descriptive overview of sibling death in 43 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Specifically, we analyze Demographic and Health Survey data from nationally representative samples of 352,930 15- to 34-year-old women, born between 1985 and 2003, to document experiences of sibling death before age 25. On average, roughly one-third of individuals report a deceased sibling in these countries; estimates reach 40-50% of respondents in multiple African countries, particularly those that have experienced conflict and war. Although some sibling deaths occurred before the focal respondent was born, most bereaved individuals recalled a death during their lifetime-often in late childhood/early adolescence. High proportions of bereaved respondents report multiple sibling deaths, highlighting the clustering of deaths within families. Even so, bereaved individuals tend to come from large families and thus frequently have a comparable number of surviving siblings as people who never experienced a sibling die. Together, the results offer a window into global inequality in childhood experiences, and they attest to the need for research that explores the implications of sibling mortality for young people in world regions where the experience is concentrated.

Equity and elderly health in India: reflections from 75th round National Sample Survey, 2017-18, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Elderly heath; Equity; COVID-19; India	LIVING ARRANGEMENT; OLDER-ADULTS	Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, called coronavirus disease - 2019 (COVID-19), has affected more than 200 countries across the globe with a higher fatality rate among the elderly population. Aim of the study is to highlight the vulnerability of the aged amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, and in the light of the recent international evidence, suggests what government could do to mitigate their vulnerability. Methods Data from the recently released (November 2019) 75th Round National Sample Survey (NSS), which was conducted from July 2017 to June 2018, across 8077 rural villages and 6181 urban wards was used for this study. Data collected from 555,115 individuals (rural: 325,232; urban: 229,232) included 42,762 elderly individuals (60 years or above). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used for the calculation. Results Of the total sample of elderly individuals, 27.7% reported suffering from an ailment in the last 15 days, whereas 8.5% had been hospitalized during the last 365 days. Among the elderly, hospitalization rate was higher in the urban areas (OR: 1.23), general social category (OR: 1.18), richest economic quintile (OR: 1.69), and among those living alone (OR: 2.40). Also, among the elderly, 64% of those in the scheduled tribe (social group) and 51% in the poorest economic quintile utilized public facilities for hospitalization. Cardiovascular ailments were the major cause for hospitalization (18.1%) and outpatient visit (32%) among the elderly. Ailments related to diabetes and hypertension constituted 55% of outpatient visit for the elderly. Only 18.9% of the elderly had health insurance though chances of facing catastrophic health expenditures were high among the elderly. 6.6% of elderly female and 1.6% male live alone, and 27.5% of age 80 years and above are immobile. 50% of male and 90% of female are financially dependent on others and more so in poorer economic quintiles. Conclusions The vulnerability of India's elderly increases across economic levels, and other dimensions such as the place of residence, gender, social group (caste), marital status, living arrangements, surviving children, and economic dependence. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a greater risk of social isolation among the elderly, which may cause detrimental health impact.	[Ranjan, Alok; Muraleedharan, V.

While pollution can lead to unhappiness, will pollution abatement simply increase people's happiness? We analyze relevant happiness data collected before and after China's South-to-North Water Diversion Eastern Route Pollution Control Project to test this idea. The empirical results indicate that the pollution abatement project may not enhance happiness in its duration. Some residents may temporarily sacrifice something (such as employment or income), which offsets the positive effect of environmental improvement on their happiness. In subgroup analyses, rural people are found to benefit more from environmental improvement and suffer less in happiness compared with the urban, and so are low-income people compared with the high-income ones. The findings offer new insights into the costs of pollution in terms of happiness and highlight the need to abate pollution meticulously. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This has created the need for a new emphasis on problem prevention. This article highlights the core themes of the bookSetting Limits: Gambling, Science and Public Policy, taking a broad view of the consequences of gambling for society as a burden on health, well-being and equality. The book covers the extent of gambling and gambling-related problems in different societies and presents a critical review of research on industry practices, policy objectives and preventive approaches, including services to people suffering from gambling and its consequences. It discusses the developments in game characteristics and gambling environments and provides evidence on how regulation can affect those. Effective measures to minimize gambling harm exist and many are well supported by scientific evidence. They include restrictions on general availability as well as selective measures to prevent gamblers from overspending. The revenue generated from gambling for the industry, governments, and providers of public services funded from gambling returns presents an obstacle to developing policies to implement harm-reduction measures. A public interest approach must weigh these interests against the suffering and losses of the victims of gambling.

Therefore, we investigated characteristics of successful delivery after an infertility diagnosis among infertile women. Methods: We designed a retrospective cohort study with the main outcome measure of a delivery medical record after the initial diagnosis of infertility. A total of 10,108 women patients who were diagnosed with infertility between 2005 to 2013 in the National Health Insurance Cooperation Cohort Database of Korea were enrolled. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for subsequent delivery were estimated by applying a Cox proportional-hazard regression model. Results: Approximately 55% of infertile women who reported infertility had a delivery eventually. Infertile women who are aged between 30 to 39 (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.84), in low income level (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71-0.84), or diagnosed with diabetes (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.96) were less likely to report a delivery. Conclusion: These findings highlight demographic, socioeconomic, and medical characteristics of reporting a consequent delivery. Although many previous articles reported an association between socioeconomic status and receiving medical evaluation, there were few studies regarding successful delivery after an infertility diagnosis across socioeconomic status. Thus, the maintaining of support for low socioeconomic status infertile women and their family should be considered after the infertility diagnosis in aspects of financial and social approaches.

A systematic review	BMJ SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Review							WOMENS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION; UNINTENDED PREGNANCY; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; EDUCATION; INEQUALITY; ABORTION; PREVALENCE; AUTONOMY	Background Current global maternal and child health policies rarely value gender equality or women's rights and are restricted to policies addressing clinical interventions and family planning. Gender equality influences the knowledge, autonomy and utilisation of contraception and healthcare, thereby affecting maternal and child health. This systematic review aims to analyse the concurrent effect of gender equality and contraception on maternal and under-5 child mortality. Methods A systematic review was conducted to investigate the current evidence. Studies were eligible if three themes-namely, indicators of gender equality (such as female education, labour force participation, gender-based violence), contraception, and maternal or child mortality-were present together in a single article analysing the same sample at the same time. Results Even though extensive literature on this topic exists, only three studies managed to fit the selection criteria. Findings of two studies indicated an association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and infant mortality, and also reported that women's contraceptive use increased the risk of IPV. The third study found that the mother's secondary education attainment significantly reduced child mortality, while the mother's working status increased the odds of child mortality. The researchers of all included studies specified that contraceptive use significantly reduced the risk of child mortality. Conclusion Improvement in gender equality and contraception concurrently affect the reduction in child mortality. These findings provide strong support to address the research gaps and to include a gender equality approach towards maternal and child health policies.

Since 2010, the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has been publishing annual Global Landscape of Climate Finance reports. According to these reports, US$3660 billion has been spent on global climate change projects over the period 2011-2018. Fifty-five percent of this expenditure has gone to wind and solar energy. According to world energy reports, the contribution of wind and solar to world energy consumption has increased from 0.5% to 3% over this period. Meanwhile, coal, oil, and gas continue to supply 85% of the world's energy consumption, with hydroelectricity and nuclear providing most of the remainder. With this in mind, we consider the potential engineering challenges and environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the main energy sources (old and new). We find that the literature raises many concerns about the engineering feasibility as well as environmental impacts of wind and solar. However, none of the current or proposed energy sources is a "panacea". Rather, each technology has pros and cons, and policy-makers should be aware of the cons as well as the pros when making energy policy decisions. We urge policy-makers to identify which priorities are most important to them, and which priorities they are prepared to compromise on.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Chinese; dental visits; health insurance; city of residence; health disparities	ORAL-HEALTH; CARE UTILIZATION; GLOBAL BURDEN; INEQUALITY; LIFE; INEQUITY; VISITS; URBAN	The aims of the study were to present the prevalence of dental service utilization among adults (age between 18 and 65) in Chinese megacities and to examine the associations of health insurance and city of residence with dental visits. This study was a cross-sectional analysis of the 2019 New Era and Living Conditions in Megacities Survey data with a sample of 4835 participants aged 18-65 from 10 different megacities in China. The data including gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of each megacity obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China as a city-level characteristic. After adjusting sampling weights, approximately 24.28% of the participants had at least one dental visit per year. Findings from multilevel mixed-effects linear models showed that participants residing in megacities with higher GDP per capita (beta = 0.07,p< 0.001) who had Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (beta = 0.25,p< 0.001) or Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (beta = 0.19,p< 0.01) had more frequent dental visits after adjusting demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, health status, health behavior and attitude, and oral health indicators. Margins post-estimation model results demonstrated disparities in the predicted probability of having never visited a dentist by types of health insurance and city of residence. In conclusion, the prevalence of dental visits in China was found to be low. This study highlights socioeconomic inequalities in dental service utilization. There is a great need to develop more dental care programs and services and expand health insurance to cover dental care in China.

Stunting prevalence varies greatly across geographical regions and wealth groups. To address child undernutrition, the Ying Yang Bao (YYB) nutritional package has been piloted in China since 2001. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the distributional impact of a hypothetical rollout of the YYB nutritional package on child stunting across provinces and wealth groups in China, with a specific focus on equity. Methods: We used data from China Family Panel Studies and built on extended cost-effectiveness analysis methods. We estimated the distributional impact of a 12-month YYB program targeting children aged 6-36 months across 25 provinces and two wealth groups along three dimensions: the cost of the YYB program; the number of child stunting cases averted by YYB; and the cost per stunting case averted. Children in each province were divided into poverty and non-poverty groups based on the international poverty line of $5.50 per day. We also conducted a range of sensitivity analyses. Results: We showed that 75% coverage of YYB could avert 1.9 million stunting cases among children aged 6-36 months, including 1.3 million stunting cases among children living under the poverty line, at a total cost of yen 5.4-6.2 billion ($1.5-1.8 billion) depending on the type of YYB delivery. The cost per stunting case averted would greatly vary across Chinese provinces and wealth groups, ranging from yen 800 (around $220, Chongqing province) to yen 23,300 (around $6600, Jilin province). In most provinces, the cost per stunting case averted would be lower for children living under the poverty line. Conclusions: YYB could be a pro-poor nutritional intervention package that brings substantial health benefits to poor and marginalized Chinese children, but with large variations in value for money across provinces and wealth groups. This analysis points to the need for prioritization across provinces and a targeted approach for YYB rollout in China.

We argue that the emergence and development of EU regulation of GMOs were shaped by antecedent events, notably bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or 'mad cow disease' and the public fears that ensued around food safety. These regulatory emergencies were a key factor prompting national governments and EU institutions to work out the framework for the application of the precautionary principle to agricultural biotechnology. Moreover, while modern biotechnology techniques eliminate many of the perceived health and safety risks of earlier predecessors, the EU regulatory framework has been slow to keep up, lacking the proper regulatory tools that allow for a balanced policy approach towards the techniques underlying genome editing and synthetic biology. Difference in approaches to the regulation of GMOs between the EU and US, to a large extent, precipitated the transatlantic conflict over agricultural biotechnology. Specifically, a significant incompatibility between the application of the precautionary principle in the EU and the substantial equivalence in the US to assess GM food and feed risk was the main reason for the international trade dispute. The ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union that genome editing techniques will not be warranted exemption from authorisation process suggests that EU policy on agricultural biotechnology is likely to remain stringent. This may complicate the progress of synthetic biology and render the EU vulnerable to future food security and economic contingencies.

A model for measuring and preventing the continued spread of COVID-19 is urgently required to provide smart health care services. This requires using advanced intelligent computing such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive computing, cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. This paper proposes a model for predicting COVID-19 using the SIR and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of the citizens of KSA. Knowing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases each day is critical for mathematical modeling to be able to identify the behavioral effects of the pandemic. It forecasts the situation for the upcoming 700 days. The proposed system predicts whether COVID-19 will spread in the population or die out in the long run. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak and its possible end for three types of scenarios: "no actions," "lockdown," and "new medicines." The effect of interventions like lockdown and new medicines is compared with the "no actions" scenario. The lockdown case delays the peak point by decreasing the infection and affects the area equality rule of the infected curves. On the other side, new medicines have a significant impact on infected curve by decreasing the number of infected people about time. Available forecast data on COVID-19 using simulations predict that the highest level of cases might occur between 15 and 30 November 2020. Simulation data suggest that the virus might be fully under control only after June 2021. The reproductive rate shows that measures such as government lockdowns and isolation of individuals are not enough to stop the pandemic. This study recommends that authorities should, as soon as possible, apply a strict long-term containment strategy to reduce the epidemic size successfully.	[Alanazi, Saad Awadh; Kamruzzaman, M.

GDAR Network	The global diet and activity research (GDAR) network: a global public health partnership to address upstream NCD risk factors in urban low and middle-income contexts	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Upstream determinants; Non-communicable diseases; Diet; Physical activity; Partnerships; Global health; LMICs	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; INTERVENTIONS; ENVIRONMENTS; COUNTRIES	Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death globally. While upstream approaches to tackle NCD risk factors of poor quality diets and physical inactivity have been trialled in high income countries (HICs), there is little evidence from low and middle-income countries (LMICs) that bear a disproportionate NCD burden. Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean are therefore the focus regions for a novel global health partnership to address upstream determinants of NCDs. Partnership The Global Diet and Activity research Network (GDAR Network) was formed in July 2017 with funding from the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Global Health Research Units and Groups Programme. We describe the GDAR Network as a case example and a potential model for research generation and capacity strengthening for others committed to addressing the upstream determinants of NCDs in LMICs. We highlight the dual equity targets of research generation and capacity strengthening in the description of the four work packages. The work packages focus onlearning from the pastthrough identifying evidence and policy gaps and priorities,understanding the presentthrough adolescent lived experiences of healthy eating and physical activity, andco-designing future interventionswith non-academic stakeholders. Conclusion We present five lessons learned to date from the GDAR Network activities that can benefit other global health research partnerships. We close with a summary of the GDAR Network contribution to cultivating sustainable capacity strengthening and cutting-edge policy-relevant research as a beacon to exemplify the need for such collaborative groups.

J	Kidgell, D; Hills, D; Griffiths, D; Endacott, R				Kidgell, Dianna; Hills, Danny; Griffiths, Debra; Endacott, Ruth			Trade agreements and the risks for the nursing workforce, nursing practice and public health: A scoping review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Review						Nursing; Nursing workforce; Public health; Scoping review; Trade in services; Trade agreement; Health services	TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP; PROSPECTIVE POLICY-ANALYSIS; PREFERENTIAL TRADE; MEDICINES; MIGRATION; SERVICES; THREATS; TPP	Background: Trade agreements in the 21st century have evolved to include provisions that affect domestic public policy and public health in signatory countries. There are growing calls for health professionals and public health advocates to pursue an active advisory role in trade negotiations in order to anticipate and prevent negative outcomes for health services and public health. Aim: This scoping review explored current literature to identify existing knowledge of the implications of trade agreements for the nursing workforce, nursing practice and public health using as an example the 2018 'Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership'. Design: Scoping review Data sources: Emerald Insight, Informit, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and a number of specialist Economics, International Trade and Business, and International Relations databases. Grey literature included national and international policy documents. Review method: Literature was selected according to extraction field criteria, supplemented by hand searching of relevant grey literature and snowballing references from the selected literature reference lists. Analysis was undertaken to identify key themes emerging from the literature. Review results: Six key themes relevant to nursing workforce, nursing practice or public health were 1. Lack of consultation with public health and health professionals in trade negotiations; 2. Implications of strengthened intellectual property provisions for equitable access to medicines (including biologics) and medical devices; 3. Threats to government capacity to regulate domestic policy for public health and health services through 'Investor State Dispute Settlement' provisions 4. Threats to government capacity to regulate domestic policy for public health and health services through 'Regulatory Coherence' 5. Potential limited benefits to communities and increased health inequities 6. Potential implications of increased temporary migration. Gaps were identified in the literature for implications for nursing practice and the nursing workforce from regulatory and labour provisions of trade agreements. Conclusions: The analysis of the literature reviewed is of international importance for the nursing workforce, nursing practice and public health. Policymakers must anticipate and respond to how the inclusion of labour or regulatory provisions in trade agreements will affect nursing practice and the nursing workforce, and how this may subsequently impact on the health of communities globally.

The case is made for why civil society organizations (CSOs) must be engaged vigilantly in the COVID-19 response in Africa. Lockdown disruptions and the rerouting of health funds to the pandemic have impeded access to essential sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and social protection services. Compounded by pre-existing inequalities faced by vulnerable populations, the poor SRH outcomes amid COVID-19 call for CSOs to intensify demand for the accountability of governments. CSOs should also continue to persevere in their aim to rapidly close community-health facility gaps and provide safety nets to mitigate the gendered impact of COVID-19. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

National and Subnational Trends in Mortality and Causes of Death in Chinese Children and Adolescents Aged 5-19 Years From 1953 to 2016	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH			English	Article						Mortality; Death causes; Children and adolescents; Trends; China	SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; GLOBAL BURDEN; OLDER CHILDREN; MIDDLE-INCOME; YOUNG-PEOPLE; HEALTH; DISEASE; PREVALENCE; INJURIES	Purpose: We aimed to analyze the recent trends of mortality and rankings of causes of death in Chinese children and adolescents from 1953 to 2016. Methods: Data on mortality and causes of death in Chinese children and adolescents aged 5-19 years were extracted from the China Health Statistics Yearbook and the Global Burden of Disease Study from 1953 to 2016. Mortality variations were analyzed by year, age, sex, province, and causes of death. Results: The mortality of Chinese children and adolescents aged 5-19 years declined steadily from 1953 (366.03/100,000) to 2016 (27.21), with the largest reduction in adolescents aged 15-19 years and the smallest reduction in those aged 10-14 years. Large subnational disparities for all-cause mortality existed in national 31 provinces with higher mortality in western regions compared with eastern regions, but with narrowing disparities between 1981 and 2010. Injuries dominated the causes of death compared with noncommunicable diseases and communicable, maternal and neonatal, and nutritional diseases from 1990 (58.13/100,000 vs. 32.10 and 14.31) to 2016 (22.65 vs. 13.00 and 2.93). In 2016, the leading three causes of death were road injuries (8.30/100,000), drowning (7.25), and leukemia (2.60). Drowning was the leading cause of death for 5- to 14-year-olds, but road injuries have been the leading cause for 15- to 19-year-olds of both sexes since 2010. Conclusions: Although mortality in Chinese adolescents now stands at just 7% of rates in the 1950s, there is a need to address continuing inequalities across sex, economic status, and region.

Automated and partly automated contact tracing: a systematic review to inform the control of COVID-19	LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Review							TRANSMISSION	Evidence for the use of automated or partly automated contact-tracing tools to contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is scarce. We did a systematic review of automated or partly automated contact tracing. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, OVID Global Health, EBSCO Medical COVID Information Portal, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and Google Advanced for articles relevant to COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, influenza, or Ebola virus, published from Jan 1, 2000, to April 14, 2020. We also included studies identified through professional networks up to April 30, 2020. We reviewed all full-text manuscripts. Primary outcomes were the number or proportion of contacts (or subsequent cases) identified. Secondary outcomes were indicators of outbreak control, uptake, resource use, cost-effectiveness, and lessons learnt. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020179822). Of the 4036 studies identified, 110 full-text studies were reviewed and 15 studies were included in the final analysis and quality assessment. No empirical evidence of the effectiveness of automated contact tracing (regarding contacts identified or transmission reduction) was identified. Four of seven included modelling studies that suggested that controlling COVID-19 requires a high population uptake of automated contact-tracing apps (estimates from 56% to 95%), typically alongside other control measures. Studies of partly automated contact tracing generally reported more complete contact identification and follow-up compared with manual systems. Automated contact tracing could potentially reduce transmission with sufficient population uptake. However, concerns regarding privacy and equity should be considered. Well designed prospective studies are needed given gaps in evidence of effectiveness, and to investigate the integration and relative effects of manual and automated systems. Large-scale manual contact tracing is therefore still key in most contexts.

Green Apartheid: Urban green infrastructure remains unequally distributed across income and race geographies in South Africa	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Access; Green space; Environmental justice; Global South; Inequalities	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; EASTERN CAPE; SMALL TOWNS; SPACE; FORESTS; ACCESS; TREE	Urban green infrastructure provides ecosystem services that are essential to human wellbeing. A dearth of national-scale assessments in the Global South has precluded the ability to explore how political regimes, such as the forced racial segregation in South Africa during and after Apartheid, have influenced the extent of and access to green infrastructure over time. We investigate whether there are disparities in green infrastructure distributions across race and income geographies in urban South Africa. Using open-source satellite imagery and geographic information, along with national census statistics, we find that public and private green infrastructure is more abundant, accessible, greener and more treed in high-income relative to low-income areas, and in areas where previously advantaged racial groups (i.e. White citizens) reside. Areas with White residents report 6-fold higher income, have 11.7% greater tree cover, 8.9% higher vegetation greenness and live 700 m closer to a public park than areas with predominantly Black African, Indian, and Coloured residents. The inequity in neighborhood greenness levels has been maintained (for Indian and Coloured areas) and further entrenched (for Black African areas) since the end of Apartheid in 1994 across the country. We also find that these spatial inequities are mirrored in both private (gardens) and public (street verges, parks, green belts) spaces, hinting at the failure of governance structures to plan for and implement urban greening initiatives. By leveraging open-access satellite data and methods presented here, there is scope for civil society to monitor urban green infrastructure over time and thereby hold governments accountable to addressing environmental justice imperatives in the future.

Ethical issues in global neuroimaging genetics collaborations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Bioethics; Neuroethics; Genethics; Neuroimaging genetics; Global research collaborations	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; HEALTH RESEARCH DATA; MENTAL-HEALTH; INCIDENTAL FINDINGS; BIG DATA; BIOGENETIC EXPLANATIONS; PSYCHIATRIC GENOMICS; BRAIN ACTIVATION; IMAGING GENETICS; FAMILY-MEMBERS	Neuroimaging genetics is a rapidly developing field that combines neuropsychiatric genetics studies with imaging modalities to investigate how genetic variation influences brain structure and function. As both genetic and imaging technologies improve further, their combined power may hold translational potential in terms of improving psychiatric nosology, diagnosis, and treatment. While neuroimaging genetics studies offer a number of scientific advantages, they also face challenges. In response to some of these challenges, global neuroimaging genetics collaborations have been created to pool and compare brain data and replicate study findings. Attention has been paid to ethical issues in genetics, neuroimaging, and multi-site collaborative research, respectively, but there have been few substantive discussions of the ethical issues generated by the confluence of these areas in global neuroimaging genetics collaborations. Our discussion focuses on two areas: benefits and risks of global neuroimaging genetics collaborations and the potential impact of neuroimaging genetics research findings in lowand middle-income countries. Global neuroimaging genetics collaborations have the potential to enhance relations between countries and address global mental health challenges, however there are risks regarding inequity, exploitation and data sharing. Moreover, neuroimaging genetics research in low- and middle-income countries must address the issue of feedback of findings and the risk of essentializing and stigmatizing interpretations of mental disorders. We conclude by examining how the notion of solidarity, informed by an African Ethics framework, may justify some of the suggestions made in our discussion.

A SAMINOR Study	JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						boarding school; Sami; indigenous; depression; well-being; disability pension; discrimination; violence; colonialism and resilience	ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION; RESILIENCE SCALE; INDIGENOUS SAMI; MENTAL-HEALTH; POPULATIONS; NORWAY; ADOLESCENTS; PERSONALITY; SYMPTOMS; VALIDITY	Indigenous Sami and Kven minority children in Norway were during the 20th century placed at boarding schools to hasten their adoption of the Norwegian majority language and culture. This is the first population-based study examining health, well-being and disability pension rates among these children. Data stem from two epidemiological studies conducted in 2003/04 (SAMINOR 1) and 2012 (SAMINOR 2) by the Centre for Sami Health Research. The SAMINOR 1 study includedN = 13,974 residents (50.1% women,M-age = 52.9 years) andn = 2,125 boarding participants (49.6% women,M-age = 56.2 years). The SAMINOR 2 part includedN = 10,512 residents (55.5% women,M-age = 47.6 years) andn = 1246 boarding participants (48.7% women,M-age = 54.1 years). Main outcome measures are mental and general health, well-being and disability pension linearly regressed upon the predictors. We observed minor differences between boarding and non-boarding participants that generally disfavored the former, of which many disappeared after covariate adjustment. Boarding school participants reported more discrimination, violence, unhealthier lifestyle behavior (smoking), less education and household income compared to non-boarding participants. The exceptionally long timeframe between boarding school and the current outcome measures (40-50 years) is a likely reason for the weak associations. The study supports the international literature on health inequalities and highlights the risk of ill health following boarding school placement of indigenous or minority children. On a positive note, participants reporting stronger ethnic belonging (strong Sami identity) were well protected, and even functioned better in terms of lower disability rates than majority Norwegians.

Identifying Issues and Priorities in Reporting Back Environmental Health Data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						concept mapping; research report-back; environmental health; community engagement	COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE; EXPOSURES; ENGAGEMENT; CHALLENGES; PRINCIPLES; EDUCATION; BENEFITS; BEHAVIOR	Experts recommend reporting environmental exposure results back to research participants and communities, yet environmental health researchers need further guidance to improve the practice of reporting back. We present the results of a workshop developed to identify pertinent issues and areas for action in reporting back environmental health research results. Thirty-five attendees participated, brainstorming responses to the prompt: "What are some specific issues that are relevant to reporting back research results to individuals or the larger community?", and then grouping responses by similarity and rating their importance. Based on a combined theoretical foundation of grounded theory and qualitative content analysis, we used concept mapping to develop a collective understanding of the issues. Visual maps of the participants' responses were created using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. The resulting concept map provided a spatial depiction of five issue areas: Effective Communication Strategies, Community Knowledge and Concerns, Uncertainty, Empowering Action, and Institutional Review and Oversight (listed from highest to lowest rating). Through these efforts, we disentangled the complex issues affecting how and whether environmental health research results are reported back to participants and communities, by identifying five distinct themes to guide recommendations and action. Engaging community partners in the process of reporting back emerged as a unifying global theme, which could improve how researchers report back research results by understanding community context to develop effective communication methods and address uncertainty, the ability to act, and institutional concerns about beneficence and justice.

Household-Reported Availability of Drinking Water in Africa: A Systematic Review	WATER			English	Review						drinking water; water supply; availability; sufficiency; continuity; intermittency; litres per capita per day; African Union	RURAL WATER; PIPED WATER; CONSUMPTION; SANITATION; INDICATORS; PATTERNS; ACCESS; HEALTH; IMPACT; INEQUALITIES	Domestic drinking water supplies prone to interruptions and low per capita domestic water availability have been frequently reported among African households. Despite expanded international monitoring indicators that now include metrics of water availability, the range of methods used for measuring and monitoring availability remains unclear in Africa. Few household surveys have historically assessed water continuity and per capita availability, and both pose measurement challenges. This paper aims to examine the methods used to measure availability and synthesise evidence on African domestic water availability by systematically reviewing the literature from 2000-2019. Structured searches were conducted in five databases: Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, GEOBASE, Compendex and PubMed/Medline. A total of 47 of 2406 reports met all inclusion criteria. Included studies were based on empirical research which reported the household's perspective on a water availability measure. Most studies had methodological problems such as small sample sizes, non-representative sampling and incomplete reporting of methods and measures of uncertainty. Measurement of drinking water availability is primarily reliant on quantifying litres/capita/day (LPCD). Only four (9%) of the included studies reported an average water availability over the international benchmark of 50 LPCD. This pattern of water insufficiency is broadly consistent with previous studies of domestic water availability in Africa. The review highlights the need for high-quality and representative studies to better understand the uncertainties and differences in household water availability across Africa, and the methods used to measure it.

Transformational improvement in quality care and health systems: the next decade	BMC MEDICINE			English	Article						Health systems; Patient safety; Quality of care; Universal health coverage; Low-; middle- and high-income countries		BackgroundHealthcare is amongst the most complex of human systems. Coordinating activities and integrating newer with older ways of treating patients while delivering high-quality, safe care, is challenging. Three landmark reports in 2018 led by (1) the Lancet Global Health Commission, (2) a coalition of the World Health Organization, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Bank, and (3) the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine of the United States propose that health systems need to tackle care quality, create less harm and provide universal health coverage in all nations, but especially low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study is to review these reports with the aim of advancing the discussion beyond a conceptual diagnosis of quality gaps into identification of practical opportunities for transforming health systems by 2030.Main bodyWe analysed the reports via text-mining techniques and content analyses to derive their key themes and concepts. Initiatives to make progress include better measurement, using the capacities of information and communications technologies, taking a systems view of change, supporting systems to be constantly improving, creating learning health systems and undergirding progress with effective research and evaluation. Our analysis suggests that the world needs to move from 2018, the year of reports, to the 2020s, the decade of action. We propose three initiatives to support this move: first, developing a blueprint for change, modifiable to each country's circumstances, to give effect to the reports' recommendations; second, to make tangible steps to reduce inequities within and across health systems, including redistributing resources to areas of greatest need; and third, learning from what goes right to complement current efforts focused on reducing things going wrong. We provide examples of targeted funding which would have major benefits, reduce inequalities, promote universality and be better at learning from successes as well as failures.ConclusionThe reports contain many recommendations, but lack an integrated, implementable, 10-year action plan for the next decade to give effect to their aims to improve care to the most vulnerable, save lives by providing high-quality healthcare and shift to measuring and ensuring better systems- and patient-level outcomes. This article signals what needs to be done to achieve these aims.

We offer business leaders a caveat, it is dangerous to ignore the impact of VUCA on the smooth functioning of an organisation. In terms of digital transformation during lockdown this article offers three key lessons that can so far be discerned from the pandemic period, firstly organisations must improve their digital maturity, secondly, less digitally mature organisations are more fragile and finally organisations with higher levels of digital maturity are generally more flexible.

J	Otake, Y; Tamming, T				Otake, Yuko; Tamming, Teisi			Sociality and temporality in local experiences of distress and healing: Ethnographic research in northern Rwanda	TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						global mental health; healing; hope; local idioms of distress; Rwanda; war and conflict	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; NARRATIVE EXPOSURE THERAPY; MENTAL-HEALTH; GENOCIDE; SETTINGS; CHILDREN; JUSTICE; WAR	Prior studies have traced sociality and temporality as significant features of African healing. However, association between the two has not been explicitly investigated. This paper explores how sociality and temporality are associated in local experiences of distress and healing among northern Rwandans. The ethnographic research, including in-depth interviews, focus-group discussions and participant observation, was conducted in 2015-2016, with 43 participants from the Musanze district who have suffered from not only the genocide but also post-genocide massacres. Findings identified common local idioms of distress:ibikomere(wounded feelings),ihungabana(mental disturbances),ihahamuka(trauma), andkurwara mu mutwe(illness of the head, severe mental illness). One stage of distress was perceived to develop into another, slightly more serious than the previous. Social isolation played a significant role in the development as it activated 'remembering' and 'thinking too much' about the past and worsened symptoms. Subsequently, healing was experienced through social reconnection and a shift of time orientation from the past to the future; the healing experience traced a process of leaving the past behind, moving forwards and creating a future through community involvement. The experiences of distress and healing in this population were explained by two axes, i.e. sociality (isolation - reconnection) and temporality (past - future), which are associated with each other. Given the sociality-temporality association in African post-war healing, the study highlights that assistant programmes that facilitate social practice and future creation can be therapeutic and be an alternative for people who cannot benefit from talking-based and trauma-focused approaches.

Worldwide, five billion people lack access to safe, timely, and affordable surgical and anesthesia care when needed. This disparity results in over 18 million preventable deaths each year and is responsible for one-third of the global burden of disease. Here, we evaluate the role of surgical care in protecting human rights and attempt to make a human rights argument for universal access to safe surgical care. Material and methods: A scoping review was done using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify articles evaluating human rights and disparities in accessing surgical care globally. A conceptual framework is proposed to implement global surgical interventions with a human rights-based approach. Results: Disparities in accessing surgical care remain prevalent around the world, including but not limited to gender inequality, socioeconomic differentiation, sexual stigmatization, racial and religious disparities, and cultural beliefs. Lack of access to surgery impedes lives in full health and economic prosperity, and thus violates human rights. Our normative framework proposes human rights principles to make surgical policy interventions more inclusive and effective. Conclusion: Acknowledging human rights in the provision of surgical care around the world is critical to attain and sustain the Sustainable Development Goals and universal health coverage. National Surgical, Obstetric, and Anesthesia Planning and wider health systems strengthening require the integration of human rights principles in developing and implementing policy interventions to ensure equal and universal access to comprehensive health care services.

J	Grenier, AM				Grenier, Amanda M.			The conspicuous absence of the social, emotional and political aspects of frailty: the example of the<i>White Book on Frailty</i>	AGEING & SOCIETY			English	Article						frailty; fourth age; deep old age; vulnerability; precarity; inequality; critical gerontology; care systems	OLD-AGE; HEALTH; EXPERIENCES; CALL; CARE	Over the last 15 years, frailty has become a dominant discourse on late life. Taken-for-granted knowledge and practice can be seen in initiatives such as the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics'White Book on Frailty. This paper begins with an overview of key themes on frailty from the biomedical literature, followed by critical literature in the social sciences and humanities. It discusses the tensions within the biomedical field, frailty as a social construction and 'social imaginary', practices of frailty as historically linked to political systems of care, and frailty as an emotional and relational experience. It then draws on a critical discourse analysis to assess the 2016White Book on Frailty. Drawing on the idea of 'significant absences', the paper highlights the gaps that exist where the social and emotional understandings and political readings of frailty are concerned. The paper concludes by outlining the need to recognise the 'politics of frailty' including the power relations that are deeply embedded in the knowledge and practices surrounding frailty, and to incorporate older people's experience and ideas of vulnerability into research, policy and care practice.

J	Adeyinka, DA; Muhajarine, N; Petrucka, P; Isaac, EW				Adeyinka, Daniel Adedayo; Muhajarine, Nazeem; Petrucka, Pammla; Isaac, Elon Warnow			Inequities in child survival in Nigerian communities during the Sustainable Development Goal era: insights from analysis of 2016/2017 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Social determinants of health; Sustainable development goals; Neonatal mortality; Post-neonatal mortality; Child mortality; Child survival; Multilevel analysis; Multinomial regression; Nigeria	UNDER-5 MORTALITY; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; INTERVAL; INFANT; HEALTH; RISK	BackgroundChild survival is a major concern in Nigeria, as it contributes 13% of the global under-five mortalities. Although studies have examined the determinants of under-five mortality in Nigeria, the comparative roles of social determinants of health at the different stages of early childhood development have not been concurrently investigated. This study, therefore, aimed to identify the social determinants of age-specific childhood (0-59months) mortalities, which are disaggregated into neonatal mortality (0-27days), post-neonatal mortality (1-11months) and child mortality (12-59months), and estimate the within-and between-community variations of mortality among under-five children in Nigeria. This study provides evidence to guide stakeholders in planning for effective child survival strategies in the Nigerian communities during the Sustainable Development Goals era.MethodsUsing the 2016/2017 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, we performed multilevel multinomial logistic regression analysis on data of a nationally representative sample of 29,786 (weighted=30,960) live births delivered 5 years before the survey to 18,497 women aged 15-49years and nested within 16,151 households and 2227 communities.ResultsDeterminants of under-five mortality differ across the neonatal, post-neonatal and toddler/pre-school stages in Nigeria. Unexpectedly, attendance of skilled health providers during delivery was associated with an increased neonatal mortality risk, although its effect disappeared during post-neonatal and toddler/pre-school stages. Also, our study found maternal-level factors such as maternal education, contraceptive use, maternal wealth index, parity, death of previous children, and quality of perinatal care accounted for high variation (39%) in childhood mortalities across the communities. The inclusion of other compositional and contextual factors had no significant additional effect on childhood mortality risks across the communities.ConclusionThis study reinforces the importance of maternal-level factors in reducing childhood mortality, independent of the child, household, and community-level characteristics in the Nigerian communities. To tackle childhood mortalities in the communities, government-led strategies should prioritize implementation of community-based and community-specific interventions aimed at improving socioeconomic conditions of women. Training and continuous mentoring with adequate supervision of skilled health workers must be ensured to improve the quality of perinatal care in Nigeria.

J	Friel, S				Friel, Sharon			Redressing the Corporate Cultivation of Consumption: Releasing the Weapons of the Structurally Weak	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Food Corporations; Power; Structure; Governance	FRAMEWORK CONVENTION; INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; POLICY; FOOD; TRADE; POWER; DISCOURSE; IDEAS; STRATEGIES	Corporate control of the global food system has resulted in greater global availability of highly processed, packaged and very palatable unhealthy food and beverages. Environmental harm, including climate change and biodiversity loss, occurs along the supply chains associated with trans-national corporations' (TNCs') practices and products. In essence, the corporatization of the global food system has created the conditions that cultivate excess consumption, manufacture disease epidemics and harm the environment. TNCs have used their structural power - their positions in material structures and organizational networks - to establish rules, processes and norms that reinforce and extend the paradigm of the neoliberal corporate food system. As a result, policy and regulatory environments, and societal norms are favourable to TNC's interests, to the detriment of nutrition, health and environmental outcomes. There is hope, however. Power, of which there is many forms, is held not just by the TNCs but by all actors concerned about and connected to the food system. This paper aims to understand these power dynamics, and identify how structurally weak, public-interest actors can release their agency and work to achieve positive structural change. Such an analysis will help understand how the status quo can be disrupted and healthy and sustainable food systems created. The paper draws from the health governance and social movement literature, examining the Doha Declaration on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and Public Health, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), and the Divestment movement. These cases demonstrate the many 'weapons of the weak' that can, against all odds recalibrate structural inequities. There is no one approach to transforming the corporate food system to become a healthy and sustainable food system. It involves coalition building; articulation of an ambitious shared vision; strategic use of multi-level institutional processes; social mobilization among like-minded and unusual bedfellows, and organized campaigns; political and policy entrepreneurs, and compelling issue framing.

J	Okafor-Yarwood, I; Adewumi, IJ				Okafor-Yarwood, Ifesinachi; Adewumi, Ibukun Jacob			Toxic waste dumping in the Global South as a form of environmental racism: Evidence from the Gulf of Guinea	AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						Bamako Convention; Basel Convention; Africa; environmental justice; e-waste		Toxic waste is chemical compounds that, when ingested or inhaled, can cause physiological impairment and, in extreme cases, death. It is also known for its detrimental effect on the environment when disposed of in an unsafe manner. Yet, countries in the Gulf of Guinea continue to be targeted by Western waste-brokers notwithstanding the existence of laws prohibiting the transboundary disposal of such materials. There is also a rise in the export of electronic waste (e-waste) from developed countries to countries in the region, purportedly as reusable electronics, much of which ends up in landfills. The primitive recycling techniques of this e-waste undermines the health of the local populations and their environment due to inadequate care of the heavy metal and toxin content. Drawing on examples from Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana, this paper argues that toxic waste dumping in the Gulf of Guinea amounts to environmental racism. The article makes recommendations relating to the challenges of toxic waste dumping in the Gulf of Guinea, including the need for countries to implement the provisions of the Basel and Bamako conventions in their entirety, recognise acts of environmental racism as violations of human rights, and for young people to rise to the occasion as 'agents of change'.

J	Nourpanah, S				Nourpanah, Shiva			The Construction of Gratitude in the workplace: Temporary foreign workers employed in health care	INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION			English	Article							NURSES	In capitalist societies, workers feel, or feel obliged to feel grateful for having a job. In a world marked by global inequality, migrants from the global South to the North are expected to feel gratitude for their opportunity to move to and live in a first world country. In the case of temporary foreign workers, both these sorts of gratitude come together. The political economy regime governing the conditions of work and cross-border movement for temporary foreign workers employed in health care in Canada engenders feelings of gratefulness from workers towards their employers. Contextualized within a cross-disciplinary study of gratitude as a social construct, this article uses the case of this particular sort of work and migration gratitude to develop knowledge on the nuanced and complex ways in which structures of feeling lead from and loop back into capitalist political economies.

J	Silva, DAS				Santos Silva, Diego Augusto			Physical inactivity as a risk factor to mortality by ischemic heart disease during economic and political crisis in Brazil	PEERJ			English	Article						Physical activity; Public health; Kinesiology; Mortality; Heart disease; Cardiology	HEALTH; AUSTERITY	Background: To investigate the burden of mortality due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) attributable to low levels of physical activity in the Brazilian population (aged >= 25 years) before, during and after economic and political crises (2007-2017). Methods: This study was focused on IHD as a cause of death. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases (10th revision) codes related to IHD have been mapped. The data used for the physical activity estimates of the present study refer to surveys with random sampling carried out in the Brazilian territory that considers all domains of physical activity. The contribution of physical activity for mortality due to IHD was estimated using a comparative risk assessment approach. In addition, we verified the association between mortality due to IHD attributable to low levels of physical activity according to the Socio-demographic Index of the Brazilian states. Results: For males it was estimated that in 2007 and 2017 there were, respectively, 9,585 and 11,821 deaths due to IHD as a result low physical activity. For females there were 8,689 deaths in 2007 and 10,779 deaths in 2017 due to IHD attributable to low physical activity. From 2007 to 2017, there was 12.0% (for males) and 16.0% (for females) of reduction in age-adjusted mortality rate due to IHD attributable to low physical activity. This reduction was not observed in the Northern and Northeastern regions of Brazil for the male population. Brazilian states with better socioeconomic conditions showed greater reductions in age-adjusted mortality rate due to IHD attributable to low physical activity (male: rho = -0.74; female: rho = -0.54) Conclusion: The fiscal austerity policies implemented and the lower investment in social programs in the period of economic and political crisis highlighted the social inequalities between Brazilian geographic regions for the burden of mortality due to IHD attributable to low levels of physical activity.

An Analysis of Care Seeking and Equity in 24 USAID Priority Countries	GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article								Pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria are leading causes of under-5 mortality. Accelerated reductions in illness burden are needed to meet childhood Sustainable Development Goals. Understanding where parents take sick children for care is key to improving equitable, high-quality treatment for these childhood illnesses and catalyzing reductions in morbidity and mortality. We analyzed the most recent Demographic and Health Survey data in 24 of the United States Agency for International Development's maternal and child health priority countries to examine levels and sources of care for children sick with 3 illness classifications: symptoms of acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, or fever. On average, across countries analyzed, one-third of children had recent experience with at least 1 of the 3 classifications. The majority (68.2%) of caregivers sought external advice or treatment for their sick children, though the level is far higher for the wealthiest (74.3%) than poorest (63.1%) families. Among those who sought out-of-home care, 51.1% used public sources and 42.5% used private-sector sources. Although sources for sick child care varied substantially by region and country, they were consistent across the 3 illness classifications. Urban and wealthier families reported more use of private sources compared with rural and poorer families. Though 35.2% of the poorest families used private sources, most of these (57.2%) were retail outlets like pharmacies and shops, while most wealthier families who sought care in the private sector went to health facilities (62.4%). Efforts to strengthen the quality of integrated management of sick child care must therefore reach both public and private facilities as well as private pharmacies, shops, and other retail outlets. Stakeholders across sectors must collaborate to reach all population groups with high-quality child health services and reduce disparities in care-seeking behaviors. Such cross-sectoral efforts will build clinical and institutional capacity and more efficiently allocate resources, ultimately resulting in stronger, more resilient health systems.	[Bradley, Sarah E.

Global surgeries include 91 common cases of general and specialized surgeries in hospitals; fixed tariffs are annually defined for these surgeries, and insurance companies must pay medical centers based on these tariffs. The aim of this study was to examine and compare hospital bills with global surgery tariffs at Hazrate Rasoole Akram Educational and Medical Center in 2017. Methods This descriptive-analytic study was conducted retrospectively and compared the global and actual costs of global surgeries performed in the third quarter of the year 2017 at Hazrate Rasoole Akram Educational and Medical Center. Required data on the actual costs of surgeries was collected through the Hospital Information System (HIS) and patients' records. Information on the global costs was obtained from the Annual Circulars of Insurance Council for the studied period about the cost of global surgeries. Linear regression (STATA13 software) was used to investigate the effect of items on tariff and invoice differences; concerning other calculations, EXCEL software was used. Results The highest frequency of global surgeries was related to ophthalmic surgery which accounted for approximately half of total surgeries performed at Hazrate Rasoole Akram Hospital. The most significant difference between global tariff and invoice was also related to ophthalmic surgery (188709.3 Dollar a year).Overall, the actual hospital bills were much higher than the tariffs approved for global surgeries, and the total difference was 461805.5 Dollar. The results revealed that there was a significant relationship between some of the items such as the cost of operating rooms, anesthesia and other services. Conclusions Referral hospitals which are at the level three of referral networks usually treat more complex patients; this should be taken into account when defining surgery tariffs of these centers. On the other hand, hospitals need to control the costs and reduce the end cost of these surgeries by improving clinical management and cost management. In addition, prospective and case-based payment methods can control health costs.

A systematic review of the factors - barriers and enablers - affecting the implementation of clinical commissioning policy to reduce health inequalities in the National Health Service (NHS), UK	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						General Practitioner commissioning; Population health; Health inequalities; National Health Service; Systematic review	METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE; CARE; ENGLISH; EQUITY; PERCEPTIONS; PROGRESS; ENGLAND; FUTURE	Objective: The aim of the present study is two-fold. First, it attempts to identify the barriers and enablers of implementing clinical commissioning policy. Second, it synthesises how these barriers and enablers affect the success of National Health Service (NHS) efforts to reduce health inequalities in the UK. Methods: A systematic review was conducted. We searched large biomedical bibliographic databases, namely MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Allied & Complementary Medicine, DH-DATA, Global Health and CINAHL for primary studies, conducted in the UK, that assessed the factors - barriers and enablers related to health inequalities, published from 2010 onwards and in English, and reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. We used Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal and Mixed Methods Appraisal tools to assess the methodological qualities, and synthesised by performing thematic analysis. Two reviewers independently screened the articles and extracted data. Results: We included six primary studies (including a total of 1155 participants) in the final review. The studies reported two broad categories, under four separate themes: (1) the agenda of health inequalities has not been given priority; (2) there was very little evidence for reducing health inequalities through the clinical commissioning (CC) process; (3) CC was positively associated with the restructuring of NHS; and (4) CC brings better collaboration and engagement, which led to some improvements in health services access, utilisation and delivery at the local level. Conclusion: This study provides useful factors - barriers and enablers - to implement and deliver clinical commissioning policy in improving health and well-being. These factors could be assessed in future to develop objective measures and interventions to establish the link between commissioning and health inequalities. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Despite a variety of female contraceptive options,male contraceptive options are limited to the condom and vasectomy. Condoms have high failure rates and surgical vasectomy is not reliably reversible. There is a global need and desire for novel male contraceptive methods. Hormonal methods have progressed the furthest in clinical development and androgen plus progestin formulations hold promise as a marketable, reversible male contraceptive over the next decade. Investigators have tested androgen plus progestin approaches using oral, transdermal, subdermal, and injectable drug formulations and demonstrated the short-term safety and reversibility of hormonal male contraception. The most commonly reported side effects associated with hormonal male contraception include weight gain, acne, slight suppression of serum high-density cholesterol, mood changes, and changes in libido. Efficacy trials of hormonal male contraceptives have demonstrated contraceptive efficacy rates greater than that of condoms. Although there has been less progression in the development of nonhormonal male contraceptives, potentially reversible vaso-occlusive methods are currently in clinical trials in some countries. Various studies have confirmed both men and women's desire for novel male contraceptives. Barriers to development include an absence of investment from pharmaceutical companies, concerns regarding side effects and spermatogenic rebound with hormonal methods, and lack of clear reversibility and proven effectiveness of nonhormonal methods. The ultimate availability of male contraceptives could have an important impact on decreasing global unintended pregnancy rates (currently 40% of all pregnancies) and will be a step towards reproductive justice and greater equity in family planning.

PECUNIA Grp	Exploring the identification, validation, and categorization of the cost and benefits of criminal justice in mental health: the PECUNIA project	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Criminal justice intersectoral costs and benefits; Mental health; Health economics research; Societal perspective; Methodology; PECUNIA	SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVE; DISORDERS; BURDEN	Background Mental health disorders and their treatments produce significant costs and benefits in both healthcare and non-healthcare sectors. The latter are often referred to as intersectoral costs and benefits (ICBs). Little is known about healthcare-related ICBs in the criminal justice sector and how to include these in health economics research. Objectives The triple aim of this study is (i) to identify healthcare-related ICBs in the criminal justice sector, (ii) to validate the list of healthcare-related ICBs in the criminal justice sector on a European level by sector-specific experts, and (iii) to classify the identified ICBs. Methods A scientific literature search in PubMed and an additional grey literature search, carried out in six European countries, were used to retrieve ICBs. In order to validate the international applicability of the ICBs, a survey was conducted with an international group of experts from the criminal justice sector. The list of criminal justice ICBs was categorized according to the PECUNIA conceptual framework. Results The full-text analysis of forty-five peer-reviewed journal articles and eleven grey literature sources resulted in a draft list of items. Input from the expert survey resulted in a final list of fourteen unique criminal justice ICBs, categorized according to the care atom. Conclusion This study laid further foundations for the inclusion of important societal costs of mental health-related interventions within the criminal justice sector. More research is needed to facilitate the further and increased inclusion of ICBs in health economics research.	[Janssen, Luca M. M.; Pokhilenko, Irina; Evers, Silvia M. A. A.; Paulus, Aggie T.

The aim of the present work was to review the global and national policies and practices that address sex equality in health with a focus on CVDs in women. Scientific databases and health organizations' websites that presented/discussed policies and initiative targeting to enhance a sex-centered approach regarding general health and/or specifically cardiac health care were reviewed in a systematic way. In total, 61 relevant documents were selected. The selected policies and initiatives included position statements, national action plans, evidence-based guidelines, guidance/recommendations, awareness campaigns, regulations/legislation, and state-of-the art reports by national/international projects and conferences. The target audiences of large stakeholders (eg, American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were female citizens, health professionals, and researchers. Much as policy-makers have recognized the sex/gender gap in the CVD field, there is still much to be done. Thereby, tailor-made strategies should be designed, evaluated, and delivered on a global and most importantly a national basis to achieve gender equity with regard to CVDs.

Feasibility of implementing a text-based symptom-monitoring program of endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer patients during treatment	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Symptom assessment; Text-based monitoring; Smartphones; Breast cancer; Ovarian cancer; Endometrial cancer	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; REPORTED OUTCOMES; CARE; ONCOLOGY; COMMUNICATION; MANAGEMENT; FATIGUE; IMPROVE; SOCIETY; SURGERY	Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of implementing systematic patient symptom monitoring during treatment using a smartphone. Methods Endometrial [n = 50], ovarian [n = 70] and breast [n = 193] cancer patients participated in text-based symptom reporting for up to 12 months. In order to promote equity, patients without a smartphone were provided with a device, with the phone charges paid by program funds. Each month, patients completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and 4 single items assessing fatigue, sleep quality, pain, and global quality of life during the past 7 days rated on a 0 (low) -10 (high) scale. Patients' responses were captured using REDCap, with oncologists receiving monthly feedback. Lay navigators provided assistance to patients with non-medical needs. Results Patients utilizing this voluntary program had an overall mean age of 60.5 (range 26-87), and 85% were non-Hispanic white. iPhones were provided to 42 patients, and navigation services were used by 69 patients. Average adherence with monthly surveys ranged between 75-77%, with breast patients having lower adherence after 5 months. The most commonly reported symptoms across cancer types were moderate levels (scores of 4-7) of fatigue and sleep disturbance. At 6 months, 71-77% of all patients believed the surveys were useful to them and their health care team. Conclusions We established the feasibility of initiating and managing patients in a monthly text-based symptom-monitoring program. The provision of smartphones and patient navigation were unique and vital components of this program.

To understand the health profile of older adults in Brazil is fundamental for planning public policies.MethodsThe estimates were derived from data obtained through the collaboration between the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation of the University of Washington. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics provided the population estimates. Data on causes of death came from the Mortality Information System. To calculate morbidity, population-based studies on the prevalence of diseases in Brazil were comprehensively searched, in addition to information obtained from national databases such as the Hospital Information System, the Outpatient Information System, and the Injury Information System. We presented the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates among Brazilian older adults (60+ years old) for life expectancy at birth (LE), healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), from 2000 to 2017.ResultsLE at birth significantly increased from 71.3years (95% UI to 70.9-71.8) to 75.2years (95% UI 74.7-75.7). There was a trend of increasing HALE, from 62.2years (95% UI 59.54-64.5) to 65.5years (95% UI 62.6-68.0). The proportion of DALYs among older adults increased from 7.3 to 10.3%. Chronic noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of death among middle aged and older adults, while Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause only among older adults. Mood disorders, musculoskeletal pain, and hearing or vision losses are among the leading causes of disability.ConclusionsThe increase in LE and the decrease of the DALYs rates are probably results of the improvement of social conditions and health policies. However, the smaller increase of HALE than LE means that despite living more, people spend a substantial time of their old age with disability and illness. Preventable or potentially controllable diseases are responsible for most of the burden of disease among Brazilian older adults. Health investments are necessary to obtain longevity with quality of life in Brazil.

Analysis of medical expenses of inpatients with diabetes: China's Eastern, Central, and Western regions (2013-2015)	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Diabetes; Medical expense; Out-of-pocket expense; China; Health care	BURDEN	Objective: With the continuing rise in the global incidence of diabetes, the prevention of diabetes and control of associated medical expenses has become a public health issue worldwide. This study aims to identify the medical expenses of patients with diabetes in different regions of China and examine the differences in inpatient medical expenses and the impacts of them on these patients. Study design: This study is a longitudinal analysis of medical expenses for inpatients with diabetes for different years; horizontal analysis of medical expenses among different regions; and literature review. Methods: Data were derived from China's Medical Insurance Department database. We selected inpatients with diabetes in the eastern, central, and western regions of China for the period 2013-2015 and randomly selected data through systematic sampling. Results: Among the 4150 patients with diabetes considered in this study, the patients' medical expenses were found to differ significantly across regions, years, ages, medical insurance types, medical institution levels, total medical expenses, medical insurance fund payments, and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses. In addition, there were significant differences in total medical expenses for male and female patients. Furthermore, medical insurance type, patients' age, medical institution level, and year significantly influenced total medical expenses. Conclusions: Inpatients with diabetes in different regions exhibited significant differences in total medical expenses, medical insurance fund payments, and OOP expenses. China should invest more in chronic disease treatment in its central and western regions, narrow the regional differences in medical expenses, and endeavor to ensure equity in the availability and cost of medical services. Moreover, patients with diabetes must be encouraged to access primary care to reduce their medical expenses. (C) 2020 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Results from the evaluation in Zhejiang province, east China	HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS			English	Article						Evaluation; Vaccination coverage; Missed opportunities; Methodology	ROUTINE VACCINATION; IMPACT; CONTRAINDICATIONS	Background: To evaluate the missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) in Zhejiang province by using the global methodology from World Health Organization (WHO). Methods: Based on the WHO Planning Guide to Reduce Missed Opportunities for Vaccination (MOV) and Methodology for the Assessment of MOV, 33 health facilities from 11 cities in Zhejiang province were selected. For each health facility, exit investigations for 20 caregivers of children aged 0-23 months and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys for 10 health workers was implemented. A MOV was determined based on the child's age on the date of investigation, eligibility for various vaccines. The prevalence of MOV was calculated and the risk factors of MOV were explored. Results: There were 660 completed exit investigations of caregivers of children aged 0-23 months and 330 health worker KAP investigations. Of the 658 children with documented vaccination records, 12.6% were still under-vaccinated. Among these under-vaccinated children, 54.2% still had a MOV. Children's age and their previous vaccination behavior, as well as caregivers' relationship to children and education level had a significant impact on the incidence of MOV. Conclusion: The high proportions of visits with MOV in Zhejiang province suggested that interventions to reduce MOV in health service settings may be a potential quick win for improving coverage and equity. National immunization programs should explore the tailored efforts to improve health worker practices by making better use of existing health service contacts.

Policies to address the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are vital, especially in lower middle and middle-income countries (LMICs). Hence, the aim of this study was to compare the national infertility policies in the selected countries (LMICs comparing with high-income) to determine gaps or to confirm desirable policies in the given health systems. Methods This study has executed a comparative policy analysis of infertility services using the universal health coverage framework (financial protection, population coverage, and service features) in three scopes (prevention, treatment, and supportive care). Seven countries that had infertility programs in their health sectors were selected. Results The results showed that financial protection was good in high and middle-income countries, but in a lower middle income, and in one high-income country was poor. The findings also showed that health systems in the same countries had no infertility services for men. Preventive and supportive care services were neglected in LMICs by governments. Conclusion The findings indicate that income is not the only factor that fulfills universal health coverage for infertility care services. Perhaps to achieve equity in infertility care services, it should be seen as a universal human right to accomplish the right to have a child and to have a life with physical and mental health for all men and women.

However, little is known whether and how such an effort could address disparities in tobacco risk perceptions among population subgroups. In this study, using data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey of Ethiopia, we examined if tobacco risk perceptions varied across socioeconomic and urban vs. rural population subgroups, and whether and how exposure to anti-smoking message was associated with disparities in risk perceptions across socioeconomic and urban-rural subgroups. The results indicated that health risk perceptions of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure were significantly lower among rural, less educated and less affluent population subgroups. Controlling for age, gender, education, wealth, place of residence, and pro-smoking message exposure, anti-smoking message exposure was associated with greater risk perceptions of smoking. Moreover, anti-smoking message exposure moderated the associations of place of residence and education with risk perceptions of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, respectively. The probability of risk perception of smoking associated with anti-smoking message exposure was higher among the rural populace compared to urbanites. Similarly, the probability of risk perception of secondhand smoke exposure associated with anti-smoking message exposure was the highest among individuals without formal education compared to those with primary, secondary, and college-level education. The findings suggest that efforts should be made to make sure adequate anti-smoking message exposure among less educated and rural audiences so as to reduce disparities in tobacco risk perceptions.

Simultaneously, the competitiveness of countries is a key economic indicator, and this interconnection requires special attention, especially in the decision-making process of public policies. The main objective of the presented study was to evaluate the effects of selected health indicators on the competitiveness of developed countries. The following health variables were collected for the analysed period from 2010 to 2018: four variables of Life Expectancy (LE) and three variables of Perceived Health Status (PHS). Each variable was observed from the perspective of gender differentiation and gender inequalities. The Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) was also used in the analyses as an economic variable. The research sample included all countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The analytical data processing consisted of descriptive analysis, difference analysis (Wilcoxon Test), regression analysis (Panel regression model) and correlation analysis (Spearman's.). Regarding the results, all health variables showed differences between men and women. The results of the regression analysis revealed a very strong and significant effect of LE and PHS on the competitiveness of individual economies. The correlation analysis confirmed all relations. Improving the health of men and women is likely to increase the competitiveness of developed countries. As a result, it provides space for further research and policy-making in each country.

For instance, many measures taken in a lockdown aimed at protecting human life may compromise the immune system, and purpose in life, especially of vulnerable groups. This leads to the paradoxical situation of compromising the immune system and physical and mental health of many people, including the ones we aim to protect. Also, it is expected that hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger and postponed medical treatments. Other side effects include financial insecurity of billions of people, physical and mental health problems, and increased inequalities. The economic and health repercussions of the crisis will be falling disproportionately on young workers, low-income families and women, and thus exacerbate existing inequalities. As the virus outbreak and media coverage spread fear and anxiety, superstition, cognitive dissonance reduction and conspiracy theories are ways to find meaning and reduce anxiety. These behavioral aspects may play a role in the continuance of lockdown decisions. Based on theories regarding agnotology (i.e., the ways ignorance or doubt about certain topics is created by means of withholding or presenting information in a certain way), social influence, superstition and stress and coping, I seek to explain the social and behavioral aspects of human behavior in times of crises. Both the Covid-19 crisis itself as well as the resulting economic and (mental) health crisis are global problems that may require global solutions. I present a model of drivers and outcomes of lockdown behaviors and offer suggestions and a tool to counteract the negative psychological effects by means of online life crafting therapeutic writing interventions.

It has long been recognized that accreditation systems will need to shift their focus from processes to outcomes, particularly those related to the end goals of medical education: the creation of broadly competent, confident professionals and the improvement of health for individuals and populations. An international group of experts in accreditation convened in 2013 to discuss this shift.Main textParticipants unequivocally supported the inclusion of more outcomes-based criteria in medical education accreditation, specifically those related to the societal accountability of the institutions in which the education occurs. Meaningful and feasible outcome metrics, however, are hard to identify. They are regionally variable, often temporally remote from the educational program, difficult to measure, and susceptible to confounding factors. The group identified the importance of health outcomes of the clinical milieu in which education takes place in influencing outcomes of its graduates. The ability to link clinical data with individual practice over time is becoming feasible with large repositories of assessment data linked to patient outcomes. This was seen as a key opportunity to provide more continuous oversight and monitoring of program impact. The discussants identified several risks that might arise should outcomes measures completely replace process issues. Some outcomes can be measured only by proxy process elements, and some learner experience issues may best be measured by such process elements: in brief, the "how" still matters.ConclusionsAccrediting bodies are beginning to view the use of practice outcome measures as an important step toward better continuous educational quality improvement. The use of outcomes will present challenges in data collection, aggregation, and interpretation. Large datasets that capture clinical outcomes, experience of care, and health system performance may enable the assessment of multiple dimensions of program quality, assure the public that the social contract is being upheld, and allow identification of exemplary programs such that all may improve. There remains a need to retain some focus on process, particularly those related to the learner experience.

J	Philibert, I; Blouin, D				Philibert, Ingrid; Blouin, Danielle			Responsiveness to societal needs in postgraduate medical education: the role of accreditation	BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Review						Accreditation; Diversity; Equity; Postgraduate medical education; Societal accountability	SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY; HEALTH; CARE; DETERMINANTS; SHORTAGE; IMPACT	BackgroundSocial accountability in medical education has been defined as an obligation to direct education, research, and service activities toward the most important health concerns of communities, regions, and nations. Drawing from the results of a summit of international experts on postgraduate medical education and accreditation, we highlight the importance of local contexts in meeting societal aims and present different approaches to ensuring societal input into medical education systems around the globe.Main textWe describe four priorities for social responsiveness that postgraduate medical education needs to address in local and regional contexts: (1) optimizing the size, specialty mix, and geographic distribution of the physician workforce; (2) ensuring graduates' competence in meeting societal goals for health care, population health, and sustainability; (3) promoting a diverse physician workforce and equitable access to graduate medical education; and (4) ensuring a safe and supportive learning environment that promotes the professional development of physicians along with safe and effective patient care in settings where trainees participate in care. We relate these priorities to the values proposed by the World Health Organization for social accountability: relevance, quality, cost-effectiveness, and equity; discuss accreditation as a lever for change; and describe existing and evolving efforts to make postgraduate medical education socially responsive.ConclusionAchieving social responsiveness in a competency-based postgraduate medical education system requires accrediting organizations to ensure that learning emphasizes relevant competencies in postgraduate curricula and educational experiences, and that graduates possess desired attributes. At the same time, institutions sponsoring graduate medical education need to provide safe and effective patient care, along with a supportive learning and working environment.

The improper or non-use of child restraints can result in children sustaining significant injuries in the event of a collision. Systematic reviews on the effectiveness of various interventions to increase the use of child restraints already exist but to the best of our knowledge, there has been no qualitative evidence syntheses on the facilitators and barriers to child restraint usage. This review aims to fill that gap. Methods We searched for qualitative studies, which focused on perceptions, values and experiences of children, parents/caregivers or any other relevant stakeholders on the use of restraints for children travelling in motor vehicles in PubMed, EMBASE and Global Health and screened reference lists of all included studies. We assessed the quality of included studies with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and used the PROGRESS Plus lens for an equity focused analysis. Results We identified a total of 335 records from searching the databases and five records from other sources. After screening, we identified 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. All but one study (which had children as participants) focused on the perceptions, attitudes and barriers of parents or caregivers. The included studies were from three high-income (n=14) and one upper-middle income (n=3) country. In addition, although many focused exclusively on participants from culturally and linguistically diverse minorities, the issue of equity was not well addressed. Five major themes emerged from the analysis. (1) perceived risk for injuries and perceived safety benefits of child restraint usage varies in different settings and between different types of caregivers; (2) practical issues around the use of child restraints is a major barrier to its uptake as a child safety measure; (3) restraint use is considered as a mechanism to discipline children rather than as a safety device by parents and as children became older they actively seek opportunities to negotiate the non-usage of restraints; (4) adoption and enforcement of laws shape perceptions and usage in all settings and (5) perceptions and norms of child safety differ among culturally and linguistically diverse groups. Conclusion The results of this systematic review should be considered when designing interventions to promote the uptake of child restraints. However, there is a need to conduct qualitative research around the facilitators and barriers to child restraint usage in low-income and middle-income countries. Furthermore, there is a need for more evidence conducted in semiurban and rural areas and to involve fathers, policy-makers, implementers and enforcement agencies in such studies.

Contemporary Incidence and Prevalence of Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease in Australia Using Linked Data: The Case for Policy Change	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Australia; epidemiology; ethnic; inequalities; linked data; rheumatic heart disease	ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; ADMINISTRATIVE DATA; NORTHERN-TERRITORY; HEALTH; ALGORITHM; SURVIVAL; LINKAGE; RECORDS; BURDEN; END	Background In 2018, the World Health Organization prioritized control of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), including disease surveillance. We developed strategies for estimating contemporary ARF/RHD incidence and prevalence in Australia (2015-2017) by age group, sex, and region for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians based on innovative, direct methods. Methods and Results This population-based study used linked administrative data from 5 Australian jurisdictions. A cohort of ARF (age <45 years) and RHD cases (<55 years) were sourced from jurisdictional ARF/RHD registers, surgical registries, and inpatient data. We developed robust methods for epidemiologic case ascertainment for ARF/RHD. We calculated age-specific and age-standardized incidence and prevalence. Age-standardized rate and prevalence ratios compared disease burden between demographic subgroups. Of 1425 ARF episodes, 72.1% were first-ever, 88.8% in Indigenous people and 78.6% were aged <25 years. The age-standardized ARF first-ever rates were 71.9 and 0.60/100 000 for Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations, respectively (age-standardized rate ratio=124.1; 95% CI, 105.2-146.3). The 2017 Global Burden of Disease RHD prevalent counts for Australia (<55 years) underestimate the burden (1518 versus 6156 Australia-wide extrapolated from our study). The Indigenous age-standardized RHD prevalence (666.3/100 000) was 61.4 times higher (95% CI, 59.3-63.5) than non-Indigenous (10.9/100 000). Female RHD prevalence was double that in males. Regions in northern Australia had the highest rates. Conclusions This study provides the most accurate estimates to date of Australian ARF and RHD rates. The high Indigenous burden necessitates urgent government action. Findings suggest RHD may be underestimated in many high-resource settings. The linked data methods outlined here have potential for global applicability.

J	Chambers, J				Chambers, Jonathan			Global and cross-country analysis of exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves from 1980 to 2018	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Global warming; Health; Heatwaves; Indicators	HEAT WAVES; MORTALITY; HEALTH; TEMPERATURE; IMPACT; MORBIDITY; CLIMATE	Heatwaves have become more frequent and intense due to anthropogenic global warming and have serious and potentially life-threatening impacts on human health, particularly for people over 65 years old. While a range of studies examine heatwave exposures, few cover the whole globe and very few cover key areas in Africa, South America, and East Asia. By using global gridded climate reanalysis, population, and demographic data, this work analyses trends in change in exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves, providing global and per-country aggregate statistics. The difference between the global mean of heatwave indexes and the mean weighted by vulnerable population found that these populations are experiencing up to five times the number of heatwave days relative to the global average. The total exposures, measured in person-days of heatwave, highlight the combined effect of increased heatwaves and aging populations. In China and India, heatwave exposure increased by an average of 508 million person-days per year in the last decade. Mapping of changes per country highlighted significant exposure increases, particularly in the Middle East and in South East Asia. Major disparities were found between the heatwave exposures, country income group, and country health system capacity, thus highlighting the significant inequalities in global warming impacts and response capacities with respect to health across countries. It is therefore of prime importance that health development and response are coordinated with climate change mitigation and adaptation work.

Translating evidence-based treatment for digital health delivery: a protocol for family-based treatment for anorexia nervosa using telemedicine	JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS			English	Article						Anorexia nervosa; Cost-consequence analysis; Inequalities; Eating disorder; Covid-19; Young people; Telemedicine; Telemedicine; Family-based treatment; Rural health	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; EATING-DISORDER EXAMINATION; RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; BULIMIA-NERVOSA; ADOLESCENTS; TELEHEALTH; RECOVERY; EFFICACY; REMISSION; INTERVIEW	Background Family-based treatment (FBT) is an efficacious outpatient intervention for young people diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). To date, treatment to protocol has relied on standard face-to-face delivery. Face-to-face therapy is subject to geographic, temporal and human factors, rendering it particularly susceptible to inequities and disruption. This has resulted in poorer service provision for rural and regional families, and recently a significant challenge to providing face-to-face services during the COVID-19 global pandemic. The present study examines whether FBT for AN can be successfully translated to a digital delivery platform to address these access issues. Method Forty young people aged 12 to 18 years who meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for AN, and live in a rural or regional setting, will along with their family be recruited to the study. Trained therapists will provide 18 sessions of FBT over 9 months via telemedicine to the home of the young person and their family. The analysis will examine treatment effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness. Discussion The study addresses the treatment needs of families not able to attend face-to-face clinical services for evidence-based treatment for eating disorders. This might be due to several barriers, including a lack of local services or long travel distances to services. There has been a recent and unprecedented demand for telemedicine to facilitate the continuity of care during COVID-19 despite geographical circumstances. If delivering treatment in this modality is clinically and economically effective and feasible, it will facilitate access to potentially lifesaving, evidence-based treatments for families formerly unable to access such care and provide evidence for the continuity of services when and where face-to-face treatment is not feasible.

Since 2008, Sapienza University of Rome has offered activities to medical and other health profession students related to global health (GH), which is grounded in the theory of social determinants of health and inspired by social justice. The educational activities included elective courses as well as community and service-learning experiences, referred to as GH gyms. This study attempts to measure the long-term impact of these educational experiences, especially to demonstrate their influence on the perceived social responsibility of future health professionals. Methods A questionnaire was elaborated and tested on a small sample of participants. It was sent to participants by e-mail. Quantitative results were analysed through descriptive statistics and qualitative answers were carefully read and classified. Results A total of 758 students from different faculties took part to the educational experiences. Only 488 e-mail addresses were available. One hundred and five (21.5%) questionnaires were returned. Participation in GH gyms was perceived to have had a higher influence on future professional and personal choices, when compared to participation in elective GH courses. Conclusions The study shows that consideration of health and social issues related with inequities in health and the use of interactive teaching methodologies had important effects on social responsibility of a large number of students. As there could be a selection bias among respondents, more research is needed to understand the impact of GH educational experiences. The inclusion of global health education in health and social curricula and the use of interactive methodologies with a correct evaluation of results are the indications that emerge from this research, together with the necessity of a strong involvement of students, professors and the whole academic reality.

A comprehensive body of strong research from international authors has reported negative associations between racism and health outcomes. In Australia, although the literature is more limited, available findings follow global trends. Australia has an identified health gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-indigenous Australians, and despite efforts to bridge this gap, health inequities continue to exist. This scoping review aims to assess, analyse and synthesise the relationship between racism and discrimination on the physical and mental health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples living in Australia. Method This is the study protocol for a scoping review. A systematic search will be conducted using five electronic databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science and the Australia's National Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research. The database search will include studies published between 2000 and 2020. Reference lists of the included articles will be searched. Outcome measures will include physical and mental health components including chronic conditions, depression and anxiety, psychological distress, social and emotional difficulties, suicide and health-related outcomes such as wellbeing and life satisfaction. Duplications will be removed, and titles and abstracts will be reviewed to select studies. Full-text screening of preselected studies will be performed by four reviewers independently, to select studies according to inclusion criteria. Included studies will be appraised for quality using appropriate tools tailored for each study design. Data will be extracted, and study findings and characteristics synthesised in a narrative summary. Discussion Our scoping review will synthesise the evidence on the impacts of racism and discrimination in relation to the physical and mental health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples living in Australia. These findings could guide future health interventions by addressing the exposure of racism and racial discrimination in order to reduce health disparity. It is anticipated the findings to be of interest to policymakers, researchers, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and community health organisations and other stakeholders interested in optimising public health interventions for and in partnership with Aboriginal and Strait Torres Islander communities of Australia. Scoping review registration: The protocol for this review has been registered on the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). The registration ID is CRD42020186193.

J	Almeida, T; Balaam, M; Comber, R				Almeida, Teresa; Balaam, Madeline; Comber, Rob			Woman-Centered Design through Humanity, Activism, and Inclusion	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION			English	Article						Body; women's health; health care; intimate care; feminist HCI; feminisms; genders; embodiment; technology	VAGINAL MICROBIOME; FEMINIST; GENDER; HEALTH	Women account for over half of the global population, however, continue to be subject to systematic and systemic disadvantage, particularly in terms of access to health and education. At every intersection, where systemic inequality accounts for greater loss of life or limitations on full and healthy living, women are more greatly impacted by those inequalities. The design of technologies is no different, the very definition of technology is historically cast in terms of male activities, and advancements in the field are critical to improve women's quality of life. This article views HCI, a relatively new field, as well positioned to act critically in the ways that technology serve, refigure, and redefine women's bodies. Indeed, the female body remains a contested topic, a restriction to the development of women's health. On one hand, the field of women's health has attended to the medicalization of the body and therefore is to be understood through medical language and knowledge. On the other hand, the framing of issues associated with women's health and people's experiences of and within such system(s) remain problematic for many. This is visible today in, e.g., socio-cultural practices in disparate geographies or medical devices within a clinic or the home. Moreover, the biological body is part of a great unmentionable, i.e., the perils of essentialism. We contend that it is necessary, pragmatically and ethically, for HCI to turn its attention toward a woman-centered design approach. While previous research has argued for the dangers of gender-demarcated design work, we advance that designing for and with women should not be regarded as ghettoizing, but instead as critical to improving women's experiences in bodily transactions, choices, rights, and access to and in health and care. In this article, we consider how and why designing with and for woman matters. We use our design-led research as a way to speak to and illustrate alternatives to designing for and with women within HCI.

J	Lee, ADJ; Cullerton, K; Herron, LM				Lee, Amanda J.; Cullerton, Katherine; Herron, Lisa-Maree			Achieving Food System Transformation: Insights From A Retrospective Review of Nutrition Policy (In)Action in High-Income Countries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Nutrition Policy; Food Systems; Sustainability; Equity; NOURISHING Framework; OECD countries	OBESITY PREVENTION; DISEASES; SUPPORT	Background: Comprehensive nutrition policies are required urgently to help transform food systems to more equitably deliver healthy, sustainable diets. Methods: Literature was searched systematically for nutrition policies of the then 34 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members as part of a scoping study. Recently, results were re-analysed, against the NOURISHING framework. Results: Twenty-three nutrition policy documents were identified for 19 jurisdictions. Most policy actions focused on the behaviour change communication domain: all (100%) promoted consumption of 'healthy' choices. In the food environment domain, most policies included food labelling (84%), product reformulation (68%), providing healthy foods in public institutions (89%, mainly schools), and restricting food advertising (53%), largely through voluntary codes. Relatively few economic tools were being applied. There was very little focus on reducing consumption of 'unhealthy' food or drinks. Not all nutrition policy actions identified were covered by the NOURISHING framework. Conclusion: The NOURISHING framework could be expanded to more comprehensively encompass the health and sustainability dimensions of food systems, eg, by detailing optimum governance arrangements. As recently as seven years ago, half of the most developed economies globally did not have a publicly available nutrition policy. Existing policies were dominated by conventional nutrition education approaches, while policy actions targeting food environments, and regulatory and legislative reforms, were rare. This is consistent with a neo-liberal approach centring individual responsibility. No examples of the multi-strategy, inter-sectoral, coordinated, evidence-based policies required to drive systemic transformation were identified. Therefore, it is not surprising that rates of obesity and diet-related conditions have continued to rise in these jurisdictions, nor that governments are currently off-track to deliver the systemic transformation required to meet relevant global health and sustainable development goals.

Sex Representation in Clinical Trials Associated withFDACancer Drug Approvals Differs Between Solid and Hematologic Malignancies	ONCOLOGIST			English	Article						Clinical trial; Neoplasms; Sex; Healthcare disparities	CANCER; DISPARITIES; PARTICIPATION; MORTALITY; SURVIVAL; EPIDEMIC; IMPACT; WOMEN	Background Proportionate female representation in health research is necessary for scientific rigor and health equity. We aimed to assess the representation of women in clinical trials leading to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cancer drug approvals. Materials and Methods Trials supporting FDA cancer drug approvals between July 2008 and June 2018 were sourced from PubMed and . The ratio of female to male trial enrollment was compared with cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S. using International Agency for Research on Cancer data. Reproductive tract and breast cancers were excluded. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing trial enrollment with population incidence and mortality were calculated. Results A total of 186 trials leading to 170 FDA cancer drug approvals showed slight female underrepresentation compared with overall cancer incidence in the U.S. (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98,p< .0001). Female enrollment for drugs approved between 2008-2013 and 2014-2018 was unchanged (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.05,p= .25). There was slight female underrepresentation in hematological trials (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.998;p= .040 for leukemia; OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-0.997;p= .040 for lymphoma) and significant female underrepresentation in colorectal (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.69-0.76;p< .0001), pancreas (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93;p= .0004), lung (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.75-0.80;p< .0001), kidney (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.60-0.67;p< .0001), and thyroid cancer trials (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.23-0.28;p< .0001) compared with U.S. incidence. Conclusions Female underrepresentation has persisted within solid organ tumor trials but is less notable in hematologic trials. Additional work is required to identify drivers of such disparity. Implications for Practice Adequate gender representation in clinical trials is a matter of health equity. This study demonstrates that women remain underrepresented in trials across hematological and solid organ trials compared with cancer incidence and mortality in women, with the disparity worse in a number of solid organ tumor types. There are thus still significant improvements to be made regarding adequate representation of women in trials. Studies exploring the reasons for ongoing disparity in gender representation are warranted to help clinicians to rectify this.

Our collaboration in Rwanda to build prehospital trauma care led us to create a research mentorship program to enhance the ability of the local team to evaluate their system. METHODS: NIH grant funding had been previously obtained to establish standards for prehospital trauma care in Rwanda and build local research capacity. We created a research mentorship program that involved a surgical resident embedded locally tasked with 1) giving lectures on research, study design, interpretation, and writing, 2) providing mentorship for data interpretation and 3) supporting the development of abstracts, presentations, and publications. RESULTS: Four research teams identified high priority areas for quality improvement research. Research group meetings were held and involved mentored literature searches, critical review of published works, basics of study design, abstract writing and manuscript development. Abstracts were submitted and accepted to three international conferences. At this time 3 manuscripts have been accepted and are in production, 2 abstracts and 1 manuscript has been published. Eleven staff enrolled in master's degree programs in critical and nursing, epidemiology, public health and global health equity across three institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Responsive health care systems need capacity for ongoing quality improvement and research. This is especially true to address the massive global burden of disease of trauma and emergency conditions. US academic surgical collaborations have tremendous research expertise that can contribute to improving health system capacity globally. Such collaborations offer the opportunity to set up the foundations of future academic productivity. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Currently, fundamental tenets of global surgical inequity are only available to students on an elective basis or in special interest groups. Therefore, an hour-long course with emphasis on global surgery was developed for third-year medical students. The aim of this study was to examine student response to this pilot course and to establish whether course content was applicable to clinical rotations. DESIGN: A 1-hour structured curriculum was delivered to third-year medical students (MS3s) during the 2-day orientation phase of each rotation of an 8-week surgery clerkship from August 2018 to May 2019. The course targeted approximately 30 students per session in the pre-clinical orientation at Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School. Upon completion of the 8-week clerkship rotation, a paper survey was administered to evaluate student's exposure to previous content, attitudes toward global health, interest and engagement in course materials, and applicability of learned course content to local environments. SETTING: Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School, an urban medical school located in Newark, New Jersey. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 191 students attended the global surgery and health equity course; 146 participants participated in the postcourse survey. RESULTS: When asked about baseline interest in global or public health, the majority (51%) were extremely interested or very interested. Nearly all participants found the course to be valuable (94%). When asked which educational modality was preferred, 23% of participants favored the traditional lecture component and 29% favored case-based discussions. Nearly half (48%) the respondents found both modalities to be valuable. Fifty students (34% of respondents) reported encounters with patients affected by barriers in access to surgical care during their clerkships. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students responded favorably to this health inequity and global surgery pilot course and requested supplemental lectures. Additionally, course content was applicable to local clinical experiences. Therefore, 1 modality of integrating global surgery to the established curriculum is under the framework of health inequity and social determinants of health during surgical clerkships. This study demonstrates that meaningful inclusion of global surgery and health inequity can be implemented within the existing curricular structure.

J	Friedler, A				Friedler, Anna			Sociocultural, behavioural and political factors shaping the COVID-19 pandemic: the need for a biocultural approach to understanding pandemics and (re)emerging pathogens	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Biocultural; cultural epidemiology; infectious disease; COVID-19; biopolitics	ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME; ONE HEALTH APPROACH; TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE; AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN; WET-MARKETS; DISEASE TRANSMISSION; SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS; SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY; HUMAN-RIGHTS; ZIKA VIRUS	Although there has been increasing focus in recent years on interdisciplinary approaches to health and disease, and in particular the dimension of social inequalities in epidemics, infectious diseases have been much less focused on. This is especially true in the area of cultural dynamics and their effects on pathogen behaviours, although there is evidence to suggest that this relationship is central to shaping our interactions with infectious disease agents on a variety of levels. This paper makes a case for a biocultural approach to pandemics such as COVID-19. It then uses this biocultural framework to examine the anthropogenic dynamics that influenced and continue to shape the COVID-19 pandemic, both during its initial phase and during critical intersections of the pandemic. Through this understanding of biocultural interactions between people, animals and pathogens, a broader societal and political dimension is drawn as a function of population level and international cultures, to reflect on the culturally mediated differential burden of the pandemic. Ultimately, it is argued that a biocultural perspective on infectious disease pandemics will allow for critical reflection on how culture shapes our behaviours at all levels, and how the effects of these behaviours are ultimately foundational to pathogen ecology and evolution.

A significant factor in the workplace that is thought to influence employees' mental health is leadership behavior. Hence, effective leadership interventions to foster employees' (leaders' and staff members') mental health might be an important measure to address this pressing issue. Methods We conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA statement (Liberati et al. 2009) and systematically searched the following databases: PubMed (PMC), Web of Science, PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), EconLit (EBSCOhost), and Business Source Premier (EBSCOhost). In addition, we performed a hand search of the reference lists of relevant articles. We included studies investigating leadership interventions in the health care sector that aimed to maintain/foster employees' mental health. Results The systematic search produced 11,221 initial search hits in relevant databases. After the screening process and additional literature search, seven studies were deemed eligible according to the inclusion criteria. All studies showed at least a moderate global validity and four of the included studies showed statistically significant improvements of mental health as a result of the leadership interventions. Conclusions Based on the findings, leadership interventions with reflective and interactive parts in group settings at several seminar days seem to be the most promising strategy to address mental health in health care employees. As the available evidence is limited, efforts to design and scientifically evaluate such interventions should be extended.

This study explores the views of final-year students regarding the influence of the JCU medical curriculum on their self-reported commitment to socially-accountable practice, intentions for rural practice, and desired postgraduate training pathway. Methods Cross-sectional survey of final year JCU medical students (n = 113; response rate = 65%) to determine whether their future career directions (intentions for future practice rurality and postgraduate specialty training pathway) are driven more by altruism (commitment to socially accountable practice/community service) or by financial reward and/or prestige. Results Overall, 96% of responding students reported their JCU medical course experiences had cultivated a greater commitment towards 'socially-accountable' practice. A commitment to socially-accountable practice over financial reward and/or prestige was also significantly associated with preferring to practise Medicine in non-metropolitan areas (p = 0.036) and intending to choose a 'generalist' medical discipline (p = 0.003). Conclusions The findings suggest the JCU medical curriculum has positively influenced the commitment of its graduating students towards more socially accountable practice. This influence is a likely result of pre-clinical teachings around health inequalities and socially-accountable medical practice in combination with real-world, immersive experiences on rural and international placements.

J	Sayeed, S; Taylor, L				Sayeed, Sadath; Taylor, Lauren			Institutionalising global health: a call for ethical reflection	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH			English	Article						health education and promotion; health policy	EDUCATION	We describe a global health course and pedagogy that highlights the moral ambiguity and many ethical compromises that have emerged as the discipline has increasingly become institutionalised. We encourage students to reflect on how the oft-declared aspiration for global health equity still remains seriously contested as a normative and political matter, especially in settings like the USA. We further encourage students to reflect on how authentic concern for social justice, health equity and human rights are consistently undermined by unconscious and/or intentional fealty to standard operating procedures within hierarchical structures and systems. Lastly, we encourage students to openly question and critique the dominant socioeconomic and institutional paradigms that influence practitioner ways of thinking about global health. Our aim is to provide a learning space for students to at least imagine, if not demand, more daring modes of engagement. We also encourage our colleagues in the global health education community to be forthright that the process of institutionalising global health reliably favours our own interests more than those we claim to be most concerned about. If the ideal of global health is to build a bridge to human solidarity, we see substantial risk that current popularised approaches might never yield a structural tipping point.

J	Hosseinzadegan, F; Jasemi, M; Habibzadeh, H				Hosseinzadegan, Fariba; Jasemi, Madineh; Habibzadeh, Hosein			Factors Affecting Nurses' Impact on Social Justice in the Health System	NURSING ETHICS			English	Article						Health equity; nursing; qualitative research; social justice	CARE	Background: Social inequities in health systems are threats to global health. Considering the important role of nurses in establishing social justice, identification of factors affecting nurses' participation in this area can contribute to the development of social justice. Objective: This study aimed to identify factors affecting nurses' participation in establishing social justice in the health system. Research design and methods: The study was conducted using conventional qualitative content analysis approach. Purposive sampling was used to select 14 participants in 2019. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed concurrently with data gathering. Participants and research context: In total, six faculty members, five nursing managers, and three clinical nurses from three different universities were interviewed. Ethical considerations: The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of Urmia University of Medical Sciences in Iran. Findings: Four main themes were found, including inadequate professional authority, insufficient attention to social justice in the area of education, clinical concerns as barriers to professional presence in society, and reflection of personality traits in the profession. These are the main factors affecting nurses' participation in establishing social justice in the health system. Discussion: Authorities need to take effective steps to establish social justice through reforming the health system's policy-making and power-acquisition domains, promoting nurses' involvement in social factors in health issues, and adding professional values as a part of nursing curriculum. The clinical practice environment can also be helpful through providing quality, safe, and cost-effective services. In addition, fair and efficient recruitment process for new nurses can contribute to the establishment of social justice in the health system. Conclusion: Macro-level managerial factors such as policy, education, and clinical environment, along with personal factors, play a significant role in the participation of nursing profession in establishing social justice.

J	Kim, B; Son, KB				Kim, Bookyoung; Son, Kyung-Bok			Factors affecting the self-rated health of immigrant women married to native men and raising children in South Korea: a cross-sectional study	BMC WOMENS HEALTH			English	Article						Immigrant woman; Foreign wife; Self-rated health; South Korea	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; SOCIAL SUPPORT; CARE SERVICES; ACCULTURATION; DEPRESSION; MORTALITY; MIGRANTS; STRESS; INEQUALITIES	Background Since the influx of international immigrants to South Korea (Korea) in the 1980s, the number of immigrants married to native Koreans has increased substantially over the last 30 years. This study aims to provide recent evidence on the self-rated health of immigrant women married to native men and raising children. We evaluated the self-rated health of immigrant women sorted by their country of origin and elucidated factors that affect their self-rated health. Methods Data were obtained from the 2015 Korean National Multi-Cultural Family Survey. From the survey, a total of 6960 Korean-Chinese, Han-Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Filipino women were identified and a series of logistic regressions was conducted to elucidate factors that affected the self-rated health of immigrant women. Results The majority of immigrant women in Korea perceived that they are healthy. However, the self-rated health of immigrant women varied by country of origin. Korean-Chinese and Japanese immigrants are less likely to perceive that they are healthy compared with Filipino and Vietnamese immigrants. We identified several factors at the individual, household, and community levels and found that the majority of them are likely to be ethnic dependent. However, satisfaction with husband and experience of unmet medical needs presented consistent results in the five ethnicity groups. Conclusions Programs that strengthen spousal relationships and policies to enhance access to healthcare could be prioritized options to improve the self-rated health of immigrant women in Korea.

Biological factors alone do not explain gender differences in LE, and examining structural differences may help illuminate other explanatory factors. The aim of this research is to analyse the influence of gender inequality on the gender gap in LE globally. We have carried out a regression analysis between the gender gap in relativised LE and the UN Gender Inequality Index (GII), with a sensitivity analysis conducted for its three dimensions, stratified by the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. We adjusted the model by taking into consideration gross national income (GNI), democratic status and rural population. The results indicated a positive association for the European region (ss=0.184) and the Americas (ss=0.136) in our adjusted model. Conversely, for the African region, the relations between gender equality and the LE gender gap were found to be negative (ss=-0.125). The findings suggest that in the WHO European region and the Americas, greater gender equality leads to a narrowing of the gender LE gap, while it has a contrary relationship in Africa. We suggest that this could be because only higher scores in the GII between men and women show health benefits. Copyright: (c) 2020 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

This study aims to measure inequality in the distribution of selected indicators of national health accounts across the Iranian provinces. Methods In this study, the data on health financing agents from provincial health accounts from 2008 to 2016 were collected. Gini coefficient (GC) was used to measure inequality. The population and the number of service providers in each province were the bases to measure the GC. The Coefficient of Variation (CV) and the Rate Ratio (RR) were used to determine the dispersion and variation across the provinces. Disparity index was employed to measure the average deviation of the out-of-pocket (OOP) proportion from the desired OOP proportion presented in national development plans (NDPs) of Iran. Results The distribution of resources using both bases were unequal, especially in OOP, with the highest rate over the years studied, ranging from 0.50 to 0.59. The inequality in public resources was lower, with Health Insurance Organization dropping from 0.42 to 0.40 over the years. CV and RR also confirmed the inequality in health resources distribution. In the years 2014 and 2015, the lowest and highest levels were 0.22 and 0.39, respectively. The values of disparity index for OOP had a fluctuating trend ranging from 37.01 to 65.85%. Conclusion Inequality in the distribution of public health expenditures was moderate to high. Moreover, inequality in private health expenditures was higher than public one. Distribution of OOP spent by households at provincial level showed a high inequality. It is suggested that inequality measures to be considered in NDPs to illustrate how resources are distributed at the geographical level. NHA framework can help to provide robust evidence base for policymaking.

This paper seeks to discuss some of the ethical issues arising from community engagement in a low resource setting. Methods A qualitative study design focusing on the engagement activities of three biomedical research projects as ethnographic case studies was used to gain in-depth understanding of community engagement as experienced by multiple stakeholders in Malawi. Data was collected through participant observation, 43 In-depth interviews and 17 focus group discussions with community leaders, research staff, community members and research participants. Thematic analysis was used to analyse and interpret the findings. Results The results showed that structural coercion arose due to an interplay of factors pertaining to social-economic context, study design and power relations among research stakeholders. The involvement of community leaders, government stakeholders, and power inequalities among research stakeholders affected some participants' ability to make autonomous decisions about research participation. These results have been presented under the themes of perception of research as development, research participants' motivation to access individual benefits, the power of vernacular translations to influence research participation, and coercive power of leaders. Conclusion The study identified ethical issues in community engagement practices pertaining to structural coercion. We conclude that community engagement alone did not address underlying structural inequalities to ensure adequate protection of communities. These results raise important questions on how to balance between engaging communities to improve research participation and ensure that informed consent is voluntarily given.

In many areas, COVID-19 has also either exacerbated already existing or created new inequalities in relation to specific parts of the population. Older individuals are one group in society that has been widely impacted, while social isolation/shielding measures have placed them in higher risk of loneliness, isolation, financial deprivation and mental health challenges, to name a few. This commentary reflects on such inequalities across four European nations (the United Kingdom (UK), Republic of Ireland, Finland, Spain) and draws attention to the critical role of Gerontological Social Work (GSW), while emphasizing the ways in which social work can intervene. First, we identify common concerns for the rights of older people that span across all four nations, and second, we identify significant roles for GSW practitioners at the individual, community and policy levels and conclude with a call for GSW in these four nations to be reimagined in a time of global crisis.

Here, we put forward evidence to unpack the relationship between gender and outcomes in health and well-being, and explore how legal determinants interact and intersect with gender norms to amplify or reduce health inequities across populations. The paper explores the similarities between legal and health systems in their response to gender-both systems portray gender neutrality but would be better described as gender-blind. We conclude with a set of recommendations to address both law and gender in implementing the work of the Lancet Commission on the legal determinants of health to improve health outcomes for all, irrespective of gender.

The Lancet Commission sees the role of law as positive, indeed central in providing justice in global contexts, and this contribution explores and unpacks this assertion, drawing on some examples from India and elsewhere. Some feminists have argued that law and justice are incompatible for women, and this is sometimes borne out when we look at legal reforms and interventions in the field of gender-based violence. However, we also explore the ways in which some women have used legal reforms in creative ways to destabilize patriarchal norms, and more broadly, how absence of legal protection can undermine access to rights. We conclude that law can have a symbolic relationship with justice.

J	Da Silva, M				Da Silva, Michael			The Complex Structure of Health Rights	PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS			English	Article								Research on how to understand legally recognized socio-economic rights produced many insights into the nature of rights. Legally recognized rights to health and, by extension, health care could contribute to health justice. Yet a tension remains between widespread international and transnational constitutional recognition of rights to health and health care and compelling normative conditions for rights recognition from both philosophers seeking to identify the scope and structure of the rights and policy scholars seeking to understand how to practically realize such rights (and measure realization of same). This work identifies an overlooked source of these difficulties: the right to health care and other health rights are necessarily 'complex', consisting of multiple related, but irreducible, morally valuable components. 'Complex rights' do not fit the traditional structure of human rights, so legal recognition of same can appear confused from a philosophical perspective, but there is ample reason to admit complex rights into our moral ontology and doing so can help bridge the divide between global health practices and ongoing work in the philosophy of rights and public policy. Recognition of complex rights admittedly shifts the burden for justifying health rights, but it does so in a way that is instructive for general philosophical analysis of socio-economic rights.yy	[Da Silva, Michael] McGill Univ, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, 1130 Pine Ave W, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada	McGill University	Da Silva, M (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, 1130 Pine Ave W, Montreal, PQ H3A 1A3, Canada.	michael.dasilva@mcgill.ca		Da Silva, Michael/0000-0002-7021-9847					38	3	3	1	8	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	1754-9973	1754-9981		PUBLIC HEALTH ETH-UK	Public Health Ethics	APR	2020	13	1					99	110		10.1093/phe/phaa001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/phe/phaa001			12	Ethics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)	Social Sciences - Other Topics; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Medical Ethics	NV4KY					2025-01-01	WOS:000574293900014

We examine these difficulties in a study of disparate levels of exposure to pollution from coal-fired power generation in India, a country with high levels of air pollution and large, marginalized populations. With data on coal plant locations, atmospheric conditions, and census demographics, we estimate exposure to coal plant emissions using models that predict emission transportation. We find that ethnic and poor populations are more likely to be exposed to coal pollution. However, this relationship is sometimes non-linear and follows an inverted u-shape similar to that of an Environmental Kuznets Curve. We theorize that this non-linear relationship is due to the exclusion of marginalized communities from both the negative and positive externalities of industrial development.

Achieving Health Equity Through Eradicating Structural Racism in the United States: A Call to Action for Nursing Leadership	JOURNAL OF NURSING SCHOLARSHIP			English	Article						Health disparities; health inequities; racism in nursing; social determinants of health; structural racism	RACE; DIVERSITY	Purpose To advocate for strategic actions by U.S. nursing leadership that denote the presence, customs, and implications of racism that has been institutionalized within the structures of U.S. nursing leadership and the profession. Organizing Constructs A racial equity framework is used to examine the barriers to quality health care and equitable health outcomes and to present evidence-based actions to dismantle structural inequities embedded in the nursing profession. Methods This article was developed through a comprehensive literature review and synthesis of relevant research, data, peer-reviewed literature, government reports, and organizational guidelines. Findings A commitment by U.S. nursing leadership to eradicate structural racism in nursing must be made in order to effect sustainable transformative change toward more equitable systems of health care. Conclusions This article presents recommendations for nursing leadership in the United States to renew its commitment to quality health care through dismantling structural racism at all levels of direct and systems nursing practice and education, at the bedside, and in the boardrooms. Clinical Relevance Structural racism in nursing and health care also persists globally as a key social determinant of health. Its elimination aligns with international health care and nursing's policy priorities, yet change can only occur when senior leaders clearly understand it as a key barrier to health, and commit to transformative change in how their "systems" work. These recommendations can also be culturally adapted by global nursing for use in antiracism work.

Yet there has been inadequate focus on the social aspects of GI. In the United Kingdom (UK) the need for GI is well established, such that policymakers and planners are now turning to the question of how GI should be implemented. Drawing on a mixed method research approach centring on practitioner experience, this paper identifies potential social principles that underpin GI and questions the extent to which these are being implemented in the UK. Results highlight the hitherto unexplored complexities of GI maintenance, the effects of austerity politics, and the role of local-level power dynamics on the implementation of GI. Findings have implications for international literature on GI as well as nature-based solutions more broadly.

While there is abundant literature that discusses the discourses of security and concerns over international terrorism, as well as acculturation and accommodation, little is known about how some of these public policies and practices intersect with human rights, health, and wellbeing. This paper seeks to illuminate the health and human rights consequences of policies about the hijab and niqab, including bans on religious symbols in public workplaces. This work is guided by interdisciplinary health, social justice, and anti-racism frameworks, and it explores the human rights concerns of policies that may be used to justify surveillance and control over racialized people, migrants, and their cultural practices. Various countries have increasingly expanded their surveillance of immigrant people from South Asia and the Middle East, especially Arabs, Central and South Asians, Africans, and Muslims. These groups have been experiencing racism at their places of worship, borders, ports of entry, and at airports.(1)Many governments, including the provincial government of Quebec from within Canada, have introduced policy interventions aimed at persons displaying religious symbols, which I argue have undermined the human rights and well-being of affected groups.

J	Zhao, PJ; Li, SX; Liu, D				Zhao, Pengjun; Li, Shengxiao; Liu, Di			Unequable spatial accessibility to hospitals in developing megacities: New evidence from Beijing	HEALTH & PLACE			English	Article						Healthcare services; Inequality; Spatial accessibility; COVID-19 pandemic; Megacities; China	HEALTH-CARE ACCESSIBILITY; ACCESS; NEIGHBORHOOD; INEQUALITIES	The increasing inequality in spatial accessibility to hospitals in developing countries has been attracting attention from researchers and politicians. The situation seems to be worse in growing megacities where more than 10 million people live and rapid urban sprawl has caused serious problems with the supply of health and public transport services. The recent global COVID-19 pandemic calls for particular attention to be afforded to the matter of equal access to basic medical facilities and services for people across different neighborhoods. Although some studies have already been undertaken into the subject of health-focused inequality in the cities of developing countries, the spatial inequity in hospital accessibility has rarely been discussed to date. In this paper, I aim to provide new evidence by considering Beijing as a case study. With the results of my analysis, I show that lowincome neighborhoods have experienced lower levels of accessibility not only to high-tier hospitals (secondary and tertiary hospitals) but also to primary healthcare services (primary hospital and neighborhood clinics). The rate at which high-income neighborhoods access secondary and tertiary hospitals is approximately 4 times and 1.5 times as high as that of low-income neighborhoods. Low-income face nearly twice the travel time of those from high-income neighborhoods to reach the nearest primary hospital or neighborhood clinics. Suburban neighborhoods have less access to medical services than neighborhoods that are located in the central urban areas. It seems that the rapid urban sprawl has been worsening spatial inequality in the context of access to medical services in the growing megacity of Beijing. Equal access to healthcare services should be prioritized in future policy discussions, especially in relation to the urban growth management of megacities in developing countries in order to ensure that fair and inclusive urbanization processes are undertaken. Equal access to healthcare services would also be widely beneficial in the context of managing the COVID-19 pandemic.

Functional recovery in older women undergoing surgery for gynaecological malignancies: A systematic review and narrative synthesis	JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC ONCOLOGY			English	Review						Gynaeoncology surgery; Geriatric oncology; Functional outcomes; Activities of Daily Living (ATMs); Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS); Shared-decision making	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; OVARIAN-CANCER; ENDOMETRIAL CANCER; OUTCOMES; VALIDATION; MOBILITY; IMPACT; ADULTS; NEEDS; AGE	Objectives: Older women are increasingly undergoing surgery for gynaecological malignancies. Although survival data is available other outcomes such as functional recovery are less well described. This systematic review and narrative synthesis describes functional recovery after gynaeoncology surgery with respect to baseline characteristics. Materials and Methods: Systematic search of MEDUNE and EMBASE databases and Cochrane Library between 1974 to 2018. Two reviewers independently reviewed abstracts/papers for inclusion against the following criteria: - mean/median patient age >60 - gynaeoncology surgery - preoperative, post-operative and change in function evaluated using any validated tool containing items measuring functional ability (defined by WHO International Classification of Function). Results analysed and presented using narrative synthesis. Results: Fifteen studies identified (8 Endometrial, 2 Ovarian, 2 Vulva], 3 mixed cancer types). 1/15 used a standalone functional assessment tool, 14/15 used Health-Related Quality of Life tools (EORTC QLQ C30 (8), FACT-G (3), SF-36 (3)) comprising items describing function. More studies showed full recovery to baseline (n - 13) than incomplete recovery (n - 2). Four studies reported a negative association between older age and functional trajectory. Recovery was more likely and occurred faster in minimally-invasive surgery. Few studies reported baseline characteristics including cognition, frailty or comorbidities and none examined associations with functional recovery. Conclusion: There is inadequate data on functional recovery of older women following gynaeoncology surgery. Future studies are needed to identify factors associated with poorer/better outcomes. This may enable identification of opportunities for risk reduction, improve equity of access and better shared-decision making. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the current context of globalization and the predominance of cooperative work, it is crucial to analyze the participation of the countries and regions where the infection is most prevalent. This study assesses the participation of African countries in publications on the topic, as well as the degree of equity or influence existing in North-South relations. Methods We identified all articles and reviews of HIV/AIDS indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection. We analyzed the scientific production, collaboration, and contributions from African and Middle Eastern countries to scientific activity in the region. The concept of leadership, measured through the participation as the first author of documents in collaboration was used to determine the equity in research produced through international collaboration. Results A total of 68,808 documents published from 2010 to 2017 were analyzed. Researchers from North America and Europe participated in 82.14% of the global scientific production on HIV/AIDS, compared to just 21.61% from Africa and the Middle East. Furthermore, the publications that did come out of these regions was concentrated in a small number of countries, led by South Africa (41% of the documents). Other features associated with HIV/AIDS publications from Africa include the importance of international collaboration from the USA, the UK, and other European countries (75-93% of the documents) and the limited participation as first authors that is evident (30 to 36% of the documents). Finally, the publications to which African countries contributed had a notably different disciplinary orientation, with a predominance of research on public health, epidemiology, and drug therapy. Conclusions It is essential to foster more balance in research output, avoid the concentration of resources that reproduces the global North-South model on the African continent, and focus the research agenda on local priorities. To accomplish this, the global North should strengthen the transfer of research skills and seek equity in cooperative ties, favoring the empowerment of African countries. These efforts should be concentrated in countries with low scientific activity and high incidence and prevalence of the disease. It is also essential to foster intraregional collaborations between African countries.

However, ways in which the healthcare needs of LGBTI + people can be addressed in student nurse education programmes have yet to be fully explored. The aim of this discussion paper is to present the evidence to support the inclusion of LGBTI + health throughout the nursing curriculum. A new conceptualisation of the full and effective integration of LGBTI + health content across and within the nursing curriculum is proposed. This can be achieved by further developing theory, skills simulation and practice learning opportunities. There is a need to ensure that nursing students are positioned and adequately prepared to effectively address concerns of social justice, reducing health inequalities, and providing responsive person-centred care for LGBTI + health service users.

J	Massuda, A				Massuda, Adriano			Primary health care financing changes in the Brazilian Health System: advance ou setback?	CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA			English	Article						Primary Health Care; Health Financing; Unified Health System	MORTALITY	In 2019, the Brazilian government launched a new Primary Health Care (PHC) policy for the Unified Health System (SUS). Called "PrevineBrasil", the policy changed the PHC funding for municipalities. Instead of inhabitants and Family Health Strategy (ESF) teams, intergovernmental transfers are calculated from the number of people registered in PHC services and the results achieved in a selected group of indicators. The changes will have a set of impacts for the SUS and the health of the population, which must be observed and monitored. In this paper, possible effects of the new policy are discussed from a brief context analysis of global trends in health systems financing and health services' remuneration models, as well as on the advances, challenges, and threats to PHC and the SUS. Based on the analysis, the new policy seems to have a restrictive purpose, which should limit universality, increase distortions in financing and induce the focus of PHC actions on the SUS, contributing to the reversal of historic achievements in reducing health inequalities in Brazil.

JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Air pollution; SDGs; Sustainable development; Climate change; Health	EMISSIONS; INDICATORS; CHALLENGES; MITIGATION; STRATEGIES; MORTALITY; COUNTRIES; POLICIES; BENEFIT; GOALS	Understanding the extent to which air pollution influences the process of attaining sustainable development goals (SDGs) may help to estimate the benefit of reducing air pollution for improving sustainable development and to evaluate the necessity and urgency of reducing air pollutants and improving air quality. In this paper, we use the latest calculation of the SDGs in China to construct provincial panel data and investigate the relationship between air pollution and Chinese SDGs. We find that reducing air pollution will not only improve the SDGs directly associated with the environment, such as SDG3 (good health and well-being) and SDG15 (life on land), but also has a close relationship with the SDGs of other dimensions, such as SDG4 (quality education), SDG9 (industrial, innovation and infrastructure), SDG12(responsible consumption and production), SDG16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), SDG17(global partnerships). Based on the actual reduction in industrial SO2 emissions and evolution of the SDGs in China, we estimate that the former contributes approximately 3.5%-12.3% of the actual change in these SDGs from 2005 to 2015. Our findings support that reducing air pollution benefits the progress of sustainable development in various ways, and the efforts of curbing air pollution and improving air quality are especially valuable for sustainable development.

J	Thummapol, O; Park, T; Barton, S				Thummapol, Onouma; Park, Tanya; Barton, Sylvia			Exploring health services accessibility by indigenous women in Asia and identifying actions to improve it: a scoping review	ETHNICITY & HEALTH			English	Review						Indigenous women in Asia; ethnic minority; health services accessibility; equitable healthcare; gender equality; human rights	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; CARE; DETERMINANTS; EXPERIENCES	Objectives:The aim of this scoping review was to uncover and summarize what is known in the literature about the experiences of Indigenous women in Asia regarding access to health services. Design:The study was informed by the scoping review methodology proposed by Arksey and O'Malley [2005. "Scoping Studies: Towards a Methodological Framework."International Journal of Social Research Methodology8 (1): 19-32. doi:10.1080/1364557032000119616]. A comprehensive search of the databases for peer-reviewed studies and grey literature was conducted between January 2000 and December 2016. The data of selected papers and abstracts were analysed by three independent researchers through a protocol of data charting, descriptive numerical summary, and thematic analysis. Results:Sixteen articles and two abstracts met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review. These 18 peer-reviewed documents consisted of eight qualitative studies, seven quantitative studies, and three mixed-method studies, which included the peer-reviewed poster and oral presentation abstracts from international conferences. The findings were sorted and grouped under the following themes: health care access for Indigenous women in Asia, facilitators to accessing healthcare services, barriers to accessing healthcare services, and cultural contexts impacting health and access. Conclusion:There is limited information about the experiences, facilitators, barriers, and cultural contexts faced by Indigenous women in Asia related to health services accessibility, and even less information related to improving health services accessibility and health outcomes. This scoping review in particular highlights the dearth of literature relating to Indigenous women's postpartum health and access to postnatal supports and services. Generally, it indicates that Indigenous women in Asia are more vulnerable to poor health in comparison to non-Indigenous women, and continue to face challenges and barriers in accessing quality and equitable health services.

However, in low-and middle-income countries, many women are still dying due to lack of obstetric services. Tanzania is one of the African countries where maternal mortality is high. However, there is paucity of evidence related to the magnitude and trends of disparities in CS utilization in the country. This study examined both the magnitude and trends in socio-economic and geographic inequalities in access to birth by CS. Methods Data were extracted from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys (TDHSs) (1996-2015) and analyzed using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software. First, access to birth by CS was disaggregated by four equity stratifiers: wealth index, education, residence and region. Second, we measured the inequality through summary measures, namely Difference (D), Ratio (R), Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII). A 95% confidence interval was constructed for point estimates to measure statistical significance. Results The results showed variations in access to birth by CS across socioeconomic, urban-rural and regional subgroups in Tanzania from 1996 to 2015. Among the poorest subgroups, there was a 1.38 percentage points increase in CS coverage between 1996 and 2015 whereas approximately 11 percentage points increase was found among the richest subgroups within same period of time. The coverage of CS increased by nearly 1 percentage point, 3 percentage points and 9 percentage points among non-educated, those who had primary education and secondary or higher education, respectively over the last 19 years. The increase in coverage among rural residents was 2 percentage points and nearly 8 percentage points among urban residents over the last 19 years. Substantial disparity in CS coverage was recorded in all the studied surveys. For instance, in the most recent survey, pro-rich (RII = 15.55, 95% UI; 10.44, 20.66, SII = 15.8, 95% UI; 13.70, 17.91), pro-educated (RII = 13.71, 95% UI; 9.04, 18.38, SII = 16.04, 95% UI; 13.58, 18.49), pro-urban (R = 3.18, 95% UI; 2.36, 3.99), and subnational (D = 16.25, 95% UI; 10.02, 22.48) absolute and relative inequalities were observed. Conclusion The findings showed that over the last 19 years, women who were uneducated, poorest/poor, living in rural settings and from regions such as Zanzibar South, appeared to utilize CS services less in Tanzania. Therefore, such subpopulations need to be the central focus of policies and programmes implemmentation to improve CS services coverage and enhance equity-based CS services utilization.

Although physical activity (PA) is a noninvasive and cost-effective method of improving the quality of health, global statistics show that only a few middle-aged and older adults engage in the recommended PAs. This is due to a lack of motivation and companionship.Objective. This study analyses the attitudes and self-determined motivation of Chinese middle-aged and older adults for PAs and their eagerness to participate in PAs such as sports, exercise, and recreational and cultural activities (RCAs), from attitudinal, eagerness, and motivational objectives of PAs perspective.Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 840 middle-aged (35-54 years) and older adults (55+ years). To determine their attitude, eagerness, and self-determined motivation for PA, we used attitudinal, Eagerness for Physical Activity Scale (EPAS), and Situational Motivational Scale (SIMS). The data were analyzed with SPSS 23.0.Results. The results show that 39.1% of the participants were not satisfied with PAs. Compared with females, males reported a less positive attitude towards PAs. Moreover, a positive attitude decreases with age. Participants' motivation and eagerness in activities such as RCAs, exercise, and sports are decreasing. Regarding self-determined motivation, there are gender differences in RCAs, but there is none for exercise and sports participation.Conclusion. The findings show the importance of RCAs and the support of family and friends enhancing the eagerness, attitude, and motivation to participate in PAs. Furthermore, the findings can help to create more effective PA programs for middle-aged and older adults. By engaging in RCAs, participants can reap the benefits of PAs. Participating in RCAs can lead to social equity in health.

More so, the pandemic has undermined the profession's historical value commitment to social justice and human rights while overturning our insistence on the importance of human relationships. The purpose of this essay is to explicate the nexus between social work and COVID-19 pandemic. While noting the deafening silence of the profession in the global discourse of the pandemic, it advocates for the urgency of our response if our profession is to attain significant public value amid the current loss of lives and threats to human rights. Strategies for our professional action, in flattening the curve of the contagion, are laid out.

Based on the assumption that public reform, meaning changes to the structures and processes of public organizations designed to improve their performance (Pollitt & Bouckaert, 2017), is a feature of modern governance, studies investigating lack of reform have suggested it as evidence of non-governability, lack of management, lack of leadership and even public anarchy (e.g., Jeffery, 2008; Rahat & Hazan, 2011). However, its wide-ranging and theoretical influence has not yet been examined in depth, its connections to recent trends in public management have yet to be clarified, and its ramifications for the management of Israeli local municipalities are unclear. Thus, I explore the theoretical and practical interactions between the attributes and circumstances of the lack of reform of local government in Israel - especially in its management. I also examine how recent global trends such as the co-production of value and the coronavirus outbreak may postpone or accelerate such reform.

Mobile sex-tech apps: How use differs across global areas of high and low gender equality	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEALTH-PROMOTION; RISK BEHAVIOR; SOCIAL MEDIA; SEEKING SEX; ONLINE; MEN; ADULTS; PREVALENCE; EDUCATION; INTERNET	Digital technologies are increasingly intertwined into people's sexual lives, with growing scholarly interest in the intersection of sex and technology (sex-tech). However, much of the literature is limited by its over emphasis on negative outcomes and the predominance of work by and about North Americans, creating the impression that sex-tech is largely a Western phenomenon. Based on responses from 130,885 women in 191 countries, we assessed how women around the world interact with mobile technology for sex-related purposes, and whether in areas of greater gender inequality, technological accessibility may be empowering women with knowledge about sexuality. We investigated women's use of technology to find sexual partners, learn about sex and improve their sexual relationships, and track their own sexual health. About one-fifth reported using mobile apps to find sexual partners. This use varied by region: about one-third in Oceania, one-fourth in Europe and the Americas, and one-fifth in Asia and Africa. Staying connected when apart was the most commonly selected reason for app use with a sexual partner. About one-third had used an app to track their own sexual activity. Very few reported that the app they used to improve their sexual relationships was detrimental (0.2%) or not useful (0.6%). Women in countries with greater gender inequality were less likely to have used mobile apps to find a sexual partner, but nearly four timesmorelikely to have engaged in sending and receiving sexts. To our knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive global data on sex-tech use thus far, demonstrates significant regional variations in sex-tech use, and is the first to examine women's engagement in sex-related mobile technology in locations with greater gender disparities. These findings may inform large-scale targeted studies, interventions, and sex education to improve the lives of women around the world.

Cambodia's microfinance sector is one of the fastest growing, and like others in the Global South has moved from offering entrepreneurial capital to everyday liquidity, and even disaster relief. In this Viewpoint, however, we argue that the promotion of microfinance as market-based relief and recovery from the pandemic should be a source of concern, not comfort. We firstly suggest that as a result of the health and economic impacts associated with COVID-19, credit-taking is likely to escalate further in terms of the number of borrowers and loan amounts. Second, we contend that a growing reliance on MFIs will leave households undernourished, and further vulnerable to its disciplining and extractive impulses. Third, we argue that the interplay between over-indebtedness, pre-existing malnutrition challenges, and the global public health crisis of COVID-19 represents a major challenge to gender equality and sustainable development. Coordination between the Cambodian government, microfinance lenders, international investors, and development partners is vital to offer debt relief. Furthermore, to reverse the reliance of so many households on the microfinance industry for survival, inclusive socio-economic policies and public welfare services must be prioritised.

J	Klassen, S; Murphy, S				Klassen, Susanna; Murphy, Sophia			Equity as both a means and an end: Lessons for resilient food systems from COVID-19	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Food systems; Resilience; Equity; Migration; Labor; Food insecurity	HEALTH; MIGRANT	Food systems are important sites of economic stress, political response and adaptation. Access to food is also an important marker of how well a society distributes its wealth, reflecting the state of political accountability, economic redistribution, and the society's level of commitment to uphold the right to food. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the interconnected weaknesses of our food, social and economic systems and offers lessons for building more just and resilient food systems. We focus on three lessons learned anew in the pandemic: (1) food insecurity both reflects and reinforces inequity, (2) food workers are essential yet treated as sacrificial, and (3) racialized migrant food workers face unique forms of inequity. These lessons - chosen for their ethical salience, global relevance, and political urgency - show how interconnected inequities revealed by the pandemic are undermining resilience. We conclude with specific policy recommendations for redress, both within and beyond food systems. This will not be the final global pandemic, nor is it the only shock that regions are currently experiencing. COVID-19 is an opening to think about how societies might center justice and equity in efforts to build back better. Governments should take this opportunity to invest in structural changes to reduce persistent inequities in food access due to poverty, health outcomes, decent work and overall wellbeing, especially for racialized communities and migrants.

Research on gender and politics shows that exceptional environments can activate stereotypes of women as honest, trustworthy, and competent lawmakers in public health and, in doing so, can generate increased public support for female political candidates. We argue that the 2019-2020 Coronavirus Pandemic has the potential to produce this outcome, as recent public opinion polls highlight widespread discontent with male-led governments' responses to the pandemic and elevated concerns surrounding public health. Recent positive media reports of female world leaders' responses to the pandemic provide further reason to suspect a forthcoming increase in political support for female candidates. We posit that such an outcome may prove essential not only for enhancing development and improving long-standing gender inequities but also for alleviating the pandemic's disproportionately allocated hardships.

The aim of this study was to enumerate surgical volumes in Liberia, quantify surgical infrastructure, personnel and availability of essential surgical procedures, describe surgical facilities, and assess the influence of human resources and infrastructure on surgical volumes. Methods: An observational countrywide survey was done in Liberia between 20 September and 8 November 2018. All healthcare facilities performing surgical procedures requiring general, regional or local anaesthesia in an operating theatre between September 2017 and August 2018 were eligible for inclusion. Information on facility infrastructure and human resources was collected by interviewing key personnel. Data on surgical volumes were extracted from operating theatre log books. Results: Of 70 healthcare facilities initially identified as possible surgical facilities, 52 confirmed operative capacity and were eligible for inclusion; all but one shared surgical data. A national surgical volume of 462 operations per 100 000 population was estimated. The median hospital offered nine of 26 essential surgical procedures. Unequal distributions of surgical infrastructure, personnel, and essential surgical procedures were identified between facilities. In multivariable regression analysis, surgical human resources (beta = 0.60, 95 per cent c.i. 0.34 to 0.87;P < 0.001) and infrastructure (beta = 0.03, 0.02 to 0.04;P < 0.001) were found to be strongly associated with operative volumes. Conclusion: The availability of essential surgical procedures in Liberia is extremely low. Descriptive tools can quantify inequalities, guide resource allocation, and highlight rational investment areas.	[Adde, H. A.; van Duinen, A. J.; Oghogho, M. D.; Bolkan, H.

The aim is to design treemaps providing a summary description of hospitals (including breast units) and Local Health Units (LHUs) in terms of their levels of performance within the breast cancer network of the Lazio region (central Italy). The treemap structure has an intuitive design and displays information from both general and specific analyses. Methods Patients admitted to the regional hospitals for malignant breast cancer (MBC) surgery in 2010-2017 were selected in a population-based cohort study. These quality indicators were calculated based on the international guidelines (EUSOMA, ESMO) to assess the performance in terms of volume of activity, surgery procedure, post-surgery assistance and timeliness of medical therapy or radiotherapy beginning. The quality indicators were calculated using administrative health data systematically collected at the regional level and were included in the treemap to represent the surgery or the post-surgery areas of the breast cancer clinical pathway. In order to allow aggregation of scores for different indicators belonging to the same clinical area, up to five evaluation classes were defined using the "Jenks Natural Breaks" algorithm. A score and a colour were assigned to each clinical area based on the ranking of the indicators involved. The analyses were performed on an annual basis, by the LHU of residence and by the hospital which performed the surgical intervention. Results In 2017, 6218 surgical interventions for MBC were performed in the hospitals of Lazio. The results showed a continuous increase of the level of performance over the years. Hospitals showed higher variability in the levels of performance than the LHUs. 36% of the evaluated hospitals reached a high level of performance. An audit of the S. Filippo Neri breast unit revealed incorrect coding of the input data. For this reason, the score for the indicator for the volume of wards was re-calculated and re-evaluated, with a subsequent improvement of the level of performance. Most LHUs achieved at least an average overall level of performance, with 20% of the LHUs reaching a high level of performance. Conclusions This is the first attempt to apply the treemap logic to a single clinical network, in order to obtain a summary indicator for the evaluation of the breast cancer care network. Our results supply decision makers with a transparent instrument of governance for heterogeneous users, directing efforts improving and promoting equity of care. The treemaps could be reproduced and adapted for other local contexts, in order to limit inappropriateness and ensure uniform levels of breast cancer care within local areas. The next step is the evaluation of audit and feedback interventions to improve the quality of care and to guarantee homogeneous levels of care throughout the region.

Unpacking the black box of trade credit to socially responsible customers	JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE			English	Article						Customer-supplier relationships; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Trade credit	FINANCIAL DISTRESS; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MAJOR CUSTOMERS; CORPORATE; SUPPLIERS; CONSTRAINTS; EARNINGS; EQUITY; IMPACT; CASH	We investigate whether suppliers value customer firms' socially responsible activities by examining the relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and firms' access to trade credit. We posit that firms with better social performance are more likely to receive trade credit because suppliers view customers' CSR activities as a signal of trustworthiness and of the capacity to meet financial obligations. In addition to this direct channel, we describe other channels: a) trade credit opens the possibility for suppliers to secure a share of their customers' future business opportunities, which are expected to be higher for socially responsible firms, and b) the risk associated with the diffusion of negative shocks through the supply chain due to trade credit is lower for socially responsible firms, making them more attractive partners for suppliers. Consistent with our predictions, we find that socially responsible customers receive more trade credit from suppliers. This relation is more pronounced in situations where the aforementioned channels are more relevant: namely, when the financial health of a customer is of greater importance to its suppliers; when there are greater information asymmetries between suppliers and customers due to a lack of close transactional relationships; when socially responsible activities are more likely to generate growth; and when suppliers are exposed to higher risk in the customer-supplier relationship. We also document that during the global financial crisis, socially responsible customers offered backward liquidity provision to suppliers by reducing their use of trade credit, which represents an extra benefit of having socially responsible customers in production networks.

J	Vickers, CH				Vickers, Caroline H.			Occasioned membership categorization in a transnational medical consultation: Interaction, marginalization, and health disparities	JOURNAL OF SOCIOLINGUISTICS			English	Article						health equity; medical interaction; multilingualism; transnationalism	INTERPRETERS; EPISTEMICS; DYNAMICS; IDENTITY	The purpose of this paper is the identification of linguistic features that work to co-construct identities and meaning making processes in a transnational medical consultation. Health scholarship has demonstrated that the medical consultation is essentially an interview that tends to be controlled by the medical provider. However, this paper demonstrates that the epistemic status and stance attributed to the patient and the provider can affect the interaction as can the introduction of a third party and multiple languages. Data analyzed in this paper come from a consultation in a low-income community clinic in Southern California that involves a monolingual Spanish-speaking patient, her Spanish-English bilingual daughter, and a Spanish-English bilingual nurse practitioner. Data analysis methodology includes membership categorization analysis (MCA) and interactional sociolinguistics (IS). Findings reveal that occasioned membership categories develop micro-interactionally, which affect how meaning is negotiated within the interaction and the quality of care that the patient receives. Language choice, prosody, phrase choice, paralinguistic signs, and participation framework contribute to the co-construction of occasioned membership categories. Implications include the need to attend to how the participation framework and occasioned membership categories may contribute to health disparities for transnational populations. El proposito de este documento es el identificar las cualidades linguisticas que trabajan para construir identidades y lo que significa hacer procesos en una consulta medica transnacional. La beca de salud ha demonstrado que la consulta medica es escencialmente una entrevista que tiende a ser controlada por el proveedor medico. Sin embargo, este documento demuestra que el estado y postura espitemica atribuida al paciente y el poveedor puede afectar la interaccion asi como la introduccion de terceras personas y multiples lenguajes. Los datos analizados en este documento provienen de una consulta medica en una clinica medica de bajos recursos en Southern California que involucra un paciente hispanohablante y monolingue, su hija quien es bilingue en espanol y ingles asi como una enfermera practicante quien tambien es bilingue en espanol y ingles. El metodo de analisis de los datos incluye una categorizacion de miembros y sociolinguistica interactiva. Los descubrimientos revelan que la categorizacion de miembros se desarrolla a traves de micro-interaccion, que afecta en como el significado es negociado entre la interaccion y la calidad del cuidado que el paciente transnacional recibe.

In Australia, people born overseas are identified as being at greater risk of drowning. This paper presents findings from a community-based qualitative evaluation of swimming and water safety (SWS) programs delivered to adults from migrant backgrounds in Sydney, Australia. Methods A qualitative study was conducted in November-December 2019 among 35 female participants of SWS programs targeted to adult migrants. While offered to all SWS program participants, no males took part in the study. Focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed using a deductive approach. The domains of enquiry were guided by the health belief model and the theory of planned behaviour. Results Study participants were >= 25 years, first generation and most had lived in Australia for >= 10 years. Most were nonswimmers and were fearful of water prior to the program. Key themes were: direct SWS program outcomes, health and well-being; enablers and barriers to participation including: motivation, a program coordinator, fear and settlement priorities. Conclusion Findings suggest that in order to increase SWS participation among migrant communities, the broader determinants of health need to be considered. Culturally appropriate strategies are required to enable both men and women equal opportunities to access SWS programs. So what SWS programs provide multiple benefits for adult migrants; however, the impact on reducing inequities is limited, with broader multi-strategic health promotion approaches and policies required for inclusion and sustainability.

Tenofovir for prevention of mother to child transmission of hepatitis B in migrant women in a resource-limited setting on the Thailand-Myanmar border: a commentary on challenges of implementation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Barriers; Inequality; HBV; Antiviral therapy	DISOPROXIL FUMARATE; VERTICAL TRANSMISSION; GLOBAL ELIMINATION; ANTIVIRAL THERAPY; PREGNANT-WOMEN; EFFICACY; SAFETY; SEROPREVALENCE; INFECTION; HIV	Background The aim of this manuscript is to highlight challenges in the implementation of maternal tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in resource limited setting. Current preventive strategies in resource-limited settings fail mainly due to prohibitive costs of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and a high proportion of homebirths, meaning both HBIG and hepatitis B birth dose vaccine are not given. A new strategy for PMTCT without the necessity of HBIG, could be daily tenofovir commenced early in gestation. Implementation challenges to early tenofovir for PMTCT can provide insight to elimination strategies of HBV as the burden of disease is high in resource-limited settings. Methods Challenges encountered during implementation of a study of tenofovir for PMTCT before 20 weeks gestation in rural and resource-limited areas on the Thailand-Myanmar border were identified informally from trial study logbooks and formally from comments from patients and staff at monthly visits. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02995005. Main body During implementation 171 pregnant women were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive by point of-care test over 19 months (May-2018 until Dec-2019). In this resource-limited setting where historically no clinic has provided tenofovir for PMTCT of HBV, information provided by staff resulted in a high uptake of study screening (95.5% (84/88) when offered to pregnant women. False positive point-of-care rapid tests hinder a test and treat policy for HBV and development of improved rapid tests that include HBeAg and/or HBV DNA would increase efficiency. Integrated care of HBV to antenatal care, transport assistance and local agreements to facilitate access, could increase healthcare at this critical stage of the life course. As safe storage of medication in households in resource-limited setting may not be ideal, interactive counseling about this must be a routine part of care. Conclusion Despite challenges, results from the study to date suggest tenofovir can be offered to HBV-infected women in resource-limited settings before 20 weeks gestation with a high uptake of screening, high drug accountability and follow-up, with provision of transportation support. This commentary has highlighted practical implementation issues with suggestions for strategies that support the objective of PMTCT and the World Health Organization goal of HBV elimination by 2030.

J	Mohan, G; Chattopadhyay, S				Mohan, Giridhar; Chattopadhyay, Sajal			Cost-effectiveness of Leveraging Social Determinants of Health to Improve Breast, Cervical, and Colorectal Cancer Screening A Systematic Review	JAMA ONCOLOGY			English	Review							PATIENT NAVIGATION PROGRAM; BUDGET IMPACT ANALYSIS; ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; MOBILE MAMMOGRAPHY; TELEPHONE CALLS; INTERVENTION; APPLICABILITY; NEIGHBORHOODS; PROBAST; WOMEN	Question What are the costs of interventions leveraging social determinants of health to improve breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening, and are they cost-effective? Findings In this systematic review of 30 unique economic evaluations, the median intervention cost per participant was $123.87, the median incremental cost per additional person screened was $250.37, and the median incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $3120.00, which was considerably lower than an established conservative threshold for cost-effectiveness. Meaning This study found that interventions focused on social determinants of health to improve breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening appear to be cost-effective for underserved, vulnerable populations in the United States. Importance Screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers in the United States has remained below the Healthy People 2020 goals, with evidence indicating that persistent screening disparities still exist. The US Department of Health and Human Services has emphasized cross-sectoral collaboration in aligning social determinants of health with public health and medical services. Examining the economics of intervening through these novel methods in the realm of cancer screening can inform program planners, health care providers, implementers, and policy makers. Objective To conduct a systematic review of economic evaluations of interventions leveraging social determinants of health to improve screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer to guide implementation. Evidence Review A systematic literature search for economic evidence was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Global Health, Scopus, Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete, EconLit, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), ERIC (Education Resources Information Center), and Sociological Abstracts from January 1, 2004, to November 25, 2019. Included studies intervened on social determinants of health to improve breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in the United States and reported intervention cost, incremental cost per additional person screened, and/or incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Risk of bias was assessed along with qualitative assessment of quality to ensure complete reporting of economic measures, data sources, and analytic methods. In addition, included studies with modeled outcomes had to define structural elements and sources for input parameters, distinguish between programmatic and literature-derived data, and assess uncertainty. Findings Thirty unique articles with 94 706 real and 4.21 million simulated participants satisfied our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. The median intervention cost per participant was $123.87 (interquartile interval [IQI], $24.44-$313.19; 34 estimates). The median incremental cost per additional person screened was $250.37 (IQI, $44.67-$609.38; 17 estimates). Studies that modeled final economic outcomes had a median incremental cost per person of $122.96 (IQI, $46.96-$124.80; 5 estimates), a median incremental screening rate of 15% (IQI, 14%-20%; 5 estimates), and a median incremental QALY per person of 0.04 years (IQI, 0.006-0.06 year; 5 estimates). The median incremental cost per QALY gained of $3120.00 (IQI, $782.59-$33600.00; 5 estimates) was lower than $50000, an established, conservative threshold of cost-effectiveness. Conclusions and Relevance Interventions focused on social determinants of health to improve breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening appear to be cost-effective for underserved, vulnerable populations in the United States. The increased screening rates were associated with earlier diagnosis and treatment and in improved health outcomes with significant gains in QALYs. These findings represent the latest economic evidence to guide implementation of these interventions, which serve the dual purpose of enhancing health equity and economic efficiency. This systematic review assesses economic evaluations of interventions leveraging social determinants of health to improve screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer.

J	de Carvalho, RC; Nahas, MIP; Heller, L				de Carvalho, Rodrigo Coelho; Pedrosa Nahas, Maria Ines; Heller, Leo			Localizing Sustainable Development Goal 6: An Assessment of Equitable Access to Sanitation in a Brazilian Metropolitan Region	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						SDG 6; target 6; 2; localizing; sanitation; inequality; RMBH		In order for the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda to be achieved, it is essential to "localize" the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), since it is only at the local level that it is possible to move towards their effective implementation. This article seeks to contribute to the development of evaluation and monitoring strategies for target 6.2 at the local level, adapting the official SDG indicator 6.2.1a and the international criteria established by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)) at the municipal scale. Using the Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region (RMBH) as a case study, a series of methodological procedures is proposed to assess and monitor equitable access to sanitation services. Inequalities in access to services between different population subgroups and between the municipalities that make up the RMBH are explored in different ways, including the evaluation of intersecting forms of inequality, the mapping of a synthetic index of inequality based on multiple criteria and the projection of the time needed to achieve universal access to services according to international criteria. The procedures applied demonstrated the existence of significant inequalities among the municipalities and population subgroups of the RMBH, which are not evident in the analysis of the aggregated data by municipality.

J	Javanparast, S; Baum, F; Ziersch, A; Freeman, T				Javanparast, Sara; Baum, Fran; Ziersch, Anna; Freeman, Toby			A Framework to Determine the Extent to Which Regional Primary Healthcare Organisations Are Comprehensive or Selective in Their Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Comprehensive Primary Healthcare; Assessment Framework; Regional Planning; Australia		Background: There is an increasing emphasis on the importance of comprehensive primary healthcare (CPHC) in improving population health and health equity. There is, therefore, a need for a practical means to determine how comprehensive regional primary healthcare organisations (RPHCOs) are in their approach. This paper proposes a framework to provide such a means. The framework is then applied to assess the comprehensiveness of Australian RPHCOs. Methods: Drawing on a narrative review of the broader literature on CPHC versus selective primary healthcare (SPHC) and examples of international models of RPHCOs, we developed a framework consisting of the key criteria and a continuum from comprehensive to selective interventions. We applied this framework to Australian RPHCOs using data from the review of their planning documents, and survey and interviews with executive staff, managers, and board members. We used a spidergram as a means to visualise how comprehensive they are against each of these criteria, to provide a practical way of presenting the assessment and an easy way to compare progress over time. Results: Key criteria for comprehensiveness included (1) focus on population health; (2) focus on equity of access and outcomes; (3) community participation and control; (4) integration within the broader health system; (5) intersectoral collaboration; and (6) local responsiveness. An examination of Australian RPHCOs using the framework suggests their approach is far from comprehensive and has become more selective over time. Conclusion: The framework and spidergram offer a practical means of gauging and presenting the comprehensiveness of RPHCOs, and to identify gaps in comprehensiveness, and changes over time.

Mind the gap: Gender differences in walkability, transportation and physical activity in urban India	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH			English	Article						Non-communicable diseases; Low- and middle-income countries; Physical activity; Built environment; Neighborhood walkability; India	OBESITY PREVALENCE; DISEASES; HYPERTENSION; OVERWEIGHT; PATTERNS	Introduction: Insufficient physical activity (PA) is a key contributor for premature mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite the well-documented health benefits of PA, few women achieve the recommended levels of PA. The global average of inactivity among women is higher at 31.7% compared to 23.4% for inactive men. The gender gap in PA participation is wider in India where estimates indicate that 44% women are insufficiently active, compared to 25% men. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the city of Chennai, India. Participants (N = 370) were recruited from 155 wards stratified by neighborhood walkability and socio-economic status. The adapted Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale for India (NEWS-India) was used to assess built environment perceptions on density, land-use mix, street infrastructure, aesthetics, traffic and crime safety. Travel and leisure PA were recorded using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form (IPAQ-LF). Study protocols were based on recommendations of the International Physical activity and the Environment Network (IPEN; www.ipenproject.org) and previously used in studies in Brazil, Colombia, and Nigeria. Results: A greater number of women reported achieving weekly PA levels from travel-related activities (n = 54, 16.0%) compared to men (n = 33, 9.8%). In contrast, a higher percentage of men (n = 75, 22.3%) met weekly PA recommendations during leisure-time compared to women (n = 54, 16.1%). Street connectivity (aOR = 3.2, CI = 1.3, 8.0) and land-use mix access (aOR = 3.7, CI = 1.4, 8.2) significantly increased odds of travel PA among women. Conclusions: Low engagement in leisure PA among women can be linked to prevailing sociocultural norms that constrain women's mobility and hinder their participation in PA. Aspects of gender equity in transportation planning are closely linked with citywide indicators of liveability, sustainability and resilience in LMICs like India. Public health practitioners must address gender-specific barriers to increase PA among women through context-specific group exercise programs, peer support and guidance that emphasize the importance of PA.

Measuring the availability and geographical accessibility of maternal health services across sub-Saharan Africa	BMC MEDICINE			English	Article						Emergency obstetric care; Universal health coverage; Healthcare accessibility; Maternal and newborn health; GIS	EMERGENCY OBSTETRIC CARE; INDICATORS; COVERAGE; SYSTEMS; ACCESS	Background With universal health coverage a key component of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, targeted monitoring is crucial for reducing inequalities in the provision of services. However, monitoring largely occurs at the national level, masking sub-national variation. Here, we estimate indicators for measuring the availability and geographical accessibility of services, at national and sub-national levels across sub-Saharan Africa, to show how data at varying spatial scales and input data can considerably impact monitoring outcomes. Methods Availability was estimated using the World Health Organization guidelines for monitoring emergency obstetric care, defined as the number of hospitals per 500,000 population. Geographical accessibility was estimated using the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, defined as the proportion of pregnancies within 2 h of the nearest hospital. These were calculated using geo-located hospital data for sub-Saharan Africa, with their associated travel times, along with small area estimates of population and pregnancies. The results of the availability analysis were then compared to the results of the accessibility analysis, to highlight differences between the availability and geographical accessibility of services. Results Despite most countries meeting the targets at the national level, we identified substantial sub-national variation, with 58% of the countries having at least one administrative unit not meeting the availability target at province level and 95% at district level. Similarly, 56% of the countries were found to have at least one province not meeting the accessibility target, increasing to 74% at the district level. When comparing both availability and accessibility within countries, most countries were found to meet both targets; however sub-nationally, many countries fail to meet one or the other. Conclusion While many of the countries met the targets at the national level, we found large within-country variation. Monitoring under the current guidelines, using national averages, can mask these areas of need, with potential consequences for vulnerable women and children. It is imperative therefore that indicators for monitoring the availability and geographical accessibility of health care reflect this need, if targets for universal health coverage are to be met by 2030.

Meanwhile, information and communication technologies (ICT), such as the internet, mobile phones, and smartphones, are spreading worldwide, including in low- and middle-income countries. We reviewed the available evidence on the use of ICT-based interventions to address intimate partner violence (IPV), evaluating the effectiveness, acceptability, and suitability of ICT for addressing different aspects of the problem (e.g., awareness, screening, prevention, treatment, mental health).MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines, using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Key search terms included women, violence, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, information, communication technology, ICT, technology, email, mobile, phone, digital, ehealth, web, computer, online, and computerized. Only articles written in English were included.ResultsTwenty-five studies addressing screening and disclosure, IPV prevention, ICT suitability, support and women's mental health were identified. The evidence reviewed suggests that ICT-based interventions were effective mainly in screening, disclosure, and prevention. However, there is a lack of homogeneity among the studies' outcome measurements and the sample sizes, the control groups used (if any), the type of interventions, and the study recruitment space. Questions addressing safety, equity, and the unintended consequences of the use of ICT in IPV programming are virtually non-existent.ConclusionsThere is a clear need to develop women-centered ICT design when programming for IPV. Our study showed only one study that formally addressed software usability. The need for more research to address safety, equity, and the unintended consequences of the use of ICT in IPV programming is paramount. Studies addressing long term effects are also needed.

However, coverage rates have stagnated and remained low for many years, suggesting the presence of systemic barriers to implementation. Hence, there is a need to consolidate the existing knowledge, in order to address them and consequently improve program effectiveness.MethodsA thorough literature review and Delphi method were used. In this review, we searched Pubmed/Medline, WHO library, Science direct, Cochrane library, Google scholar and Google using different combinations of search strategies. Studies that applied any study design, data collection and analysis methods related to immunization program were included. In the Delphi method, a panel of 28 national and international experts were participated to identify current evidence gaps and set research priorities under the immunization program.ResultsIn this review, a total of 55 studies and national documents were included. The review showed that the vaccination coverage ranged from 20.6% in Afar to 91.7% in Amhara region with large inequities related to socio-economic, health service access and knowledge about vaccination across different settings. Only one study reported evidence on timeliness of immunization as 60%. The review revealed that 80% of health facilities provide immunization service nationally while service availability was only 2% in private health facilities. This review indicated that poor vaccine storage, vaccine shortage, service interruptions, poor defaulter tracing, low community engagement and poor documentation were the main barriers for the Expanded Program on Immunization with variations across different regions. Through expert panel of discussion using Delphi method, 10 priority research areas were identified across different domains of the immunization program at national level.ConclusionWe found out that there is substantial knowledge on vaccination coverage, however, there is little evidence on timeliness of vaccination. The existing barriers that affect full immunization coverage also varied from context to context which indicates there is a need to design and implement evidence based locally tailored interventions. This review also indicated evidence gaps with more focus on health system related implementation barriers at lower level and identified further research priorities in the immunization program of Ethiopia.

Confining the analyses to patients, it was also examined whether survival over the observation period and over a standardised period of 18 months differed by occupational position and income. Methods Our findings are based on claims data from a German statutory health insurance covering 2005-2016. The database comprised N=3 163 211 women (50.7%) and men (49.3%) aged 18 years and older. Diagnoses (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision: C34.0 to C34.9) were hospital-based, and income and occupational position were used as indicators of socioeconomic position. Analyses on social gradients were performed for employed and retired insured, but only for employed insured information on occupation and on income were available, for retired women and men only income was available. Analyses were performed by means of proportional hazard regression. Results In employed women, social gradients for the occurrence emerged for occupational position, but not for income. In men, social differences were found for both indicators. For retired insured, income gradients were found in men. Looking at overall survival, neither in women nor in men social gradients emerged. Conclusions The reported social inequalities in the occurrence of lung cancer are pointing towards social differences in smoking behaviour, exposition to hazardous occupation-related substances and differences in preventive strategies. The absence of social inequalities in survival after lung cancer suggests equality in medical treatment of the disease.

The "patriotism paradox" is that disengagement from the international legal order weakens rather than strengthens state sovereignty. The "border paradox" is that securing domestic populations by excluding noncitizens, in the absence of accompanying regulatory mechanisms to secure adherence to internal health measures, accelerates viral spread among citizens. The "equality paradox" is that while pandemics pose an equal threat to all people, their impacts compound existing inequalities.

While such impacts of Covid-19 are becoming clearer, the implications of the disease for energy and climate policy are more prosaic. This Special Section seeks to offer more clarity on the emerging connections between Covid-19 and energy supply and demand, energy governance, future low-carbon transitions, social justice, and even the practice of research methodology. It features articles that ask, and answer: What are the known and anticipated impacts of Covid-19 on energy demand and climate change? How has the disease shaped institutional responses and varying energy policy frameworks, especially in Africa? How will the disease impact ongoing social practices, innovations and sustainability transitions, including not only renewable energy but also mobility? How might the disease, and social responses to it, exacerbate underlying patterns of energy poverty, energy vulnerability, and energy injustice? Lastly, what challenges and insights does the pandemic offer for the practice of research, and for future research methodology? We find that without careful guidance and consideration, the brave new age wrought by Covid-19 could very well collapse in on itself with bloated stimulus packages that counter sustainability goals, misaligned incentives that exacerbate climate change, the entrenchment of unsustainable practices, and acute and troubling consequences for vulnerable groups.

The COVID-19 crisis is yet another manifestation of the urgent need to transition to more sustainable societies, further exposing the weaknesses in health systems and the injustice in our societies. It also underlines that many of the factors leading to environmental degradation, ill health and social and health inequities are interlinked. The current situation provides an unprecedented opportunity to invest in initiatives that address these common factors and encourage people to live more healthily and sustainably. Such initiatives can generate the positive feedback loops needed to change the systems and structures that shape our lives. INHERIT (January 2016-December 2019), an ambitious, multisectoral and transnational research project that involved 18 organisations across Europe, funded by the European Commission, explored such solutions. It identified, defined and analysed promising inter-sectoral policies, practices and approaches to simultaneously promote environmental sustainability, protect and promote health and contribute to health equity (the INHERIT "triple-win") and that can encourage and enable people to live, move and consume more healthfully and sustainably. It also explored the facilitators and barriers to working across sectors and in public private cooperation. The insights were brought together in guidelines setting out how policy makers can help instigate and support local "triple-win" initiatives that influence behaviours as an approach to contributing to the change that is so urgently needed to stem environmental degradation and the interlinked threats to health and wellbeing. This article sets out this guidance, providing timely insights on how to "build back better" in the post pandemic era.

The lack of effective dissemination of emerging evidence on climate change health risks, effects, and innovative interventions to health professionals presents one of the greatest challenges to climate action today. Intervention To identify and address the knowledge gaps at the intersection of health and climate change, the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research (CCGHR) established a Working Group on Climate Change and Health (WGCCH). WGCCH is evolving organically into a community of practice (CoP) that aims to elevate knowledge brokering on climate change and health and expand to global multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary realms. Outcomes To date, the WGCCH established a regular webinar series to share expert knowledge from around the world on intersections between climate change and health, developed short summaries on climate change impacts on broad health challenges, supported young professional training, and enhanced climate health research capacity and skills through collegial network development and other collaborative projects that emerged from CoP activities. Implications This paper proposes that WGCCH may serve as an example of an effective strategy to address the lack of opportunities for collaborative engagement and mutual learning between health researchers and practitioners, other disciplines, and the general public. Our experiences and lessons learned provide opportunities to learn from the growing pains and successes of an emerging climate change and health-focused CoP.

Several studies have documented that female empowerment may increase violence against women-the so-called "male backlash." We propose a utilitarian explanation for this phenomenon, based on the assumption that violence may be used as an instrument to affect the distribution of the household surplus between the spouses. Our main result is that promoting norms of gender equity (or otherwise enhancing the prospects of divorced women) may inadvertently promote violence against women in settings where production outcomes are uncertain.

Homeless populations face significant barriers to care. We aim to summarise evidence of treatment initiation and completion for homeless populations with these infections, and their associated factors, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We will search MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL for all study types and conference abstracts looking at either (1) treatment initiation in a cohort experiencing homelessness with at least one of HIV, hepatitis C, active tuberculosis and/or latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); (2) treatment completion for those who initiated treatment. We will perform a meta-analysis of the proportion of those with each infection who initiate and complete treatment, as well as analysis of individual and health system factors that may affect adherence levels. We will evaluate the quality of research papers using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Discussion Given the political emphasis on global elimination of these diseases, and the current lack of understanding of effective and equitable treatment adherence strategies in homeless populations, this review will provide insight to policy-makers and service providers aiming to improve homeless healthcare.

The World Health Organization declared the Zika outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in 2016. Health facilities in the regions most affected by Zika lacked the capacity to respond to the increased demand for contraception. The objectives were to explore healthcare users' perceptions regarding contraception, Zika prevention during pregnancy and post-abortion care (PAC) services in the context of a Zika outbreak in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and to follow these services over time. Methods This study was part of a broader implementation research study. We used qualitative research consistent with grounded theory approach. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were performed with women and their partners who used contraceptive services or received PAC services. Data were collected in two stages from December 2017 to July 2018. Themes explored included contraception, Zika and PAC services. Results Participants had positive attitude towards the use of contraceptive methods and demanded more information on safety, efficacy and on side effects. Health care services were inconsistent in the provision of information on Zika and contraception services. ZIKV vector transmission was known but fewer participants were aware of risk of sexual transmission of Zika. Barriers to access healthcare services included contraceptive and PAC services included distance to healthcare facilities, disorganized admission process, long waiting times and out-of-pocket expenditure to purchase medicines. Furthermore, poor quality, mistreatment and abuse of women seeking PAC was prevalent. Some positive changes were noted over time, such as improvements in infrastructure including improved privacy and cleanliness, removal of fees, requisite to bring clean water to hospital. Conclusions Our results highlight the challenges and areas for improvement in policy and practice related to contraceptive services and PAC in the context of ZIKV infection. Public policies to prevent epidemics should focus more on providing proper sanitation; removing barriers to access and use of effective contraception as human rights priority. Zika epidemic has highlighted weaknesses in health systems that obstruct access to and use of sexual and reproductive health services. The study results call for increased efforts to improve access, especially for women of low socio-economic status and intervene at different levels to eradicate discrimination and improve equity in the provision of health care.

Monitoring the progress of health-related sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Brazilian states using the Global Burden of Disease indicators	POPULATION HEALTH METRICS			English	Article						Health disparities; Poverty; Inequalities; Middle-income countries; Health indicators	SYSTEMATIC SUBNATIONAL ANALYSIS; CESAREAN DELIVERY; CHILD HEALTH; MORTALITY; INEQUALITY; HOMICIDE; RATES; CITY	BackgroundMeasuring the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) has been the key to verifying the evolution of health indicators worldwide. We analyse subnational GBD data for Brazil in order to monitor the performance of the Brazilian states in the last 28years on their progress towards meeting the health-related SDGs.MethodsAs part of the GBD study, we assessed the 41 health-related indicators from the SDGs in Brazil at the subnational level for all the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District from 1990 to 2017. The GBD group has rescaled all worldwide indicators from 0 to 100, assuming that for each one of them, the worst value among all countries and overtime is 0, and the best is 100. They also estimate the overall health-related SDG index as a function of all previously estimated health indicators and the SDI index (Socio-Demographic Index) as a function of per capita income, average schooling in the population aged 15years or over, and total fertility rate under the age of 25 (TFU25).ResultsFrom 1990 to 2017, most subnational health-related SDGs, the SDG and SDI indexes improved considerable in most Brazilian states. The observed differences in SDG indicators within Brazilian states, including HIV incidence and health worker density, increased over time. In 2017, health-related indicators that achieved good results globally included the prevalence of child wasting, NTD, household air pollution, conflict mortality, skilled birth attendance, use of modern contraceptive methods, vaccine coverage, and health worker density, but poor results were observed for child overweight and homicide rates. The high rates of overweight, alcohol consumption, and smoking prevalence found in the historically richest regions (i.e., the South and Southeast), contrast with the high rates of tuberculosis, maternal, neonatal, and under-5 mortality and WASH-related mortality found in the poorer regions (i.e., the North and Northeast).ConclusionsThe majority of Brazil's health-related SDG indicators have substantially improved over the past 28years. However, inequalities in health among the Brazilian states and regions remain noticeable negatively affecting the Brazilian population, which can contribute to Brazil not achieving the SDG 2030 targets.

In order to measure the inequalities of the IMR by FU, the ratios from highest to lowest from 1990 to 2015 were calculated. Maps were elaborated in 2000, 2010, and 2015 at the municipality level. To analyze the effect of income, IMR inequalities by GDP per capita were analyzed, comparing Brazil and the FU to other same-income level countries in 2015, and the IMR municipal estimates were analyzed by income deciles, in 2000 and 2010.ResultsIMR decreased from 47.1 to 13.4 per 1000 live births (LB) from 1990 to 2015, with an annual decrease rate of 4.9%. The decline was less pronounced for the early neonatal annual rate (3.5%). The Northeast region showed the most significant annual decline (6.2%). The IMR estimates carried out by the GBD were about 20% higher than those obtained by the MoH, but in terms of their inequalities, the ratio from the highest to the lowest IMR among the 27 FU decreased from 4 to 2, for both methods. The percentage of municipalities with IMR higher than 40 per 1000 LB decreased from 23% to 2%, between 2000 and 2015. Comparing the IMR distribution by income deciles, all inequality measures of the IMR decreased markedly from 2000 to 2010.ConclusionThe results showed a marked decrease in the IMR inequalities in Brazil, regardless of the geographic breakdown and the calculation method. Despite clear signs of progress in curbing infant mortality, there are still challenges in reducing its level, such as the concentration of deaths in the early neonatal period, and the specific increases of post neonatal mortality in 2016, after the recent cuts in social investments.

Invisible No More: The Impact of COVID-19 on Essential Food Production Workers	JOURNAL OF AGROMEDICINE			English	Article						Meatpacking; processing; farmworkers; ethics; human rights		From the farms to the packing plants, essential workers in critical food production industries keep food on our tables while risking their and their families' health and well-being to bring home a paycheck. They work in essential industries but are often invisible. The disparities illuminated by COVID-19 are not new. Instead, they are the result of years of inequities built into practices, policies, and systems that reinforce societal power structures. As a society, we are now at an antagonizing moment where we can change our collective trajectory to focus forward and promote equity and justice for workers in agriculture and food-related industries. To that end, we describe our experience and approach in addressing COVID-19 outbreaks in meat processing facilities, which included three pillars of action based on public health ethics and international human rights: (1) worksite prevention and control, (2) community-based prevention and control, and (3) treatment. Our approach can be translated to promote the health, safety, and well-being of the broader agricultural workforce.

Human rights and education for Gambian young women during COVID-19: Recommendations for social policy and practice	INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						COVID-19; education; Gambia; girls; human rights; social work; young women		COVID-19 is not only a global health disaster but a full-fledged social, economic, and political crisis that could disrupt the gains made in women's education and empowerment. In The Gambia, issues of unequal access to educational resources determined by gender, geographical location, and social class; a disproportionate burden of household chores imposed on women and girls; and economic pressures have the potential to expose girls to more violence, exclusion, and abuse. In this article, we use a human rights framework, as conceptualized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW), and discuss increases in educational inequality that young women in a poor, conservative, and patriarchal society will face during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose solutions to mitigate these issues through social protection policies and practices that can ensure the right to education for the most vulnerable and marginalized.

J	Liu, F; Zheng, MN; Wang, MC				Liu, Feng; Zheng, Meina; Wang, Meichang			Does air pollution aggravate income inequality in China? An empirical analysis based on the view of health	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						PM2.5; Socioeconomic status; Hierarchical linear model; Health; 3SLS	ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; EXPOSURE; EMISSIONS; POVERTY; MORTALITY; IMPACT; SPAIN; CO2	Given the rapid development of the Chinese economy, especially its accelerated urbanization, air pollution and income inequality, as two of the most important global issues, have also become hot topics in China. However, limited attention has been devoted to understanding their joint evolution in the literature. In this study, we thus investigate the relationship between them using a multi-level nested data model, which enables us to estimate the long-run distribution effect of air pollution on individuals of different socioeconomic statuses, based on China's city-level PM2.5 emissions and individual-level income. We further examine the mechanisms behind the evolution using a 3SLS model. The estimation results reveal that the increase in air pollution concentration has short-term positive production effects and long-term negative impacts on individual income, and will exacerbate the income inequality across socioeconomic statuses. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status have disadvantages in achieving efficient avoiding knowledge and measures. The results of 3SLS model confirm the existence of the health channel through which air pollution exerts influence on income inequality. These results provide a roadmap for policymakers. First, a comprehensive assessment of the health burden distribution from air pollution on individuals of different socioeconomic statuses should be considered for environmental policymaking. Second, the regional disparities and differences among income groups should also be considered during this process. Third, equal access to basic public services should be the primary target of environmental regulations. Moreover, compensation and assistance for the health issues caused by environmental pollution could be an important supplement to these regulations. Future study could do further analysis of the specific level of health burden due to different types of pollutants and their relationship with income inequality. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Aaslund, H; Chear, C				Aaslund, Havard; Chear, Charles			Marginalised groups protest against social welfare and public health: conceptualising the challenge for social workers	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK			English	Article						Collective action; community organising; protest; social work ethics; neoliberalism	MOVEMENTS; POWER; NEOLIBERALISM; MOBILIZATION; RESISTANCE; POLITICS	As neoliberalisation and other global disruptions change the understanding of human rights and social justice for social workers, how are protests organised by marginalised groups against social welfare and public health regimes understood and participated, or even resisted, by social workers? Although there is a vast literature on protest and community organising in the social work tradition, there is less exploration of marginalised groups organising against the systems in which social workers are employed, thereby leading to dilemmas for social workers. Hence, more knowledge is necessary about social workers' capability to respond to such protests. Using collective action and social movement theories, this paper introduces a conceptual framework in order to identify key factors and variables when marginalised groups organise against social welfare and public health regimes and social workers are involved. The conceptual framework concerns social workers' value negotiation of human rights and social justice principles, collective action framing, ethical decision-making, and ultimately, the thought process behind a social worker's response to collective actions against social welfare and public health regimes.

J	Paprotny, D				Paprotny, Dominik			Convergence Between Developed and Developing Countries: A Centennial Perspective	SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH			English	Article						Time lags; Global development; Health indicators; Economic indicators; Environmental indicators; Sustainable development goals	PRODUCTIVITY; WORLD; DIVERGENCE; INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; TESTS	Are countries at a low level of socio-economic development catching up with developed countries over time or rather falling further behind? Existing work on the subject is not conclusive, partially due to methodological differences. The aim of the paper is to carry out a broader analysis with longer time series and a more diverse set of indicators. The study divides countries of the world into 21 developed "benchmark" countries and 156 developing countries. The distance between the benchmark and developing countries is measured using the "time lags" method, applied here to nine indicators covering topics such as the economy, health, education and the environment. The study further utilizes a probabilistic approach to extrapolate missing historical data for developing countries, so that the analysis can cover a full century starting in 1920 and ending with short-term projections to year 2020. The study finds that a majority of developing countries, and the population-weighted developing world as a whole, has reduced its lag in most indicators between 1920 and 2020. Progress was unevenly distributed, with East Asian and European countries converging the most with the benchmark, while most African countries have diverged along with some American ones. Catch-up in education attainment and life expectancy has been more successful than in infant survival rate, GDP per capita or technology adoption. The findings are put in context of United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, showing how the time lag method could improve setting targets for some of the goals. Further, time lags are used to analyze the current demographic, economic and political situation of developing countries, identifying opportunities and risks for future catch-up with developed countries.

J	Liu, L				Liu, Lee			Rural-Urban Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease Mortality Among Middle-Age Men in China	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						health inequities; heart diseases; stroke; China; men's health		Rural-urban health disparities are still poorly understood, due to a considerable gap in knowledge, while a looming heart disease and stroke epidemic in China has caused global concern. This report attempts to fill in the knowledge gaps to examine if rural-urban disparities in heart disease and stroke mortality have widened, which population cohorts have experienced the greatest mortality growth and disparities, and if rurality still matters in China. Age-specific data from 2002 to 2016 published in the China Health Yearbooks were analyzed with the Joinpoint Regression Program. The results reveal that China faces a fast growing cardiovascular disease epidemic with widening rural-urban disparities. Rural death rates have grown higher than urban rates along with fast rising rural mortality, and the fastest increasing rates are found among rural men in younger age groups. These findings inspire further research into the causes of the disparities.

Socio-economic disparity in these two countries has created wide gap in management of hypertension. However, inequalities in prevalence and management (awareness, treatment, and control) of hypertension is poorly assessed. This study analyzes the risk factors associated with prevalence and management of hypertension in India and Nepal and assesses the wealth-and education-based inequalities in them. Methods: This study used data from the Demographic and Health Survey; a cross-sectional survey conducted between January 2015 to December 2016 in India and June 2016 to January 2017 in Nepal. A total of 787,713 individuals in India and 14,454 individuals in Nepal aged between 15 and 49years were included in the study. Respondents were classified as being hypertensive if their systolic blood pressure (SBP) readings were at least 140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings were at least 90mmHg, or if they reported currently taking anti-hypertensive medication. Multilevel logistic regression models with random intercepts at household-and community-levels were used to identify the risk factors associated with prevalence and management of hypertension. For inequality assessment, slope index and relative index of inequalities in prevalence and management of hypertension were estimated. Results: Overall prevalence of hypertension in India and Nepal were 11.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 11.4-11.5) and 19.6% (95% CI, 18.9-20.2), respectively. Less than one-third of the hypertensive population received treatment and below 20% among them had their blood pressure controlled. In both countries, wealth-and education-based inequalities in awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension were significantly high in urban and rural areas. Conclusion: Wealth- and education-based inequalities in prevalence and management of hypertension were high among different socio-economic groups at national and sub-national levels. Tailored strategies are required to effectively manage hypertension in different regions by considering socio-economic and demographic factors.	[Rauniyar, Santosh Kumar; Rahman, Md.

However, this does not guarantee an improved quality of life. There is a gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. This study aimed to reveal the features of healthy life expectancy across all secondary medical areas (n= 344) in Japan and examine the relationship among healthcare resources, life expectancy, and healthy life expectancy at birth. Data were collected from Japan's population registry and long-term insurance records. Differences in healthy life expectancy by gender were calculated using the Sullivan method. Maps of healthy life expectancy were drawn up. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were used for analysis. The findings revealed significant regional disparities. The number of doctors and therapists, support clinics for home healthcare facilities and home-visit treatments, and dentistry expenditure per capita were positively correlated with life expectancy and healthy life expectancy (correlation coefficients > 0.2). They also revealed gender differences. Despite controlling for population density, inequalities in healthy life expectancy were observed, highlighting the need to promote social policies to reduce regional disparities. Japanese policymakers should consider optimal levels of health resources to improve life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. The geographical distribution of healthcare resources should also be reconstituted.

Linking the co-benefits of climate action to wider issues that the public are concerned about can help decision makers to prioritise decarbonisation options that increase the chance of public support for such changes, while ensuring that a just transition is delivered. We identified key issues of concern to the UK public by use of Ipsos MORI public opinion data from 2007 to 2020 and used these data to guide a narrative review of academic and grey literature on the co-benefits of climate change action for the UK. Correspondence with civil servants, third sector organisations, and relevant academics allowed us to identify omissions and to ensure policy relevance of the recommendations. This evidence-based Review of the various co-benefits of climate change action for the UK identifies four main areas: health and the National Health Service; security; economy and unemployment; and poverty, housing, and inequality. Associated trade-offs are also discussed. City-level and regional-level governments are particularly well placed to incorporate co-benefits into their decision making because it is at this scale that co-benefits most clearly manifest, and where interventions can have the most immediate effects.

J	Okenwa-Emegwa, L; Eriksson, H				Okenwa-Emegwa, Leah; Eriksson, Henrik			Lessons Learned from Teaching Nursing Students about Equality, Equity, Human Rights, and Forced Migration through Roleplay in an Inclusive Classroom	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						inclusive education; role play; forced migration; violence; nursing students; sustainable development; existential; precarious migration status	HEALTH	Inclusive education, sustainable development, and core nursing values all share common goals of promoting diversity, equity, social justice, and inclusion. However, prevailing norms of exclusion may shape health systems and healthcare workers' attitudes and threaten inclusive patient care. Ongoing global conflicts and violence resulting in growing patient diversity in terms of ethnicity and migration status have led to questions regarding healthcare systems' preparedness for inclusive nursing. Diversity-rich classrooms and collaborative learning methods, like role play, are inclusive strategies that may be useful in nursing education. The purpose of this paper is to present lessons learned from incorporating role play about forced migration in inclusive nursing classrooms. Various diversity-rich nursing student groups participated in a two-hour role play on forced migration facilitated by youth volunteers from the Swedish Red Cross Society between 2017 and 2019. This study is based on the amplified analysis of qualitative data materials, in the form of notes and summarized feedbacks, obtained from evaluating the role play as a teaching-learning activity. Three themes were identified, specifically, knowledge exchange, existential reflections, and empathy evoked. Findings suggest that working collaboratively in an inclusive environment may improve nursing students' understanding of the vulnerabilities created by forced migration and to be better prepared for promoting social justice for this group in health care settings.

This article is carried out within the framework of approximation work towards health-related ethnic inequalities among the population of African descent of the Americas. A qualitative methodology was used to conduct 20 in-depth interviews with a group of key informants composed of leaders of African descent, officials from the ministries of health, international health agencies, and international technicians specialised in African descent health and interculturality from six different countries. The extracted data were categorised and encoded, generating quotations and concept maps with Atlas.ti v.8.2. The concurrency coefficients made it possible to link the codes of each subcategory with the central analytical category. The racial discrimination experienced by people of African descent and the quality of health services received poses a problem. Discrimination is faced in all countries, affecting access to services and the quality of health care, and greater discrimination against women is also detected. This shows the need for an activistpolicy and for the inclusion of specific variables in surveys, censuses, and records in order that they may be researched. Claims are made about the complementary role that traditional medicine may play and the fact that the intercultural approach may be a useful strategy for addressing inequalities. The interviewees agree with the reference theory on the existence of racial discrimination and segregation regarding the African descent population of the Americas and how this translates into ethnic inequities in the field of health. Proposals have been put forward both on how to deepen research and how to contribute to the reduction of ethnic inequalities in health issues.

J	Alexander, FH				Alexander, Frederick H.			The benefit stance: responsible ownership in the twenty-first century	OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY			English	Article						corporation law; social values; shareholder primacy; benefit corporations		Ownership in the global equities markets is dominated by large institutions that manage the savings of beneficiaries with long investment horizons. These asset managers rely on incomplete investment models that betray the interests of their beneficiaries and threaten their collective future. The models encourage individual companies to compete without regard for health of the critical social and environmental systems that support the long-term value of those beneficiaries' diversified portfolios and lived experience. These naive models ignore the growing cost of profit-driven negative externalities. This article examines the latest models of benefit corporation law, a new form of governance that overturns the rule of shareholder primacy, and argues that their principles should be expanded to cover the entire chain of investing, from savers to funds to asset managers and finally to the real economy.

Methods and findings We compared Hofstede's six cultural dimensions against relative health systems performance of 35 countries. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified best-matched groupings of countries. Performance was measured by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's)Health at a Glanceindicators data framework (five dimensions with 57 indicators) and the United Nations' (UNs') Sustainability Development Goals (SDG) data set (15 indicators). Three country clusters emerged: Collective-Pyramidal (n = 9: comprising Slovak Republic, Mexico, Poland, Greece, Spain, Turkey, Portugal, Chile, and Slovenia); Collaborative-Networked (n = 12: UK, Canada, Australia, USA, Ireland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden); and Orderly-Future Orientated (n = 14: Korea, Estonia, Latvia, Austria, Israel, Japan, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Switzerland). The Collaborative-Networked cluster had significantly better performing health systems measured by both theHealth at a Glanceand SDG performance data, followed by the Orderly-Future Orientated cluster, followed by the Collective-Pyramidal cluster. The Collaborative-Networked Cluster was characterized by low power distance (e.g., greater levels of equity), low uncertainty avoidance (e.g., toleration of others' opinions), individualism (e.g., self-reliance) and indulgence (e.g., drives and norms to enjoy life and have fun). Conclusions National cultures are associated with healthcare performance on two key international measures. In national and international efforts to improve health system performance, cultural characteristics play an important role. This information may be of value to regulators, policymakers, researchers and clinicians examining the practical impact of culture on healthcare performance.

J	Banerjee, K; Dwivedi, LK				Banerjee, Kajori; Dwivedi, Laxmi Kant			Disparity in childhood stunting in India: Relative importance of community-level nutrition and sanitary practices	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RISK-FACTORS; HEALTH; UNDERNUTRITION; DECOMPOSITION; INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; CHILDREN; GROWTH; COPRODUCTION; MALNUTRITION	Despite rapid macro-economic growth, one-third of the global burden of childhood stunting is contributed by India. This burden is characterized by wide-spread geographical variation within the country. This paper explores two research questions: (i) are the drivers of severe and moderate stunting similar? (ii) differential endowments or policy-effect, how do community-level nutrition and sanitary practices affect inter-state differences? Using data from Indian National Family and Health Survey 4, 2015-16, six states holding different ranks in the stunting continuum are compared to Tamil Nadu, taken as the benchmark state due to its laudable performance in the health care sector. Applying quantile regression approaches, the difference in state-level performance is decomposed into detailed covariate effects (differential endowments) and coefficient effects (differential strength of association between the drivers and outcome). The explanatory variables are not similarly associated with severe and moderate stunting. Decomposition results demonstrate a significant role of community-level sanitation practices compared to child nutrition behaviour in explaining the inter-state disparity. Coefficient effects play a dominant role in the lower tail of HAZ distribution for the poor performing states indicating that the worse outcomes of these states are due to weaker policy effects of the control variables on stunting. Multi-sectoral approach, identification and differentiation between severe and moderate stunting cases can be more instrumental in managing and reducing the scourge. This paper also advocates the potential benefits of customizing centrally-launched policies as per the state's performance and introducing the concept coproduction in the existing nutrition and health policy framework. This will instigate a feeling of ownership of the problem of childhood stunting among the policy consumers and strengthen the influence of policies on the outcomes.

FindingsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, psychosocial stressors at work were associated with an elevated risk of sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder. The risk was up to 76% higher among workers exposed to these work stressors compared with nonexposed workers. MeaningGiven that psychosocial stressors at work are frequent and modifiable, physicians should be aware of their importance when evaluating their patients' mental health and work capacity. ImportanceMental health problems are associated with considerable occupational, medical, social, and economic burdens. Psychosocial stressors at work have been associated with a higher risk of mental disorders, but the risk of sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder, indicating a more severe condition, has never been investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis. ObjectiveTo synthesize the evidence of the association of psychosocial stressors at work with sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder among adult workers. Data SourcesSeven electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, and International Bibliography of the Social Sciences), 3 gray literature databases (Grey Literature Report, WHO-IRIS and Open Grey), and the reference lists of all eligible studies and reviews were searched in January 2017 and updated in February 2019. Study SelectionOnly original prospective studies evaluating the association of at least 1 psychosocial stressor at work from the 3 most recognized theoretical models were eligible: the job demand-control-support model, including exposure to job strain (high psychological demands with low job control); effort-reward imbalance model; and organizational justice model. Study selection was performed in duplicate by blinded independent reviewers. Among the 28467 citations screened, 23 studies were eligible for systematic review. Data Extraction and SynthesisThis meta-analysis followed the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Data extraction and risk of bias evaluation, using the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies-Interventions tool, were performed in duplicate by blinded independent reviewers. Data were pooled using random-effect models. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSickness absence due to a mental disorder with a diagnosis obtained objectively. ResultsA total of 13 studies representing 130056 participants were included in the 6 meta-analyses. Workers exposed to low reward were associated with a higher risk of sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder compared with nonexposed workers (pooled risk ratio [RR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.49-2.08]), as were those exposed to effort-reward imbalance (pooled RR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.37-2.00]), job strain (pooled RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.24-1.74]), low job control (pooled RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.02-1.53]), and high psychological demands (pooled RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.04-1.45]). Conclusions and RelevanceThis meta-analysis found that workers exposed to psychosocial stressors at work were associated with a higher risk of sickness absence due to a mental disorder. A better understanding of the importance of these stressors could help physicians when evaluating their patients' mental health and work capacity. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the association of psychosocial stressors at work with sickness absence due to a diagnosed mental disorder among adult workers.

This article focuses on CHamoru, Guam's Indigenous people, and examines distal social determinants of health (SDOH) in the contested spaces of US territorial status and non-self-determining Indigenous nationhood. Published multi-disciplinary literature identified ways in which territorial status functions as an SDOH unique to non-self-determining Pacific Island nations. Indicated is the use of structural approaches that address mechanisms of US power and control, including economic policies that 'defacto' promote coca-colonisation and non-communicable diseases risk. Critical race theory centres race, colonisation and subversive narratives. In line with fourth-generation SDOH action-oriented research, we posit a CHamoru critical race theory model that weaves Indigenous, social work and public health perspectives. Lack of community input is a limitation of the current research. To assure relevance, the model will be vetted through community discussions. Our discussion guide may be tailored for other Indigenous communities. Social workers may play a meaningful role in promoting health equity through participatory action-oriented, cultural-political social work that upholds Indigenous self-determination and survivance in contested spaces.

These pressures highlight ethical, social, and political challenges about healthcare resource allocation, what health improvements matter to patients, and how they are measured. This study highlights the complexity of the ethical landscape, relating particularly to the balances that need to be struck when allocating resources; when measuring and prioritizing outcomes; and when individual preferences are sought. Objective: Health outcome prioritization is the ranking in order of desirability or importance of a set of disease-related objectives and their associated cost or risk. We analyze the complex ethical landscape in which this takes place in the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Narrative review of literature published since 2007, incorporating snowball sampling where necessary. We identified, thematized, and discussed key issues of ethical salience. Results: Eight areas of ethical salience for outcome prioritization emerged: 1) Public health and distributive justice, 2) Scarcity of resources, 3) Heterogeneity and changing circumstances, 4) Knowledge of treatment, 5) Values and circumstances, 6) Conflicting priorities, 7) Communication, autonomy and caregiver issues, and 8) Disclosure of risk. Conclusion: These areas highlight the difficult balance to be struck when allocating resources, when measuring and prioritizing outcomes, and when individual preferences are sought. We conclude by reflecting on how tools in social sciences and ethics can help address challenges posed by resource allocation, measuring and prioritizing outcomes, and eliciting stakeholder preferences.

J	Jöbges, S; Vinay, R; Luyckx, VA; Biller-Andorno, N				Joebges, Susanne; Vinay, Rasita; Luyckx, Valerie A.; Biller-Andorno, Nikola			Recommendations on COVID-19 triage: international comparison and ethical analysis	BIOETHICS			English	Article						comparison; COVID-19; ethics; guidelines; public health; triage		On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization classified COVID-19, caused by Sars-CoV-2, as a pandemic. Although not much was known about the new virus, the first outbreaks in China and Italy showed that potentially a large number of people worldwide could fall critically ill in a short period of time. A shortage of ventilators and intensive care resources was expected in many countries, leading to concerns about restrictions of medical care and preventable deaths. In order to be prepared for this challenging situation, national triage guidance has been developed or adapted from former influenza pandemic guidelines in an increasing number of countries over the past few months. In this article, we provide a comparative analysis of triage recommendations from selected national and international professional societies, including Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Pakistan, South Africa, Switzerland, the United States, and the International Society of Critical Care Medicine. We describe areas of consensus, including the importance of prognosis, patient will, transparency of the decision-making process, and psychosocial support for staff, as well as the role of justice and benefit maximization as core principles. We then probe areas of disagreement, such as the role of survival versus outcome, long-term versus short-term prognosis, the use of age and comorbidities as triage criteria, priority groups and potential tiebreakers such as 'lottery' or 'first come, first served'. Having explored a number of tensions in current guidance, we conclude with a suggestion for framework conditions that are clear, consistent and implementable. This analysis is intended to advance the ongoing debate regarding the fair allocation of limited resources and may be relevant for future policy-making.

Challenges to peer support in low- and middle-income countries during COVID-19	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Peer support; Global mental health; Covid-19	HEALTH	Background A recent editorial urged those working in global mental health to "change the conversation" on coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by putting more focus on the needs of people with severe mental health conditions. UPSIDES (Using Peer Support In Developing Empowering mental health Services) is a six-country consortium carrying out implementation research on peer support for people with severe mental health conditions in high- (Germany, Israel), lower middle- (India) and low-income (Tanzania, Uganda) settings. This commentary briefly outlines some of the key challenges faced by UPSIDES sites in low- and middle-income countries as a result of Covid-19, sharing early lessons that may also apply to other services seeking to address the needs of people with severe mental health conditions in similar contexts. Challenges and lessons learned The key take-away from experiences in India, Tanzania and Uganda is that inequalities in terms of access to mobile technologies, as well as to secure employment and benefits, put peer support workers in particularly vulnerable situations precisely when they and their peers are also at their most isolated. Establishing more resilient peer support services requires attention to the already precarious situation of people with severe mental health conditions in low-resource settings, even before a crisis like Covid-19 occurs. While it is essential to maintain contact with peer support workers and peers to whatever extent is possible remotely, alternatives to face-to-face delivery of psychosocial interventions are not always straightforward to implement and can make it more difficult to observe individuals' reactions, talk about emotional issues and offer appropriate support. Conclusions In environments where mental health care was already heavily medicalized and mostly limited to medications issued by psychiatric institutions, Covid-19 threatens burgeoning efforts to pursue a more holistic and person-centered model of care for people with severe mental health conditions. As countries emerge from lockdown, those working in global mental health will need to redouble their efforts not only to make up for lost time and help individuals cope with the added stressors of Covid-19 in their communities, but also to regain lost ground in mental health care reform and in broader conversations about mental health in low-resource settings.

Methods The intervention offered first-time parents six home visits from a paediatric nurse and a parental advisor with Social Services. On the fourth visit (infant age 6-8 months), parents received a toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste from non-dental staff. Twice, at child ages 18 and 36 months, a dentist used the International Caries Detection and Assessment System to record caries and conducted a structured interview with the parents on oral health habits. The intervention group (n = 72) was compared to a reference group (n = 100) from the standard child healthcare programme, which included one home visit. Results Significantly, caries prevalence was lower and tooth brushing habits more consistent in the intervention group compared to the reference group in the standard child health programme. The difference was most pronounced at 18 months and had decreased at the 36-month follow-up. Conclusion The extended postnatal home visiting programme had a positive impact on oral health. Early oral health promotion delivered by non-dental professionals could be a beneficial approach to early caries prevention.

We employ a firm-level panel dataset for the period of 2010-2014, covering 400 subsectors, and employing two measures of industrial concentration as proxies for market competition. The results suggest that firms operating in less competitive sectors in Indonesia experience higher technical efficiency. Additionally, foreign ownership, international activity (export-import), and firm size are positively related to technical efficiency. Such findings suggest that the efficient structure hypothesis (ESH) applies in Indonesia, as more efficient firms gain in market share as a result from dynamic competition. Foreign direct investment (FDI) via horizontal spillovers has contributed to an increase in intra industry firms' efficiency. Nevertheless, as industrial concentration increases, the positive effects in firm efficiency from FDI and from international trade (imports and export) tend to decrease.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between income, income inequality and schizophrenia and its heterogeneity among different geographic scales and subgroups. Methods We used data from the Second China National Sample Survey on Disability (2006). The sample consisted of 1 909 205 participants aged 18 years or older. Individuals who were suspected to be psychiatrically disabled were administered the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule, Version II and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Symptom Checklist for Mental Disorders by trained clinical psychiatrists to diagnose schizophrenia. Gross household income per capita was used to calculate the Gini coefficient to measure income inequality. Multilevel logistic regression with cross-level interaction was applied to examine the association of income, income inequality and schizophrenia. Results A total of 7 628 persons (0.40%) were identified as having schizophrenia. Income was independently associated with schizophrenia. At the province level, greater income inequality was significantly associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia (OR, 1.03; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06), and no significant association was observed at the county level. The analysis with cross-level interaction showed that the association at the province level was most pronounced in the highest income quartile (OR, 1.02; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03). Conclusion The significant association between income and schizophrenia was consistent with the absolute income hypothesis. The adverse effect of income inequality on the risk of schizophrenia starts to operate at a larger area level, and it is more pronounced for the affluent population in China. This finding further supports the relative income hypothesis and social causation pathway for schizophrenia and calls attention to the vulnerability of high-income groups.

This is attributable to: (a) social inequalities, including 'minority stress'; (b) associated health-risk behaviours (eg, smoking, excessive drug/alcohol use, obesity); (c) loneliness and isolation, affecting physical/mental health and mortality; (d) anticipated/experienced discrimination and (e) inadequate understandings of needs among healthcare providers. Older LGBT+ people are particularly affected, due to the effects of both cumulative disadvantage and ageing. There is a need for greater and more robust research data to support growing international and national government initiatives aimed at addressing these health inequalities. We identify seven key research strategies: (1) Production of large data sets; (2) Comparative data collection; (3) Addressing diversity and intersectionality among LGBT+ older people; (4) Investigation of healthcare services' capacity to deliver LGBT+ affirmative healthcare and associated education and training needs; (5) Identification of effective health promotion and/or treatment interventions for older LGBT + people, and subgroups within this umbrella category; (6) Development of an (older) LGBT+ health equity model; (7) Utilisation of social justice concepts to ensure meaningful, change-orientated data production which will inform and support government policy, health promotion and healthcare interventions.

J	Li, BX; Cheng, SX; Xiao, D				Li, Baoxi; Cheng, Shixiong; Xiao, De			The impacts of environmental pollution and brain drain on income inequality	CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW			English	Article						Environmental quality; Brain drain; Income inequality; Regional differences	RURAL-URBAN MIGRATION; INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CARBON EMISSIONS; AIR-POLLUTION; CO2 EMISSIONS; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; CHINA; QUALITY; REMITTANCES	This paper establishes a two-sector general equilibrium model of a small open economy to examine the impact of environmental pollution on income inequality via brain drain. The results of the equilibrium modelling show that environmental pollution in the source country can widen the income gap between skilled and unskilled workers and that brain drain caused by environmental pollution will amplify this effect; furthermore, improving the environmental quality in the recipient country will widen the skilled-unskilled income gap in the source country. Our empirical results show that deteriorating the environmental quality in the source country increases income inequality and that brain drain caused by environmental quality will amplify the effect. Our sample is divided into four sub-samples: stage of national development, level of national income, status of environmental pollution and situation of brain drain. We find that environmental pollution has different effects on income inequality via brain drain in these sub samples. Comparing the heterogeneous components of environmental quality, we find that brain drain caused by diminished ecosystem vitality and by air quality affecting human health will widen income inequality but that other factors related to environmental quality have no significant impacts on the effect of brain drain on income inequality. The results of a robustness test support these conclusions.

AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY			English	Article						Compliance; COVID-19; deterrence; duty; health risk; restrictions; social distancing; trust in authority	PROCEDURAL JUSTICE; MOTIVATING COMPLIANCE; PANDEMIC INFLUENZA; BEHAVIORS; TRUST; RISK	On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) a global pandemic. At the time of writing, over 16 million cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed worldwide, and more than 650,000 people had died from the virus. A priority amongst governments globally is limiting the spread of the virus. In Australia, this response included mandatory 'lockdown' restrictions which limited citizens' freedom of movement. This article uses survey data from 1595 Australians to examine compliance with COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in the early stages of the pandemic. Results revealed that a substantial number of Australians did not comply fully with the measures. Further, while self-interest and health concerns motivated compliance, normative concerns regarding duty to support the authorities dominated compliance decisions. The findings' implications for both compliance research and for authorities wanting to nurture voluntary compliance with public health orders are discussed.

Effect of the ASCENT Intervention to Increase Knowledge of Kidney Allocation Policy Changes Among Dialysis Providers	KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL REPORTS			English	Article						dialysis; effectiveness-implementation trial; health system intervention; kidney allocation system; kidney transplantation; pragmatic trial	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; RACIAL DISPARITIES; UNITED-STATES; EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; CARE PROVIDERS; TERM IMPACT; TRANSPLANTATION	Introduction: The Allocation System Changes for Equity in Kidney Transplantation (ASCENT) trial was a cluster-randomized pragmatic, effectiveness-implementation study designed to test whether a multicomponent educational intervention targeting leadership, clinic staff, and patients in dialysis facilities improved knowledge and awareness of the 2014 Kidney Allocation System (KAS) change. Methods: Participants included 690 dialysis facility medical directors, nephrologists, social workers, and other staff within 655 US dialysis facilities, with 51% (n = 334) in the intervention group and 49% (n = 321) in the control group. Intervention activities included a webinar targeting medical directors and facility staff, an approximately 10-minute educational video targeting dialysis staff, an approximately 10-minute educational video targeting patients, and a facility-specific audit and feedback report of transplant performance. The control group received a standard United Network for Organ Sharing brochure. Provider knowledge was a secondary outcome of the ASCENT trial and the primary outcome of this study; knowledge was assessed as a cumulative score on a 5-point Likert scale (higher score = greater knowledge). Intention-to-treat analysis was used. Results: At baseline, nonintervention providers had a higher mean knowledge score (mean +/- SD, 2.45 +/- 1.43) than intervention providers (mean +/- SD, 2.31 +/- 1.46). After 3 months, the average knowledge score was slightly higher in the intervention (mean +/- SD, 3.14 +/- 1.28) versus nonintervention providers (mean +/- SD, 3.07 +/- 1.24), and the estimated mean difference in knowledge scores between the groups at follow-up minus the mean difference at baseline was 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.48; P = 0.039). The effect size (0.41) was low to moderate. Conclusion: Dialysis facility provider education could help extend the impact of a national policy change in organ allocation.

J	Haycock, D; Jones, J; Smith, A				Haycock, David; Jones, Jon; Smith, Andy			Developing young people's mental health awareness through education and sport: Insights from the Tackling the Blues programme	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL EDUCATION REVIEW			English	Article						Focus groups; mental health; mental illness; pupil voice; whole-school approaches	PHYSICAL-EDUCATION; EMOTIONAL ASPECTS; LEARNING SEAL; IMPLEMENTATION; EXPERIENCES; PROMOTION; SCHOOLS	There is growing national and international concern about the mental health of children and young people, and in countries such as England there is now a political and policy commitment to developing whole-school approaches to mental health. This paper presents new evidence on how pupils' mental health is being addressed in schools using learning activities associated with physical education, sport and physical activity, as part of a school-based sport- and mental health-themed programme ('Tackling the Blues') for pupils aged 6-16 years old in north-west England. In particular, we examine how pupil-centred learning activities have been used in weekly multi-sport activity sessions and related classroom-based workshops, and draw upon insight from 29 focus groups to explore pupils' (n= 116) mental health awareness and associated socio-emotional learning (SEL). The learning activities led pupils to focus on the impact personal relationships with family and friends, feelings and emotions, and experiences of stress, anger and entrapment can have on mental health. It is argued that embedding socially relevant learning activities into the content, organisation and delivery of school curricula may help improve pupils' sense of enjoyment, participation and achievement which are important for enhancing their knowledge and awareness of mental health, and developing SEL. However, we conclude that the effectiveness of whole-school approaches also depends, perhaps to a greater degree, on the wider educational systems in which schools are located and especially the widening social, economic and health inequalities which have profound impacts on child development, educational and other outcomes, and mental health.

The Plant Science Decadal Vision 2020-2030 frames our ability to perform vital and far-reaching research in plant systems sciences, essential to how we value participants and apply emerging technologies. We outline a comprehensive vision for addressing some of our most pressing global problems through discovery, practical applications, and education. The Decadal Vision was developed by the participants at the Plant Summit 2019, a community event organized by the Plant Science Research Network. The Decadal Vision describes a holistic vision for the next decade of plant science that blends recommendations for research, people, and technology. Going beyond discoveries and applications, we, the plant science community, must implement bold, innovative changes to research cultures and training paradigms in this era of automation, virtualization, and the looming shadow of climate change. Our vision and hopes for the next decade are encapsulated in the phrase reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future. The Decadal Vision recognizes the vital intersection of human and scientific elements and demands an integrated implementation of strategies for research (Goals 1-4), people (Goals 5 and 6), and technology (Goals 7 and 8). This report is intended to help inspire and guide the research community, scientific societies, federal funding agencies, private philanthropies, corporations, educators, entrepreneurs, and early career researchers over the next 10 years. The research encompass experimental and computational approaches to understanding and predicting ecosystem behavior; novel production systems for food, feed, and fiber with greater crop diversity, efficiency, productivity, and resilience that improve ecosystem health; approaches to realize the potential for advances in nutrition, discovery and engineering of plant-based medicines, and "green infrastructure." Launching the Transparent Plant will use experimental and computational approaches to break down the phytobiome into a "parts store" that supports tinkering and supports query, prediction, and rapid-response problem solving. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are indispensable cornerstones of realizing our vision. We make recommendations around funding and systems that support customized professional development. Plant systems are frequently taken for granted therefore we make recommendations to improve plant awareness and community science programs to increase understanding of scientific research. We prioritize emerging technologies, focusing on non-invasive imaging, sensors, and plug-and-play portable lab technologies, coupled with enabling computational advances. Plant systems science will benefit from data management and future advances in automation, machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence-assisted data integration, pattern identification, and decision making. Implementation of this vision will transform plant systems science and ripple outwards through society and across the globe. Beyond deepening our biological understanding, we envision entirely new applications. We further anticipate a wave of diversification of plant systems practitioners while stimulating community engagement, underpinning increasing entrepreneurship. This surge of engagement and knowledge will help satisfy and stoke people's natural curiosity about the future, and their desire to prepare for it, as they seek fuller information about food, health, climate and ecological systems.

The Dengue Virus (DENY) serotypes are transmitted by an Aedes aegypti mosquito. Vector control is among the primary methods to prevent the disease, especially in tropical countries. This study aimed to analyze the spatial distribution of dengue and its relationship with social inequalities using spatial modelling. An ecological study with temporal and spatial analysis was conducted in the state of Sergipe, Northeast Brazil. over a period of 18 years. Spatial modelling was used to determine the influence of space on dengue incidence and social inequalities. The epidemic rates in 2008. 2012, and 2015 were identified. Spatial modelling explained 40% of the influence of social inequalities on dengue incidence in the state. The main social inequalities related to the occurrence of dengue were the percentage of people living in extreme poverty and inadequate sanitation. The epidemic situation even increased the risk of dengue in the population of the state of Sergipe. These results demonstrate the potential of spatial modelling in determining the factors associated with dengue epidemics and are useful in planning the intersectoral public health policies.

J	Hensher, M; Tisdell, J; Canny, B; Zimitat, C				Hensher, Martin; Tisdell, John; Canny, Ben; Zimitat, Craig			Health care and the future of economic growth: exploring alternative perspectives	HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article						Economic growth; health expenditure; health system sustainability; heterodox economics; post-growth health care	DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE; SECULAR STAGNATION; PREPAID PRIVATE; INCOME; INEQUALITY; GOVERNMENT; HAPPINESS; LIMITS; TOO; EXPENDITURE	The strong and positive relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) and health expenditure is one of the most extensively explored topics in health economics. Since the global financial crisis, a variety of theories attempting to explain the slow recovery of the global economy have predicted that future economic growth will be slower than in the past. Others have increasingly questioned whether GDP growth is desirable or sustainable in the long term as evidence grows of humanity's impact on the natural environment. This paper reviews recent data on trends in global GDP growth and health expenditure. It examines a range of theories and scenarios concerning future global GDP growth prospects. It then considers the potential implications for health care systems and health financing policy of these different scenarios. In all cases, a core question concerns whether growth in GDP and/or growth in health expenditure in fact increases human health and well-being. Health care systems in low growth or 'post-growth' futures will need to be much more tightly focused on reducing overtreatment and low value care, reducing environmental impact, and on improving technical and allocative efficiency. This will require much more concerted policy and regulatory action to reduce industry rent-seeking behaviours.

J	Smith, S; Connolly, S				Smith, Samantha; Connolly, Sheelah			Re-thinking unmet need for health care: introducing a dynamic perspective	HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW			English	Article						Dynamic perspective; health care demand; health care need; health care utilisation; unmet need	BEHAVIORAL-MODEL; MEDICAL-CARE; SERVICES; ACCESS; SAMPLE; EQUITY	There is an increasing interest in assessing unmet need for health care services particularly in European countries. Despite this there has been relatively little analysis of unmet need in the European or wider international setting. It remains a challenge to pin down what types of unmet need can and should be addressed by health care policymakers, and how to go about identifying and quantifying those unmet needs. The objective of this paper is to propose a new way of thinking about unmet need for health care which can in turn guide analysis of unmet need in terms of potential data sources and analytic approaches. Unmet need is shown to be a complex multi-faceted concept that cannot be captured by a single indicator or measurement. To advance the literature in this field, this paper considers what happens to unmet need over time. By introducing a dynamic perspective, three alternative trajectories for health care needs are outlined: non-use of health care, delayed use of health care and sub-optimal use of health care. These trajectories are discussed with a view to improving the focus, and policy applicability, of empirical research in this field.

Ethnicity classification systems for public health surveys: experiences from HIV behavioural surveillance among men who have sex with men	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Ethnicity classification; Public health; Surveillance; Sexual health; Health equity; Race; Racism; Surveys; Men who have sex with men (MSM); New Zealand	NEW-ZEALAND; INTERSECTIONALITY; INFECTION; AUSTRALIA; CANADA; RACE	BackgroundRace and ethnicity classification systems have considerable implications for public health, including the potential to reveal or mask inequities. Given increasing "super-diversity" and multiple racial/ethnic identities in many global settings, especially among younger generations, different ethnicity classification systems can underrepresent population heterogeneity and can misallocate and render invisible Indigenous people and ethnic minorities. We investigated three ethnicity classification methods and their relationship to sample size, socio-demographics and sexual health indicators.MethodsWe examined data from New Zealand's HIV behavioural surveillance programme for men who have sex with men (MSM) in 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2014. Participation was voluntary, anonymous and self-completed; recruitment was via community venues and online. Ethnicity allowed for multiple responses; we investigated three methods of dealing with these: Prioritisation, Single/Combination, and Total Response. Major ethnic groups included Asian, European, indigenous Maori, and Pacific. For each classification method, statistically significant associations with ethnicity for demographic and eight sexual health indicators were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.ResultsOverall, 10,525 MSM provided ethnicity data. Classification methods produced different sample sizes, and there were ethnic disparities for every sexual health indicator. In multivariable analysis, when compared with European MSM, ethnic differences were inconsistent across classification systems for two of the eight sexual health outcomes: Maori MSM were less likely to report regular partner condomless anal intercourse using Prioritisation or Total Response but not Single/Combination, and Pacific MSM were more likely to report an STI diagnosis when using Total Response but not Prioritisation or Single/Combination.ConclusionsDifferent classification approaches alter sample sizes and identification of health inequities. Future research should strive for equal explanatory power of Indigenous and ethnic minority groups and examine additional measures such as socially-assigned ethnicity and experiences of discrimination and racism. These findings have broad implications for surveillance and research that is used to inform public health responses.

J	Zhu, JH; Stone, T; Petrini, M				Zhu, Junhong; Stone, Teresa; Petrini, Marcia			The ethics of refusing to care for patients during the coronavirus pandemic: A Chinese perspective	NURSING INQUIRY			English	Article						China; COVID-19; ethics; health professionals; nursing; pandemic; refuse; value of care	HEALTH; NURSES; SARS	As a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, health professionals are faced with situations they have not previously encountered and are being forced to make difficult ethical decisions. As the first group to experience challenges of caring for patients with coronavirus, Chinese nurses endure heartbreak and face stressful moral dilemmas. In this opinion piece, we examine three related critical questions: Whether society has the right to require health professionals to risk their lives caring for patients; whether health professionals have the right to refuse to care for patients during the coronavirus pandemic; and what obligations there are to protect health professionals? Value of care, community expectations, legal obligations, professional and codes of practice may compel health professionals to put themselves at risks in emergency situations. The bioethical principles of autonomy, justice, beneficence and non-maleficence, as well as public health ethics, guide nurses to justify their decisions as to whether they are entitled to refuse to treat COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. We hope that the open discussion would support the international society in addressing similar ethical challenges in their respective situations during this public health crisis.

Sustainable development principles in US sport management graduate programs	SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Athletic administration; sport leadership; sustainability; sustainable development goals (SDG); education; curriculum	EDUCATION; GLOBALIZATION; PEDAGOGY; PEACE	This study assesses the engagement of academic programs in sport management with global problems by using the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals as a proxy measure of these problems, and gauges the degree to which sport management programs are positioning themselves as providers of knowledge and expertise in the area of sustainable development. To this end, the authors examined the program descriptions, learning outcomes and curricula of 84 graduate programs in sport management or closely related fields at 65 R1 universities in the United States. Using inductive thematic analysis, they identified seven themes that are shared across multiple program curricula. The seven themes were labeled: sport sociology and sport ethics; globalization and economic growth; sport for development and peace; health; climate, environment and sustainability; gender; and inequality, discrimination and social justice. The overall results indicate that the discipline has coalesced around a key set of skills and content areas. This standardization may come at the expense of adaptability and responsiveness to changes in sport and in society. Academic programs are generally unwilling to depart from a twentieth-century model of education built around a supposition that the sport manager's primary responsibilities are revenue generation and liability mitigation. As the unsustainability of late capitalism becomes increasingly difficult to ignore, students and educators will find it correspondingly complicated to reconcile the contradiction between sport-as-business-enterprise and the notion that sport itself can contribute to social or moral development. This long-standing compromising attitude and failure to acknowledge the need for wholesale change will only require much more disruptive and perhaps radical reform in the future. Faced with pressure from various stakeholders, many sport organizations employ sustainability units or departments. Although imperfect, these efforts often exceed those made by academic programs.

J	Jennings, N; Chambaere, K; Deliens, L; Cohen, J				Jennings, Nicholas; Chambaere, Kenneth; Deliens, Luc; Cohen, Joachim			Place of death in a small island state: a death certificate population study	BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE			English	Article						place of death; death certificates; Trinidad and Tobago; palliative care; developing country; public health	PALLIATIVE CARE; END; PREFERENCES; IMPACT; LEVEL; HOME; DIE	Objectives Low/middle-income countries, particularly Small Island Developing States, face many challenges including providing good palliative care and choice in place of care and death, but evidence of the circumstances of dying to inform policy is often lacking. This study explores where people die in Trinidad and Tobago and examines and describes the factors associated with place of death. Methods A population-level analysis of routinely collected death certificate and supplementary health data where the unit of analysis was the recorded death. We followed the Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational Routinely Collected Health Data reporting guidelines, an extension of Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology, on a deidentified data set on decedents (n=10 221) extracted from International Statistical Classification of Diseases version 10 coded death records for the most recent available year, 2010. Results Of all deaths, 55.4% occurred in a government hospital and 29.7% in a private home; 65.3% occurred in people aged 60 years and older. Cardiovascular disease (23.6%), malignancies (15.5%) and diabetes mellitus (14.7%) accounted for over half of all deaths. Dying at home becomes more likely with increasing age (70-89 years (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.10) and 90-highest (OR 3.63, 95% CI 3.08 to 4.27)), and less likely for people with malignancies (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.97), cerebrovascular disease (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.72) and respiratory disease (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91). Conclusion Place of death is influenced by age, sex, race/ethnicity, underlying cause of death and urbanisation. There is inequality between ethnic groups regarding place of care and death; availability, affordability and access to end-of-life care in different settings require attention.

J	Douglas, F; MacIver, E; Yuill, C				Douglas, Flora; MacIver, Emma; Yuill, Chris			A qualitative investigation of lived experiences of long-term health condition management with people who are food insecure	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Household food insecurity; Food poverty; Chronic health conditions; Long-term health conditions; Self-management; Self-care; Support for self-care; Lived experiences; Qualitative research	CRITICAL INTERPRETIVE SYNTHESIS; SELF-MANAGEMENT; MENTAL-HEALTH; BANK USE; UNIVERSAL CREDIT; ADULT PATIENTS; CARE; OUTCOMES; IMPACTS; ASSOCIATION	Background As more people are living with one or more chronic health conditions, supporting patients to become activated, self-managers of their conditions has become a key health policy focus both in the UK and internationally. There is also growing evidence in the UK that those with long term health conditions have an increased risk of being food insecure. While international evidence indicates that food insecurity adversely affects individual's health condition management capability, little is known about how those so affected manage their condition(s) in this context. An investigation of lived experience of health condition management was undertaken with food insecure people living in north east Scotland. The study aimed to explore the challenges facing food insecure people in terms of, i. their self-care condition management practices, and ii. disclosing and discussing the experience of managing their condition with a health care professional, and iii. Notions of the support they might wish to receive from them. Methods Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted with individuals attending a food bank and food pantry in north east Scotland. Interview audio recordings were fully transcribed and thematically analysed. Results Individuals reporting multiple physical and mental health conditions, took part in the study. Four main themes were identified i.e.: 1. food practices, trade-offs and compromises, that relate to economic constraints and lack of choice; 2. illness experiences and food as they relate to physical and mental ill-health; 3. (in) visibility of participants' economic vulnerability within health care consultations; and 4. perceptions and expectations of the health care system. Conclusions This study, the first of its kind in the UK, indicated that participants' health condition management aspirations were undermined by the experience of food insecurity, and that their health care consultations in were, on the whole, devoid of discussions of those challenges. As such, the study indicated practical and ethical implications for health care policy, practice and research associated with the risk of intervention-generated health inequalities that were suggested by this study. Better understanding is needed about the impact of household food insecurity on existing ill health, wellbeing and health care use across the UK.

J	Tittor, A; López, VT				Tittor, Anne; Toledo Lopez, Virginia			Struggling against the consequences of bioethanol production. Narratives of a local environmental justice movement in Cordoba, Argentina	ERDE			English	Article						environmental justice; social movements; Argentina; bioenergy; health		The production of bioenergy and especially of agrofuels is highly contested, both on a local and global scale. While most research has focused on rural areas and sustainability, our case study explores a conflict around bioethanol production within an urban context: the city of Cordoba, Argentina. Describing the emergence and narratives of a local protest movement within the neighbourhood next to the ethanol factory, our article aims to contribute to the debate on the externalities of bioenergy from an environmental justice perspective. The article shows that the struggle against bioethanol production in the neighbourhood emerged as a local environmental justice movement concerned about the uncertainties regarding health risks and the danger of explosions. At the start, the activists did not define themselves as 'environmentalists' or 'ecologists'. This is not an environmentalism of choice, but an environmentalism 'of obligation', starting from their struggle to defend their bodies, health, lives and territory. The authorities ignored their claims, and so, facing sociotechnical controversies, the movement invested huge efforts into critical epidemiology and created alliances with health and science professionals and institutions. Through their struggle, they developed their own narrative, questioning the enterprise's narrative of:green' and 'sustainable' energy. The movement fully developed its own understanding of environmental justice in unison with other environmental and human rights movements in the country.

However, there are inequalities in the procurement of vaccines particularly among US ethnic and racial minority males when compared to the rest of the US population. This study explored the reasons given by adult Mexican-origin males residing in Texas, for obtaining or not, immunizations. This was a cross-sectional, exploratory study with a sample of convenience of 401 adult males (age range 18-79) who were invited to participate in the study while waiting their turn to receive administrative services at the Mexican Consulate in Austin Texas. Data was collected in Spanish with a seven-item multiple choice questionnaire, using electronic tablets. The majority of respondents received their last vaccination longer than 5 years earlier. A higher percentage of individuals in the older age groups received a vaccine in the last year, as opposed to their younger counterparts who obtained their last immunization 3 to 5 years earlier. Among the reasons given for not getting vaccinated were lack of time or money, feared injections and side effects, insufficient information, interest or motivation. Others did not get vaccines because they perceived themselves to be healthy and did not feel sick. Findings from this study have important implications for future preventive medicine and vaccination practices that reach socially excluded groups in times of COVID-19. Recommendations are made to facilitate access to vaccines to the target group of this study and other socially disadvantaged populations in the global health context.	[Snyder, V.

Various forms of health information technology (HIT), such as mobile health and telemedicine, have been used globally to support health care delivery systems. Forms of HIT, developed primarily by men in rich countries, are touted to support all patients and providers. However, while women perform most global health delivery, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), they have less access to technology. Stakeholders have been slow to recognize and resolve conflicts about how technology affects gender disparities, especially in health care. In this paper, we describe, using a social capital framework, how integrating HIT in health systems can empower women in the health care workforce. We conclude with policy recommendations that can support women in the health care workforce through HIT.

As people tend to cooperate on a voluntary basis only with systems they consider fair, it becomes difficult to ensure compliance with public health measures in a context of extreme inequality. Among the major inequalities that need to be addressed we can find major differences in the extensiveness and intensiveness of quarantine experiences, lack of opportunities to participate in common efforts, hardship in complying with disease control recommendations, and an unfair distribution of the cooperative surplus.

This article focuses on five countries in SSA, which are some of the destinations that account for the highest receipt of international remittances. We analyze both aggregate and distributional effects of international remittances on expenditure patterns of households. To investigate the distributional effect of international remittances, we adopt the instrumental variable quantile (IV-quantile) regression framework that allows us to simultaneously address the endogeneity of international remittances and possible heterogeneity in the impact of international remittances on households' expenditure patterns. We instrument for international remittances by using the economic conditions in migrants' countries as an instrument for international remittances. Our results show that the receipt of international remittances increases expenditures on food, durables, education, and health. Using the IV-quantile regression, we find the effects of international remittances on household expenditure on food, durables, education, and health increase across the different expenditure quantiles.

Objective: To assess the gender and geographic diversity of authors among all Cochrane SRs in eyes and vision as compared with a random sample of non-Cochrane SRs of interventions in the field of eyes and vision. Design: The Cochrane Eyes and Vision US Satellite maintains a database of SRs in the field of eyes and vision. We selected all (n = 313) eyes and vision intervention SRs published in The Cochrane Library and a random sample of 313 eyes and vision intervention SRs published elsewhere for this study. We determined gender of the first and corresponding authors ("woman," "man," or "unknown") using a previously developed algorithm and their location based on institution country and the World Health Organization region. Results: From the 626 reviews included in our sample, we identified 751 unique authors who comprised 887 author positions (i.e., first and/or corresponding authors). We were able to ascertain the gender of 647/751 (86%) authors: 276 women and 371 men. Among Cochrane eyes and vision SRs, the proportions of women in first and/or corresponding author positions were consistent and approximately equal to men. Among non-Cochrane eyes and vision SRs, the representation of women was markedly lower as corresponding authors than other positions. Most authors of Cochrane eyes and vision SRs were from the UK (31%) and USA (26%), whereas most authors of non-Cochrane SRs were from China (34%). Conclusions and relevance: Compared with authors of non-Cochrane SRs in eyes and vision, authors of Cochrane SRs appear to have approximately equal representation of women and men among perceived important author positions and be located in European and North American countries, possibly due to the locations of the Cochrane editorial teams. Cochrane Eyes and Vision should continue to recruit authors from around the world in locations that reflect the global burden of eye disease.

It also brings to light multiple ongoing, underlying social crises. The COVID-19 crisis is actively revealing crises of energy sovereignty in at least four ways. First, there are many whose access to basic health services is compromised because of the lack of energy services necessary to provide these services. Second, some people are more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of exposure to environmental pollution associated with energy production. Third, energy services are vital to human wellbeing, yet access to energy services is largely organized as a consumer good. The loss of stable income precipitated by COVID-19 may therefore mean that many lose reliable access to essential energy services. Fourth, the COVID-19 crisis has created a window of opportunity for corporate interests to engage in aggressive pursuit of energy agendas that perpetuate carbon intensive and corporate controlled energy systems, which illuminates the ongoing procedural injustices of energy decision making. These four related crises demonstrate why energy sovereignty is essential for a just energy future. Energy sovereignty is defined as the right for communities, rather than corporate interests, to control access to and decision making regarding the sources, scales, and forms of ownership characterizing access to energy services. Energy sovereignty is a critical component in the design of a post-COVID-19 energy system that is capable of being resilient to future shocks without exacerbating injustices that are killing the most vulnerable among us.

J	Thompson, MS; Cochrane, A; Hopma, J				Thompson, Merisa S.; Cochrane, Alasdair; Hopma, Justa			Democratising food: The case for a deliberative approach	REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Deliberative Democracy; Food Politics; Food Justice; Food Security; Global Food System; Democratisation; Non-Human Animals	SOVEREIGNTY; POLITICS; JUSTICE; DEMOCRACY; SECURITY; MOVEMENTS; LAW	Prevailing political and ethical approaches that have been used to both critique and propose alternatives to the existing food system are lacking. Although food security, food sovereignty, food justice, and food democracy all offer something important to our reflection on the global food system, none is adequate as an alternative to the status quo. This article analyses each in order to identify the prerequisites for such an alternative approach to food governance. These include a focus on goods like nutrition and health, equitable distribution, supporting livelihoods, environmental sustainability, and social justice. However, other goods, like the interests of non-human animals, are not presently represented. Moreover, incorporating all of these goods is incredibly demanding, and some are in tension. This raises the question of how each can be appropriately accommodated and balanced. The article proposes that this ought to be done through deliberative democratic processes that incorporate the interests of all relevant parties at the local, national, regional, and global levels. In other words, the article calls for adeliberativeapproach to thedemocratisationof food. It also proposes that one promising potential for incorporating the interests of all affected parties and addressing power imbalances lies in organising the scope and remit of deliberation aroundfood type.

This study aimed to measure socioeconomic inequality in dental caries experience and to identify determinants of this inequality. Materials and methods Data were obtained from the Ravansar Non-Communicable Diseases (RaNCD) Cohort Study. This cross-sectional analysis included 10,002 adults aged 35-65 years. Caries experience was dichotomised based on the decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) of one-third of the population with the highest caries scores (i.e. significant caries index). Socioeconomic status (SES) was calculated using the principal component analysis. The concentration index (CI) was used to quantify the extent of socioeconomic inequality in dental caries experience. Decomposition analysis was conducted to quantify the contribution of each determinant to the observed inequality. Results The mean DMFT for all individuals was 16.1(SD 9.1). The CI of having significant dental caries was -0.236 (95% CI: -0.0259, -0.213), indicating that having significant dental caries was more concentrated among low-SES individuals. SES (65.6%), age group (24.7%) and female gender (3.7%) were found to have the largest percentage of contributions to the observed inequality in dental caries. Conclusion This study indicates pro-rich inequalities in dental caries experience among middle-aged adults in Iran. The findings highlight the importance of early prevention of dental caries experience before it happens. To mitigate inequalities in dental caries experience, policy interventions should focus on females, older age groups, and low-SES individuals.

J	Lorist, J				Lorist, Jeroen			Engaging African Men through Sexual, Reproductive Health, and Rights Interventions	HUMAN ORGANIZATION			English	Article						masculinities; gender and development; male involvement; global development; sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR); Uganda		This article examines how research and ideas related to so-called positive masculinities have emerged and proliferated among employees of a Dutch development organization, enabling it to establish itself as a frontrunner in engaging men in campaigns to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Arguments draw on organizational ethnography conducted from September 2016 until July 2018 and analysis of discursive practices embedded in documents and training materials that have helped establish men as a new target for intervention. These ideas circulate within a Dutch-funded, globally distributed knowledge network that is for the most part invisible to the African men being targeted. At the same time, the Dutch experts developing these "men engagement" interventions are also largely unaware of how unspoken Dutch norms around gender equality, masculinity, and race are used to legitimize these interventions. This paper emphasizes the importance of considering how donor agendas and donor power work, while at the same time exploring how these elements can, often unconsciously, be inserted into programs, often skewing them in a particular direction.

Past efforts to synthesise research on SBCE interventions identified a need for clear priorities to guide future research. WHO led an exercise to identify global research priorities for SBCE interventions to improve MNCH. Methods We adapted the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative method and combined quantitative and qualitative methods to determine MNCH SBCE intervention research priorities applicable across different contexts. Using online surveys and meetings, researchers and programme experts proposed up to three research priorities and scored the compiled priorities against four criteria - health and social impact, equity, feasibility, and overall importance. Priorities were then ranked by score. A group of 29 experts finalised the top 10 research priorities for each of maternal, newborn or child health and a cross-cutting area. Results A total of 310 experts proposed 867 research priorities, which were consolidated into 444 priorities and scored by 280 experts. Top maternal and newborn health priorities focused on research to improve the delivery of SBCE interventions that strengthen self-care/family care practices and care-seeking behaviour. Child health priorities focused on the delivery of SBCE interventions, emphasising determinants of service utilisation and breastfeeding and nutrition practices. Cross-cutting MNCH priorities highlighted the need for better integration of SBCE into facility-based and community-based health services. Conclusions Achieving global targets for MNCH requires increased investment in SBCE interventions that build capacities of individuals, families and communities as agents of their own health. Findings from this exercise provide guidance to prioritise investments and ensure that they are best directed to achieve global objectives. Stakeholders are encouraged to use these priorities to guide future research investments and to adapt them for country programmes by engaging with national level stakeholders.

Our scholarship program is a bi-directional, 3-month international experiential learning program, including both undergraduate and graduate students, with associated online course focused on community engagement. Students completed a semi-structured narrative report at the conclusion of their funding related to their experience and learning. The Likert questions were analyzed descriptively and student responses to the open-ended questions were utilized for thematic analysis. Also included in this paper is a summary of our lessons learned through program administration. A total of 38 students completed the program between 2016 and 2018, with 95% reporting that they either met or exceeded their goals in the program. Three overarching and inter-related themes emerged in our thematic-analysis of students' narrative reports, includingsuccess through relationships and new perspectives, challenges of the unfamiliar, andpersonal growth through strong emotions. Many students reported personal growth as their greatest success and linked this with new perspectives and awareness of how different contexts shaped their understanding of health issues. Overcoming challenges in their placements contributed to students' confidence in their ability to problem-solve. Overall, students reported value in their experiential learning, which further supports the growing trend to incorporate both experiential learning and formal education in community engagement in public health pedagogy. However, international experiential learning requires considerable financial and human resource commitments to ensure its success.

J	Halvorson, B				Halvorson, Britt			Reassessing Charitable Affect: Volunteerism, Affect, and Ethical Practice in a Medical Aid Agency	ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY			English	Article						Affect; volunteerism; ethical practice; charitable aid; semiosis	ACCOUNTABILITY; COMPASSION; LANGUAGE; POLITICS; STANCE	Charitable aid is sometimes characterized as an activity saturated with emotion, in which outpourings of feeling and care draw individual volunteers to the work (Muehlebach 2012, Adams 2013, Malkki 2015, Caldwell 2017). Yet the affective practice of humanitarian care can take different cultural forms, some of which may not appear deeply affecting. Drawing upon ethnographic research with the long-term US volunteers of a faith-based medical aid organization in Minneapolis/St. Paul, this article develops a linguistically and semiotically informed approach to affect in order to deepen understanding of charitable affect as an actively made experience with cultural variability among long-term charitable volunteers, rather than a singular or stable phenomenon. It argues that affective displays are central to a multifaceted ethical practice through which charitable volunteers seek to demonstrate virtuousness in their ordinary aid activities. The article explores how, within the Minneapolis faith-based organization International Health Mission, volunteer commitment is culturally scaffolded or made socially legible through a combination of conversational exchanges, embodied labor practices, and examples of the ethically disfavored course of action. Applying linguistic and semiotic tools to the analysis of charitable aid illuminates the mechanisms through which affect economies are variously realized, contested, and practiced. Though charitable volunteers may seek to demonstrate a sense of duty or care for other people, the ways they culturally exhibit these complex ethical positions may vary substantially. Charitable work can produce the feeling of participating in a shared social contract, of rectifying the inequalities and failures of the state in some cases. This article concludes that the affect practices central to mobilizing such action may not be the same, nor importantly look the same across charitable endeavors.

Effects of a value-based reimbursement program on patient reported outcome measures	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Reimbursement; Payment; Value-based; Bundled payment; P4P; Incentives; PROM; ODI; EQ-5D	PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE; LOW-BACK-PAIN; HEALTH-CARE; JOINT REPLACEMENT; BUNDLED PAYMENTS; QUALITY; SURGERY; INCENTIVES; FUSION	Background Value-based reimbursement programs have become increasingly common. However, little is known about the effect of such programs on patient reported outcomes.Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of introducing a value-based reimbursement program on patient reported outcome measures and to explore whether a selection bias towards less complicated patients occurred. Methods This is a retrospective observational study with a before and after design based on the introduction of a value-based reimbursement program in Region Stockholm, Sweden. We analyzed patient level data from inpatient and outpatient care of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery during 2006-2015. Patient reported outcome measures used was Global Assessment, EQ-5D-3L and Oswestry Disability Index. The case-mix of surgically treated patients was analyzed using medical and socioeconomic factors. Results The value-based reimbursement program did not have any effect on targeted or non-targeted patient reported outcome measures. Moreover, the share of surgically treated patients with risk factors such as having comorbidities and being born outside of Europe increased after the introduction. Hence, the value-based reimbursement program did not encourage discrimination against sicker patients. However, the income was higher among patients surgically treated after the introduction of the value-based reimbursement. This indicates that a value-based reimbursement program may contribute to increased inequalities in access to healthcare. Conclusions The value-based reimbursement program did not have any effect on patient reported outcome measures.

J	Creutzig, F				Creutzig, Felix			Limits to Liberalism: Considerations for the Anthropocene	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article							LAND-USE CHANGE; HEALTH; TIME; GLOBALIZATION; FAMILY; GROWTH; DEATH	Modern liberal societies appear ill-prepared to meet the paramount challenges of the Anthropocene. While liberalism has been the winning modern ideology since 1990, dominating both political and economic institutions in most countries worldwide, it has been forced onto the defensive. This is shown symptomatically by the international ascent of the extreme right, and substantially by its inability to address rising inequality and to sustain planetary health, which is understood to keep earth system processes within planetary boundaries. Here, I critique liberalism 1) on its core assumption: autonomy of the individual, 2) on its shaky empirical grounds: rational choice model, and 3) on its track record: ambiguous impact on individual and social well-being and destabilization of the earth. The focus of this critique is economic neoliberalism, and the reductionist role assigned to individuals, an ideology that was never well founded in philosophy but nonetheless remains prevalent in political action. While modern political liberalism is mostly immune to this critique, I maintain that on its own it remains inadequate to counter the global challenges we face. Instead, a broader understanding of human behavior, and a contextualization of the individual in social and environmental settings, will underpin efforts to support planetary health.

Socially determined cervical cancer care navigation: An effective step toward health care equity and care optimization	CANCER			English	Article						cancer care navigation; cervical cancer; patient navigation; socially determined care; underserved	PATIENT NAVIGATION; TREATMENT PROLONGATION; TREATMENT TIME; WOMEN; ADHERENCE; BREAST; BRACHYTHERAPY; CARCINOMA; IMPACT; STATE	Background Despite being the standard of care for patients with locoregional cervical cancer, many patients do not complete all components of primary chemoradiotherapy (pCRT): external beam radiotherapy, chemosensitization, and brachytherapy. Incomplete or protracted pCRT is associated with worse survival. The authors implemented a socially determined cervical cancer care navigation program at a public safety-net hospital to improve treatment adherence. Methods Patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB1 to IVA cervical cancer who underwent pCRT from 2012 to 2016 were prospectively enrolled into this navigation program spanning the medical, financial, and psychosocial aspects of care. This patient cohort was compared with a similar cohort of consecutive nonnavigated patients who were treated from 1998 to 2008. Patient characteristics, treatment data, and patient outcomes were collected. A database of navigation encounters was maintained prospectively. Results A total of 46 patients composed the navigated cohort and 85 patients composed the nonnavigated cohort. After implementation of the cervical cancer care navigation program, the percentage of patients receiving >= 5 cycles of weekly cisplatin increased from 74% to 93% (P < .01) and rates of the initiation of brachytherapy during external beam radiotherapy increased from 49% to 78% (P < .01). The median treatment time was reduced from 67 days in the nonnavigated patients to 55 days in the navigated patients (P < .01). Approximately 95% of navigated patients who completed pCRT did so within 63 days, compared with 52% of nonnavigated patients (P < .01). Treatment completion within 63 days was associated with significantly improved overall survival. Conclusions Socially informed cervical cancer care navigation can significantly improve the timeliness of guideline-based care, enhance access to resources for underserved minority patients receiving pCRT, and may improve overall patient outcomes.

J	Mladovsky, P				Mladovsky, Philipa			Fragmentation by design: Universal health coverage policies as governmentality in Senegal	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Universal health coverage; Africa; Senegal; Health systems; Fragmentation; Governmentality; Citizenship; Older people	REMOVING USER FEES; GLOBAL HEALTH; INSURANCE; NEOLIBERALISM; ENROLLMENT; LESSONS; AFRICA; PEOPLE; CARE	There is increasing international consensus that countries need to reduce health system fragmentation in order to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). Yet there is little agreement on what drives fragmentation, in particular the extent to which fragmentation has a political purpose. This study analyses a highly fragmented health financing system through a UHC policy that aims to remove user fees for people aged 60 and over in Senegal. 53 semi-structured interviews (SSIs) and focus group discussions with the target population were conducted in four regions in Senegal over a period of six months during 2012. A further 46 SSIs were conducted with key informants at the national level and in each of the four regions. By analysing explanations of the successes and failures of policies, an understanding of power relations in state institutions, communities and individuals is gained. The concept of governmentality is used to interpret the results. The interviewees' main concern was to implement or resist various techniques of control over the conduct of bureaucrats, health workers, patients and the wider population. These techniques included numeracy and calculation, referral letters, ID cards, data collection, new prudentialism, active citizenship and ethical self-formation through affinities of the community. The techniques sought to make two types of subjects; citizens subjects of rights and obligations; and autonomous subjects of choice and self-identity. A key implication is that in Senegal, and perhaps elsewhere, fragmentation of the health system plays a key role in the formation and control of subjects, in the name of "freedom". As such, fragmentation may be an inherent feature of UHC. Interventions that aim to reduce fragmentation based on evidence of its inefficiency, inequity and ineffectiveness in reducing poverty and ill health may be missing this point.

Empirical evidence on contagion in health care fraud	MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS			English	Article							CORRUPTION; SECTOR; ABUSE; US	This paper examines the presence of contagion in health care fraud across jurisdictional boundaries. Using state-level data for the United States, we find evidence of contagion in medical fraud. There are also spillovers from border corruption on medical fraud, but no evidence of spillovers from international borders. In other findings, greater urbanization, greater elderly population, and higher hospital occupancy positively contribute to medical fraud, while nursing employment has a mitigating effect. Further, it is economic inequality rather than economic prosperity that seems relevant. The main findings are robust to consideration of simultaneity, but dependent upon the prevalence of fraud across states.

J	Stoddart, R; Simpson, P; Haire, B				Stoddart, Rohanna; Simpson, Paul; Haire, Bridget			Medical advocacy in the face of Australian immigration practices: A study of medical professionals defending the health rights of detained refugees and asylum seekers	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MENTAL-HEALTH; DUAL LOYALTIES; SEEKING ASYLUM; DETENTION; CARE; CHALLENGES; COMPLICITY; PROTECTION; CURRICULUM; TEMPORARY	While medical advocacy is mandated as a core professional commitment in a growing number of ethical codes and medical training programs, medical advocacy and social justice engagement are regularly subordinated to traditional clinical responsibilities. This study aims to provide insight into factors that motivate clinician engagement and perseverance with medical advocacy, so as to inform attempts by policymakers, leaders and educators to promote advocacy practices in medicine. Furthermore, this study aims to provide an analysis of the role of medical advocates in systems where patients' rights are perceived to be infringed and consider how we might best support and protect these medical advocates as a profession, by exploring the experiences and perspectives of Australian clinicians defending the health of detained asylum seekers. In this qualitative study thirty-two medical and health professionals advocating on asylum seeker health in immigration detention were interviewed. Transcripts were coded both inductively and deductively from interview question domains and thematically analysed. Findings suggested that respondents' motivations for advocacy stemmed from deeply intertwined professional and personal ethics. Overall, advocacy responses originated from the union of three integral stimuli: personal ethics, proximity and readiness. We conclude that each of these three integral factors must be addressed in any attempt to foster advocacy within the medical profession. In light of current global trends of increasingly protectionist immigration practices, promoting effective physician advocacy may become essential in ensuring patients' universal right to health.

There has been increased recognition in the urban sanitation sector that in rapidly growing cities, there is unlikely to be a single centralized sanitation solution which can effectively deliver services to all demographics, and that heterogeneous approaches to urban sanitation are required. At the same time, due to competing investment priorities, there is a greater focus on the need for sanitation investments to address multiple objectives. However, calls for more informed sanitation planning and a more dynamic and disaggregated approach to the delivery and management of sanitation services have had limited impacts. This is in part due to the complexity of the drivers for sanitation investment, and the difficulties involved in identifying and addressing these multiple, often conflicting, goals. This paper examines three potential drivers of citywide sanitation decision-making - public health, sustainability and economic performance - via the three proxies of contamination, climate change and costs. It examines the importance of each driver and proxies, how they are considered in investment decisions, the current state of knowledge about them, and priority aspects to be included in decisions. At present, while public health is a common driver for improving sanitation, there are significant gaps in our understanding of fecal contamination spread and exposure, and how to select sanitation solutions which can best address them. Climate change is sometimes seen as a low priority for the sanitation sector given the immediacy and scale of existing challenges and the uncertainty of future climate predictions. However, potential risks are significant, and uninformed decisions may result in greater costs and increased inequalities. Cost data are sparse and unreliable, and it is challenging to build robust cost-effectiveness analyses. Yet these are needed to compare citywide options based on least-cost over their full life cycle. This paper provides insights into how existing evidence on contamination, climate change and costs can inform decisions on sanitation investments and help chart a sustainable way forward for achieving citywide services.

The data was extracted from the Report Cards on Physical Activity for Children and Youth from the 49 countries that participated in the Global Matrix 3.0 initiative. Descriptive statistics and a latent profile analysis with active transportation, Human Development Index and Gini index as latent variables were conducted. The global average grade was a "C", indicating that countries are succeeding with about half of children and youth (47-53%). There is wide variability in the prevalence and in the definition of active transportation globally. Three different profiles of countries were identified based on active transportation grades, Human Development Index (HDI) and income inequalities. The first profile grouped very high HDI countries with low prevalence of active transport and low inequalities. The second profile grouped low and middle HDI countries with high prevalence of active transportation and higher inequalities. And the third profile was characterized by the relatively high prevalence of active transportation and more variability in the socioeconomic variables. Promising policies from countries under each profile were identified. A unified definition of active transportation and contextualized methods for its assessment are needed to advance in surveillance and practice.

LGBTQ plus Inclusive Palliative Care in the Context of COVID-19: Pragmatic Recommendations for Clinicians	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						LGBTQ; LGBT; CO VID-19; palliative care	SEXUAL ORIENTATION; LIFE CARE; GAY; EXPERIENCES; BEREAVEMENT; LESBIANS; PEOPLE; END	As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact the seriously ill and their families on a global scale, considerations given to marginalized groups amid the pandemic are essential to ensure the provision of high-quality and dignified care. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender-nonconforming and queer/questioning-identified (LGBTQ+) persons are particularly vulnerable to health inequities across settings, including palliative care and at the end of life. There is a crucial gap in the literature pertaining to palliative care for LGBTQ+ populations during COVID-19. We aim to fill this gap by providing essential health inequity and social support background pertaining to LGBTQ+ persons and practical recommendations for immediate implementation that support inclusive and respectful care for these populations. Using these recommendations is a pragmatic pathway to promote trust, transparency, patient and family engagement, and value concordant care amid the health system strain caused by COVID-19.

J	Lindström, M				Lindstrom, Martin			Populism and health inequality in high-income countries	SSM-POPULATION HEALTH			English	Article						Public health; Health inequality; Populism; Political bias; Commission on social determinants of health; Socioeconomic status; Inequity; Sweden	LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES CHALLENGES; POST-TRUTH POPULISM; SOCIAL DETERMINANTS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; RISE	The rise of populist parties and movements in general and right-wing populist parties in particular has been noted also in the public health literature. While economic and other factors behind the populist surge have been systematically analyzed in the political and social science literature, the understanding of this political phenomenon seems weak in important parts of the public health literature. The lack of analysis of economic effects on health inequity of immigration of people with low levels of work skills to many high-income countries is given with the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health report as an example. Public health scholars should be able to fully analyze all effects on health inequity within countries. Public health scholars and professionals may lose credibility if they do not fully assess all relevant determinants, and the investigation of health inequity within countries should consider all systemic roots. Health inequity between countries is a crucial issue and should be addressed through international cooperation between countries, regions and international organizations. The approach from political science and social science should be adopted.

Considering specific population subgroups to examine prevalence and socioeconomic inequalities in T2D is rare. Moreover, using one indicator to depict socioeconomic inequalities in health is a common practice despite evidence on differences in what different socioeconomic indicators ought to measure. This study has two aims: 1. Examine the prevalence of T2D in employed individuals, nonworking spouses and pensioners. 2. Examine socioeconomic inequalities in T2D in the three population subgroups and determine the explanatory power of income, education and occupation in employed individuals and nonworking spouses. This study is based on claims data from a statutory health insurance provider in Lower Saxony, Germany. T2D prevalence in the period between 2013 and 2017 was examined in employed individuals, nonworking spouses and pensioners. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to examine socioeconomic inequalities in T2D in the three population subgroups. Explanatory power of the three socioeconomic indicators was determined by deviance analysis. Results showed that T2D prevalence was four times higher in male nonworking spouses (24.2%) and 2.6 times higher in female nonworking spouses (12.7%) compared to employed men (6.4%) and women (4.7%) respectively, while it accounted for 40% of men and 36% of women in pensioners. T2D inequalities emerged for all three socioeconomic indicators and were observed in the three subgroups. School education had the highest explanatory power in employed men and women and male nonworking spouses. Nonworking spouses are an important target group in T2D prevention interventions. The three socioeconomic indicators have independent effects and differ in their explanatory power where low school education appears to be a major risk factor. It can be discussed that health literacy and the associated health behavior play a role in mediating the association between school education and T2D.

J	van Grunsven, J				van Grunsven, Janna			Perceptual breakdown during a global pandemic: introducing phenomenological insights for digital mental health purposes	ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Digital mental health; Loss of perceptual world-familiarity; COVID-19 pandemic; Phenomenology; Well-being; Affordances; Ego-depletion; Online therapy; Social interaction technologies		Online therapy sessions and other forms of digital mental health services (DMH) have seen a sharp spike in new users since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Having little access to their social networks and support systems, people have had to turn to digital tools and spaces to cope with their experiences of anxiety and loss. With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, many of us are likely to remain reliant upon DMH for the foreseeable future. As such, it is important to articulate some of the specific ways in which the pandemic is affecting our self and world-relation, such that we can identify how DMH services are best able to accommodate some of the newly emerging needs of their users. In this paper I will identify a specific type of loss brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and present it as an important concept for DMH. I refer to this loss asloss of perceptual world-familiarity.Loss of perceptual world-familiarity entails a breakdown in the ongoing effortless responsiveness to our perceptual environment that characterizes much of our everyday lives. To cash this out I will turn to insights from the phenomenological tradition. Initially, my project is descriptive. I aim to bring out how loss of perceptual world-familiarity is a distinctive form of loss that is deeply pervasive yet easily overlooked-hence the relevance of explicating it for DMH purposes. But I will also venture into the space of the normative, offering some reasons for seeing perceptual world-familiarity as a component of well-being. I conclude the paper with a discussion of how loss of perceptual world-familiarity affects the therapeutic setting now that most if not all therapeutic interactions have transitioned to online spaces and I explore the potential to augment these spaces with social interaction technologies. Throughout, my discussion aims to do justice to the reality that perceptual world-familiarity is not an evenly distributed phenomenon, that factors like disability, gender and race affect its robustness, and that this ought to be reckoned with when seeking to incorporate the phenomenon into or mitigate it through DMH services.

Associations of Sociodemographic Factors and Psychiatric Disorders With Type of School-Based Mental Health Services Received by Youth	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH			English	Article						Schools; Mental health; Services; Adolescence; Disparities; Inequities; Race/ethnicity	STUDENTS; ADOLESCENTS; DIAGNOSES; DISABILITIES; CONCORDANCE; VALIDATION; PREDICTORS; CHILDREN; PROGRESS; VERSION	Purpose: Schools provide access to mental health services for traditionally underserved youth. However, there is variability in the types of school-based services students receive (e.g., school counseling, services in separate classrooms, or schools serving students with psychiatric disorders). Prior research has typically not distinguished among these different types of school-based services. The present study examines sociodemographic characteristics and disorders associated with the types of services received in schools. Methods: Data were analyzed from a sample of adolescenteparent pairs in the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement who received school mental health services (N = 1,204). DSM-IV diagnoses were based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview administered to adolescents and questionnaires self-administered to parents. Adolescents (aged 13-18 years) and parents also responded to questions about lifetime school-based mental health service receipt. Results: Among those receiving school-based mental health services, almost one-third (29.7%) received services in a separate classroom and almost one-fourth (22.3%) in a separate school. Increased likelihood of lifetime placement in a separate classroom or school was detected among older youth, males, blacks, Latinos, youth with learning disabilities, those whose parents had fewer years of education, and those who received community-based mental health services. Oppositional defiant disorder was associated with increased lifetime placement in a separate school. Conclusions: The results advance the evidence base by indicating that racial/ethnic minority youth and those whose parents have fewer years of education were more likely to receive school-based mental health services in separate settings. These results provide more context to studies of school-based mental health service receipt. (C) 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

Method Dispositional optimism and possible correlates were assessed across 61 countries (N = 15,185; mean age = 21.92; 77% female). Mean-level differences in optimism were computed along with their relationships with individual and country-level variables. Results Worldwide, mean optimism levels were above the midpoint of the scale. Perhaps surprisingly, country-level optimism was negatively related to gross domestic product per capita, population density, and democratic norms and positively related to income inequality and perceived corruption. However, country-level optimism was positively related to projected economic improvement. Individual-level optimism was positively related to individual well-being within every country, although this relationship was less strong in countries with challenging economic and social circumstances. Conclusions While individuals around the world are generally optimistic, societal characteristics appear to affect the degree to which their optimism is associated with psychological well-being, sometimes in seemingly anomalous ways.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						social determinants of health; health promotion; health policy	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; INEQUALITIES	Twelve years have now passed since the influential WHO Report on the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) in 2008. A group of senior international public health scholars and decision-makers met in Italy in mid-2019 to review the legacy of the SDoH conceptual framework and its adequacy for the many challenges facing our field as we enter the 2020s. Four major categories of challenges were identified: emerging "exogenous" challenges to global health equity, challenges related to weak policy and practice implementation, more fundamental challenges related to SDoH theory and research, and broader issues around modern research in general. Each of these categories is discussed, and potential solutions offered. We conclude that although the SDoH framework is still a worthy core platform for public health research, policy, and practice, the time is ripe for significant evolution.

This study aimed to explore both spatial and temporal heterogeneous impacts of various socioeconomic and environmental factors on healthcare resource inequalities at a fine-scale administrative county level. We collected data on county-level hospital beds per ten thousand people to represent healthcare resources, as well as data on 32 candidate socioeconomic and environmental covariates in southwest China from 2002 to 2011. We innovatively employed a cutting-edge local spatiotemporal regression, namely, a Bayesian spatiotemporally varying coefficients (STVC) model, to simultaneously detect spatial and temporal autocorrelated nonstationarity in healthcare-covariate relationships via estimating posterior space-coefficients (SC) within each county, as well as time-coefficients (TC) over ten years. Our findings reported that in addition to socioeconomic factors, environmental factors also had significant impacts on healthcare resources inequalities at both global and local space-time scales. Globally, the personal economy was identified as the most significant explanatory factor. However, the temporal impacts of personal economy demonstrated a gradual decline, while the impacts of the regional economy and government investment showed a constant growth from 2002 to 2011. Spatially, geographical clustered regions for both hospital bed distributions and various hospital bed-covariates relationships were detected. Finally, the first spatiotemporal series of complete county-level hospital bed inequality maps in southwest China was produced. This work is expected to provide evidence-based implications for future policy making procedures to improve healthcare equalities from a spatiotemporal perspective. The employed Bayesian STVC model provides frontier insights into investigating spatiotemporal heterogeneous variables relationships embedded in broader areas such as public health, environment, and earth sciences.

First, it examines the world's proportionately most destructive pandemic as coterminous with the rise of imperialism. Next, it traces how the impetus for international health cooperation based on regional crises predated and informed efforts elsewhere. Finally, it explores two under-charted narratives: the creative harnessing of data produced under adversity, and alternative health solidarities that bypass reigning hierarchies of "humanitarian" aid. Together, these glimpses underscore a fundamental need for incorporating histories of and from Latin America to overcome the "history-telling injustice" created by the centuries-long Western dismissal of knowledge, practices, experiences, and existential meaning generated in the Global South. In short, these accounts provide a more complex and possibility-filled restructuring of dominant narratives around the diverse trajectories and consequences, as well as varieties of resistance, that shape understandings of pandemics.

There is evidence of disparities in the uptake of ANC services, however, little is known about both the socio-economic and geographic-based disparity in the use of ANC services in Angola. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of socio-economic, urban-rural and subnational inequality in ANC coverage in Angola. Methods We analyzed data from the 2015 Angola Demographic and Health Survey (ADHS) using the World Health Organization (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software. The analysis consisted of disaggregated ANC coverage rates using four equity stratifiers (economic status, education, residence, and region) and four summary measures (Difference, Population Attributable Risk, Ratio and Population Attributable Fraction). To measure statistical significance, an uncertainty interval (UI) of 95% was constructed around point estimates. Results The study showed both absolute and relative inequalities in coverage of ANC services in Angola. More specifically, inequality favored women who were rich (D = 54.2, 95% UI; 49.59, 58.70, PAF = 43.5, 95% UI; 40.12, 46.92), educated (PAR = 19.9, 95% UI; 18.14, 21.64,R = 2.14, 95% UI; 1.96, 2.32), living in regions such as Luanda (D = 51.7, 95% UI; 43.56, 59.85,R = 2.64, 95% UI; 2.01, 3.26) and residing in urban dwellings (PAF = 20, 95% UI; 17.70, 22.38, PAR = 12.3, 95% UI; 10.88, 13.75). Conclusion The uptake of ANC services were lower among poor, uneducated, and rural residents as well as women from the Cuanza Sul region. Government policy makers must consider vulnerable subpopulations when designing needed interventions to improve ANC coverage in Angola to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal of reducing global maternal mortality ratio to 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.

The objective of this study is to identify the school social climate factors that affect secondary school students' academic performance in mathematics via a multilevel analysis. The model revealed the following factors: Disciplinary Measures, School Violence, Teacher-Student Violence and Encouragement of Classroom Participation. It revealed the teacher's role in modelling and setting behaviour rules based on respect, equity, justice and inclusion. From this perspective, managing discipline and developing social-emotional competences in associated issues like coping, classroom management, mediation, conflict resolution and positive disciplinary measures should be included in pre-service and in-service teacher training.

There is increased interest in utilizing geographically-disaggregated data to estimate sub-national deworming coverage and equity, as well as gender parity. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) offer a potential source of sub-national data. This study aimed to compare deworming coverage routinely reported to WHO and estimated by DHS in pre-school aged children to inform global STH measurement and evaluation. Methodology We compared sub-national deworming coverage in pre-school aged children reported to WHO and estimated by DHS aligned geospatially and temporally. We included data from Burundi (2016-2017), Myanmar (2015-2016), and the Philippines (2017) based on data availability. WHO provided data on the date and sub-national coverage per mass drug administration reported by Ministries of Health. DHS included maternally-reported deworming status within the past 6 months for each child surveyed. We estimated differences in sub-national deworming coverage using WHO and DHS data, and performed sensitivity analyses. Principal findings We compared data on pre-school aged children from 13 of 18 districts in Burundi (N = 6,835 in DHS), 11 of 15 districts in Myanmar (N = 1,462 in DHS) and 16 of 17 districts in the Philippines (N = 7,594 in DHS) following data exclusion. The national deworming coverages estimated by DHS in Burundi, Myanmar, and the Philippines were 75.5% (95% CI: 73.7%-77.7%), 47.0% (95% CI: 42.7%-51.3%), and 48.0% (95% CI: 46.0%-50.0%), respectively. The national deworming coverages reported by WHO in Burundi, Myanmar, and the Philippines were 80.1%, 93.6% and 75.7%, respectively. The mean absolute differences in district-level coverage reported to WHO and estimated by DHS in Burundi, Myanmar, and the Philippines were 9.5%, 41.5%, and 24.6%, respectively. Across countries, coverage reported to WHO was frequently higher than DHS estimates (32 of 40 districts). National deworming coverage from DHS estimates were similar by gender within countries. Conclusions and significance Agreement of deworming coverage reported to WHO and estimated by DHS data was heterogeneous across countries, varying from broadly compatible in Burundi to largely discrepant in Myanmar. DHS data could complement deworming data reported to WHO to improve data monitoring practices and serve as an independent sub-national source of coverage data. Author summary Soil-transmitted helminths are parasitic worms that infect an estimated 1 billion people globally, primarily in low- and middle-income countries. One of the main strategies to reduce the prevalence of these parasitic infections is through preventive chemotherapy-the periodic widespread treatment of an entire at-risk population (e.g. children) with albendazole or mebendazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) tracks the progress of mass deworming programs by estimating the national coverage of these programs through aggregation of local health district program reports, which represent the proportion of at-risk people in a country that are reported to have received deworming treatment. In this study, we used an alternative source of data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) that provides maternally-reported child deworming treatment to estimate coverage in pre-school aged children and was subsequently compared to data reported to WHO. We conducted this comparison of deworming coverage at a sub-national level for three countries with available data: Burundi, Myanmar, and the Philippines. Coverage reported to WHO and estimated by DHS were broadly consistent in Burundi, highly discrepant in Myanmar, and varied in agreement for the Philippines. These differences may be explained by variability in the medication distribution monitoring practices, quality of national validation systems, and mis-reporting due to albendazole receipt through non-STH related public health campaigns (e.g. lymphatic filariasis treatment). This analysis suggests that in specific settings, DHS data can complement deworming coverage data reported to WHO, serving as an independent source of high-resolution data to improve monitoring and evaluation of deworming programs globally.

Objective To examine the association of race, ethnicity, and SES with UM treatment and survival. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective cohort analysis of 28% of the US population using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registries from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2014, was conducted. Data analysis was performed from April to July 2018. SEER identified 4475 individuals using International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition site and morphology codes. Exposures Race, ethnicity, and SES estimated by tertile using Yost Index composite scores. Main Outcomes and Measures Treatment odds ratios (ORs), 1-year and 5-year survival estimates, mortality hazard ratios (HRs), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Hypothesis was formulated before data collection. Results Multivariate analyses of 4475 individuals (2315 [51.7%] men; non-Hispanic white, 4130 [92.3%]; nonwhite, 345 [7.7%]) showed that patients who were nonwhite (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.12-1.88) and socioeconomically disadvantaged (lower SES: OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.82-2.68; middle SES: OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.56-2.21) were more likely to receive primary enucleation. No interactions were observed between race/ethnicity, SES, and stage at diagnosis. From 2004 to 2014, rates of primary enucleation decreased across all racial/ethnic and SES groups, but disparities persisted. Socioeconomically disadvantaged patients had lower 5-year all-cause survival rates (lower SES: 69.2%; middle SES: 68.1%; and upper SES: 73.8%), although disease-specific survival did not vary significantly by racial/ethnic or SES strata. Mortality risk was associated with older age at diagnosis (56-68 years: HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44-2.01; >= 69 years: HR, 3.32; 95% CI, 2.85-3.86), advanced stage of UM (stage 2: HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.19-1.65; stage 3: HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.87-2.73; and stage 4: HR, 10.09; 95% CI, 7.39-13.77), and treatment with primary enucleation (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.88-2.44) with no racial/ethnic or SES variation. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, SEER data from 2004 to 2014 suggest that nonwhite and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients with UM are more likely to be treated with primary enucleation, although no such variation appears to exist in disease-specific survival. These differences reveal opportunities to address issues regarding treatment choice in UM. Question Is race/ethnicity or lower socioeconomic status in patients with uveal melanoma associated with increased odds of primary enucleation or decreased survival? Findings This cohort study of 4475 patients with uveal melanoma from 2004 to 2014 found that patients who are nonwhite and socioeconomically disadvantaged are more likely to receive primary enucleation despite disease stage at presentation. There appear to be no racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic differences in disease-specific survival. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic status disparities are present in uveal melanoma treatment and survival; further research is needed to elucidate the sources of these disparities. This cohort study evaluates the association of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status with treatment and survival in patients with uveal melanoma.

J	Karaye, IM; Horney, JA				Karaye, Ibraheem M.; Horney, Jennifer A.			The Impact of Social Vulnerability on COVID-19 in the US: An Analysis of Spatially Varying Relationships	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							OIL-SPILL; HEALTH; POPULATIONS; RISK	Introduction: Because of their inability to access adequate medical care, transportation, and nutrition, socially vulnerable populations are at an increased risk of health challenges during disasters. This study estimates the association between case counts of COVID-19 infection and social vulnerability in the U.S., identifying counties at increased vulnerability to the pandemic. Methods: Using Social Vulnerability Index and COVID-19 case count data, an ordinary least squares regression model was fitted to assess the global relationship between COVID-19 case counts and social vulnerability. Local relationships were assessed using a geographically weighted regression model, which is effective in exploring spatial nonstationarity. Results: As of May 12, 2020, a total of 1,320,909 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. Of the counties included in this study (91.5%, 2,844 of 3,108), the highest case count was recorded in Trousdale, Tennessee (16,525.22 per 100,000) and the lowest in Tehama, California (1.54 per 100,000). At the global level, overall Social Vulnerability Index (e(beta) =1.65, p=0.03) and minority status and language (e(beta) =6.69, p<0.001) were associated with increased COVID-19 case counts. However, on the basis of the local geographically weighted model, the association between social vulnerability and COVID-19 varied among counties. Overall, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: Large-scale disasters differentially affect the health of marginalized communities. In this study, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. Addressing the social factors that create poor health is essential to reducing inequities in the health impacts of disasters.

National governments and international organizations are increasingly considering medical imaging and nuclear medicine access data in strategies to address epidemiologic priorities. Our objective here was to develop a statistical model to assist countries in estimating their needs for PET-CT systems for the management of specific cancer types. Material/Methods: We introduce a patient-centered statistical model based on country-specific epidemiological data, PET-CT performance, and evidence-based clinical guidelines for PET-CT use for cancer. The output of the model was integrated into a Bayesian model to rank countries or world regions that would benefit the most from upscaling PET-CT scanners. Results: We applied our model to the IMAGINE database, recently developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Our model indicates that at least 96 countries should upscale their PET-CT services and more than 200 additional PET-CT scanners would be required to fulfill their needs. The model also provides quantitative evidence indicating that low-income countries would benefit the most from increasing PET-CT provision. Finally, we discuss several cases in which the standard unit [number of scanners]/[million inhabitants] to guide strategic planning or address inequities is misleading. Conclusions: Our model may help in the accurate delineation and further reduction of global inequities in access to PET-CT scanners. As a template, the model also has the potential to estimate the costs and socioeconomic impact of implementing any medical imaging modality for any clinical application.

The global crisis presents an opportunity to cement archaeological practice in a foundation of community building. We can learn from the ancestors,razana, how investing in community-social networks at different scales-makes us more resilient to crises. In so doing, we can improve the quality and equity of the science we produce and ensure relevant outcomes for living communities and future generations.

J	Herrick, C; Bell, K				Herrick, Clare; Bell, Kirsten			Concepts, disciplines and politics: on 'structural violence' and the 'social determinants of health'	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Social determinants of health; structural violence; health inequalities; disciplinarity; terminology; global health	INEQUALITY	It has long been recognised that human health is indelibly shaped by a variety of factors. These include pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, but also broad-ranging social, economic and political forces operating at different spatial scales. In seeking to understand the nature and effects of these forces, two concepts have become particularly influential: the 'social determinants of health' and 'structural violence'. In this paper, we critically examine their origins, tracing their 'prehistory' and little-recognised intersections, based on searches of both concepts in PubMed and Google Scholar, and a critical reading of the range of texts our searches produced. This forms the groundwork from which we examine their similarities and differences, and their potentialities and limitations. We demonstrate that both concepts operate largely as black boxes. Their usage has thus become tied to disciplinary and methodological projects, with attendant implications for their wider usage - especially given the respective statuses of the fields of medical anthropology and social epidemiology in public health. We conclude that structural violence and the social determinants of health have both been influential in research and policy, but have struggled to effect the kinds of political change that their moral commitment to social justice promises and that further dialogue between them is required.

J	Mialon, M				Mialon, Melissa			An overview of the commercial determinants of health	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Review						Commercial determinants of health; Corporate political activity; Industry; Public health; Non-communicable diseases	CORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITY; ULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ALCOHOL INDUSTRY; TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS; BIG TOBACCO; CONSUMPTION; PREVENTION; DISEASES; CAPTURE	Background Different terms are described in the literature that refer to commercial determinants as drivers of ill-health. The aim of the present review was to provide an overview of the commercial determinants of health, through a review of the literature on this subject. The review was conducted in December 2019 and updated in February 2020. Searches were conducted from peer-reviewed scientific articles, commentaries, books, and books chapters, with no restriction in their publication dates and languages. Main body The commercial determinants of health cover three areas. First, they relate to unhealthy commodities that are contributing to ill-health. Secondly, they include business, market and political practices that are harmful to health and used to sell these commodities and secure a favourable policy environment. Finally, they include the global drivers of ill-health, such as market-driven economies and globalisation, that have facilitated the use of such harmful practices. Short conclusion The discussion on the commercial determinants of health offers a unique opportunity to shift the dominant paradigm in public health, where individual behaviours are considered to be driven by inadequate environments. Ill-health, damages to the environment, and health and social inequalities, might be better understood through a commercial determinant lens.

J	Huang, R; Ghose, B; Tang, SF				Huang, Rui; Ghose, Bishwajit; Tang, Shangfeng			Effect of financial stress on self-rereported health and quality of life among older adults in five developing countries: a cross sectional analysis of WHO-SAGE survey	BMC GERIATRICS			English	Article						Financial stress; Subjective health; Quality of life; Older adults; WHO-SAGE study	POPULATION; CARE; SATISFACTION; DEPRESSION; VALIDITY; PROFILE; BURDEN	In developing countries, older adults (65 years of age and above) share an increased vulnerability to catastrophic health expenditures and financial stress which can have significant bearing on their health and well-being. Currently, research evidence on how financial stress correlates with health and well-being among older adults in the developing countries is limited. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between financial stress and subjective 1) health, 2) depression, 3) quality of life, and 4) life satisfaction among older adults in five developing countries. Methods Data used in this study were cross-sectional which were collected from the first wave of Study on Global AGEing and Health (SAGE) survey of World Health Organization. Sample population were 12,299 community dwelling men and women in China (n = 4548), Ghana (n = 1968), India (n = 2441), South Africa (n = 1924), and Russia (n = 1418). Using generalized linear models with logit links, we assessed the correlation between self-reported financial stress and income inequality with the four outcome measures by adjusting for various sociodemographic factors. Results Overall, the prevalence of good self-reported health, quality of life and positive life-satisfaction was 47.11, 79.25 and 44.40% respectively, while 20.13% of the participants reported having depression during past 12 months. Only about a fifth (18.67%) of the participants reported having enough money to meet daily their necessities completely, while more than quarter (28.45%) were in the lowest income quintile. With a few exceptions, the odds of reporting good self-reported health, quality of life, and life satisfaction were generally lower among those with varying degrees of financial stress, and larger among those in the higher income quintiles. Conversely, the likelihood of self-reported depression was significantly higher among those with any level of financial stress, and lower among those in the higher income quintiles. Conclusion This study concludes that both subjectively and objectively measured financial stress are inversely associated with good self-reported health, quality of life, life satisfaction, and positively associated with self-reported depression among older adults.

Global Health Microsurgery Training With Cell Phones	ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY			English	Article						global surgery; microsurgery teaching; cell phone microsurgery	PLASTIC-SURGERY; BURDEN	Background Lack of surgical care for trauma, burns, congenital anomalies, and other surgical diseases is a growing portion of global disability and death accounting for 30% of the global disease burden. Global surgical and anesthesia care aim to achieve excellence and equality of clinical care through leadership, innovation, teaching, research, and advocacy. Stanford University Division of Plastic Surgery faculty partnered with ReSurge International to teach reconstructive microsurgery in low- and middle-income countries. Challenge Global surgery teaching and training are challenged by limited resources. Surgical loupes and operating microscopes used to perform complex microsurgery magnify the surgical field are very expensive. Our goal was to identify low-cost alternatives to teach and practice microsurgery suturing. Innovation Use cell phone camera with zoom capacity to teach and practice microsurgery suturing. Results Cell phones with zoom feature are widely available even in low- and middle-income countries. A cell phone was placed on a stand over a microsurgery practice station. The camera was used to zoom and focus on the suturing station to mimic a surgical field with loupes or microscope magnification. Nine attending surgeons and 7 residents practiced microsurgery with microsurgical instruments and 9-0 nylon suture under the magnification of a cell phone camera. The Stanford Microsurgery and Resident Training Scale was used to track their progress. A feedback survey was given to the participants to identify the usefulness of the cell phone setup for microsurgery suture practice. Conclusions Global surgery teaching and training face many challenges especially limited resources. Identifying low-cost alternative is crucial. Cell phone camera with zoom is a low-cost alternative to loupes or operating microscope for microsurgical teaching and training.

The study is based on a self-report social survey conducted in Adana which includes three different time frames for happiness, namely at present (short-term), in the last week and in the last 4 weeks (global). Over which, the effects of objective, subjective and social spatial variables through socio-economic and social capital variables are measured using logistic regression models. Based on cognitive neuroscience research findings, the expectations are that perceived aspects of life are more likely related to short-term happiness and objective aspects of life are more likely related to global happiness. The analyses reveal that urban-remote difference is more likely related to higher global happiness; vehicle dependent-others difference is more likely related to higher happiness; perceived spatial factors are more likely related to short-term happiness; lower relative income and higher neighborhood inequality are more likely to decrease global happiness; the unemployed and retired urban residents are more likely to feel less happy and related to global happiness; personal characteristics and socio-economic factors are more likely related to one-week happiness. The implications suggest that policies should be towards the city retirees and the unemployeds who feel less happy, and intensive public transportation areas and their residents who are the most unhappy and more disturbed by air pollution. For policy implementation, we recommend that the authorities discuss the public transport, distance to services, air pollution and unemployment issues, and adopt the retirement adjustment law to eliminate the grievances in the pensions of the retirees.

DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						COVID-19; scarce resources; Africa	VACCINE; HEALTH	The COVID-19 pandemic has raised important universal public health challenges. Conceiving ethical responses to these challenges is a public health imperative but must take context into account. This is particularly important in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this paper, we examine how some of the ethical recommendations offered so far in high-income countries might appear from a SSA perspective. We also reflect on some of the key ethical challenges raised by the COVID-19 pandemic in low-income countries suffering from chronic shortages in health care resources, and chronic high morbidity and mortality from non-COVID-19 causes. A parallel is drawn between the distribution of severity of COVID-19 disease and the classic "Fortune at the bottom of the pyramid" model that is relevant in SSA. Focusing allocation of resources during COVID-19 on the 'thick' part of the pyramid in Low-to-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) could be ethically justified on utilitarian and social justice grounds, since it prioritizes a large number of persons who have been economically and socially marginalized. During the pandemic, importing allocation frameworks focused on the apex of the pyramid from the global north may therefore not always be appropriate. In a post-COVID-19 world, we need to think strategically about how health care systems can be financed and structured to ensure broad access to adequate health care for all who need it. The root problems underlying health inequity, exposed by COVID-19, must be addressed, not just to prepare for the next pandemic, but to care for people in resource poor settings in non-pandemic times.

Commercial determinants of health: an ethical exploration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						Commercial determinants of health; CDoH; Ethics; Public health; Private sector; Bioethics	CORPORATE; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; ALCOHOL	Objectives This paper seeks to contribute toward a better understanding of commercial determinants of health by proposing a set of ethical principles that can be used by researchers and other health actors in understanding and addressing Commercial Determinants of Health (CDoH). Methods The paper is mainly based on a systematic review and qualitative analysis of the existing literature on CDoH and public health ethics frameworks. We conducted searches using selected search engines (Google Scholar and Pubmed). For ethical challenges relating to CDOH, our searches in Google Scholar yielded 17 papers that discussed ethical challenges that affect CDoH. For ethical frameworks relevant for CDOH, our searches in Google Scholar and Pubmed yielded 15 papers that clearly described bioethical models including relevant ethical principles. Additionally, we consulted eight experts working on CDoH. Through these two methods, we were able to identify ethical challenges as well as norms and values related to CDoH that we offer as candidates to comprise a foundational ethics framework for CDoH. Results Discussing risk factors associated with CDH frequently brings public health into conflict with the interests of industry actors in the food, automobile, beverage, alcohol, ammunition, gaming and tobacco industries including conflict between profit-making and public health. We propose the following candidate ethical principles that can be used in addressing CDoH: moral responsibility, nonmaleficence, social justice and equity, consumer sovereignty, evidence-informed actions, responsiveness, accountability, appropriateness, transparency, beneficence and holism. Conclusions We hope that this set of guiding principles will generate wider global debate on CDoH and help inform ethical analyses of corporate actions that contribute to ill health and policies aimed at addressing CDoH. These candidate principles can guide researchers and health actors including corporations in addressing CDoH.

Justice for George Floyd and a reckoning for global mental health	GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Colonialism; racism; violence	TEAM CIT MODEL; INCOME; CALL	In the wake of George Floyd's killing by police in Minneapolis and the global response inspired by Black Lives Matter, it is time for the field of global mental health to reexamine how we have acknowledged and addressed racism in our institutions, our research, and our mental health services. In solidarity with street level responses, this is an important opportunity to understand and collaboratively respond to public demand for systemic change. To respond effectively, it is vital to (1) be aware of the colonial history that influences today's practices, and move forward with anti-colonial and anti-racist actions; (2) identify where and why diversity and representation are lacking in the global mental health workforce, then follow steps to combat these disparities; and (3) work with communities and institutions to end both police violence and structural violence.

To maximise health promotion intervention outcomes, practitioners need up-to-date information that helps them navigate the complexity of food systems and eating behaviours. Methods This scoping review of Australian and international research, including peer-reviewed and grey literature, provides a picture of health promotion nutrition interventions, as well as other initiatives that may promote increased vegetable consumption. Search terms related to nutrition and vegetable consumption, type of intervention or initiative, for example, campaign; and consumer values and behaviour. A wide range of data sources were used including scholarly papers, market research reports and publicly available websites of community organisations (eg,OOOOBY). A broad food systems typology was developed to provide a framework for the review. Results The review finds an emerging group of community-driven initiatives within local food systems that appear to have positive impacts on vegetable consumption. These initiatives sit within a multi-faceted approach to health and well-being that is consistent with the tenets of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, including community engagement, social justice and sustainability goals. Conclusions More research into the impact of these new frontiers is needed, but our preliminary findings point to the potential for health promotion practitioners to collaborate on local/community food system initiatives that are not motivated primarily by health goals, but have the potential to deliver multiple health and environmental outcomes. So what? This review demonstrated community-driven initiatives around local food systems show the most promise in promoting vegetable consumption and addressing the determinants of health. Health promotion efforts to encourage food security and healthy eating could be strengthened through collaborations within these new frontiers.

Public Risk-Taking and Rewards During the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Case Study of Remdesivir in the Context of Global Health Equity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Biomedical R&D; Innovation; Access; Public Value	EBOLA-VIRUS; EFFICACY; GS-5734	Public investment, through both research grants and universityfunding, plays a crucial role in the research and development (R&D) of novel health technologies, including diagnostics, therapies, and vaccines, to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using the example of remdesivir, one of the most promising COVID-19 treatments, this paper traces back public contributions to different stages of the innovation process. Applying the Risk-Reward Nexus framework to the R&D of remdesivir, we analyse the role of the public in risk-taking and reward and address inequities in the biomedical innovation system. We discuss the collective, cumulative and uncertain characteristics of innovation, highlighting the lack of transparency in the biomedical R&D system, the need for public investment in the innovation process, and the "time-lag" between risk-taking and reward. Despite the significant public transnational contributions to the R&D of remdesivir, the rewards are extracted by few actors and the return to the public in the form of equitable access and affordable pricing is limited. Beyond the necessity to treat remdesivir as a global public good, we argue that biomedical innovation needs to be viewed in the broader concept of public value to prevent the same equity issues currently seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires the state to take a market-shaping rather than market-fixing role, thereby steering innovation, ensuring that patents do not hinder global equitable access and affordable pricing and safeguarding a global medicines supply.

We present a literature review on the extent to which research in this field has developed over the years, and reveal gaps in gender-sensitive awareness between the clinical portrayal and the translation into gender-specific treatment regimens, guidelines and into gender-oriented preventive strategies and health policies. Subsequently, through the lens of gender, we describe these domains in detail for four selected medical conditions: Asthma, obesity and overweight, chronic kidney disease and coronavirus disease 2019. As some of the key gender differences become more apparent during adolescence, we focus on this developmental stage. Finally, we propose a model which is based on three influential issues: (1) Investigating gender-specific medical profiles of related health conditions, rather than a single disease; (2) The dynamics of gender disparities across developmental stages; and (3) An integrative approach which takes into account additional risk factors (ethnicity, socio-demographic variables, minorities, lifestyle habitsetc.). Increasing the awareness of gender-specific medicine in daily practice and in tailored guidelines, already among adolescents, may reduce inequities, facilitate the prediction of future trends and properly address the characteristics and needs of certain subpopulations within each gender.

This article assesses the plausibility of such measures through the lens of luck egalitarianism, a prominent responsibility-sensitive theory of distributive justice. This article presents a framework of luck egalitarianism in health, which integrates other concerns of justice than health, is pluralist, and is compatible with a wide range of measures for giving lower priority to those deemed responsible. Applying this framework to oral health, the allocation of livers among potential transplant recipients and travel insurance demonstrates that this version of luck egalitarianism is a much more attractive and flexible theory than much of the contemporary discussion allows. This also pertains to its ability to provide plausible answers to two prominent critiques of harshness and intrusiveness. The discussion also shows that the luck egalitarian commitment to eliminating the influence of luck on people's lives is likely to require substantial redistribution.

However, studies that investigate regional mortality patterns within and between national and regional borders are rare. We carry out a comparative study of Finland and Sweden: two welfare states that share many attributes, with one exception being their mortality trajectories. Although Finland has risen rapidly in the global life expectancy rankings, Sweden has lost its historical place among the top 10. Using individual-level register data, we study regional trends in life expectancy and lifespan variation by sex. Although all regions, in both countries, have experienced substantial improvements in life expectancy and lifespan inequality from 1990-2014, considerable differences between regions have remained unchanged, suggesting the existence of persistent inequality. In particular, Swedish-speaking regions in Finland have maintained their mortality advantage over Finnish-speaking regions. Nevertheless, there is some evidence of convergence between the regions of Finland and Sweden.

J	Nissanholtz-Gannot, R; Shapiro, E				Nissanholtz-Gannot, Rachel; Shapiro, Ephraim			Community nurses and chronic disease in Israel: Professional dominance as a social justice issue	NURSING INQUIRY			English	Article						chronic illness; community nursing; health inequities; international health; nursing roles; professionalization; social justice	PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS; SELF-MANAGEMENT; HEALTH; PRACTITIONERS; QUALITY; PERCEPTIONS; SERVICES; WORK; LIFE; CARE	Chronic diseases are major causes of health inequalities. Community nurses can potentially make large contributions to chronic illness prevention and management in Israel but may be obstructed by professional dominance of physicians. However, insufficient research exists about community nursing in Israel, and how it may differ from other countries. This study aims to document chronic disease-related community nursing roles in Israel, identify changes and trends in community nursing roles that may increase social justice, and understand how the roles and trends in community health nursing in Israel may differ from developments in other countries. In-depth interviews were performed with 55 Israeli health system professionals, and 692 nurse care-givers were asked open-ended questions. Interview answers were analyzed to find themes and trends. The study found that community nurse roles in Israel have expanded, especially for chronic disease control. Commonalities exist with countries such as the United States and the UK, albeit with important differences. However, continued conflicts with physicians exist, which can limit nurses' contributions to reducing health inequalities. Community nurses' importance is growing. Enabling them to overcome professional dominance and improve chronic disease control can help reduce health inequalities in Israel and elsewhere.

Methods Country-specific DALY number, rate and age-standardized rate of AMD were acquired from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 database. The Socio-demographic Index (SDI), Human Development Index (HDI), Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IA-HDI) and other related data were obtained from published data or shared databases. Regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlations between the potential risk factors and the age-standardized DALY rate of AMD. Results The DALY number doubled from 1990 to 2017, and DALY rate increased from 4.73 (95% CI: 3.19-6.54) to 6.95 (95% CI: 4.76-9.54). However, change was small after standardizing. Females tended to have severer burden. Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) rates were correlated to annual PM2.5 concentration, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, population with at least some secondary education (secondary education), glaucoma prevalence and gross national income (GNI) per capita. In SDI model, glaucoma, GDP, healthcare access and quality index (HAQ) and secondary education were associated with disease burden (p < 0.001). In IA-HDI model, cataract, glaucoma, PM2.5, GDP and secondary education were correlated to DALY rates (p < 0.001). In model included four components of HDI, glaucoma, PM2.5, GDP, secondary education, expected years of schooling and life expectancy at birth were associated (p < 0.001). Conclusion Being female, older age, poor socioeconomic status and less educated are associated with a heavier disease burden of AMD. These findings would provide a basic understanding for policy making on AMD prevention and treatment.

Other pressures that negatively impact primates are unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal trade of primates as pets and as body parts, expanding road networks in previously isolated areas, zoonotic disease transmission and climate change. Here we examine current and future trends in several socio-economic factors directly or indirectly affecting primates to further our understanding of the interdependent relationship between human well-being, sustainable development, and primate population persistence. We found that between 2001 and 2018 ca 191 Mha of tropical forest (30% canopy cover) were lost as a result of human activities in the five primate range regions. Forty-six percent of this loss was in the Neotropics (Mexico, Central and South America), 30% in Southeast Asia, 21% in mainland Africa, 2% in Madagascar and 1% in South Asia. Countries with the greatest losses (ca 57% of total tree cover loss) were Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, China, and Malaysia. Together these countries harbor almost 50% of all extant primate species. In 2018, the world human population was estimated at ca 8bn people, ca 60% of which were found in primate range countries. Projections to 2050 and to 2100 indicate continued rapid growth of the human populations in these five primate range regions, with Africa surpassing all the other regions and totaling ca 4bn people by the year 2100. Socioeconomic indicators show that, compared to developed nations, most primate range countries are characterized by high levels of poverty and income inequality, low human development, low food security, high levels of corruption and weak governance. Models of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) projected to 2050 and 2100 showed that whereas practices of increasing inequality (SSP4) or unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5) are projected to have dire consequences for human well-being and primate survivorship, practices of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1) are expected to have a positive effect on maintaining biodiversity, protecting environments, and improving the human condition. These results stress that improving the well-being, health, and security of the current and future human populations in primate range countries are of paramount importance if we are to move forward with effective policies to protect the world's primate species and promote biodiversity conservation.

In this study, we showed extent and the overtime dynamics of inequality in caesarean section in Ethiopia following rigorous methodologies.MethodsThe data for analysis came from Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS) conducted between 2000 and 2016. We used the World Health Organization's (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) to analyze the data. Caesarean delivery was disaggregated by four equity stratifiers, namely education, wealth, residence and regions. Relative and absolute summary measures were calculated for each equity stratifier to capture inequality from different perspectives. 95% Uncertainty Interval was calculated around a point estimate to measure statistical significance.ResultsWe found large socioeconomic and area-based inequalities in use of caesarean section in all study surveys. The inequalities have occurred in favour of socioeconomically advantaged women and those living in urban areas and certain regions such as Addis Ababa. While area-related inequality had generally increased with time, socioeconomic inequality showed fluctuation. Adoption of different measures in the study for the inequality analysis has caused the emergence of mix of patterns in caesarean section inequality over time.ConclusionsIn all the surveys, wealthy and more educated women, and those residing in urban areas had higher chance of obtaining caesarean delivery. Policy makers should work to ensure caesarean section that is in the accepted normal range. More emphasis should be drawn to subpopulation with under use of caesarean section while at the same time, discouraging unjustified use of it.

The disease is a serious public health problem, and is directly linked to social issues. We analyzed temporal trend variations in areas at risk for concomitant TB, and characterized the clinical and epidemiological profiles of cases in a hyperendemic municipality in the Amazon region of Brazil.MethodsThis ecological study was performed in the municipality of Manaus, in northern Brazil. The population comprised cases with concomitant pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB, registered on the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018. For risk cluster detection, spatial and spatiotemporal scanning statistical techniques were used. The Spatial Variation in Temporal Trends (SVTT) approach was used to detect and infer clusters for significantly different time trends.ResultsBetween 2009 and 2018, 873 concomitant TB cases were registered in Manaus. By using purely spatial scanning statistics, we identified two risk clusters. The relative risk (RR) of the clusters was 2.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.57-2.88; P=0.0031) and 2.03 (95% CI: 1.58-2.58; P=0.0029). Using space-time scanning, we identified a risk cluster with an RR of 3.57 (95% CI: 2.84-4.41; P=0.014), between 2017 and 2018. For SVTT analyses, three clusters with spatial variations were detected in the significant temporal trends: SVTT 1 (P=0.042), SVTT 2 (P=0.046) and SVTT 3 (P=0.036).ConclusionsIn Brazil, several TB-determining factors such as race/color, gender, low educational level and low income overlap in needy urban areas and communities, demonstrating that it is unlikely to reach the goals, agreed and launched with the END TB Strategy within the deadlines of international agreements, if there is no reduction in existing inequities determinants and risk of illness in the country.

For disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, access to evidence-based interventions beyond research settings is of great importance. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a brief, group-based intervention, with consistent evidence of effectiveness. Methods:An implementation focused, three-phase methodology was developed using extensive stakeholder engagement. The methods resulted in a standardized Implementation Plan for the successful translation of CST from research to practice. The methodology was developed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and refined in three countries that vary in levels of economic development and healthcare systems (Brazil, India and Tanzania). Results:Five Implemention Plans for CST were produced. Each plan contained implementation strategies and action plans devised in conjunction with policy professionals, healthcare professionals, people with dementia and family carers, and an international team of researchers and clinicians. Conclusion:This novel methodology can act as a template for implementation studies in diverse healthcare systems across the world. It is an effective means of devising socio-culturally informed Implementation Plans that account for economic realities, health equity and healthcare access.

People who are culturally distinct from the dominant population group may experience a variety of barriers to accessing healthcare, including linguistic and cultural barriers in communication, navigation of an unfamiliar health system and unconscious or overt discrimination. Here, we outline the protocol of a scoping review to identify, describe and summarise interventions aimed at improving access to eye care for non-Indigenous, non-dominant ethnic groups residing in high-income countries.Methods and analysisWe will search MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health from their inception to July 2019. We will include studies of any design that describe an intervention to promote access to eye care for non-Indigenous, non-dominant ethnic groups. Two authors will independently review titles, abstracts and full-text articles for inclusion. Reference lists from all included articles will also be searched. In cases of disagreement between initial reviewers, a third author will help resolve the conflict. For each included article, we will extract data about the target population, details of the intervention delivered and the effectiveness of or feedback from the intervention. Overall findings will be summarised with descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.Ethics and disseminationThis review will summarise existing literature and as such ethics approval is not required. We will publish the review in an open-access, peer-reviewed journal, and draft appropriate summaries for dissemination to the wider community. This wider community could include clinicians, policymakers, health service managers and organisations that work with non-dominant ethnic groups. Our findings will also feed into the ongoing Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health.

Design This scoping review protocol followed Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) Scoping Review Framework. Data sources and eligibility The following databases were searched for the period January 1997 to January 2019: Medline via PubMed, Scopus, Academic Search Premier, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Africa-Wide Information, Humanities International Complete, Web of Science, PsychInfo, SocINDEX and grey literature. Eligible articles were primary studies, reviews or theoretical papers which conceptualised, defined and/or operationalised social inclusion or occupational justice in mental illness or HIV. Study appraisal and synthesis We undertook a three-part article screening process. Screening and data extraction were undertaken independently by two researchers. Arksey's framework and thematic analysis informed the collation and synthesis of included papers. Results From 3352 records, we reviewed 139 full articles and retained 27 for this scoping review. Definitions of social inclusion and occupational justice in the domains of mental illness and HIV were heterogeneous and lacked definitional clarity. The two concepts were conceptualised as either processes or personal experiences, with key features of community participation, respect for human rights and establishment and maintenance of healthy relationships. Conceptual commonalities between social inclusion and occupational justice were premised on social justice. Conclusions To address lack of clarity, we propose further and concurrent exploration of these concepts, specifically with reference to persons with comorbid mental health disorders such as substance use disorders and HIV living in low-income countries. This should reflect contextual realities influencing community participation, respect for human rights and meaningful occupational participation. From this broadened understanding, quantitative measures should be applied to improve the standardisation of measurements for occupational justice and social inclusion in policy, research and practice.

Interventions to improve the quality of cataract services: protocol for a global scoping review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review						cataract and refractive surgery; quality in health care; health policy	SURGERY; OUTCOMES; BLINDNESS; IMPAIRMENT	Introduction Cataract is the leading cause of blindness globally and a major cause of vision impairment. Cataract surgery is an efficacious intervention that usually restores vision. Although it is one of the most commonly conducted surgical interventions worldwide, good quality services (from being detected with operable cataract to undergoing surgery and receiving postoperative care) are not universally accessible. Poor quality understandably reduces the willingness of people with operable cataract to undergo surgery. Therefore, it is critical to improve the quality of care to subsequently reduce vision loss from cataract. This scoping review aims to summarise the nature and extent of the published literature on interventions to improve the quality of services for primary age-related cataract globally. Methods and analysis We will search MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health for peer-reviewed manuscripts published since 1990, with no language, geographic or study design restrictions. To define quality, we have used the elements adopted by the WHO-effectiveness, safety, people-centredness, timeliness, equity, integration and efficiency-to which we have added the element of planetary health. We will exclude studies focused on the technical aspects of the surgical procedure and studies that only involve children (<18 years). Two reviewers will screen all titles/abstracts independently, followed by a full-text review of potentially relevant articles. For included articles, data regarding publication characteristics, study details and quality-related outcomes will be extracted by two reviewers independently. Results will be synthesised narratively and presented visually using a spider chart. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was not sought, as our review will only include published and publicly accessible information. We will publish our findings in an open-access peer-reviewed journal and develop an accessible summary of the results for website posting. A summary of the results will be included in the ongoing Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health.

Hence, civil society organizations explore different strategies to improve reproductive health (RH) service delivery and to create safe spaces for women. To understand these efforts further, this study will examine four themes among the best practices of civil society organizations: education, male engagement, empowerment and advocacy. Here, I will explore some of their experiences in educating the community about their SRHRs, enhancing male responsibility on reproductive health, empowering gender-based violence victims and contextualizing global campaigns for local women's activism. Despite some limitations, the practices identified here illustrated significant results in the advancement of sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender equality in the Philippines.

Despite the documented negative impacts of diseases on tourism demand and people's perceived health risk, researchers have seldom examined the psychological responses of tourists travelling during an infectious disease outbreak. We therefore conducted three studies to examine this key aspect, and our findings indicate that tourists have a strong negative emotional reaction towards disadvantaged tourism-related prices in response to a high (vs low) infectious disease threat. Furthermore, risk aversion acts as an underlying mechanism driving this effect tourists are more risk aversive under the threat of an infectious disease, which consequently magnifies their negative emotional reaction. At last, theoretical and practical implications of these findings for tourism are discussed.

However, populations living in these highly varied regions are now confronted by global change. It is critical that they are able to anticipate change to strategically manage resources and avoid potential conflict. Yet, planning for sustainable, equitable transitions for the future is a daunting task, considering the range of uncertainties and the unique character of MtSES. Participatory scenario planning (PSP) can help MtSES communities by critically reflecting on a wider array of innovative pathways for adaptive transformation. Although the design of effective approaches has been widely discussed, how PSP has been employed in MtSES has yet to be examined. Here, we present the first systematic global review of single- and multiscalar, multisectoral PSP undertaken in MtSES, in which we characterize the process, identify strengths and gaps, and suggest effective ways to apply PSP in MtSES. We used a nine-step process to help guide the analysis of 42 studies from 1989 screened articles. Our results indicate a steady increase in relevant studies since 2006, with 43% published between 2015 and 2017. These studies encompass 39 countries, with over 50% in Europe. PSP in MtSES is used predominantly to build cooperation, social learning, collaboration, and decision support, yet meeting these objectives is hindered by insufficient engagement with intended end users. MtSES PSP has focused largely on envisioning themes of governance, economy, land use change, and biodiversity, but has overlooked themes such as gender equality, public health, and sanitation. There are many avenues to expand and improve PSP in MtSES: to other regions, sectors, across a greater diversity of stakeholders, and with a specific focus on MtSES paradoxes. Communicating uncertainty, monitoring and evaluating impacts, and engendering more comparative approaches can further increase the utility of PSP for addressing MtSES challenges, with lessons for other complex social-ecological systems.

As global fertile land is limited, the question arises whether growth in food consumption associated with increased affluence surmounts increases in land-use efficiency (measured as food supply per cropland area) associated with technological progress. Furthermore, substantial inequalities prevail in the global food system: While overly rich diets represent a serious health issue for many of the world's most affluent inhabitants and constitute a critical climate-change driver, undernourishment and hunger still threaten a considerable fraction of the world population, mostly in low-income countries. We here analyze trajectories in cropland demand and their main basic drivers food consumption (measured by a food index reflecting the share of animal products in diets) and land-use efficiency, for 123 countries (clustered in four income groups, covering 94% of the world population). We cover the period 1990-2013 and assess if these trajectories are associated with changes in inequality between countries. We find that while all groups of countries converged towards the high level of the per-capita food consumption of high-income countries, differences between income groups remained pronounced. Overall, cropland demand per capita declined over the entire period in all regions except low income countries, resulting in a tendency towards global convergence. However, the trend slowed in the last years. In contrast, land-use efficiency increased in all income groups with a similar trend, hence international inequalites in land-use efficiency remained almost unaltered. Because population and food requirements per capita are expected to grow in all income groups except the richest ones, failure to improve land efficiency sufficiently could lead to a less unequal but at the same time less ecologically sustainable world. Avoiding such outcomes may be possible by reducing the consumption of animal products in the richer countries and raising land-use efficiency in the poorer countries.

J	Chang, J; Agliata, J; Guarinieri, M				Chang, Judy; Agliata, Jake; Guarinieri, Mauro			COVID-19-Enacting a 'new normal' for people who use drugs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY			English	Article						COVID-19; People who use drugs; Community engagement; Criminalisation	INJECT DRUGS; HIV	The COVID-19 crisis has magnified existing social, economic and political inequities. People who use drugs are particularly vulnerable due to criminalisation and stigma and often experience underlying health conditions, higher rates of poverty, unemployment and homelessness, as well as a lack of access to vital resources - putting them at greater risk of infection. On the other hand, COVID-19 presents an opportunity to confront the mistakes of the past and re-negotiate a new social contract. The International Network of People who use Drugs (INPUD) believe that this crisis must be an occasion to rethink the function of punishment, to reform the system and to work towards ending the war on drugs. This commentary presents a set of recommendations to UN agencies, governments, donor agencies, academics, researchers and civil society, challenging these actors to work alongside people who use drugs to enact a new reality based on solidarity and cooperation, protection of health, restoration of rights and dignity and most importantly to mobilise to win the peace.

This article articulates 12 ethical principles for researchers undertaking gender and sexually diverse social, health, and related research. We have called these the 'Montreal Ethical Principles for Inclusive Research.' While writing from an international social work perspective, our aim is to promote ethical research that benefits people being researched by all disciplines. This paper targets four groups of interest: 1. Cisgender and heterosexual researchers; 2. Researchers who research 'general' populations; 3. and sexually diverse researchers; 4. Human ethics committees. This article was stimulated by the 2018 Global Social Work Statement of Ethical Principles, which positions human dignity at its core. It is critically important to understand and account for the intersectionality of gender and sexuality with discourses of race, ethnicity, colonialism, dis/ability, age, etc. Taking this intersectionality into consideration, this article draws on scholarship that underpins ethical principles developed for other minoritized communities, to ensure that research addresses the autonomy of these participants at every stage. Research that positions inclusive research ethics at its foundation can provide a solid basis for policy and practice responses to health and social inequities in gender and sexually diverse persons.

Many of these reports have received strong, sometimes litigious, backlash from the corporations exposed. The aim of this paper is to provide a critical commentary on existing literature, policies, procedures and observations of issues, especially regarding the use of the corporate determinants of health as a research construct, in the persistence and flourishing of oral health inequalities at a global level. We discuss theoretical frameworks that underpin the power constructs of the corporate determinants of health, including Lukes "three faces of power" theory. This theory posits that power is exercised in three ways: through decision-making, through non-decision-making and ideologically. We will demonstrate, using examples of corporate determinants of health and oral health inequalities from several countries, how intervening at key leverage points is a crucial strategy for improving oral health inequalities at a global level.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) - An epidemic or pandemic for financial markets	JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE			English	Article						Coronavirus; Financial markets; Bitcoin; Gold; Equity markets; Volatility	MEDIA; INTEGRATION; VOLATILITY; RETURNS	The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has quickly evolved from a provincial health scare to a global meltdown. While it has brought nearly half the world to a standstill it has affected the financial markets in unseen ways by eroding a quarter of wealth in nearly a month. This paper investigates the reaction of financial markets globally in terms of their decline and volatility as Coronavirus epicentre moved from China to Europe and then to the US. Findings suggest that the earlier epicentre China has stabilized while the global markets have gone into a freefall especially in the later phase of the spread. Even the relatively safer commodities have suffered as the pandemic moves into the US. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These estimates inform and motivate investment in global health programmes and policies. Variability in the availability and reliability of data poses challenges for measuring and monitoring trends in unintended pregnancy and abortion. We developed a new statistical model that jointly estimated unintended pregnancy and abortion that aimed to better inform efforts towards global equity in sexual and reproductive health and rights. Methods We developed a model that simultaneously estimated incidence of unintended pregnancy and abortion within a Bayesian framework. Data on pregnancy intentions and abortion were compiled from country-based surveys, official statistics, and published studies found through a literature search, and we obtained data on livebirths from the World Population Prospects. We analysed results by World Bank income groups, Sustainable Development Goal regional groupings, and the legal status of abortion. Findings In 2015-19, there were 121.0 million unintended pregnancies annually (80% uncertainty interval [UI] 112.8-131.5), corresponding to a global rate of 64 unintended pregnancies (UI 60-70) per 1000 women aged 15-49 years. 61% (58-63) of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion (totalling 73. 3 million abortions annually [66.7-82.0]), corresponding to a global abortion rate of 39 abortions (36-44) per 1000 women aged 15-49 years. Using World Bank income groups, we found an inverse relationship between unintended pregnancy and income, whereas abortion rates varied non-monotonically across groups. In countries where abortion was restricted, the proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion had increased compared with the proportion for 1990-94, and the unintended pregnancy rates were higher than in countries where abortion was broadly legal. Interpretation Between 1990-94 and 2015-19, the global unintended pregnancy rate has declined, whereas the proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion has increased. As a result, the global average abortion rate in 2015-19 was roughly equal to the estimates for 1990-94. Our findings suggest that people in high-income countries have better access to sexual and reproductive health care than those in low-income countries. Our findings indicate that individuals seek abortion even in settings where it is restricted. These findings emphasise the importance of ensuring access to the full spectrum of sexual and reproductive health services, including contraception and abortion care, and for additional investment towards equity in health-care services.

Preliminary findings suggest adverse mental health effects in previously healthy people and especially in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of worldwide health systems, efforts have been made to adapt the delivery of mental health care to the demands of COVID-19. Mental health concerns have been addressed via the public mental health response and by adapting mental health services, mostly focusing on infection control, modifying access to diagnosis and treatment, ensuring continuity of care for mental health service users, and paying attention to new cases of mental ill health and populations at high risk of mental health problems. Sustainable adaptations of delivery systems for mental health care should be developed by experts, clinicians, and service users, and should be specifically designed to mitigate disparities in health-care provision. Thorough and continuous assessment of health and service-use outcomes in mental health clinical practice will be crucial for defining which practices should be further developed and which discontinued. For this Position Paper, an international group of clinicians, mental health experts, and users of mental health services has come together to reflect on the challenges for mental health that COVID-19 poses. The interconnectedness of the world made society vulnerable to this infection, but it also provides the infrastructure to address previous system failings by disseminating good practices that can result in sustained, efficient, and equitable delivery of mental health-care delivery. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could be an opportunity to improve mental health services.

Vitamin Status and Diet in Elderly with Low and High Socioeconomic Status: The Lifelines-MINUTHE Study	NUTRIENTS			English	Article						vitamins; socioeconomic status; elderly; nutritional status; diet quality	RISK-FACTORS; FOLATE; PLASMA; ADULTS; FOOD; DETERMINANTS; INEQUALITIES; POSITION; EUROPE; HEALTH	Socioeconomic health inequalities are an important global public health problem. However, it is not well known to what extent socioeconomic inequalities culminate in impaired vitamin status and whether this is mediated by diet. We, therefore, aimed to assess vitamin status in a population already at increased risk of micronutrient deficiency, i.e., elderly with high and low socioeconomic status (SES), and to investigate whether potential differences therein were mediated by diet quality. Vitamin status in 1605 individuals (60-75 years) from the Lifelines- Micronutrients and Health inequalities in Elderly (MINUTHE) Study was assessed by measuring folic acid and the vitamins B6, B12, D, A, E, and K. Multinomial logistic and linear regression analyses were applied to test the associations between SES and vitamin status. Mediation analysis was used to explore the interrelationship between SES, diet quality, and vitamin status. Low SES was associated with poorer status of vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and, notably, folic acid. Moreover, multivitamin deficiencies were more prevalent in the low SES group. Diet quality was found to mediate the associations of SES with folic acid (for 39.1%), vitamin B6 (for 37.1%), and vitamin B12 (for 37.2%). We conclude that low SES is a risk factor for a spectrum of vitamin deficiencies. Diet quality can partially explain the socioeconomic differences in vitamin status, suggesting that policymakers can mitigate socioeconomic inequality in nutritional status through improving diet quality.

Challenges of COVID-19 in children in low- and middle-income countries	PAEDIATRIC RESPIRATORY REVIEWS			English	Review						COVID; Low-middle income countries; Child; Indirect effects; Resource allocation	FACE MASKS; CARE; SPREAD; AFRICA	As the coronavirus pandemic extends to low and middle income countries (LMICs), there are growing concerns about the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in populations with high prevalence of comorbidities, the impact on health and economies more broadly and the capacity of existing health systems to manage the additional burden of COVID-19. The direct effects of COVID are less of a concern in children, who seem to be largely asymptomatic or to develop mild illness as occurs in high income countries; however children in LMICs constitute a high proportion of the population and may have a high prevalence of risk factors for severe lower respiratory infection such as HIV or malnutrition. Further diversion of resources from child health to address the pandemic among adults may further impact on care for children. Poor living conditions in LMICs including lack of sanitation, running water and overcrowding may facilitate transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The indirect effects of the pandemic on child health are of considerable concern, including increasing poverty levels, disrupted schooling, lack of access to school feeding schemes, reduced access to health facilities and interruptions in vaccination and other child health programs. Further challenges in LMICs include the inability to implement effective public health measures such as social distancing, hand hygiene, timely identification of infected people with self-isolation and universal use of masks. Lack of adequate personal protective equipment, especially N95 masks is a key concern for health care worker protection. While continued schooling is crucial for children in LMICs, provision of safe environments is especially challenging in overcrowded resource constrained schools. The current crisis is a harsh reminder of the global inequity in health in LMICs. The pandemic highlights key challenges to the provision of health in LMICs, but also provides opportunities to strengthen child health broadly in such settings. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted a cross-sectional study on 349 women (Catania, Italy) to investigate whether behaviors might mediate the association between SES and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) methylation, a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation. Educational level, used as an indicator of SES, and data on behaviors (i.e. diet, smoking habits, physical activity, and weight status) were collected using structured questionnaires. Adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD) was assessed by the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). Leukocyte LINE-1 methylation was assessed by pyrosequencing. Mediation analysis was conducted using the procedure described by Preacher and Hayes. Women with high educational level exhibited higher MDS (beta =0.669; 95%CI 0.173-1.165; p<0.01) and LINE-1 methylation level (<beta>=0.033; 95%CI 0.022-0.043; p<0.001) than their less educated counterpart. In line with this, mediation analysis demonstrated a significant indirect effect of high educational level on LINE-1 methylation through the adherence to MD (<beta>=0.003; 95%CI 0.001-0.006). Specifically, the mediator could account for 9.5% of the total effect. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the mediating effect of diet in the relationship between SES and DNA methylation. Although these findings should be confirmed by prospective research, they add value to the promotion of healthy dietary habits in social disadvantaged people.

Rethinking the Central Role of Equity in the Global Governance of Pandemic Response	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						COVID-19; Pandemics; Equity; Global health; Governance		Our initial response to COVID-19 has been plagued by a series of failures-many of which have extended inequity within and across populations, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The global health governance of pandemic preparedness and response needs to move further away from the advocacy of a one-size-fits-all approach that tends to prioritize the interests of high-income countries towards a context-sensitive approach that gives equity a central role in guiding our pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

For people with disability, persisting and ubiquitous disablism is played out in a variety of ways in clinical and public health contexts. This paper examines the impact of disablism on pandemic triage guidance for allocation of critical care. It identifies three underlying disablist assumptions about disability and health status, quality of life, and social utility, that unjustly and potentially catastrophically disadvantage people with disability in COVID-19 and other global health emergencies.

Some of the most pressing issues are the extent of restrictive measures, the reciprocal duties to healthcare workers, the allocation of scarce resources, and the need for research. While policy and ethical frameworks are being developed to face these problems, the gender perspective has been largely overlooked in most of the issues at stake. Domestic violence is the most prevalent form of violence against women, which can be exacerbated during a pandemic: stress and economic uncertainty are triggers for abuse, and confinement limits access to support networks. Confinement also exacerbates the unfair distribution of unpaid labor, which is disproportionately assigned to women and girls, and highlights inequality in the overall labor market. Lack of security measures has resulted in attacks towards health workers, particularly female nurses, due to fear of contamination. Finally, resource results in lack of access to other health necessities, including sexual and reproductive health services. Research across all disciplines to face-and to learn from-this crisis should be done through a gender lens, because understanding the realities of women is essential to understand the pandemic's true effects in Mexico and the world.

Successful responses require more integrated approaches to policy making at all levels of government, so that economic, social and environmental actions reinforce each other rather than compete. They also require effective coordination across levels of government to manage shared responsibilities, mutual dependence and common challenges. This commentary highlights the progress in the multi-level governance concept since its first use, and focuses on some current dynamics driving multi-level governance, in particular the trend towards differentiated subnational governance. It then highlights that the way multi-level governance systems are designed has a direct impact on policy outcomes, hence the imperative to strengthen multi-level governance systems. The commentary offers insight into how the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is tacking this imperative to best support countries in their development processes.

J	Wright, C; Sathre, R; Buluswar, S				Wright, Caleb; Sathre, Roger; Buluswar, Shashi			The global challenge of clean cooking systems	FOOD SECURITY			English	Review						Clean cooking; Household air pollution; Energy access; Gender equity; Improved cookstoves; Renewable energy	FUEL USE; AIR-POLLUTION; HOUSEHOLD COOKING; BIOGAS DIGESTERS; FOSSIL-FUELS; CHARCOAL; CONSEQUENCES; TECHNOLOGIES; CONSUMPTION; COOKSTOVES	Cooking is an essential and energy-intensive activity. Populations in industrialized countries enjoy nearly universal access to electricity and gas for clean cooking, while about 2.5 billion people in low- and middle-income countries use solid fuels such as wood, charcoal, coal, crop residue and dung for their daily cooking. These traditional solid fuel cooking systems negatively affect the health and reduce the opportunities of cookstove users, who are disproportionately women and children. Solid fuel cooking also presents a number of detrimental environmental impacts, such as ambient air pollution and forest degradation in some regions. Access to cleaner cooking fuels such as gas and electricity is expanding, but is constrained by the higher costs and logistical challenges of such systems. This review investigates the technologies and systems that are currently used to cook food, with a focus on low-income populations.

Finally, it reflects on the recent success of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) along with other fossil fuel-based cooking systems, and discusses a potential transition to renewable energy-based cooking.

This is predicated, however, on our ability to combine climate and health data to investigate the ways in which variations in climate, weather, and health outcomes interact. There is growing evidence to support the value of place- and community-based monitoring and surveillance efforts, which can contribute to improving both the quality and equity of data collection needed to investigate and understand the impacts of climate change on health. The inclusion of multiple and diverse knowledge systems in climate-health surveillance presents many benefits, as well as challenges. We conducted a systematic review, synthesis, and confidence assessment of the published literature on integrated monitoring and surveillance systems for climate change and public health. We examined the inclusion of diverse knowledge systems in climate-health literature, focusing on: (1) analytical framing of integrated monitoring and surveillance system processes; (2) key contributions of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge systems to integrated monitoring and surveillance systems processes; and (3) patterns of inclusion within these processes. In total, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction, appraisal, and analysis. Our findings indicate that the inclusion of diverse knowledge systems contributes to integrated climate-health monitoring and surveillance systems across multiple processes of detection, attribution, and action. These contributions include: the definition of meaningful problems; the collection of more responsive data; the reduction of selection and source biases; the processing and interpretation of more comprehensive datasets; the reduction of scale dependent biases; the development of multi-scale policy; long-term future planning; immediate decision making and prioritization of key issues; as well as creating effective knowledge-information-action pathways. The value of our findings and this review is to demonstrate how neither scientific, Indigenous, nor local knowledge systems alone will be able to contribute the breadth and depth of information necessary to detect, attribute, and inform action along pathways of climate-health impact. Rather, it is the divergence or discordance between the methodologies and evidences of different knowledge systems that can contribute uniquely to this understanding. We critically discuss the possibility of what we, mainly local communities and experts, stand to lose if these processes of inclusion are not equitable. We explore how to shift the existing patterns of inclusion into balance by ensuring the equity of contributions and justice of inclusion in these integrated monitoring and surveillance system processes.

The Index offers an evidenced, structured, and reasoned approach to using aid in bi-lateral agreements with mental health as a foundation. This study used 26 internationally available and validated indicators to explore and perform the analysis leading to the development of the Index. As with many summary statistics used to describe matters across the globe there has to be a fundamental reliance on national reporting or gathering of the underlying information used in their derivation, although their reliability may be in question and, in addition, such an exercise can be refined and repeated every year. It is concluded that the countries which score worse on the Index are likely to be failed states or fragile states: countries where the governments do not have complete control or authority. Such governments can often be repressive and corrupt, may participate in serious human rights abuses, and are characterized by conflict of various forms. These governments are also likely to suffer disadvantage as a result of extremes of climate changes, extreme poverty, inequality, social and ethnic divisions, the inability to provide basic services, and suffer from pockets of insurgency in the form of terrorism, which are often violent and brutal.

In countries such as India, where menstruation is stigmatised, it can be particularly difficult. This paper examines challenges related to menstruation for young women living in slums in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. The research was informed by the socio-ecological model. Life course interviews were conducted with 70 young women ages 15-24 living in the slums of Lucknow. Thematic analysis was used to identify salient themes regarding individual, social, and systemic challenges related to menstruation. On the individual level, young women lack knowledge about menstruation. In the social sphere, young women experience stigma around menstruation, lack opportunities to discuss menstruation, and experience limitations around mobility and other activities during menstruation. At the institutional level, for example in school, there are few resources to support menstruating young women as toilets are dirty and doors are broken. Therefore, menstruating adolescents and young women in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India, face an array of challenges at multiple levels. These findings suggest that multi-level interventions are warranted to create a supportive context for menstruation.

American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs) have the highest rates of diabetes in the nation with a prevalence of 14.7% in 2018, more than twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. AI/AN men have the highest prevalence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes (14.5%) compared to non-Hispanic Black (11.4%), non-Hispanic Asian (10.0%), and non-Hispanic White (8.6%) men. Several landmark clinical trials have shown that lifestyle interventions can effectively prevent or delay the onset of diabetes among those at risk, including in AIs/ANs. Despite positive outcomes for AIs/ANs in these studies, very few were men. To date, there have been no concerted efforts to recruit and retain AI/AN men in interventions that promote weight loss and healthy lifestyles to prevent diabetes, and they remain underrepresented in these types of studies. This article describes the design and methods of the first randomized controlled trial of a diabetes prevention program with a study sample comprised entirely of AI/AN men. Research to date has demonstrated suboptimal patterns of recruitment and retention of AI/AN men, resulting in their virtual absence in health and intervention research. Effective methods to recruit and retain AI/AN men, and potential benefit gained from participation in diabetes prevention research, are unknown for this population who experience a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes. The study design presented in this article offers promising insights to help remedy these important shortcomings in the science of recruitment and retention of AI/AN men in research.

The study included a dataset comprising death certificates of Polish citizens from 2002 (N = 359 486) and 2011 (N = 375 501). The data on deaths caused by malignant neoplasms of the digestive system, that is, coded as C15-C26 according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, was analyzed. The standard expected years of life lost meter was used to calculate years of life lost. In 2002, malignant neoplasms of the digestive system caused 25 024 deaths among Polish citizens (7.0% of all deaths), which translated into a premature loss of 494 442.1 years of life (129.4 years per 10 000 people). In 2011, the number of deaths increased to 26 537 (7.1% of all deaths) and the number of years of life lost rose to 499 804.0 (129.7 years per 10 000). The most important causes of mortality and years of life lost were colorectal, stomach, and pancreatic cancers. In both studied years, the socioeconomic features with an adverse effect on years of life lost due to each considered malignant neoplasm of the digestive system included male gender, lower than secondary education, widowed marital status, economic inactivity, living in urban areas. Years of life lost analysis constitutes a valuable part of epidemiological assessment of health inequalities in society. It appears that the observed inequalities may have many causes; however, further research is needed to better understand their full extent.

Uncovering spatial variation in maternal healthcare service use at subnational level in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Ethiopia; Spatial analysis; Clusters; Maternal health service use; Sub-national data; Equity	COUNTRIES; INEQUALITIES; EQUITY	Background Analysis of disaggregated national data suggest uneven access to essential maternal healthcare services within countries. This is of concern as it hinders equitable progress in health outcomes. Mounting an effective response requires identification of subnational areas that may be lagging behind. This paper aims to explore spatial variation in maternal healthcare service use at health centre catchment, village and household levels. Spatial correlations of service use with household wealth and women's education levels were also assessed. Methods Using survey data from 3758 households enrolled in a cluster randomized trial geographical variation in the use of maternity waiting homes (MWH), antenatal care (ANC), delivery care and postnatal care (PNC) was investigated in three districts in Jimma Zone. Correlations of service use with education and wealth levels were also explored among 24 health centre catchment areas using choropleth maps. Global spatial autocorrelation was assessed using Moran's I. Cluster analyses were performed at village and household levels using Getis Ord Gi* and Kulldorf spatial scan statistics to identify cluster locations. Results Significant global spatial autocorrelation was present in ANC use (Moran's I = 0.15,pvalue = 0.025), delivery care (Moran's I = 0.17,pvalue = 0.01) and PNC use (Moran's I = 0.31,pvalue < 0.01), but not MWH use (Moran's I = -0.005,pvalue = 0.94) suggesting clustering of villages with similarly high (hot spots) and/or low (cold spots) service use. Hot spots were detected in health centre catchments in Gomma district while Kersa district had cold spots. High poverty or low education catchments generally had low levels of service use, but there were exceptions. At village level, hot and cold spots were detected for ANC, delivery care and PNC use. Household-level analyses revealed a primary cluster of elevated MWH-use not detected previously. Further investigation of spatial heterogeneity is warranted. Conclusions Sub-national variation in maternal healthcare services exists in Jimma Zone. There was relatively higher poverty and lower education in areas where service use cold spots were identified. Re-directing resources to vulnerable sub-groups and locations lagging behind will be necessary to ensure equitable progress in maternal health.

Several studies have shown that there is limited knowledge about the disease and its diagnosis among health care providers, and there is an important inequity in the access to specialized care and appropriate treatment across Europe. The European Commision and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommend that the care of patients with AATD must be organized in reference centers at national or regional levels. These reference centers must provide optimal clinical care in terms of adequate diagnostic techniques, such as phenotyping and genotyping, and ensure access to treatment according to guidelines. Reference centers should also provide continuous medical education for health care professionals, genetic counseling, collaboration with patient associations and promote collaborative research and clinical trials with new and existing treatments for the disease. These centers must have a registry of their activity and collaborate with large, international, multicenter registries, such as the European Alpha-1 antitrypsin Deficiency Research Collaboration (EARCO) international registry, which is endorsed by the ERS, and aims to recruit up to 3,000 patients over a period of three years and prospectively follow them to better understand the natural history of the disease and the impact of different treatments on outcomes in a real life setting. International collaboration and standardized collection of high-quality prospective data will provide new insights into the clinical manifestations and prognosis of AATD.

The Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis: How Neoliberalism Helps Microbes Dodge Our Drugs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article						antimicrobial resistance; political economy; health policy; infectious diseases	ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; HEALTH; HISTORY; FUTURE; POWER	The urgent public health threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has received much attention from the world's most important health agencies and national governmental organizations. However, despite large investments being allocated to strategizing national and international plans for addressing this public health problem, the incidence of untreatable, antimicrobial-resistant diseases continues to rise in many nations. To avoid returning to a society in which common infections once again become deadly, one must consider the often-ignored root causes driving inappropriate behaviors relating to antimicrobial use, such as the history of antimicrobial drug development, the effects of commodifying health-related services, and the rise in social inequalities. By employing the lens of political economy to analyze the phenomenon of AMR on national and international scales, it is found that the acceptance of neoliberalism as a governing ideology by authorities is hindering our ability to globally combat AMR through the depoliticization of issues that require political intervention to stimulate change. Differences in level of AMR and approaches to pharmaceutical governance between social democratic and liberal welfare states provide validity to this hypothesis.

Global trends of epidemiological research in livestock tuberculosis for the last four decades	TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES			English	Review						animal tuberculosis; bibliometric review; epidemiology; livestock; livestock production system; one health; research trends	MYCOBACTERIUM-BOVIS STRAINS; ZOONOTIC TUBERCULOSIS; SPOLIGOTYPE DIVERSITY; COMPLEX; CAPRAE; CATTLE; DIFFERENTIATION; PATHOGENESIS; RELEVANCE; EVOLUTION	Animal tuberculosis (TB) caused byMycobacterium tuberculosiscomplex (MTC) bacteria remains as one of the most significant infectious diseases of livestock, despite decades of eradication programmes and research efforts, in an era where the livestock sector is among the most important and rapidly expanding commercial agricultural segments worldwide. This work provides a global overview of the spatial and temporal trends of reported scientific knowledge of TB in livestock, aiming to gain insights into research subtopics within the animal TB epidemiology domain and to highlight territorial inequalities regarding data reporting and research outputs over the years. To deliver such information, peer-reviewed reports of TB studies in livestock were retrieved from the Web of Science and Google Scholar, systematized and dissected. The validated data set contained 443 occurrence observations, covering the 1981-2020 period (39 years). We highlight a clear move towards transdisciplinary areas and the One Health approach, with a global temporal increase in publications combining livestock with wildlife and/or human components, which reflect the importance of non-prototypical hosts as key to understanding animal TB. It becomes evident that cattle is the main host across works from all continents; however, many regions remain poorly surveyed. TB research in livestock in low-/middle-income countries is markedly growing, reflecting changes in animal husbandry, but also mirroring the globalization era, with a marked increase in international collaboration and capacitation programmes for scientific and technological development. This review gives an overview of the most prolific continents, countries and research fields in animal TB epidemiology, clearly outlining knowledge gaps and key priority topics. The estimated growth trend of livestock production until 2050, particularly in Asia and Africa, in response to human population growth and animal-protein demand, will require further investment in early surveillance and adaptive research to accommodate the higher diversity of livestock species and MTC members and raising the possibility to fine-tune funding schemes.

The integration of evidence from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health in the field of health equity: a scoping review	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						health inequities; knowledge-to-action; knowledge translation; scoping review	KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION; POLICY; CANADA; ETHICS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PERSPECTIVES; DISPARITIES; STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK; SETTINGS	In 2008, the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) presented an influential compilation of evidence establishing the relationship between health inequities and the unfair distribution of power, wealth, and resources. A decade later, individual and bio-behavioural responses to health inequities persist. The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the extent to which this evidence guided research, practice, and policy in global and public health. To do this, we assessed different ways the CSDH evidence and calls for action were integrated in scholarly publications (citation, portrayal of health inequities, alignment with calls for action, and orientation toward root causes). A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles (2000-2016) using search terms related to 'knowledge-to-action' and 'health equity' led to 330 included articles. Results suggest integration of CSDH evidence and calls for action in scholarly work is modest: 59% (n= 163) of authors (2009-2016) cited the report. A large portion of authors did not reference causes of health inequities (52% before and 51% after the CSDH) and few referred to issues of power. Among 110 post-CSDH empirical articles, half did not align with CSDH principles for action. This review illustrates that much scholarly work that purported to contribute to health equity did so in ways that conflicted with the CSDH's characterization of the remediable nature and distribution of health inequities. These results provide a practical platform for assessing how global and public health efforts can move towards better alignment with the best available evidence about advancing health equity.

Systematic research in cultural neuroscience within the research domain criteria (RDoC) framework investigates the fundamental biobehavioral dimensions and observable behavior across cultures. Cultural dimensions are characterized in elements of circuit-based mechanisms and behavior across a range of analysis. Research approaches in cultural neuroscience within the RDoC framework advance the evidence-based resources for the development and implementation of cures, preventions and interventions to mental disorders in global mental health. This review presents a novel synthesis of foundations in cultural neuroscience within the research domain criteria framework to advance integrative, translational efforts in discovery and delivery science of mental disorders across cultural contexts in global mental health.

Clinical care during a pandemic health crisis requires prioritising the use of resources for patients with a greater chance of survival, especially in developing countries. The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis has generated new challenges given that cancer patients are normally not prioritised for admission in critical care units. Nevertheless, the development of new cancer drugs and novel adjuvant/neoadjuvant protocols has dramatically improved the prognosis of cancer patients, resulting in a more complex decision-making when prioritising intensive care in pandemic times. In this context, it is essential to establish an effective and transparent communication between the oncology team, critical care, and emergency units to make the best decisions, considering the principles of justice and charity. Concurrently, cancer treatment protocols must be adapted to prioritise according to oncologic response and prognosis. Communication technologies are powerful tools to optimise cancer care during pandemics, and we must adapt quickly to this new scenario of clinical care and teaching. In this new challenging pandemic scenario, multi-disciplinary work and effective communication between clinics, technology, science, and ethics is the key to optimising clinical care of cancer patients.

This study aimed to seek the views of international experts concerning evidence relating to gender and the premature deaths of people with intellectual disabilities, their views on priorities for future research, and recommendations for future research and policy. Twenty international experts on the health and/or mortality of people with intellectual disabilities were invited to complete an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was based on summary statements from a literature review on gender and premature death among people with intellectual disabilities compared to the general population. Summary statements included general topics such as mortality and specific major causes of death (e.g., cancer). For each summary statement, respondents rated on 5-point scales: their agreement with the statement; the importance of the topic; and the adequacy of the evidence. Participants then indicated their top three priorities for future research, and gave recommendations for future research and policy. Eighteen (90% response rate) respondents from nine countries participated. There was consensus among respondents regarding the greater inequality in intellectual disability vs. general population mortality rates for women compared to men. Evidence was considered inadequate for most topics. Evidence on cause-specific death rates was the most frequently mentioned main research priority, followed by age trends in mortality compared to the general population. Recommendations ranged from the need to use consistent methodology and case definition in future research, to the need for governments to be called to account on the issue. Further evidence on gender and mortality is urgently needed; an international consensus on recommendations for future research pertaining to gender and the premature deaths of people with intellectual disabilities would greatly assist the development of evidence-based policy and practice.

Using data from the 2013 Chinese General Social Survey, we find that party membership is associated with better self-rated health, higher health-related quality of life and work, and lower levels of self-rated depression, whereas the effect of education is somewhat more elusive than it usually is in Western societies. Our findings suggest that the effects of socioeconomic indicators are better understood by being contextualized in a sociopolitical environment. It is also fruitful to include both global (education, income, employment status, and subjective SES) and local measures of SES (party membership and housing ownership) in exploring their associations with health in the world's largest transitional society.

J	Evans, O; Manchanda, R				Evans, Olivia; Manchanda, Ranjit			Population-based Genetic Testing for Precision Prevention	CANCER PREVENTION RESEARCH			English	Article							RANDOMIZED NONINFERIORITY TRIAL; BREAST-CANCER; GENOMIC MEDICINE; FOUNDER MUTATIONS; BRCA1; WOMEN; OVARIAN; RISK; RECOMMENDATIONS; METAANALYSIS	Global interest in genetic testing for cancer susceptibility genes (CSG) has surged with falling costs, increasing awareness, and celebrity endorsement. Current access to genetic testing is based on clinical criteria/risk model assessment which uses family history as a surrogate. However, this approach is fraught with inequality, massive underutilization, and misses 50% CSG carriers. This reflects huge missed opportunities for precision prevention. Early CSG identification enables uptake of risk-reducing strategies in unaffected individuals to reduce cancer risk. Population-based genetic testing (PGT) can overcome limitations of clinical criteria/family history-based testing. Jewish population studies show population-based BRCA testing is feasible, acceptable, has high satisfaction, does not harm psychologic well-being/quality of life, and is extremely cost-effective, arguing for changing paradigm to PGT in the Jewish population. Innovative approaches for delivering pretest information/education are needed to facilitate informed decision-making for PGT. Different health systems will need context-specific implementation strategies and management pathways, while maintaining principles of population screening. Data on general population PGT are beginning to emerge, prompting evaluation of wider implementation. Sophisticated risk prediction models incorporating genetic and nongenetic data are being used to stratify populations for ovarian cancer and breast cancer risk and risk-adapted screening/prevention. PGT is potentially cost-effective for panel testing of breast and ovarian CSGs and for risk-adapted breast cancer screening. Further research/implementation studies evaluating the impact, clinical efficacy, psychologic and socio-ethical consequences, and cost-effectiveness of PGT are needed.

We compared the socioeconomic inequalities in oral health among older adults in Japan and England. We used the data for adults aged 65 years or over from Japan (N= 79,707) and England (N= 5115) and estimated absolute inequality (the Slope Index of Inequality, SII) and relative inequality (the Relative Index of Inequality, RII) for edentulism (the condition of having no natural teeth) by educational attainment and income. All analyses were adjusted for sex and age. Overall, 14% of the Japanese subjects and 21% of the English were edentulous. In both Japan and England, lower income and educational attainment were significantly associated with a higher risk of being edentulous. Education-based SII in Japan and England were 9.9% and 26.7%, respectively, and RII were 2.5 and 4.8, respectively. Income-based SII in Japan and England were 9.2% and 14.4%, respectively, and RII were 2.1 and 1.9, respectively. Social inequalities in edentulous individuals exist in both these high-income countries, but Japan, with wider coverage for dental care, had lower levels of inequality than England.

These situations need high doses of social responsibility among the population. In the educational field, different studies express that training future teachers in "Social Responsibility", from ethics and social commitment; provides social justice and welfare in citizens. (2) Methods: This study developed a quantitative methodology; non-experimental and descriptive type. The research sample was university students registered in the Education Sciences degrees of different Spanish universities. The statistical analysis has been carried out with the SPSS software version 25 for Windows. (3) Results: The results express that the competence for social responsibility should be established in the university environment through training (university studies) contributing to the increase in the degree of social responsibility of the university student to face the changes of society (socially committed professional). (4) Conclusion: Social responsibility and university training should be key in the theoretical-practical and professional exercise of future teachers, since the quality and improvement of education will be determined by the real promotion of social responsibility as a basic competence in the curriculum of future teachers.

Cervical cancer is a highly preventable and treatable disease, if detected through screening at an early stage. Governments have a responsibility to screen women for precancerous cervical lesions. Yet, national screening programmes overlook many poor women and those marginalised in society. Under-screened women (called hard-to-reach) experience a higher incidence of cervical cancer and elevated mortality rates compared to regularly-screened women. Such inequalities deprive hard-to-reach women of the full enjoyment of their right to sexual and reproductive health, as laid out in Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and General Comment No. 22. Discussion This article argues first for tailored and innovative national cervical cancer screening programmes (NCSP) grounded in human rights law, to close the disparity between women who are afforded screening and those who are not. Second, acknowledging socioeconomic disparities requires governments to adopt and refine universal cancer control through NCSPs aligned with human rights duties, including to reach all eligible women. Commonly reported- and chronically under-addressed- screening disparities relate to theavailabilityof sufficient health facilities and human resources (example from Kenya), thephysical accessibilityof health services for rural and remote populations (example from Brazil), and theaccessibility of informationsensitive to cultural, ethnic, and linguistic barriers (example from Ecuador). Third, governments can adopt new technologies to overcome individual and structural barriers to cervical cancer screening. National cervical cancer screening programmes should tailor screening methods to under-screened women, bearing in mind that eliminating systemic discrimination may require committing greater resources to traditionally neglected groups. Conclusion Governments have human rights obligations to refocus screening policies and programmes on women who are disproportionately affected by discrimination that impairs their full enjoyment of the right to sexual and reproductive health. National cervical cancer screening programmes that keep the right to health principles (above) central will be able to expand screening among low-income, isolated and other marginalised populations, but also women in general, who, for a variety of reasons, do not visit healthcare providers for regular screenings.

Governmental recognition of the unique health needs of Indigenous populations is necessary for the development of targeted programs and policies to achieve universal health coverage. At the same time, the participation of Indigenous peoples in decision-making and program and policy design helps to ensure that barriers to health services are appropriately addressed and promotes the rights of Indigenous peoples to self-determination.Due to similar patterns of Indigenous health and health determinants across borders, there have been calls for greater global collaboration in this field. However, most international studies on Indigenous health policy link Anglo-settler democracies (Canada, Australia, Aotearoa/New Zealand and the United States), despite these countries representing a small fraction of the world's Indigenous people.AimThis paper examines national-level policy in Australia, Brazil, Chile and New Zealand in relation to governmental recognition of differential Indigenous health needs and engagement with Indigenous peoples in health. The paper aims to examine how Indigenous health needs and engagement are addressed in national policy frameworks within each of the countries in order to contribute to the understanding of how to develop pro-equity policies within national health care systems.MethodsFor each country, a review was undertaken of national policies and legislation to support engagement with, and participation of, Indigenous peoples in the identification of their health needs, development of programs and policies to address these needs and which demonstrate governmental recognition of differential Indigenous health needs. Government websites were searched as well as the following databases: Google, OpenGrey, CAB Direct, PubMed, Web of Science and WorldCat.FindingsEach of the four countries have adopted international agreements regarding the engagement of Indigenous peoples in health. However, there is significant variation in the extent to which the principles laid out in these agreements are reflected in national policy, legislation and practice. Brazil and New Zealand both have established national policies to facilitate engagement. In contrast, national policy to enable engagement is relatively lacking in Australia and Chile. Australia, Brazil and New Zealand each have significant initiatives and policy structures in place to address Indigenous health. However, in Brazil this is not necessarily reflected in practice and although New Zealand has national policies these have been recently reported as insufficient and, in fact, may be contributing to health inequity for Maori. In comparison to the other three countries, Chile has relatively few national initiatives or policies in place to support Indigenous engagement or recognise the distinct health needs of Indigenous communities.ConclusionsThe adoption of international policy frameworks forms an important step in ensuring that Indigenous peoples are able to participate in the formation and implementation of health policy and programs. However, without the relevant principles being reflected in national legislature, international agreements hold little weight. At the same time, while a national legislative framework facilitates the engagement of Indigenous peoples, such policy may not necessarily translate into practice. Developing multi-level approaches that improve cohesion between international policy, national policy and practice in Indigenous engagement in health is therefore vital. Given that each of the four countries demonstrate strengths and weaknesses across this causal chain, cross-country policy examination provides guidance on strengthening these links.

Here we develop a statistical framework that integrates projections from coupled ecosystem and earth-system models to evaluate significance and uncertainty in marine animal biomass changes over the 21(st) century in relation to socioeconomic indicators at national to global scales. Significant biomass changes are projected in 40%-57% of the global ocean, with 68%-84% of these areas exhibiting declining trends under low and high emission scenarios, respectively. Given unabated emissions, maritime nations with poor socioeconomic statuses such as low nutrition, wealth, and ocean health will experience the greatest projected losses. These findings suggest that climate-driven biomass changes will widen existing equity gaps and disproportionally affect populations that contributed least to global CO2 emissions. However, our analysis also suggests that such deleterious outcomes are largely preventable by achieving negative emissions (RCP 2.6). Numerous marine ecosystem models are used to project animal biomass over time but integrating them can be challenging. Here the authors develop a test for statistical significance in multi-model ensemble trends, and thus relate future biomass trends to current patterns of ecological and socioeconomic status.

Strategic management of primary health care centres is necessary for creating an efficient global health care system that delivers good care. Objectives. To perform a systematic literature review of the use of data envelopment analysis in estimating the relative technical efficiency of primary health care centres, and to identify the inputs, outputs and models used. Methods. PubMed, MEDLINE Complete, Embase and Web of Science were searched for papers published before the 25 March 2019. Results. Of a total of 4231 search results, 54 studies met the inclusion criteria. The identified inputs included personnel costs, gross expenditures, referrals and days of hospitalization, as well as prescriptions and investigations. Outputs included consultations or visits, registered patients, procedures, treatments and services, prescriptions and investigations. A variety of data envelopment analysis models used was identified, with no standard approach. Conclusions. Data envelopment analysis extends the scope of tools used to analyse primary care functioning. It can support health economic analyses when assessing primary care efficiency. The main issues are setting outputs and inputs and selecting a model best suited for the range of products and services in the primary health care sector. This article serves as a step forward in the standardization of data envelopment analysis, but further research is needed.

J	Bispo, JP Jr; Morais, MB				Bispo Junior, Jose Patricio; Morais, Marciglei Brito			Community participation in the fight against COVID-19: between utilitarianism and social justice	CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA			English	Article						Community Participation; COVID-19; Health Systems; Health Policy; Social Determinants of Health	HEALTH-CARE; SYSTEM	This essay aims to discuss the foundations and possibilities for community participation in the fight against COVID-19. The first part discusses the meanings of community, defined according to geographic, aggregate-interest, or epidemiological criteria. In the context of the pandemic, none of the three perspectives can be considered alone. The essay discusses the need to link different approaches in order to produce socially contextualized health interventions. Next, the authors present the four main models in the international literature that provide the basis for community participation practices in various countries. The analysis of community participation in the context of COVID-19 uses conceptual systematization based on two meta-narratives: utilitarian and social justice. The utilitarian perspective involves measures to restrict social contact. Participation is thus understood as collaboration in implementing measures that contribute to controlling the problem. The social justice perspective especially addresses the social determinants of health and reduction in social inequalities. The approach focuses on community empowerment and the search for solutions to the social and economic problems that determine the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases. The essay concludes on the peculiarities and importance of each approach. Community participation in the fight against COVID-19 should consider the emergency contexts to strengthen the health system and the defense of the social protection system and democracy.

Medical Cosmopolitanism: The global extension of justice in healthcare practice	DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS			English	Article						Medical Cosmopolitanism; distributive justice; medical ethics; moral obligation; developing world	DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE; BRAIN-DRAIN; AFRICAN; ETHICS	While there is a shortage of healthcare workers in virtually all countries, there currently exists a pronounced inequality in the distribution of healthcare workers, with a high concentration of healthcare workers in high income countries (HIC) and low concentrations in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC). This inequality in the distribution of healthcare workers persists, in spite of the fact that HICs enjoy a much lower disease burden than LMICs This inequality raises medical ethical issues related to what obligations health workers from HICs have to correct these imbalances by working in LMICs. While the biomedical principle of Justice, first formulated by Beauchamp and Childress, advocates for healthcare workers to conduct themselves in a manner that is fair and equitable in light of what is due or owed, it does not elaborate on what sort of obligation this places on healthcare workers from HICs to work in LMICs in a bid fairly distribute the availability of healthcare workers. As such, this paper gives a normative argument for why healthcare workers from HICs have a moral obligation to work in LMICs, a concept we call Medical Cosmopolitanism. Following our positive argument, we debunk prominent objections to the concept of Medical Cosmopolitanism and consider ethical, educational and governmental implications of our findings.

J	Gollier, C				Gollier, Christian			If the Objective is Herd Immunity, on Whom Should it be Built?	ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS			English	Article						VSL; QALY; Covid; Pandemics; Herd immunity; Deconfinement	DECISIONS; HEALTH	Assuming that there is no other solution than herd immunity in front of the current pandemic, on which groups of citizens should we build this herd immunity? Given the fact that young people face a mortality rate which is at least a thousand times smaller than people aged 70 years and more, there is a simple rational to build it on these younger generations. The transfer of some mortality risk from the elderly to younger people raises difficult ethical issues. However, none of the familiar moral or operational guidelines (equality of rights, VSL, QALY, ...) that have been used in the Western world over the last century weights the value of young lives 1000 times or more than the lives of the elders. This suggests that Society could offer covid protection to the elders by recommending them to remain confined as long as this herd immunity has not been attained by the younger generations. This would be a potent demonstration of intergenerational solidarity towards the most vulnerable people in our community. The welfare gain of this age-specific deconfinement strategy is huge, as it can reduce the global death toll by more than 80% as compared to a strategy of non-targeted herd immunity.

METHODS: Comparative analysis of the characteristics of health system reforms conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, still seen in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Data were collected by documental analysis and literature review. The systems were described based on the characteristics of: co-payment, privatization mechanisms, decentralization, fragmentation of the system, integration of funding sources and coverage of the population (universal or segmented). RESULTS: The reforms were implemented differently, worsening inequalities in health service delivery systems. Changes related to the neoliberal idea of transforming public action in the direction of private logic point to the predominance of competition rules and the reduction in economic costs in all countries analyzed, contrary to the logic of universal health systems. CONCLUSION: The reduction in economic costs, the fragmentation of systems and inequalities in the provision of health services, among others, may mean other future costs resulting from low protection to the population's health. A striking and multidimensional counter-reform is essential to make health a right of all again, in a solidarity system that can lead to the reduction in inequalities and a more democratic society.

The prioritisation of high value cancer interventions must be embedded in the agenda for the pandemic response, ensuring that no inconsistency or discrepancy emerge in the health planning processes. The aim of this work is to organise health interventions for breast cancer management and research in a tiered framework (high, medium, low value), formulating a scheme of prioritisation per clinical cogency and intrinsic value or magnitude of benefit. The public health tools and schemes for priority setting in oncology have been used as models, aspiring to capture clinical urgency, value in healthcare, community goals and fairness, while respecting the principles of benevolence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice. We discuss the priority health interventions across the cancer continuum, giving a perspective on the role and meaning to maintain some services (undeferrable) while temporarily abrogate some others (deferrable). Considerations for implementation and the essential link to pre-existing health services, especially primary healthcare, are addressed, outlining a framework for the development of effective and functional services, such as telemedicine. The discussion covers the theme of health systems strategising, and why oncology care, in particular breast cancer care, should be maintained in parallel to pandemic control measures, providing a pragmatic clinical model within the broader context of public healthcare schemes.

J	van Deursen, AJAM				van Deursen, Alexander J. A. M.			Digital Inequality During a Pandemic: Quantitative Study of Differences in COVID-19-Related Internet Uses and Outcomes Among the General Population	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						COVID-19; digital inequality; internet use; survey; personality; literacy; internet skills; information; communication	DIVIDE SHIFTS; LITERACY; SKILLS; INFORMATION; SUPPORT; GENDER	Background: The World Health Organization considers coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to be a public emergency threatening global health. During the crisis, the public's need for web-based information and communication is a subject of focus. Digital inequality research has shown that internet access is not evenly distributed among the general population. Objective: The aim of this study was to provide a timely understanding of how different people use the internet to meet their information and communication needs and the outcomes they gain from their internet use in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also sought to reveal the extent to which gender, age, personality, health, literacy, education, economic and social resources, internet attitude, material access, internet access, and internet skills remain important factors in obtaining internet outcomes after people engage in the corresponding uses. Methods: We used a web-based survey to draw upon a sample collected in the Netherlands. We obtained a dataset with 1733 respondents older than 18 years. Results: Men are more likely to engage in COVID-19-related communication uses. Age is positively related to COVID-19-related information uses and negatively related to information and communication outcomes. Agreeableness is negatively related to both outcomes and to information uses. Neuroticism is positively related to both uses and to communication outcomes. Conscientiousness is not related to any of the uses or outcomes. Introversion is negatively related to communication outcomes. Finally, openness relates positively to all information uses and to both outcomes. Physical health has negative relationships with both outcomes. Health perception contributes positively to information uses and both outcomes. Traditional literacy has a positive relationship with information uses and both outcomes. Education has a positive relationship with information and communication uses. Economic and social resources played no roles. Internet attitude is positively related to information uses and outcomes but negatively related to communication uses and outcomes. Material access and internet access contributed to all uses and outcomes. Finally, several of the indicators and outcomes became insignificant after accounting for engagement in internet uses. Conclusions: Digital inequality is a major concern among national and international scholars and policy makers. This contribution aimed to provide a broader understanding in the case of a major health pandemic by using the ongoing COVID-19 crisis as a context for empirical work. Several groups of people were identified as vulnerable, such as older people, less educated people, and people with physical health problems, low literacy levels, or low levels of internet skills. Generally, people who are already relatively advantaged are more likely to use the information and communication opportunities provided by the internet to their benefit in a health pandemic, while less advantaged individuals are less likely to benefit. Therefore, the COVID-19 crisis is also enforcing existing inequalities.	[van Deursen, Alexander J. A.

Antenatal care (ANC) is an inextricable part of healthy pregnancy and could prevent the adverse birth outcomes. Almost 97% of Iranian expectant women are receiving adequate ANC (4 or more visits). However, the situation for pregnant Afghan women is unclear. Some studies indicated low access to ANC among Afghan women. In the present study, we aimed to explore the sociodemographic factors and potential barriers associated with adequate ANC among Afghan women in Iran. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted between June 2019 and August 2019. Using time location sampling (TLS), we recruited 424 Afghan women aged 18-45 years old at three health centers in south region of Tehran. The data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics and the reported reasons for inadequate ANC using a questionnaire and analyzed applying bivariate, and multivariate analyses. Factor analysis was performed to reduce the number of potential reasons for inadequate ANC in order to improve the precision of regression analysis. Results Almost a third of Afghan women in this study had adequate ANC (>= 8 visits). The women in older age group, those with higher education and family income, women with longer length of stay, those of legal status were more likely to have adequate ANC. In multivariate analysis, the poor knowledge and attitude toward ANC (AOR = 0.06; 95% CI [0.03-0.15]), the poor quality of services (AOR = 0.17 95% CI [0.07-0.41]); and to some extent, the difficulties in access (AOR = 0.33; 95% CI [0.11-1.00]) were the main obstacles toward adequate ANC among the study population. Conclusion Our study emphasized the important role of the personal knowledge and attitude toward ANC with adequate antenatal care among Afghan women in Iran. This could be addressed by well-oriented interventions and health education for Afghan women. The collaboration between central government with international agencies should be directed toward enhancing the social support, promoting the awareness and knowledge, and expanding the safety net services to improve the access and quality care among Afghan women in Iran.

Cruz			Building a Narrative of Equity: Weaving Indigenous Approaches into Community-Engaged Research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						community engagement; evaluation; capacity building; resilience; campus community partnerships	PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; CBPR	In 2020, global injustice has taken center stage during the uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement and other social movements. Activists are calling attention to longstanding disparities in health outcomes and an urgent need for justice. Given the global socio-political moment, how can health researchers draw on current critical theory and social movements to create structures for equitable outcomes in health research and practice? Here, we demonstrate principles for effective health research and social justice work that builds on community-engaged approaches by weaving critical Indigenous approaches into structural project designs. Our project, "Health Resilience among American Indians in Arizona", brought new and seasoned researchers together to collect and analyze data on the knowledge of healthcare providers concerning American Indian health and well-being. Four years after the conclusion of the project, the team developed and created a post-project self-assessment to investigate lasting impacts of project participation. In this communication, we discuss the principles of defining and measuring the capacity to build together. This work responds to the call from Indigenous scholars and community leaders to build an internal narrative of change. While we will not present the full instrument, we will discuss building a strong foundation using the principles of engagement for planning and implementing justice and change.

Yet, environmental justice (EJ), and social justice more broadly, are not currently embedded within the language and spirit of the SDGs. We part from the premise that "many 'environmental' problems are, by their very nature, problems of justice" (Lele, Wiley Interdiscip Rev Water 4:e1224, 2017). We review progress in EJ frameworks in recent years, arguing for the need to move beyond a focus on the four principles of mainstream EJ (distribution, procedure, recognition, and capabilities) towards a more intersectional decolonial approach to environmental justice that recognises the indispensability of both humans and non-humans. EJ frameworks, and the SDGs should recognise power dynamics, complex interactions among injustices, and listens to the different 'senses of justice' and desires of theorists, activists, and other stakeholder from the Global South. We analyze how EJ frameworks are, or fail to be, incorporated in the SDGs with a focus on the food-water-health nexus (SDG2, 3, 6); climate-energy (SDG7, 13), conservation (SDG14, 15); and poverty and inequality (SDG1, 10). We call attention to the 'elephant in the room'-the failure to go beyond GDP but instead include economic growth as a goal (SDG8). We argue that sustainable degrowth and intersectional decolonial environmental justices would create better conditions for the transformative changes needed to reach the broader aim of the SDGs: to leave no one behind.

J	Majid, Z; Welch, C; Davies, J; Jackson, T				Majid, Zeinab; Welch, Carly; Davies, Justine; Jackson, Thomas			Global frailty: The role of ethnicity, migration and socioeconomic factors	MATURITAS			English	Article						Frailty; Global ageing; Migration; Ethnicity	OLDER MEXICAN-AMERICAN; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; MORTALITY; PEOPLE; CARE; TRAJECTORIES; INEQUALITIES; ADULTS; INDEX	Frailty is an important consequence of ageing, whereby frail patients are more likely to face adverse outcomes, such as disability and death. Risk of frailty increases in people with poor biological health, and has been shown in many ethnicities and countries. In economically developed countries, 10% of older adults are living with frailty. Ethnic minorities in the West face significant health inequalities. However, little is known about frailty prevalence and the nature of frailty in different ethnic groups. This has implications for healthcare planning and delivery, especially screening and the development of interventions. Global frailty prevalence is variable: low- to middle-income countries demonstrate higher rates of frailty than high-income countries, but available evidence is low. Little is known about the characteristics of these differences. However, female sex, lower economic status, lower education levels, and multimorbidity are identified risk factors. Ethnic minority migrants in economically developed countries demonstrate higher rates of frailty than white indigenous older people and are more likely to be frail when younger. Similar patterns are also seen in indigenous ethnic minority marginalised groups in economically developed countries such as the US, Australia and New Zealand, who have a higher prevalence of frailty than the majority white population. Frailty trajectories between ethnic minority migrants and white indigenous groups in high-income countries converge in the 'oldest old' age group, with little or no difference in prevalence. Frailty risk can be attenuated in migrants with improvements in integration, citizenship status, and access to healthcare. Ethnicity may play some role in frailty pathways, but, so far, the evidence suggests frailty is a manifestation of lifetime environmental exposure to adversity and risk accumulation.

Methods Data were derived from the CZEch Mental health Study (CZEMS), a cross-sectional study of community-dwelling individuals. Mental disorders were assessed with Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), and information on completed education was acquired as a part of a paper and pencil interview. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of educational attainment with all mental disorders as well as with specific groups (affective, anxiety, alcohol use and substance use disorders), stepwise adjusting for socio-demographic, social and health-related characteristics. Results We studied 3175 individuals (average age 50 years, range 18-96 years; 54% women). Compared to individuals with higher education, those educated below high school graduation had higher odds of mental disorders (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.58-1.71), even after adjustment for all covariates (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.21-2.23). Education showed the strongest association with alcohol use disorders, even when covariates were adjusted for, but was not related to anxiety disorders. The association of education with affective as well as substance use disorders was explained by covariates. Conclusions Interventions aimed at reducing the burden of mental disorders should target individuals with low education. Strategies to improve population mental health need to go hand in hand with policies to enhance education as well as reduce alcohol consumption in the Czech Republic.

Health leaders from industry, academia and global health organizations reviewed efforts to accelerate innovation, improve access to vaccines, overcome inequalities and strengthen technological and public-health management capabilities. Discussion topics included World Health Organization's immunization strategy, Pan American Health Organization's system-strengthening efforts, Gavi's evaluation of vaccine coverage in middle income countries and developments on public-market intelligence. Health market trends, delivery gaps, integration of system-wide needs, costs and benefits, and implications for stakeholder decision-making were areas of focus. Novel thinking was discussed on integration of policy, financing, regulatory pathways and alignment of innovation priorities to improve efficiency in vaccine development pathways. The Vaccine Innovation Prioritization Strategy collaboration presented nine global innovation priorities, and many other partners and members presented updates on their priorities. Novel technologies and platforms, such as RNA-based vaccines, adenoviral vectors, bioconjugation, blow-fill-seal and two-dimensional barcodes, provided opportunities to accelerate vaccine innovations. Challenges in planning and operations at global level included those in health security, polio eradication, re-emergence of diseases, disparities between forecasts and orders and heterogeneous regulatory requirements. Manufacturers were urged to accelerate innovation and prequalification of high-impact vaccines, such as pneumococcal, human papillomavirus and rotavirus vaccines, to strengthen immunization globally.

J	Ismail, SJ; Hardy, K; Tunis, MC; Young, K; Sicard, N; Quach, C				Ismail, Shainoor J.; Hardy, Kendra; Tunis, Matthew C.; Young, Kelsey; Sicard, Nadine; Quach, Caroline			A framework for the systematic consideration of ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability in vaccine program recommendations	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine Program; Ethics; Equity; Feasibility; Acceptability; Framework	ZOSTER SUBUNIT VACCINE; HERPES-ZOSTER; OLDER-ADULTS; IMMUNOGENICITY; EFFICACY; SAFETY; LABEL	For the successful implementation of population-level recommendations, it is critical to consider the full spectrum of public health science, including clinical and programmatic factors. Current frameworks may identify various factors that should be examined when making evidence-informed vaccine-related recommendations. However, while most immunization guidelines systematically assess clinical factors, such as efficacy and safety of vaccines, there is no published framework outlining how to systematically assess programmatic factors, such as the ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability of recommendations. We have addressed this gap with the development of the EEFA (Ethics, Equity Feasibility, Acceptability) Framework, supported by evidence-informed tools, including Ethics Integrated Filters, Equity Matrix, Feasibility Matrix, and an Acceptability Matrix. The Framework and tools are based on five years of environmental scans, systematic reviews and surveys, and refined by expert and stakeholder consultations and feedback. For each programmatic factor, the EEFA Framework summarizes the minimum threshold for consideration and when further in-depth analysis may be required, which aspects of the factor should be considered, how to assess the factor using the supporting evidence-informed tools, and who should be consulted to complete the assessment. Research, particularly in the fields of vaccine acceptability and equity, has validated the utility and comprehensiveness of the tools. The Framework has been successfully used in Canada for clear, timely, transparent vaccine guidance with positive stakeholder feedback on its comprehensiveness, relevance and appropriateness. Applying the EEFA Framework allows for the systematic consideration of the spectrum of public health science without a delay in recommendations, complementing existing decision-making frameworks. This Framework will therefore be useful for advisory groups worldwide to integrate critical factors that could impact the successful and timely implementation of comprehensive, transparent recommendations, and will further the global objective of developing practical and evidence-informed immunization policies.

We argue that the growing remuneration of volunteers reflects an increasing financialisation of volunteering by aid and development donors to match labour to project and sectoral objectives. We examine how these remuneration strategies shape volunteering economies and (re)produce hierarchies and inequalities in contexts in the global South where volunteers are often from marginalised communities. We analyse data collected in Africa and the Middle East as part of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Global Review on Volunteering to explore these interweaving volunteering hierarchies and how they articulate with existing social stratifications. In these contexts, we argue that a livelihoods and capabilities approach across macro-, national and local levels provides an alternative and more nuanced way of accounting for volunteer remuneration within the range of assets that communities have to build their lives and future. When oriented towards catalysing these community assets, and away from rewarding particular kinds of individual labour, remuneration has the potential to enable rather than undermine sustained volunteering activity by and within marginalised communities.

The sub-Saharan Africa region continues to have the highest levels of maternal mortality and HIV, primarily affecting the most vulnerable populations. Recognising the critical role of policy in understanding health population, we conducted a systematic review of original primary research which examined the relationships between equity-focused legislation and policy and the utilisation of SRH services by vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa. We searched nine bibliographic databases for relevant articles published between 1994 and 2019. Thirty-two studies, conducted in 14 sub-Saharan African countries, met the inclusion criteria. They focused on maternal health service utilisation, either through specific fee reduction/removal policies, or through healthcare reforms and insurance schemes to increase SRH service utilisation. Findings across most of the studies showed that health-related legislation and policy promoted an increase in service utilisation, over time, especially for antenatal care, skilled birth attendance and facility-based delivery. However, social health inequalities persisted among subgroups of women. Neither the reviewed studies nor the policies specifically addressed youth, people living with HIV and people with disabilities. In the era of the sustainable development goals, addressing health inequities in the context of social determinants of health becomes unavoidable. Systematic and rigorous quantitative and qualitative research, including longitudinal policy evaluation, is required to understand the complex relationships between policy addressing upstream social determinants of health and health service utilisation.

Bibliometric analysis of scientific publications on "sustainable development goals" with emphasis on "good health and well-being" goal (2015-2019)	GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH			English	Article						Sustainable development goals; Bibliometric analysis; Scopus	RESEARCH COLLABORATION; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; MORTALITY; COVID-19; IMPACT; TRENDS	Background Global progress in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires significant national and international research efforts and collaboration. The current study aimed to provide policymakers, academics, and researchers with a snapshot of global SDGs-related research activity. Method This was a cross-sectional descriptive bibliometric study. SciVerse Scopus was used to retrieve SDGs-related research publications for the period from 2015 to 2019. Results In total, 18,696 documents were found. TheSustainabilityjournal ranked first (n = 1008; 5.4%) in the number of SDGs-related publications. The World Health Organization was the most active institution in publishing SDGs-related documents (n = 581; 1.3%). Most of the retrieved documents belonged to SDG 17 (partnership) followed by SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), while SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) had the least number of publications. The European region (n = 9756; 52.2%) had the highest research contribution while the Eastern Mediterranean region (n = 1052; 5.6%) had the least contribution. After exclusion of SDG 17, the SDG 3 (good health and well-being) was the top researched SDG for the African region, the Eastern Mediterranean regions, and the South-Eastern Asian region. For the region of the Americas, European region, and the Western Pacific region, the SDG 13 (climate action) was the most researched. The SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) was the least researched in the African region, the region of the Americas, the European region, and the South-East Asian region. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, SDG 10 (reduced inequality) was the least researched while in the Western Pacific region, SDG 5 (gender inequality) was the least researched. The most researched targets of SDG 3 were targets 7 (sexual and reproductive health services) and 8 (universal health coverage) while the least researched targets were 5 (substance use disorders) and 9 (death from hazardous materials). International research collaboration within SDG 3 between high- and low-income countries was inadequate. Conclusion The analysis presented in the current study are useful for researchers, institutes, governments, funding agencies, and policy-makers. Countries in Africa, the Middle East, and South-East Asia need to increase their funding and research collaboration in the field of SDGs.

Association of Gender and Race With Allocation of Advanced Heart Failure Therapies	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							LUNG TRANSPLANTATION GUIDELINES; INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; CARE; SEX; OUTCOMES; RECEIVE	This qualitative study examines how patient race and gender are associated with clinician recommendations for allocation of advanced heart failure therapies. Importance Racial bias is associated with the allocation of advanced heart failure therapies, heart transplants, and ventricular assist devices. It is unknown whether gender and racial biases are associated with the allocation of advanced therapies among women. Objective To determine whether the intersection of patient gender and race is associated with the decision-making of clinicians during the allocation of advanced heart failure therapies. Design, Setting, and Participants In this qualitative study, 46 US clinicians attending a conference for an international heart transplant organization in April 2019 were interviewed on the allocation of advanced heart failure therapies. Participants were randomized to examine clinical vignettes that varied 1:1 by patient race (African American to white) and 20:3 by gender (women to men) to purposefully target vignettes of women patients to compare with a prior study of vignettes of men patients. Participants were interviewed about their decision-making process using the think-aloud technique and provided supplemental surveys. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory methodology, and surveys were analyzed with Wilcoxon tests. Exposure Randomization to clinical vignettes. Main Outcomes and Measures Thematic differences in allocation of advanced therapies by patient race and gender. Results Among 46 participants (24 [52%] women, 20 [43%] racial minority), participants were randomized to the vignette of a white woman (20 participants [43%]), an African American woman (20 participants [43%]), a white man (3 participants [7%]), and an African American man (3 participants [7%]). Allocation differences centered on 5 themes. First, clinicians critiqued the appearance of the women more harshly than the men as part of their overall impressions. Second, the African American man was perceived as experiencing more severe illness than individuals from other racial and gender groups. Third, there was more concern regarding appropriateness of prior care of the African American woman compared with the white woman. Fourth, there were greater concerns about adequacy of social support for the women than for the men. Children were perceived as liabilities for women, particularly the African American woman. Family dynamics and finances were perceived to be greater concerns for the African American woman than for individuals in the other vignettes; spouses were deemed inadequate support for women. Last, participants recommended ventricular assist devices over transplantation for all racial and gender groups. Surveys revealed no statistically significant differences in allocation recommendations for African American and white women patients. Conclusions and Relevance This national study of health care professionals randomized to clinical vignettes that varied only by gender and race found evidence of gender and race bias in the decision-making process for offering advanced therapies for heart failure, particularly for African American women patients, who were judged more harshly by appearance and adequacy of social support. There was no associated between patient gender and race and final recommendations for allocation of advanced therapies. However, it is possible that bias may contribute to delayed allocation and ultimately inequity in the allocation of advanced therapies in a clinical setting. Question Is bias against a patient's gender and race associated with the allocation of advanced heart failure therapies? Findings In a qualitative study of 46 health care professionals, there was more bias against women compared with men when evaluating appearance and social support, particularly among African American women. Final recommendations were not different for groups defined by gender or race; all were offered ventricular assist devices rather than transplantation during interviews. Meaning Although gender and race were not associated with allocation of advanced heart failure therapies in this study, there was evidence of bias, which could contribute to delayed and lower allocation of advanced therapies to women.

In line with global trends, Bangladesh is also integrating technology into its health system to address disparities. Strong political endorsement and uptake of digital platforms by the government has influenced the rapid proliferation of such initiatives in the country. This paper aims to examine the implications of digital health on access to health care in Bangladesh, considering who uses electronic devices to access health information and services and why. Objective: This study aims to understand how access to health care and related information through electronic means (digital health) is affected by sociodemographic determinants (ie, age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, and personal and household ownership of mobile phones) in a semiurban community in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 854 households (between October 2013 and February 2014) and 20 focus group discussions (between February 2017 and March 2017) were conducted to understand (1) who owns electronic devices; (2) who, among the owners, uses these to access health information and services and why; (3) the awareness of electronic sources of health information; and (4) the role of intermediaries (family members or peers who helped to look for health information using electronic devices). Results: A total of 90.3% (771/854) of households (471/854, 55.2% of respondents) owned electronic devices, mostly mobile phones. Among these, 7.2% (34/471) used them to access health information or services. Middle-aged (35-54 years), female, less (or not) educated, and poorer people used these devices the least (a=.05, a is the level of significance). The lack of awareness, discomfort, differences with regular care-seeking habits, lack of understanding and skills, and proximity to a health facility were the main reasons for not using devices to access digital health. Conclusions: Although influenced by sociodemographic traits, access to digital health is not merely related to device ownership and technical skill. Rather, it is a combination of general health literacy, phone ownership, material resources, and technical skill as well as social recognition of health needs and inequity. This study's findings should serve as a basis for better integrating technology within the health system and ensuring equitable access to health care.

However, at the time of writing, access to vaccines that prevent life-threatening infectious diseases remains unequal to all infants, children and adults in the world. This is a problem that many individuals and agencies are working hard to address globally. As clinicians and biomedical scientists we often focus on the health benefits that vaccines provide, in the prevention of ill-health and death from infectious pathogens. Here we discuss the health, economic and social benefits of vaccines that have been identified and studied in recent years, impacting all regions and all age groups. After learning of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in December 2019, and its potential for global dissemination to cause COVID-19 disease was realized, there was an urgent need to develop vaccines at an unprecedented rate and scale. As we appreciate and quantify the health, economic and social benefits of vaccines and immunization programs to individuals and society, we should endeavor to communicate this to the public and policy makers, for the benefit of endemic, epidemic, and pandemic diseases.

To achieve equitable delivery, national immunization programs can use 2 main delivery platforms: routine immunization and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). The objective of this article is to use data concerning measles vaccination coverage delivered via routine and SIA strategies to make inferences about the associated equity impact. Methods: We relied on Demographic and Health Survey and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys multi-country survey data to conduct a comparative analysis of routine and SIA measles vaccination status of children by wealth quintile. We estimated the value of the angle, q, for the ratio of the difference between coverage levels of adjacent wealth quintiles by using the arctangent formula. For each country/year observation, we averaged the q estimates into one summary measurement, defined as the "equity impact number." Results: Across 20 countries, the equity impact number summarized across wealth quintiles was greater (and hence less equitable) for routine delivery than for SIAs in the survey rounds (years) during, before, and after an SIA about 65% of the time. The equity impact numbers for routine measles vaccination averaged across wealth quintiles were usually greater than for SIA measles vaccination across country-year observations. Conclusions: This analysis examined how different measles vaccine delivery platforms can affect equity. It can serve to elucidate the impact of immunization and public health programs in terms of comparing horizontal to vertical delivery efforts and in reducing health inequalities in global and country-level decision-making.

Redefining VAWG as legally unacceptable is one strategy for social change. The co-occurrence of national laws against VAWG is understudied, and tools to monitor the national legal environment are lacking. We developed the Laws on Violence against Women and Girls Index (LoVI) to measure global progress to develop comprehensive national legislation against child marriage, sexual harassment, domestic violence, and marital rape. Methods Using data from 2016 and 2018 for 189 countries from the World Bank Women, Business, and the Law database, we used factor analysis to assess the dimensionality of the LoVI. We examined the distribution of the LoVI across countries and regions, and the relationship of national rankings on the LoVI with those for other indicators from the United Nations, Demographic and Health Surveys, and World Factbook. Results A single LoVI factor showed good model fit in the factor analysis. National LoVI rankings were positively associated with gender equality in human development and economic rights-related rankings and negatively associated with rates of justifying wife beating and of lifetime and prior-year physical and/or sexual IPV. The LoVI was not associated with national indicators for human development and income inequality. Conclusion The LoVI is a concise, coherent, validated index to monitor the progress of nations on adopting comprehensive legislation to advance 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 5, to eliminate VAWG.

Although mass drug administration is a cost-effective approach to reduce occurrence, extent, and severity of the disease, it does not provide protection to subsequent reinfection. Interventions that target the parasites' intermediate snail hosts are a crucial part of the integrated strategy required to move toward disease elimination. The recent revolution in gene drive technology naturally leads to questions about whether gene drives could be used to efficiently spread schistosome resistance traits in a population of snails and whether gene drives have the potential to contribute to reduced disease transmission in the long run. Responsible implementation of gene drives will require solutions to complex challenges spanning multiple disciplines, from biology to policy. This Review Article presents collected perspectives from practitioners of global health, genome engineering, epidemiology, and snail/schistosome biology and outlines strategies for responsible gene drive technology development, impact measurements of gene drives for schistosomiasis control, and gene drive governance. Success in this arena is a function of many factors, including gene-editing specificity and efficiency, the level of resistance conferred by the gene drive, how fast gene drives may spread in a metapopulation over a complex landscape, ecological sustainability, social equity, and, ultimately, the reduction of infection prevalence in humans. With combined efforts from across the broad global health community, gene drives for schistosomiasis control could fortify our defenses against this devastating disease in the future.

Methods The study data were extracted from the adult component of Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN (PERSIAN) from 17 centers in 14 different provinces of Iran. DMFT score was used as a measure of dental caries among adults in Iran. The concentration curve and relative concentration index (RC) was used to quantify and decompose socioeconomic-related inequalities in DMFT. Results A total of 128,813 adults aged 35 and older were included in the study. The mean (Standard Deviation [SD]) score of D, M, F and DMFT of the adults was 3.3 (4.6), 12.6 (10.5), 2.1 (3.4) and 18.0 (9.5), respectively. The findings suggested that DMFT was mainly concentrated among the socioeconomically disadvantaged adults (RC = - 0.064; 95% confidence interval [CI), - 0.066 to - 0.063). Socioeconomic status, being male, older age and being a widow or divorced were identified as the main factors contributing to the concentration of DMFT among the worse-off adults. Conclusions It is recommended to focus on the dental caries status of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in order to reduce socioeconomic-related inequality in oral health among Iranian adults. Reducing socioeconomic-related inequalities in dental caries should be accompanied by appropriate health promotion policies that focus actions on the fundamental socioeconomic causes of dental disease.

At the same time, the collapse of the boundaries between these domains imposed by the pandemic created unique opportunities for intersectoral planning and collaboration. While the challenge of integration is not unique to oncology, the organisation of cancer care and its linkages to palliative care and to global health may allow it to be a demonstration model for how the problem of integration can be addressed. Before the pandemic, the large majority of individuals with cancer in need of palliative care in low- and middle-income countries and the poor or marginalised in high-income countries were denied access. This inequity was highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as individuals in impoverished or population-dense settings with weak health systems have been more likely to become infected and to have less access to medical care and to palliative and end-of-life care. Such inequities deserve attention by government, financial institutions and decision makers in health care. However, there has been no framework in most countries for integrated decision-making that takes into account the requirements of public health, clinical medicine and palliative and end-of-life care.

Timing of paediatric orchidopexy in universal healthcare systems: international administrative data cohort study	BJS OPEN			English	Article							UNDESCENDED TESTIS; PREPUBERTAL ORCHIOPEXY; LOWER RISK; CRYPTORCHIDISM; AGE; SURGERY; FERTILITY; ENGLAND; GROWTH; IMPACT	Background International guidelines in 2008 recommended orchidopexy for undescended testis at 6-12 months of age to reduce the risk of testicular cancer and infertility. Using administrative data from England, Finland, Ontario (Canada), Scotland and Sweden (with data from Victoria (Australia) and Iceland in supplementary analyses), the aim of this study was to investigate compliance with these guidelines and identify potential socioeconomic inequities in the timing of surgery before 1 and 3 years. Methods All boys born in 2003-2011 with a diagnosis code of undescended testis and procedure codes indicating orchidopexy before their fifth birthday were identified from administrative health records. Trends in the proportion of orchidopexies performed before 1 and 3 years of age were investigated, as were socioeconomic inequities in adherence to the guidelines. Results Across all jurisdictions, the proportion of orchidopexies occurring before the first birthday increased over the study period. By 2011, from 76 per cent (Sweden) to 279 per cent (Scotland) of boys had undergone orchidopexy by their first birthday and 715 per cent (Sweden) to 904 per cent (Scotland) by 3 years of age. There was limited evidence of socioeconomic inequities for orchidopexy before the introduction of guidelines (2008). Across all jurisdictions for boys born after 2008, there was consistent evidence of inequities in orchidopexy by the first birthday, favouring higher socioeconomic position. Absolute differences in these proportions between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups ranged from 25 to 59 per cent across jurisdictions. Conclusion Consistent lack of adherence to the guidelines across jurisdictions questions whether the guidelines are appropriate.	[Jay, M.

Identified facilitating factors were: (1) the historical role and high status of Swedish midwives; (2) Swedish research and development of medical abortion that enabled an enlarged clinical role for midwives; (3) collaborations between individual clinicians and researchers within the professional associations, and the autonomy of clinical units to implement changes in clinical practice; (4) a historic precedent of changes in abortion policy occurring without prior official or legal sanction; (5) a context of liberal abortion laws, secularity, gender equality, public support for abortion, trust in public institutions; and (6) an increasing global interest in task-shifting to increase access and reduce costs. Identified barriers/risks were: (1) the lack of systems for monitoring and evaluation; and (2) a loss of physician competence in abortion care.

Basic rights can be re-defined with advancements in science and technology. In such an evolutional loop, where mutual supply is obvious, combined legal and technological frameworks should be exercised and developed for practicing human rights. The main aim of this article is to propose a conceptual and methodological framework for the improvement of disability rights in the light of recent advancements in geographic information science (GIScience), in particular for those with motor disabilities, for whom questions related to "where" are essential. The concept of disability is discussed, considering different aspects, and a new methodological framework is proposed in which Geographic Information Systems (GIS), volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen science are at the core. In order to implement the framework at the national and international levels, a spatial data model should be developed first. The new data collection and interpretation approaches based on VGI, citizen science, and machine learning methods may help to realize equal rights for people with motor disabilities, by enabling improved access to education, health, and travel.

We take a more holistic approach, making five broad comparisons between the crises with five associated lessons for climate change mitigation policy. First, delay is costly. Second, policy design must overcome biases to human judgment. Third, inequality can be exacerbated without timely action. Fourth, global problems require multiple forms of international cooperation. Fifth, transparency of normative positions is needed to navigate value judgments at the science-policy interface. Learning from policy challenges during the COVID-19 crisis could enhance efforts to reduce GHG emissions and prepare humanity for future crises.

However, many of the deep and complex systemic interrelationships created and developed by this pandemic are largely hidden, unknown, or neglected, both by the hegemonic media and by a highly specialized and fragmented academic world. However, when all the available knowledge is critically integrated, the origins and effects underlying this pandemic are likely to be found in the development of neoliberal capitalism and its inherent logic of ceaseless accumulation, economic growth, large inequalities, and ecological devastation. This commentary reflects on these issues, drawing out some of the most important lessons to be learned and challenges to be faced in the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, advocating for a radical social change to deal with these challenges.

This lack of access to and the quality of healthcare, affordable housing, and lack of financial resources also continue to have a more significant impact on documented and undocumented immigrants. This paper aims at examining these critical issues and developing a framework for family therapists to address these challenges by focusing on four interrelated dimensions: cultural values, social determinants of health, collective trauma, and the ethical and moral responsibility of family therapists. Given the fact that family therapists may unwittingly function as the best ally of an economic and political system that perpetuates institutionalized racism and class discrimination, we need to utilize a set of principles, values, and practices that are not just palliative or after the fact but bring forth into the psychotherapeutic and policy work a politics of care. Therefore, a strong call to promote and advocate for the broader continuum of health and critical thinking preparing professionals to meet the challenges of health equity, as well as economic and environmental justice, is needed. The issues discussed in this paper are specific to the United States despite their relevance to family therapy as a field. We are mindful not to generalize the United States' reality to the rest of the world, recognizing that issues discussed in this paper could potentially contribute to international discourse.

To better inform health policies suited for the needs of international immigrants living in China, empirical evidence on the health service utilization of these international immigrants living in China is urgently needed. Our study included 5459 international immigrants including inpatients and outpatients, who were treated over a 4-year period (2015-2018) in one of the most frequented hospitals by international immigrants in Yiwu, Zhejiang province. Data (e.g., demographic information, outpatient costs, inpatient costs, length of stay, and the average number of visits per patient) were extracted from the Health Information System at the hospital. Descriptive analysis was performed to analyze the basic characteristics of international immigrants living in China (e.g., medical costs, length of stay and the average number of visits per patient) during the study period. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the factors that influence the health service utilization of international immigrants. International immigrants tended to use outpatient services (accounting for 97.22% of the whole sample) compared with inpatient services (only 2.78% of the whole sample). Most international immigrants visited the hospital because of orthopedics, otolaryngological diseases, pediatric-related diseases and skin-related diseases, followed by maternity and general surgery. The average number of visits to the outpatient department per patient was 2.1 in 2015 to 2.5 in 2018, and the length of stay increased from 3.45 days to 5.81 days during last four years. The outpatient costs increased from RMB 800.43(112.22 US$) to RMB 1756.98(246.33 US$), and inpatient costs rose from RMB 10,958.89(1536.44US$) to RMB 20,912.55(2931.94US$) during 2015-2018. The average number of visits and outpatient costs of international immigrants were both lower than those of local Chinese people (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistic difference in inpatient costs and LOS between international immigrants and Chinese. Having health insurance in China was significantly related with higher medical costs. Our results indicate that international immigrants living in China make greater use of outpatient services rather than hospitalization health services. Health services utilization is increasing in the last four years, but it was lower than that of local Chinese people especially outpatient service utilization. Moreover, more attention should be garnered toward specific health issues experienced by international immigrants, such as orthopedic health, maternal and child health, occupational diseases or accidents, and infectious diseases with skin-related symptoms. The policy implications from the results of this study are as follows. First, in order to improve international immigrants' health and access to health services in China, the government needs to pay more attention to incorporating international immigrants' health services to the current health system. Second, health policy is an important determining factor of access to health care, as policy can influence aspects of health services delivery such as the availability of resources, organization, and financing. Therefore, specific framework for the content of health policies focused on international immigrant populations should be developed.

Both regions did not achieve the MDG target of reducing under-five mortality rates by two thirds by 2015. The underlying causes of under-five mortality differ significantly between countries and between regions, which highlights the need to expand our understanding of the determinants of child health in developing countries. By comparing the two geographic regions of the world with the highest under-five mortality rates, we aim to identify differences between the determinants of under-five mortality in these regions. We analyse a large sample of DHS data sets consisting of 35 sub-Saharan African countries and 13 Asian countries from 1992 to 2016. Using a discrete-time survival model that takes advantage of a recently developed multilevel framework in a Bayesian setting, allowing for important non-linear effects and cluster specific heterogeneity. We find strong non-linear effects for the baseline hazard, the household size, the year of birth, and the mother's BMI. We find considerable differences in determinants between Asian and sub-Saharan African countries. This highlights the necessity to expand our current knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, and helps to formulate policy advices.

Implementation of self-care interventions within the context of human rights, gender equality, and a life course approach, offers an underused opportunity to improve universal health coverage (UHC) for all. Results from an online global values and preferences survey provided lay persons' and healthcare providers' perspectives on access, acceptability, and implementation considerations. This analysis examines 326 qualitative responses to open-ended questions from healthcare providers (n = 242) and lay persons (n = 70) from 77 countries. Participants were mostly women (66.9%) and were from the Africa (34.5%), America (32.5%), South-East Asia (5.6%), European (19.8%), Eastern Mediterranean (4.8%), and Western Pacific regions (2.8%). Participants perceived multiple benefits of self-care interventions for SRHR, including: reduced exposure to stigma, discrimination and access barriers, increased confidentiality, empowerment, self-confidence, and informed decision-making. Concerns include insufficient knowledge, affordability, and possible side-effects. Implementation considerations highlighted the innovative approaches to linkages with health services. Introduction of self-care interventions is a paradigm shift in health care delivery bridging people and communities through primary health care to reach UHC. Self-care interventions can be leveraged by countries as gateways for reaching more people with quality, accessible and equitable services that is critical for achieving UHC. The survey results underscored the urgent need to reduce stigma and discrimination, increase access to and improve knowledge of self-care interventions for SRHR for laypersons and healthcare providers to advance SRHR.

This was the central question that guided this critical review of more than 200 publications between 2010 and 2019. The findings are the following. The Essential Package of Healthcare Services (EPHS) across many countries excludes several critical SRH services (e.g. safe abortion services, reproductive cancers) that are already poorly available. Inadequate international and domestic public funding of SRH services contributes to a sustained burden of out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) and inequities in access to SRH services. Policy and legal barriers, restrictive gender norms and gender-based inequalities challenge the delivery and access to quality SRH services. The evidence is mixed as to whether an expanded role and scope of the private sector improves availability and access to services of underserved populations. As momentum gathers towards SRH and UHC, the following actions are necessary and urgent. Advocacy for greater priority for SRH in government EPHS and health budgets aligned with SRH and UHC goals is needed. Implementation of stable and sustained financing mechanisms that would reduce the proportion of SRH-financing from OOPE is a priority. Evidence, moving from descriptive towards explanatory studies which provide insights into the "hows" and "whys" of processes and pathways are essential for guiding policy and programme actions.

It is important that comparative studies use representative population samples. This study compares a total administrative population of adults with intellectual disability to a random stratified general population sample. Methods An administrative population of 217 adults with intellectual disability and a random stratified sample of 2,350 adults without intellectual disability participated. A questionnaire using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) Chapter Headings was administered to all participants to enable a like-for-like comparison. Findings Unadjusted comparisons identified that adults with intellectual disability have a greater prevalence of health problems. These problems start early in adulthood and continue throughout life. However, they were less likely to experience cancers and musculoskeletal diseases. Conclusions These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adults with intellectual disabilities have greater prevalence rates of health problems than the general population.

Social workers must be prepared to respond. Using a non-probability, convenience sample, this study surveyed 159 social workers in Alaska to assess their attitudes and their perceptions of the effects of climate change on their clients and constituents. Results indicate that social workers in Alaska believe that climate change is happening, that human activities are responsible, and that it is a large threat to people in Alaska. Over 75% believe that climate change is dangerous for their clients now or will be dangerous in 10 years. Social workers report that in the past year their clients or constituents have experienced multiple climate change-related problems with community infrastructure, health, and mental health.

Food, economic, and health systems are strained by this global rural-urban transformation. Climate change exacerbates agricultural shifts and biodiversity loss. The fields of social entrepreneurship and social innovation address these systemic inequities by re-envisioning challenges as opportunities for positive change. Innovative finance models (e.g. blended-financing, public-private partnerships) emerge in support of such initiatives. Despite this transformative potential, social innovators face significant challenges when mobilizing resources, and when moving beyond niche endeavors to scale impacts that facilitate systemic change. This article engages in a sensemaking exercise: we review literature on social entrepreneurship and innovative finance, and report outcomes from a participatory symposium in China with a variety of ecosystem stakeholders. The results presented in this paper help clarify the space and offer next steps for theorists, social entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations, development agencies, policymakers and investors.

In Burundi, there is little information about CS coverage inequality and the change in provision of this service over time. Using a high-quality equity analysis approach, we aimed to document both magnitude and change of inequality in CS coverage in Burundi over 7 years to investigate disparities.MethodsFor this study, data were extracted from the 2010 and 2016 Burundi Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHS) and analyzed through the recently updated Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) of the World Health Organization. CS delivery was disaggregated by four equity stratifiers, namely education, wealth, residence and sub-national region. For each equity stratifier, relative and absolute summary measures were calculated. We built a 95% uncertainty interval around the point estimate to determine statistical significance.Main findingsDisparity in CS was present in both survey years and increased over time. The disparity systematically favored wealthy women (SII=10.53, 95% UI; 8.97, 12.10), women who were more educated (PAR=8.89, 95% UI; 8.51, 9.26), women living in urban areas (D=12.32, 95% UI; 9.00, 15.63) and some regions such as Bujumbura (PAR=11.27, 95% UI; 10.52, 12.02).ConclusionsBurundi had not recorded any progress in ensuring equity regarding CS coverage between 2010 and 2016. It is important to launch interventions that promote justified use of CS among all subpopulations and discourage overuse among high income, more educated women and urban dwellers.

In this article we propose an equity-relevant health metric, Health Adjusted Age at Death (HAAD), that facilitates comparison of lifetime health for individuals at the onset of different medical conditions, and allows for the assessment of which patient groups are worse off. A method for estimating HAAD is presented, and we use this method to rank four conditions in six countries according to several criteria of "worse off" as a proof of concept. Methods For individuals with specific conditions HAAD consists of two components: past health (before disease onset) and future expected health (after disease onset). Four conditions (acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), schizophrenia, and epilepsy) are analysed in six countries (Ethiopia, Haiti, China, Mexico, United States and Japan). Data from 2017 for all countries and for all diseases were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study database. In order to assess who are the worse off, we focus on four measures: the proportion of affected individuals who are expected to have HAAD<20 (T20), the 25(th)and 75(th)percentiles of HAAD for affected individuals (Q1 and Q3, respectively), and the average HAAD (aHAAD) across all affected individuals. Results Even in settings where aHAAD is similar for two conditions, other measures may vary. One example is AML (aHAAD = 59.3, T20 = 2.0%, Q3-Q1 = 14.8) and ALL (58.4, T20 = 4.6%, Q3-Q1 = 21.8) in the US. Many illnesses, such as epilepsy, are associated with more lifetime health in high-income settings (Q1 in Japan = 59.2) than in low-income settings (Q1 in Ethiopia = 26.3). Conclusion Using HAAD we may estimate the distribution of lifetime health of all individuals in a population, and this distribution can be incorporated as an equity consideration in setting priorities for health interventions.

J	Cailhol, J; Lebon, MC; Sherlaw, W				Cailhol, Johann; Lebon, Marie-Christine; Sherlaw, William			Will my patients get their residence permit? A critical analysis of the ethical dilemmas involved in writing medical certificates for residence permits in France	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						France; Ill-migrants; Physicians; Ethical dilemma; Temporary residence permit	DESIRED MORAL ATTITUDE; HEALTH; OBLIGATIONS	Background France has long been a country of immigration and in some respects may be seen to have a generous policy with respect to asylum seekers and access to health care for migrants. The French state notably provides healthcare access for undocumented migrants, through state medical aid and since 1998 has had a humanitarian policy for granting temporary residence permits for medical reason (TRPMR) to migrants. Within a context of political debate, reform and tightening immigration control we will examine this latter policy focusing especially on the dilemmas that arise for physicians of migrant patients when they are requested to write medical certificates as part of a TRPMR application. In a 2017 reform the key role of making recommendations on the granting or not of permits was handed over to Ministry of the Interior health inspectors. Recommendations are made after perusal of medical certificates established by the migrant's physician and complementary evidence. Main body The writing of medical certificates by a physician would seem straightforward. This is far from the case since it raises a number of ethical dilemmas. These occur within a physician-patient relationship embedded within a social contract between the State, the physician and the migrant patient. To clarify the ethical issues arising 3 vignettes based on practice within an infectious disease unit at a large Paris hospital have been developed. The vignettes highlight ethical dilemmas in the care for migrants with tuberculosis (dilemma in defining health and disease), chronic hepatitis (dilemma between beneficence and do not harm), and HIV / AIDS (issue of deservingness). We will go on to reflect on issues of social justice and responsibility for the health of migrants within a globalized world. Conclusions Criteria for residence permit delivery appear less than clear-cut and are interpreted in a restrictive way. Neither are the consequences of refusing a residence permit taken into account. We call for an empirical transnational ethics study involving countries implementing similar TRPMR policies. We also call for inclusion of lobbying competences into the medical undergraduate curricula, in order to breed future generations of physicians skilled in defending social justice.

J	Fan, ZZ; Zou, W				Fan, Zengzeng; Zou, Wei			Private Transfer Payments, Inequality, and Poverty: From the Perspective of Households	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						private transfer; income inequality; consumption expenditure; poverty	INTERNATIONAL REMITTANCES; MIGRATION	Private transfer of wealth is a ubiquitous phenomenon in both urban and rural areas of China. This paper took an inflow private transfer payment as the research object and used the China Household Finance Survey data to analyze the impact of inward private transfer payment (IPTP) on social welfare and family welfare. According to the result of logit regression, we found the following: there is an age at which households are least likely to receive private transfer payments; families with living partners (including married and cohabiting couples) are more likely to receive private transfer payments; the worse the health of householders, the more likely they are to receive private transfer payments; rural households are more likely to have IPTPs than urban households. From the perspective of social welfare, the IPTP has seemingly decreased social inequality, especially in the case of rural areas. However, the counterfactual analysis finds that IPTP increases inequality. Analysis from three aspects of income, consumption, and family poverty level finds that IPTP not only subsidizes the family income directly but also promotes increases in family income indirectly. It also stimulates family consumption expenditure, with an increment of approximately 5000 yuan. Although it increased household income, as well as consumption expenditure, IPTP did not have a significant impact on the poverty level of Chinese households. On the whole, the existence of IPTP does not improve social welfare but improves family welfare. At the same time, IPTP has no significant effect on the reduction of family poverty.

Although community action has proven to be effective and has become a priority area of the global strategy to reduce alcohol consumption, there is a gap in the knowledge of community interventions to reduce alcohol use among adults. This study aims to analyze the evidence on effective community-based interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and harm among adults and to identify their components and underlying theories. Search strategy involved five databases (January 2000-March 2020). We included multicomponent, evaluated, and community interventions addressing to adults in urban settings of high-income countries. Furthermore, two conceptual frameworks were adapted to identify the social determinants of alcohol related harms and modifiable factors through community interventions. The initial search yielded 164 articles. The final sample included eight primary studies. Six of them were effective and shared three components (community mobilization; law enforcement and media campaigns), they combined approaches at individual and environmental levels addressing structural determinants of health and some cultural aspects related to consumption. Health outcomes focused mainly on reducing consumption, modifying patterns and acute effects on health. Few studies addressed social problems arising from harmful consumption. This review has identified several effective community-based interventions to reduce harmful use of alcohol among adults as well as some mechanisms and theories supporting them. It also provides a framework to guide new designs, with potential evidence of factors, as well as possible combinations of methods to improve health at community level across different settings and contexts.

From Robots to Humans: Newspaper Coverage of Mars in the United States and the United Kingdom 2011-2016	JOURNALISM STUDIES			English	Article						Framing; Mars; print newspapers; tone; United Kingdom; United States		The global news media have documented space science and missions since the space race began in the 1950s. Only recently has that coverage turned toward Mars exploration and colonization as more governments and private enterprises join the race to the Red Planet. This study compares the framing of Mars coverage from 2011 through 2016 in three influential newspapers in the United States, where NASA and many private companies lead the charge, with three newspapers in the United Kingdom, an allied yet competitive country with less of a vested interest in reaching Mars. A content analysis found that many frames from past space missions were adapted for the Red Planet, such as exploration, scientific knowledge, business, nationalism, settlement, legacy, and fear, while new frames emerged, including life, human health, social justice, and social engagement. The framing and tone of Mars articles were similar in both countries despite their different positions in the Mars race. From the launch of Sputnik to potential human exploration of Mars, each successive era of space exploration has been framed in a logical progression from concept to completion that resonates with the values of the times.
